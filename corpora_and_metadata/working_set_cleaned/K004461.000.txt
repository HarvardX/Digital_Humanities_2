the influence of the pastoral office on the character examined with a view especially to mr humes representation of the spirit of that office  a sermon preached before the synod of aberdeen at

particular instances especially when our experience of these instances has not been uniform great caution is necessary on every subject to preserve us from mistakes but a peculiar degree of caution is necessary in forming general maxims concerning characters because the circumstances on which characters depend are both more complicated and more uncertain in their operation than the causes of natural effects on this account observations must be made on a very great number of individuals before we can judge with accuracy concerning the character of the nation or the profession to which these individuals belong and even after we have made the most extensive observations we ought still to remember that the maxim which we form far from being an universal truth will necessarily be liable to numberless exceptions  it is however undeniable that there are few subjects on which men judge either more rashly or more dogmatically than on the characters both of nations and of particular professions they impute the faults which they have observed in a few individuals to a whole nation or order they often also embrace the groundless prejudice so closely that when they afterward discover many other individuals who appear to be free from the blemish which they had expected to find in them they suppose them to be tainted with it notwithstanding and take it for granted that it would become obvious in proper circumstances  in no instance has this shameful prejudice been indulged more freely than in forming a disadvantageous idea of the clergy in general on account of the vices of some who have been members of that society and because ministers are the public teachers of christianity the vices imputed to them in a body without evidence have been considered as throwing a reflection on the truth or the efficacy of the religion which it is their business to publish the charge has been commonly enforced by loose and popular declamation fit to make an impression on the imagination of the thoughtless and by consequence to gain their passions to the party but absolutely insufficient to convince the impartial and inquisitive if there be any difficulty in confuting the accusations that are commonly brought against our order and against the gospel on our account it arises not from the strength of the arguments by which they are supported but from the total want of argument  the most natural and direct method of proving that the clergy deserve the disagreeable character which is sometimes ascribed to them would doubtless be to examine the temper and conduct of the several individuals and to show from an intimate knowledge of them that the majority are really guilty of the vices imputed to the order a candid enquirer would likewise choose before he pronounced sentence concerning their character on the whole to compare them with the individuals of other professions and to see what proportion the virtues and the vices of the clergy bear to those of the laity it will scarce be pretended that this species of proof has been attempted by those who are so liberal in their declamations against the vices of the ministers of the gospel  but though they could produce this proof in it is greatest strength it would still be difficult to show that the faults of ministers can be justly charged on the christian religion to the rules of which it is manifest these faults are absolutely contrary the moral tendency of the doctrines of the gospel and the purity and sublimity of its precepts ought always to preserve it free from blame on account of the vices of any who profess to believe it before these vices be imputed to the gospel it should certainly be shown that there is some doctrine or precept or example recommended in scripture which gives countenance to them  but though the method of proof which we have mentioned be the most natural and direct upon a subject of this kind it must be acknowledged that another species of reasoning may be likewise used all arguments concerning matter of fact are ultimately founded on experience but it is not necessary to have recourse in every argument to experience of instances precisely similar to that which we infer it is often sufficient that the present argument be supported by some general maxims which are clearly deducible from experience we may conclude that a man who is entrusted with absolute power will probably abuse it not only from instances of tyrants who have abused it but also from the more general observation of examples which occur of corruption and insolence in private life in like manner could it be fairly proved that there are circumstances essential to the ministerial office which according to our general observation of human nature have a direct and primary tendency to produce certain vices in those who exercise that office and should it be inferred from this that these vices will be characteristical of the order and that the religion which institutes the office is the occasion of them we could not justly refuse to admit the inference this method of proof has been attempted by a late author in an essay on national characters the character which he draws is this  it is a trite but not altogether a false maxim that priests of all religions are the same and though the character of the profession will not in every instance prevail over the personal character yet it is sure always to predominate with the greater number for as chemists observe that spirits when raised to a certain height are all the same from whatever materials they he extracted so these men being elevated above humanity acquire a uniform character which is entirely their own and which in my opinion is generally speaking not the most amiable that is to be met with in human society it is in most points opposite to that of a soldier as is the way of life from which it is derived  though all mankind have a strong propensity to religion at certain times and in certain dispositions yet are there few or none who have it to that degree and with that constancy which is requisite to support the character of this profession it must therefore happen that clergymen being drawn from the common mass of mankind as people are to other employments by the views of profit the greatest part though no atheists or freethinkers will find it necessary on particular occasions to feign more devotion than they are at that time possessed of and to maintain the appearance of fervor and seriousness even when jaded with the exercises of their religion or when they have their minds engaged in the common occupations of life they must not like the rest of the world give scope to their natural movements and sentiments they must set a guard over their looks and words and actions and in order o support the veneration paid them by the ignorant vulgar they must not only keep a remarkable reserve but must promote the spirit of superstition by a continued grimace and hypocrisy this dissimulation often destroys the candor and ingenuity of their tempers and makes an  in their characters  if by chance any of them be possessed of a temper more susceptible of devotion than usual so that he has but little occasion for hypocrisy to supprt the character or his profesion it is so natural for him to overrate this advntage and to think it atones for every violation of morality that frequently he is not more virtuous than the hypocrite and though few dare openly avow these exploded opinions that every thing is lawful to the saints an that they alone have a property in their goods yet may we observe that these princples link in every bosom and represent a zeal for religious observances as so great a merit that it may compensate for many vices and enormities this observation is so common that all prudent men are on their guard when they meet with any extraordinary appearance of religion though at the same tme they confess that there are many exceptions to this general rule and that probity and superstition are far from being incompatible  most men are ambitious but the ambition of other men may commonly be satisfied by excelling in their particular profession and thereby promoting the in erests of society the ambition of the clergy can often be satisfied only by promoting ignorance and superstition and implicit faith and pious frauds and having got what archimedes only wanted viz another world on which he could fix his engines no wonder they move this world at their pleasure  most men have an overweening conceit of themselves but those have a peculiar temptation to that vice who are regarded with such veneration and are even deemed sacred by the ignorant multitude  most men are apt to bear a particular regard for the members of their own profession but as a lawyer or physician or merchant does each of them follow out his business apart the interests of these professions are not so closely united as the interests of clergymen of the same religion where the whole body gains by the veneration paid to their common tenets and by the suppression of antagonists  few men can bear contradiction with patience but the clergy too often proceed even to a degree of fury on this article because all their credit and livelihood depend upon the belief which their opinions meet with and they alone pretend to a divine and supernatural authority or have any color for representing their antagonists as impious and profane the odium theologicum or theological hatred is noted even to a proverb and means that degree of rancour which is the most furious and implacable  thus many of the vices of human nature are by sixth moral causes inflamed in that profession and though several individuals escape the contagion yet all wise governments will be on their guard against the attempts of a society who will for ever combine into one faction and while it acts as a society will for ever be actuated by ambition pride and a persecuting spirit  the temper of religion is grave and serious and this is the character required of priests which confines them to strict rules of decency and commonly prevents irregularity and intemperance amongst them the gaiety much less the excesses of pleasure is not permitted in that body and this virtue is perhaps the only one they owe to their profession in religions indeed founded on speculative principles and where public discourses make a part of religious service it may also be supposed that the clergy will have a considerable share in the learning of the times though it is certain that their taste in eloquence will always be better than their skill in reasoning and philosophy but whoever possesses the other noble virtues of humanity meekness and moderation as very many of them no doubt do is beholden for them to nature or reflection not to the genius of his calling humes essays moral and political essay     this is a representation chiefly of the moral character of the clergy and to that the following discourse is wholly confined but as an insinuation is likewise made to the disadvantage of their intellectual character it will be proper to remark that this insinuation is both of little weight and in a great measure without foundation  it is of little weight for taste is more general among all men than skill in philosophy a greater number can judge of beauty than of truth many are moved by the eloquence of a discourse who cannot examine the justness of the reasoning we meet much oftener with a degree of imagination and sensibility of temper sufficient to form a good speaker than with the penetration which is necessary for investigating the causes of things and inventing just theories it can be no reflection on the clergy that taste is more universal than philosophical genius in their profession as well as in all other professions their taste will naturally be better in eloquence than in other arts because their office leads them to apply especially to that  in every sense in which it can be considered as a reflection on our order the insinuation is entirely groundless were mankind persuaded that we are unacquainted with the rules of just reasoning and only qualified for popular declamation on principles taken for granted without enquiry this might perhaps incline them to listen to those who tell them that the truths of religion which we teach are mere fables destitute of evidence though we he not possessed of a degree of reason sufficient for detecting the fallacious arguments produced in support of them it might prepare them for expecting wonderful discoveries in the writings of infidels and prejudice them against our vindications of religion i will not say that this author made the insinuation with a design to promote this end because he has not informed us what is his design but i will say this end can be really promoted by nothing less than a proof that the clergy are weak reasoners in comparison with the rest of mankind and i will venture to affirm that neither the nature of their employment nor experience of their real character gives reason for representing them in this light their profession turns their attention to eloquence but does not divert it from just reasoning their public functions lead them to employ all their powers of persuasion in inculcating truth and goodness on their hearers their studies lead them also to examine most questions of importance to enquire into the abstrusest truths and to detect the most subtle errors corruptions of religion interwoven with the tenets of a false philosophy have sometimes retarded the improvement of science but it is the business of ministers to teach only pure religion it is a perversion of their office to support corruptions of religion and the effects of this perversion cannot justly be imputed to the genuine spirit of the office in fact the clergy have never been remarkably defective in the knowledge of philosophy there have been periods in which the philosophy of the times was almost wholly confined to them when the scholastic philosophy prevailed aniversally they discovered as great subtlety as men of other professions as great a proportion of the clergy as of any other class have excelled in the knowledge both of nature and of the human mind it is natural for freethinkers to reckon the reasonings of the clergy concerning religion weak and inconclusive because they are contradictory to their own but we are not afraid to desire the world to compare the writings of men of our order with those of the most admired infidels in respect either of the truth of the principles from which they argue or of the strength and closeness of the arguments   declining the direct proof of the vices commonly imputed to the clergy from immediate experience he has drawn a character for them though he admits of very many exceptions in individuals which is by no means amiable a character which includes many of the blackest vices in human nature and he has endeavored to prove that this character naturally results from the very genius of the ministerial calling  that candor which the gospel recommends and which ought always to prevail in the heart of a minister of the gospel forbids me to attempt detracting from the real merit or abilities of this author he is possessed of a very considerable share of genius and penetration this will gain him attention from the inquisitive and will render his reasonings on every subject more specious than those of many others and on that account more dangerous when at any time he happens to mistake is is not then worth while my reverend fathers and brethren to enquire whether his charge be just will it be unsuitable to the present occasion to examine fairly and impartially what is the natural influence of the ministerial office upon the characters of those who exercise it  the ungainly portrait that has been drawn for the ministers of the gospel suggested this investigation to my thoughts when i found myself obliged by the authority of my superiors to appear in this place on the present occasion i willingly chose this subject it affords me an opportunity of considering the ministerial character and office in a point of view in which they have not been frequently regarded it frees me from the necessity of even seeming to give directions to those from whom it becomes me rather to receive instruction for the very nature of the design confines me to enquiry at the same time it will appear that the enquiry is far from being merely speculative or unimproving and that it has on the contrary the most intimate connection with practice i enter on it with a sincere desire to vindicate our sacred function from reproach and will conduct it with an eye especially to that author to whom i have referred already priests of the temper which he describes would unite in the bitterest invectives against an antagonist who has attacked the whole body of the clergy in a manner so unreserved but that is not the temper of the ministers of jesus christ i know well that my reverend hearers would not excuse me if i made the least approach to rancour or unbecoming warmth against him if i opposed him in any other spirit than the spirit of meekness gal vi   or if i considered my subject in any other manner than with that impartiality which will be observed by those who seek only to discover truth  the apostle paul says in my text a bishop must be blameless as the steward of god it will be evident that these words lead naturally to the proposed enquiry if we attend to the manner in which they are introduced especially if we consider at the same time the import of the words themselves in the original the apostle reminds titus ver   that he had left him in crete for this purpose that he might ordain elders or presbyters in every city men blameless free not only from gross and scandalous wickedness but from every species of vice for the word here used has a respect to the judgment of god and not merely to the sentiments of men see   cor i    col i    in my text he shows that when he required presbyters to be blameless he enjoined only what the very nature of their office demands a presbyter i by his office a bishop that is an overseer and according to the language of the new testament as appears from the only place where the term is used in such a way that its meaning can be precisely determined acts xx  s an overseer of all the flock of the church of god on this account he must be blameless steady and universal virtue as far as it can be attained by human nature is a qualification absolutely necessary for the exercise of his office to render the necessity of this character still more evident the apostle adds as the steward of god he represents the christian church as the family of god and informs us that ministers are appointed to dispense to the several members of it that spiritual food by which they may be nourished to eternal life as he elsewhere characterizes them more explicitly they are stewards of the mysteries of god   cor iv   teachers not of their own opinions but of the doctrines of the christian revelation the import of the text is therefore plainly this the most exalted and blameless virtue is requisite from the very nature of their office in those whose business it is to teach religion and to oversee the morals of the people does not this assertion of the apostle imply that the ministerial office has a tendency upon the whole to form a good and virtuous character could his maxim be true if that very office had an unalterable tendency to inflame many of the basest vices of human nature and to produce a character which every good man must regard with indignation may not we then with sufficient propriety take occasion from this text to enquire what is that temper which our employment as ministers of the gospel tends to cultivate in our souls  in prosecuting this subject i will first enquire how far a tendency in the ministerial office to form a character in some respects disagreeable or even a character exposed to the danger of becoming vicious could reasonably affect either the credit of that office or the excellence of the christian religion in which the office is founded  secondly i will enquire whether that character which the ministerial office tends to form be virtuous or vicious on the whole  thirdly i will enquire how far this office has really a tendency to produce or to inflame those particular vices which some have represented as characteristical of our order  i first i will enquire how far a tendency in the ministerial office to form a character in some respects disagreeable or a character exposed to the danger of becoming vicious could reasonably affect either the credit of that office or the excellence of the christian religion  it is not unusual to draw from an argument a conclusion totally different from that which it really proves and by means of the ambiguity of words or the confusion of mens ideas the fallacy often escapes detection and it is taken for granted that a proposition is proved for which in fact there has not been a single argument proposed attempts have been sometimes made to show that the occupation of ministers tends to pre ent their acquiring that artificial polish which adds gracefulness to the behavior of the higher ranks of mankind and when plausible evidence for this trivial charge has been produced men have triumphed as if they had demonstrated a very different proposition that the character of our profession is positively disagreeable contemptible or ridiculous in like manner when men have produced such arguments as seem to make it probable that the turn of character and manners which is promoted by the genius of the ministerial office will be unfit to engage the liking of the generality or will be disagreeable in some situations they have taken it for granted that these arguments prove with equal force that this turn of character and manners is likewise positively vicious and unfit to gain the inward esteem or the moral approbation of men  a moderate degree of understanding might preserve a person from being deceived by sophisms so palpable but persons of good understanding are often not so ready to exert a very small degree of reflection as to receive every thing without examination which can gratify their own pride or afford them mirth by representing others as proper objects of contempt or ridicule for this reason these arguments or others equally inconclusive have in fact occasioned a great part of the contempt which has been poured out upon the clergy it will not therefore be unnecessary to remark though the remark be extremely obvious that a character not only may be agreeable when many agreeable qualities are wanting in it because the mere absence of them gives no positive disgust but also may be really disagreeable or unfit to engage a general liking and yet be so far from vicious that it shall on the contrary command the moral approbation and force the good opinion and even the veneration of mankind  as characters and actions may be considered in various lights they may gratify a spectator by sentiments totally distinct and different these sentiments are very apt to be confounded because they are all agreeable but every man who desires to think with accuracy must be at pains to preserve them separate a liking to a character is very different from the approbation or esteem of it the former sentiment is excited chiefly by the more trivial accomplishments of the man the latter only by such as are important the qualities which most effectually engage the liking of the generality are of too low an order to be regarded as being even akin to the moral virtues nay there are some vices which because they diffuse a certain ease and gaiety and sprightliness over the temper and behavior are very apt to obtain the liking even of those in whom a moment of reflection produces abhorrence of their baseness but it is only solid virtue rooted deep in the temper and exerted regularly in the conduct that can either gain or preserve the real inward approbation and esteem of mankind it likewise deserves to be remarked that a mans own turn of character has great influence in determining the objects of his liking who will be those chiefly whose manners resemble his own and therefore this sentiment will be variable and precarious approbation is more permanent and universal and less dependent on the peculiarities of temper it is often bestowed unwillingly by men on those to whom their own consciences tell them to their anguish that themselves bear no similitude  suppose now my fathers and brethren that some person should assert in writing or in conversation that our office deprives us of opportunities for acquiring that exterior polish of manners which is very acceptable to the generality and indeed graceful in itself this is really the whole amount of some of those superficial reflection which are often thrown out against us the author whom we have principally in our eye does not expressly urge this insignificant accusation yet he seems to insinuate not only that we are obnoxious to it but also that it does detract from the credit of our office for he mentions good breeding and openness of behavior as one of the amiable qualities which enter into the character of a soldier and are naturally derived from his way of life and he tells us that the character of a clergyman as well as his way of life is in most points opposite to that of a soldier  need we be much concerned to enquire whether the charge be true or false if we should acknowledge it do you think that either the importance of our office or the excellence of our religion would suffer by the acknowlegement nay might not the ministerial character be nevertheless agreeable and fit to procure even the liking of the generality for might not it contain those amiable inward qualities of which external politeness is only either the expression or the mimickry and from which openness and ease of behavior deriveth all its merit  suppose again that it should be asserted that the character which naturally results from our office is very generally disagreeable must we take it for granted immediately that this character is vicious may not we reasonably ask before we admit this conclusion to whom and in what particular manner it is disagreeable it is asserted by others and it is not dissembled by ourselves that our office tends to form us to a grave and serious temper that it discourages the gaiety of pleasure and unthinking levity of behavior that it confines us to strict rules of decency that it leads us to set a guard over our looks and words and actions and restrains us from giving scope to our natural movements and sentiments whenever they are either sinful or unbecoming  i do not know but there are some particular seasons at which the generality would dislike a man of this character and shun his company but it would be only when they were disposed to exceed the limits of right and innocence and could it inferred from his being disagreeable to them in this situation that his character is vicious or even that they who dislike him do not really approve and esteem him notwithstanding i doubt not but a person of the character which we have described will be in all situations disagreeable to many he bears no resemblance in his manners to the gay the dissipated and the voluptuous and his presence would lay them under an uneasy restraint they will always dislike him but is it certain that even they will always disapprove him or if they should would it be of mighty consequence for could he be more agreeable to them without becoming less virtuous admit then that our office naturally produces a turn of character which is disagreeable in some respects will either the credit of that office or the excellence of our religion suffer by this charge if we be able to vindicate our calling from a tendency to form a temper that is really vicious or morally evil  farther brethren is it absolutely certain that every sort of tendency in the ministerial function to produce some real vices in those who exercise it will necessarily detract from its credit or be inconsistent with the perfect purity of the gospel an assertion or insinuation of this nature is plausible indeed yet it may be proved that it ought not to be admitted but under several limitations  were it the direct and primary tendency of our profession to form a vicious character or to inflame some heinous vices this would certainly reflect dishonor on it this would render ours an unlawful calling because we could not exercise it without doing what is wrong were there for instance any essential part of our office which we could not execute without imposing cunningly devised fables   pet      on the credulity of mankind or fostering a spirit of superstition among them or offering violence to their consciences our employment would be so far absolutely immoral this would also reflect dishonor on our religion for that religion could not be true or holy or divine which it were impossible to teach without committing sin let it be clearly proved that something unlawful must necessarily be practiced in teaching the doctrines or inculcating the duties of genuine uncorrupted christianity  by this indeed but by nothing less than this our office and our religion will be exposed to censure  if any person should discover that though our office tend primarily to form and improve a virtuous character it has a remote and secondary tendency to produce vicious dispositions in those who resist its original impulse we may give him liberty to avail himself of the discovery as much as he can with reason the amount of the discovery is only this that the best things may be abused that what is naturally calculated for the worthiest purpose may be perverted and after it is perverted rendered subservient to an unworthy and contrary end this is indeed an universal truth reason is a noble faculty implanted in our nature on purpose to enable us to distinguish truth from falsehood but a superior degree of reason has been often employed to disguise plain truths and to render errors plausible natural affection is an amiable instinct designed to prompt the parent to provide for the helpless infant and to submit to all the fatigues which may be necessary for instilling knowledge and virtue into the opening mind yet it frequently degenerates into a vicious fondness which occasions the death or prevents the education of the child the primary end of ingenuous shame and regard to reputation plainly is the prevention of infamous vices but does not this very principle often lead men to commit one act of wickedness in order to conceal another which they have already perpetrated in secret in a word nothing can have so strong a tendency to promote a good end but it may be perverted to serve a bad or even a contrary purpose are we then to judge of things by their primary and essential tendency or by that accidental direction which they acquire when they have been abused by the former certainly if it is not sufficient that the primary tendency of a thing be good if it is necessary likewise that it be incapable of perversion or abuse there will be nothing good or wise in art or nature there will be no situation or employment in the world safe or lawful for there is none from which men may not take occasion to fall into vicious conduct and is it fair or reasonable to insist that more is requisite for the vindication of the pastoral office than of any thing besides are those vices to be charged on the office which spring only from the abuse of it are they not rather to be imputed solely to the fault of individuals  when therefore any person asserts that there are circumstances in the pastoral office which tend to inflame any particular vice it is incumbent on him to distinguish carefully between the primary and the accidental tendency of these circumstances if the tendency be but accidental to urge it to the disadvantage of the office is either inadvertently or artfully to confound things totally distinct and thus to render a falsehood plausible or to give a harmless truth an unfavourable aspect it is like hurting a mans reputation by an insinuation which will very probably be misunderstood and which could do no hurt except it were misunderstood  it has been said that there are certain vices of which ministers are often guilty and into which they are led by their profession suppose it were alleged as an instance of this that when ministers are conscious of their wanting some virtue which the decorum of their character requires they are apt to affect the outward appearance of that virtue such ministers are no doubt guilty of hypocrisy it may be affirmed too in some sense that their profession is the occasion of this hypocrisy because their being conscious that their profession requires the virtue which they affect is their motive in making false pretenses to it but is it not plain that in this case the spirit of the office leads them naturally not to affect the virtue but really to cultivate it it can be said to lead to hypocrisy only by accident by being perverted from its original and proper aim and its being thus perverted far from implying that it has an immoral tendency sets the strength of its tendency to virtue in the clearest light for it shows that the ministerial office prompts men so powerfully to the culture of virtue that even they who resist its impulse and over whom it has the least power must palliate their want of real virtue to themselves and others by an hypocritical show of goodness  there are some vices which bear a general resemblance to certain virtues superstition for instance mimics piety rancour calls itself zeal moroseness would pass for a serious temper men of all professions often indulge the vice while they flatter themselves that they are cultivating the virtue for which it is mistaken we impute it to their weakness and pity their want of true moral discernment suppose that a clergyman should in like manner substitute some specious vice in the place of a particular virtue which eminently suits the genius of his profession ought we to impute this vice to the profession must not we on the contrary impute it wholly to the infirmity of the individual and to the general deceitfulness of sin if this can account for similar instances among other ranks of men with what color of reason can we urge the vice as a proof of an immoral tendency in the ministerial calling  there are certain ends naturally desirable to mankind in whatever station they be placed every station furnishes a man with lawful means of promoting these ends but in every station a man has it likewise in his power to pursue them by unlawful means  besides those ends which we may innocently aim at there are others which it is wrong to pursue but which the corrupt affections of mankind will often lead them to pursue and different wrong ends will be most likely to attract different classes of men  in the present degenerate state of mankind many will pursue unlawful ends or seek to promote such ends as are lawful in themselves by unjustifiable means they have the vicious bent which occasions this independent of their particular profession but it determines the form which the vice assumes it is in this way that every station and profession has it peculiar temptations and exposes those who occupy it to peculiar dangers  now suppose that the station in which ministers are placed has in like manner its peculiar temptations that ministers may find in their employment unlawful means of attaining a lawful end or that they may render their sacred functions subservient to a wrong end is this any more than happens in other professions if this can expose the ministry to censure must it not equally expose every other occupation can it then be fairly urged to the disadvantage of this one office in comparison with others if this tendency to vice be but secondary and accidental in other callings must it not be esteemed such also in our vocation if in other employments the fault be chargeable only on the individuals who are guilty pray why should not individual clergymen likewise be alone answerable for yielding to the temptations which arise from their peculiar business  the office of a clergyman is founded in the gospel but can the gospel be blamed because this office has its peculiar temptations before you determine that it can stop for a moment and observe the consequences other stations are appointed in the course of ordinary providence and their peculiar temptations would reflect the same dishonor upon it if the common temptations of life be not sufficient to overturn the belief of a god and a providence those which are peculiar to the pastoral office cannot affect the truth or the excellence of the gospel let none therefore throw blame on the christian ministry on account of its supplying some temptations to vice or on the gospel because it has established an office which is liable to abuse but those who have already embraced atheism and denied the constitution of the world to be wise and good  mankind are at present by the universal appointment of god in a state of trial and exercise there is no circumstance in life but gives us opportunities of acting either virtuously or viciously it is only by putting it in our power to act viciously if we choose that any situation can exercise or improve our virtuous affections exercise is afforded to our temper not only by the general circumstances of life common to all men but likewise by the peculiar circumstances of particular professions there are peculiar circumstances in the ministerial office as well as in every other which may give exercise to our virtues and improve them but may likewise as is indeed a necessary consequence prove occasions of vice to assert this is only to say that ministers of the gospel are in a state of probation and discipline in the same sense as other men that their employment as well as other employments contains circumstances fit to draw out virtuous principles and to give them exercise and this surely can derogate nothing from the excellence of their office  but suppose that the vices of a wicked minister rise higher in particular instances and become more atrocious than those of others this is so far from necessarily implying an immoral tendency in his office that on the contrary it may really proceed from the strength of its virtuous tendency for the greater the advantage which this office affords for virtuous practice the greater will be the depravity necessary for abusing them and the more heinous and inveterate the corruption which will spring from the abuse  as the same vicious principle may assume different forms and be exerted in different ways some forms and exertions of it are often more detestible and pernicious than others if then some vicious principle should assume its blackest form in the practice of a clergyman who fosters it and if it should appear to be determined to that form by the circumstances of his occupation can we arraign the spirit of his office on this account this were to judge of that office only by the abuse of it but do not all men admit it for a maxim that those things are generally the best in themselves the corruption of which is the worst  suppose again that the employment of a minister contains circumstances which will lead to vicious conduct if the greatest caution be not exercised this would not necessarily prove even that vice will be more common among ministers than among other ranks of men much less would it prove that the spirit of the office is on the whole friendly to vice for it may contain other circumstances which prompt strongly to exert the necessary caution to resist the importunities of vice and to cultivate every virtue the ministerial office may from its being abused and perverted by the weakness or corruption of those who exercise it or from various circumstances in this state of probation in which it is to be executed supply temptations which have a direct and powerful tendency to excite a passion or inclination whose indulgence will lead the negligent into vicious conduct if this could throw a reflection on the spirit of that office or on the christian religion which has instituted it how could we vindicate the ordinary situations in which god places us or the general plan of his providence toward us in the present world many objects in nature excite passions which crave gratification often when it is vicious to gratify them were man formed for following thoughtlessly the present inclination these objects would infallibly lead him into vice but we must take the whole of human nature into the account man is endued with a moral principle a principle of reflection whose proper business it is to restrain inclination whenever it cannot be indulged lawfully his state is suited to his whole nature the temptations of life are designed to give him opportunities of exerting reflection of acting with moral attention to his conduct and are fit to strengthen by this means the principle of reflection and improve a habit of selfgovernment which is the great security of virtue they who will not exercise reflection and employ care in controuling their inclinations fall before temptations through their own fault are hardened in vice by means of them and thus render them subservient to a contrary end from that which god has designed and fitted them to answer this is the general constitution of the world yet the creator is wise and good and perfect the office of a christian minister in like manner supplies temptations with which many comply and which it requires a great degree of care and attention to resist yet that office may be designed for the virtuous improvement of those who occupy it its spirit may tend strongly to promote that improvement and the religion which institutes that office may be holy and divine for it is indeed analogous to the whole plan of providence  i will make one supposition more and that as favorable to our adversaries as they can reasonably desire i will suppose that the office of a christian minister exposes him to greater danger of acting viciously than other men even this supposition will not avail them much in this case our station would indeed be hazardous to ourselves as a few soldiers are sometimes forced to defend a desperate post in order to preserve a whole army from destruction so we should be exposed to an imminent danger of losing our own souls in promoting the salvation of others but even this would not prove that our office has an immoral tendency in any sense which could affect the credit of our religion it would be only analogous to what happens in the course of nature that some situations supply stronger and more numerous temptations than others and therefore it could never prove that the gospel is not derived from the author of nature  these observations appeared to be necessary for removing the confusion in which the charge against the spirit of our profession has been commonly involved and for enabling us to detect some of the artifices by which it has been rendered plausible and seemingly important the sum is this if the enemies of our order only prove that our office tends to form a character in which some agreeable qualities are wanting or even a character positively disagreeable in some respects or if they prove that some circumstances in it may be perverted into occasions of vice or that it presents peculiar temptations which it will require great caution to avoid complying with they allege nothing which can justly affect either the spirit of our office or the religion by which it is established if they can prove no more they attack us with insufficient weapons we may expose our bosoms to their pointless arrows without receiving the slightest hurt they show their inclination to annoy us and the undiscerning and the prejudiced may take it for granted that they have given a mortal wound to religion and its ministers but the candid and the considerate will soon perceive that in order to accomplish their design they must evince that the original and prevailing tendency of our office is immoral that something vicious is necessary in order to promote its genuine end and to discharge its real duties to discover whether this has ever been evinced or can indeed be evinced is the intention of the sequel  ii with this view we proposed secondly to enquire whether that character which the ministerial office tends to form be virtuous or vicious on the whole  our office is charged expressly only with some particular vices but these are so heinous and so numerous and softened by the mixture of so few virtues that were the charge supported with sufficient evidence it would imply that the natural character of a clergyman is upon the whole vicious and detestible i doubt not however but it will appear by every kind of evidence of which the subject can be supposed capable that a character in all respects virtuous is the natural result of our profession  may it not be asserted in the first place with considerable evidence that the clergy in general are in fact equal nay superior to other classes of men in whatever deserves the name of moral virtue and if this be true will it not form an argument in favor of the genius of our calling for if it really led to vice it could scarce fail to corrupt the greater number it is not easy to prove beyond dispute what depends upon so many instances what requires the observation of many ages and nations nor is it possible on this occasion to enter on a long detail from history to support the assertion but let any person examine with impartiality and he will find that in every state of things ministers of the gospel have had their full proportion of the virtue of the times in the best and the most virtuous ages there have been more of this order eminent for virtue in proportion to the number of those who belong to it than of any other in the most degenerate times in times when religion has been most perverted from its true design the morals of the clergy have been higher than on a level with those of the laity if there be any period in which it has been otherwise let our adversaries point it out  we own they have great advantages on their side  the ministerial office leads to privacy and retreat the abuses of it often carry a man into public life on this account the vices of those clergymen who have departed from the genius of their office are conspicuous and liable to be exposed by the torch of history but they who have been steddily actuated by its genuine spirit have passed through life in virtuous obscurity revered by those who knew them their memory honored for a generation or two but totally unregarded by history which confines itself to the actions of the higher ranks of men or to those actions which had an influence on the revolutions of government or on the general state of civil affairs  it will likewise deserve attention that in some establishments of religion many clergymen have not been confined to the proper functions of their office but have devoted themselves chiefly to secular affairs perfectly foreign to it it is not in these that we can expect to find the genuine character of the order for the pastoral office cannot possibly exert its influence on a man who is scarce at all employed in the duties of it the temper of such a person must necessarily be formed principally by those secular occupations in which he is most conversant yet it is from clergymen in this situation that persons are readiest to take their idea of the whole body because they are most exposed to observation  our adversaries derive another advantage from the unequal manner in which the comparative importance of different virtues and vices is ordinarily estimated temperance piety and the other virtues which will naturally predominate in the character of a clergyman are depressed far below their genuine dignity and at the same time many vices frequent among the other ranks of men but rarely to be found among the clergy are regarded with a more favorable eye than their real deformity deserves this perversion of moral sentiment if it be not guarded against will necessarily diminish the merit of the clergyman and raise that of the man of the world and thus disguise their true proportion to each other  but let our adversaries take no more advantage from these or other circumstances than themselves can approve as fair let them examine what has been the real character of the clergy not by selecting a few instances on one side only but by making a complete and impartial induction let them make the same allowance in this case that they would reckon reasonable in other cases let them form their judgment chiefly from those clergymen who have been employed only in the proper duties of their calling at least let them distinguish in others between the vices which belong to them as clergymen and those which have sprung from their adventitious occupations let the several virtues and their opposite vices be valued i will not say according to the christian standard but according to that standard which the unperverted sentiments of mankind have fixed and the best heathen moralists have acknowleged let them tell us honestly the result of their enquiry if they should find that ministers of the gospel have been upon the whole more blameless more virtuous than the rest of mankind that they have for the most part fallen in latest with a prevailing corruption of manners that they have often opposed its progress and been least infected with it that sometimes the majority of them have totally escaped the contagion of vice which raged among other ranks they cannot deny that the ministerial office has a strong tendency to promote the practice of universal virtue  that the result of their enquiry will be what we have supposed i pronounce with the greater confidence because it seems to be really acknowleged by all mankind it is an undeniable matter of fact that the general sense of mankind proclaims vice to be peculiarly scandalous and virtue to be peculiarly requisite in a clergyman they who pay little regard to the laws of morality in their own conduct demand the most spotless virtue in the teachers of religion every deviation from strict virtue every instance of vice in men of this profession has always excited greater and more general indignation than similar faults in others whence does this universal sentiment arise it can arise from no cause which is not obvious to the very senses of mankind for circumstances which cannot be discovered without close attention and deep penetration will never affect the generality their sentiments and judgments are produced only by plain matters of fact and from what cause can their sentiment on this subject arise but actual experience of the superior virtue of christian ministers familiar objects never strike us strongly vices which we are accustomed to witness we soon learn to behold without a great degree of horror were a vicious minister very common men must have long ago regarded him with as little indignation as other vicious men they are peculiarly shocked with vice in a clergyman for this reason because they do not find it so frequently in men of this character as in others  but this sentiment of the peculiar unsuitableness of vice to the profession of a clergyman deserves to be considered farther for not only do mankind by means of it give testimony that virtue is more general among ministers than among others but it likewise contains a direct proof that the genius of our calling is eminently favorable to virtue it supposes that all the world is sensible that ministers of the gospel have from the very nature of their office peculiar advantages for being virtuous if this were not taken for granted men could never deem vice peculiarly atrocious in a clergyman they could never exact uniform virtue more rigorously from him than from any other person when the situation in which a man is placed lays him under strong temptations to vice we make allowance for it in our censure of him we excuse in some measure the sallies of youth because the passions are violent at that time of life we give some indulgence to the peevishness of old age because the infirmities incident to that period are powerful temptations to ill humor we pity rather than blame a wretch who overcome by torture betrays his friend the judgment is natural necessary and well founded the vices on which we are disposed to pass a heavy censure are those which a man commits without any inducement from his situation those which he is under a strong obligation to avoid and has great advantages for avoiding when all men therefore perceive vice to be incongruous to the character of a clergyman is not this a confession that his sacred function has a peculiar fitness for forming him to virtue believers and infidels agree in the sentiments on which our argument is founded and therefore must equally perceive its force the natural sentiments even of those who are most forward to censure the spirit of our office pronounce vice peculiarly odious and virtue peculiarly necessary in a clergyman and these sentiments arising spontaneously and irresistibly in their hearts are a much stronger proof of their being conscious of the moral tendency of the christian ministry than any refined arguments formed at leisure can be of the contrary let them either acknowledge that our office urges us powerfully to all virtue of let them regard those vices which they charge upon it as more venial and excusable as less worthy of disapprobation in a clergyman than in another  before i leave this topic allow me to make one observation which seems to be of importance in estimating the real character of a clergyman it is the judgment of human nature that every vice has a singular atrocity in him this judgment could not be formed except vice were comparatively rare in that profession and likewise absolutely repugnant to its genuine spirit yet this very judgment has contributed not a little to bestow plausibility on the assertion that the spirit of our profession is immoral an assertion to which it is altogether contradictory the consequence of this judgment has been that while very high degrees of vice are overlooked in other men or at most are slightly blamed the least appearance of every vice in a clergyman is immediately remarked and severely condemned by this means a few small vices in him appear both greater and more numerous than many atrocious vices in another because they are more certainly observed and more heavily censured a person is highly disapproved when he bears the character of a clergyman who would have been noways censured if he had belonged to any other order thus the very tendency of the ministerial office to promote virtue has led men first to think ministers more vicious in comparison with others than they really are and next in consequence of this to charge the office itself with a tendency to vice we own that mankind do us no injustice in reckoning vice more heinous in us than in others but the judgment supposes the spirit of our office to be eminently favorable to virtue and therefore a person cannot fairly avail himself of it who denies this and is examining the real characters of clergymen in order to determine whether the spirit of their office be moral or immoral he ought to estimate their actions only by that standard which he applies to the actions of others  farther it is worth while to observe that they who censure the spirit of our profession most severely acknowledge its tendency to be moral in one respect there is one virtue strict decency and temperance which they own that we naturally derive from our employment they insinuate indeed that it is the only one but if it be evident that this one virtue necessarily promotes other virtues and gives us advantages for cultivating them it cannot be denied that our calling by its immediate influence on this one will indirectly but really tend to form the other parts of a virtuous temper  decency and temperance implies at least strict abstinence from all the excesses of pleasure from the dissipation of gay and thoughtless mirth and from all those expressions of any of our passions which are unbecoming in consequence of this abstinence the sensual appetites and infer or passions which are always vicious when they become excessive and which in others are apt to become excessive by being indulged without control will almost unavoidably be preserved weak and moderate in a clergyman this is one important ingredient in a virtuous character  but this is not all they who are disposed to regard intemperance and levity with the most favorable eye can scarce deny that they often prove occasions of leading men into vices much more heinous there is no crime so atrocious but a man brutified by excess or dissipated by giddiness may occasionally perpetrate the basest courses have been taken in order to procure gratification to pampered appetites the frequent returns of levity and intemperance may produce repeated acts of any vice and these repeated acts will by degrees render the worst dispositions habitual our office therefore by confining us to strict rules of decency preserves us from a situation which would put us in imminent hazard of committing many acts of vice and of contracting many evil habits by this means it has a peculiar tendency to produce a general purity of heart which undoubtedly confers very considerable worth upon the character  a strict regard to decency will likewise influence our temper in another way it implies a constant restraint of vicious principles concern that our conduct be right and unblameable and regard to the authority and dictates of the moral faculty now there is a natural association among our principles of action by means of which any one of them prepares the mind for receiving any other that has the same direction on this account a regard to decency must have a tendency to introduce into the soul justice veracity humility meekness patience forbearance and in a word all the virtues which like itself hold of control and are included in the idea of selfgovernment the direct principle of all these is the same with that of decency a sense of duty a submission to the law of conscience as every principle is strengthened by being habitually exerted the authority of conscience will be confirmed by our regard to decency it will be enabled to control every wrong affection with greater ease and by being accustomed to submit to its government in one instance we shall be better disposed to submit to it in all indeed men are often surprisingly absurd and inconsistent in their conduct one passion may be perfectly ungoverned while another is restrained on this account we cannot affirm that a regard to decency will necessarily produce all the virtues of selfgovernment but it certainly tends to have a favorable influence upon them and our office by almost certainly producing that will probably promote these others  the principal obstruction to the prevalence of good affections arises from the strength of some vicious passions which oppose their exercise a regard to decency by contributing directly to weaken these vicious passions will lay the mind open to the influence of worthy affections and will thus give us great advantages for acquiring all those amiable virtues which consist in the exercise of them  if therefore strict decency and temperance result naturally from our profession it must have at least an indirect tendency to promote all other virtues the concessions of our adversaries however small they may appear imply that our profession has a real tendency to promote universal virtue  these general arguments drawn from the real characters of the generality of clergymen from the natural judgment of mankind that virtue is peculiarly incumbent on them and from the influence of that partial virtue which is allowed by all to result naturally from our profession appeared too important to be wholly omitted because they not only are conclusive in themselves but also throw considerable light on the whole of this subject  but the most direct proof of the tendency of our office to form us to a temper of universal virtue still remains it arises from the nature of that office  as moral causes have doubtless a very great influence on the characters of men so all professions it is allowed contain fixed moral principles which tend to produce a correspondent character and have often force enough to alter the disposition that was received from nature now we may learn with certainty the tendency of the moral principles essential to any profession by examining the nature of that profession its end and the proper means of promoting that end if we survey the ministerial office in this manner we shall find that it has an essential tendency to promote a virtuous temper  the business of a minister of the gospel is in brief to teach religion the tendency of his office will therefore be altogether determined by the nature of the religion which he teaches christianity includes all the principles of natural religion and superadds the revelation of a stupendous dispensation of providence for the redemption and reformation of an apostate world by jesus christ the truths of natural theology especially as they are illustrated and refined in scripture center in this that to fear god and keep his commandments is the whole of man eccles xii     the peculiar doctrines of revelation teach us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly tit ii     both are proposed in the scriptures the only rule of our teaching with an express design to form us to the love of god and of man to make us perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works   timothy iii     religious principles are constantly represented as arguments for all virtue and addressed to our hopes to our fears to our gratitude to our honor to our propensity to imitation to every affection of the human heart that can have any influence on conduct at the same time in the scriptures all the parts of virtue all the duties of life are illustrated in the justest and the most practical manner our employment is to promote the belief and the practice of this religion to recommend goodness by publishing truth to explain virtue and enforce it by all possible motives can such employment tend to form us to any other temper than that virtue which we inculcate upon others  it is certainly first of all requisite in a teacher that he understand the subject of his teaching and that for this purpose he study it with care our profession will therefore naturally lead us to the diligent and constant study of all the doctrines and duties of religion it will urge us to know the holy scriptures ver     to meditate upon them to give ourselves wholly to them   tim iv     that we may be able to teach others   tim ii    if then religious or moral considerations if precepts or arguments if maxims or sentiments examples or rules of virtue have really any force they must exert it most in purifying refining and exalting the tempers of those whose whole business it is to attend to them since ministers must often think on all these that they may understand them and that they may inculcate them upon others the consequence will be that if they are like other men subject to the law of habit incitements to virtue will occur to their thoughts more easily and frequently than to the thoughts of others and urge them more powerfully to a suitable behavior  a great part of the vice with which other men are infected arises from the temptations to which they are exposed in the course of their worldly business each of them has a temporal vocation the direct end of which does not coincide with that of their spiritual calling and which therefore sometimes leads them off from the duties of the latter but ministers of the gospel have no worldly business the nature of their office as well as the authority of scripture to which they are indispensibly obliged to submit forbids them to entangle themselves with the affairs of this life   timothy ii    and by consequence preserves them while they continue in their proper province from those temptations which produce the greatest part of the wickedness of the world our occupation is to enforce a sense of virtue and religion upon others and every attempt of this kind is an act of virtue which tends directly to our own improvement every effort which we make in our particular vocation promotes the end of our general calling  our office leads us to observe our fellow creatures in all those situations in which either virtuous principles or the sense of vice produce the most conspicuous effects and tend most strongly to alarm a spectator and to force him to attend to the opposite natures of good and evil it introduces us for example into the house of mourning fcclef vii    it conducts us to the bed of death there we observe virtue supporting those who have been steady in the practice of it under all the agonies of pain and enabling them to triumph in the prospect of their dissolution as a second birth a glorious birth into the world of pure light and immortality there we see vice taking fast hold of those in the hour of perplexity who have formerly eluded its painful grasp we behold the horrors of remorse and the ghastly fears of guilt we perceive the wicked in his latest moments inheriting the unforsaken sins of his youth he looks eagerly for comfort to every side but he can find no comfort the flattering temptations which have seduced him already appear to be delusions he feels already that all which this world contains is a vain shadow that eternity alone is real and he feels the pains of hell begun already in himself if his faultering tongue should attempt to dissemble the anguish of his soul his trembling joints his beating heart his agonized and despairing look proclaim it in more striking language is there nothing in all this by which the heart may be made better ver   others may have some opportunities of this kind but our opportunities are so frequent that the impression made by one instance can scarce decay till it be revived and strengthened by another must not that man be destitute of all principles of reformation who is not formed to virtue by these means  it is our business to instruct   timothy ii     to convince to exhort tit i    to charge   timothy vi      timothy ii     to entreat   timothy v    to reprove and to rebuke ver  0   timothy iv   others can a vicious man be thus employed without some secret misgivings without some inward checks without sometimes feeling the agonies of remorse and have these no tendency to excite a man to that genuine virtue which alone can keep his own heart from condemning him can ministers allow themselves in any open and known vice and yet urge abstinence from every vice on others in public and in private in the solemn assemblies and from house to house act xx  0  will it not require a degree of impudence and effrontery which is seldom to be found even in the most degenerate  mankind are extremely averse from laboring in vain let an end be of ever so little importance in itself yet a person who is actually engaged in the pursuit of it becomes anxious to attain it and cannot without uneasiness bear the thought of disappointment the end of our office is of the greatest importance in itself it is to form mankind to virtue we cannot promote it without being highly virtuous ourselves an example of vice exhibited by us will render the best instructions ineffectual and will lead men into vice with much greater force than all our exhortations have to urge them to virtue when this is the certain consequence of wickedness in ministers must not we acknowledge either that they alone of all mankind have no concern for success and are in love with disappointment or that they have from their office a peculiar and powerful motive to be exemplarily virtuous to show themselves in all things patterns of good works tit ii     the opinion of the world has very great often too great influence on all men can it be supposed that it will not likewise have some influence on ministers of the gospel it sometimes leads other men astray into vice but it invariably urges ministers to the strictest virtue for every vice in them appears scandalous to all mankind and necessarily renders them contemptible and base before all the people mal ii    is it not a considerable advantage that a motive so powerful as the sense of character is constantly applied to us on the side of virtue  will not it also have some influence on ministers of the gospel that in the opinion of the world the vices of each individual reflect dishonor on the whole order and bring the office itself into contempt can a man consider with perfect indifference that he renders himself an object of just indignation to thousands of worthy men of his own profession whom his vices expose to undeserved ignominy when the meanest artificer is sollicitous to represent his own occupation in a favorable light can we imagine ministers so totally destitute of the most ordinary principles of human nature as to have no concern to be virtuous when that alone can prevent the ministry from being blamed   cor vi    nay the vices of ministers have still worse effects men impute them to religion itself and censure and disregard it on account of them our vices make men to abhor the offering of the lord   samuel ii     they cause many to stumble at the law mal ii    they cause the name of god and his doctrine to be blasphemed they induce great numbers to make shipwreck of their faith to harden themselves in their sins and to destroy their own souls can this consideration fail to operate powerfully on every man who is not lost to all good principles  to enumerate all the peculiar inducements which the ministers of jesus have to pure and exalted virtue were indeed to explain all the circumstances of the pastoral office from the few observations which we have made already it appears evident that that office tends to promote virtue in those who exercise it by many moral causes essential to it and fit to work on the most universal and unquestionable principles of human nature  but though our office has plainly an essential and unalterable tendency to purify and refine the heart yet we will acknowledge  we reckon ourselves noways concerned to dissemble it  it highly imports us to consider it very often  that our profession will not form us infallibly to virtue nay that if we allow it to fail of producing this its primary and most natural effect the very circumstances which give us so many advantages for virtue will render us more deeply and more obstinately wicked than the rest of mankind  by the original constitution of our nature habit which strengthens our active principles weakens all passive impressions the more frequently that we consider or feel motives to virtue without being really excited to the practice of virtue the feebler will be their influence upon us the greater our insensibility the more imminent our danger of never yielding to their force this is an alarming truth to all human creatures but to ministers of the gospel more alarming than to others we must revolve and preach the truths and duties of religion so frequently that if they do not influence us early to sincere and steadfast virtue they must quickly become familiar and lose their power moral and divine considerations must pass so continually tnro our minds that in a very short time they will make no impression on us a person whom our profession does not render virtuous will become more suddenly and more desperately obdurate in wickedness than any other man  nothing contributes more to strengthen any principle than an opposition which does not effectually restrain it our profession contains the most powerful inducements to virtue these will at least make a vigorous opposition to all vicious principles of action but if the opposition do not subdue them they will collect all their force in order to surmount it and they will be strengthened and confirmed by the violent effort as a sluice which cannot stem a torrent altogether only renders the inundation greater and greater still the longer it keeps it back just so vicious passions which are too violent to be wholly restrained by the fen es which our profession raises against them will produce the most dreadful deluge of wickedness whenever their fury can b eak down these senses if a pastor be really vicious he will almost necessarily be singularly vicious nothing less than a total depravation of soul can be the effect of a mans resisting the strict obligations to virtue and abusing the signal advantages for cultivating it which the pastoral office affords  in these and perhaps in some other ways our office may heighten vice in those who refuse to be actuated by its genuine spirit but this concession will avail our antagonists nothing were this a sufficient proof that our office tends naturally to vice it would likewise be a proof that all consideration of our duty or of arguments for the practice of it has a natural tendency to render us vicious for it is certain that the oftener any man reflects on his duty and the stronger his sense of its obligation is if he be not really excited to the practice of it the less chance there is of his ever practicing it the more hardened in vice he will become in time and the more impetuously ungoverned passions will rage within him  both from the former arguments and from the survey that we have taken of the nature of our office it is plain that it tends primarily and most naturally to virtue it promotes not one virtue but a temper which disposes the mind to the culture of every virtue it is the abuse of it that leads to vice and the abuse leads so strongly to vice only because the office itself has a powerful influence on virtue if this general examination of the genius of our calling be not necessary for vindicating it from the aspersions of our adversaries it is notwithstanding highly proper for producing in ourselves my reverend fathers and brethren a sense of the strength of those obligations to virtue which we ly under  iii we will now enquire thirdly how far our office has really a tendency to produce or to inflame those particular vices which some have represented as characteristical of our order  this is the more necessary because the late author to whom we have referred has unwarily admitted some fallacious principles and wrong suppositions into the reasoning by which he supports the charge these render his arguments specious and make those inducements to vice appear to arise from the original and prevailing spirit of our profession which are really but the partial effects of some of its circumstances or accidental temptations arising from the abuse of it and because these failacies run through all the parts of his reasoning it will be proper before we examine the particular vices which he derives from the genius of our calling to make a few observations on the general method in which he traces out the tendency of that calling  if we should allow that he has given a true account of the tendency of those circumstances in our profession which he mentions yet we might insist with reason that he has applied the character which results from them by far too generally he justly blames the undistinguished judgments of the vulgar who comprehend every individual of a nation without exception in the same national character he justly observes that all that can be asserted with truth is that some particular qualities will be more frequently met with among some classes of people than others has he preserved this necessary caution and delicacy in determining the character of the clergy he indeed says there are exceptions i will not enquire how far he can seriously admit exceptions with respect to some particulars consistently with the manner in which his reasoning is pursued but certainly it was wrong to combine all the vices which he mentions into one character and to ascribe it to most individuals of our order the same temptation will not prevail with all but only with those to whose constitution it is adapted every days experience proves that that may be an irresistible temptation to one man which makes no impression on another though therefore the genius of our calling were such as it is described it could only be inferred that some of the vices which are enumerated will belong to one clergyman others to another but not that all these vices will be united in the temper of any considerable number the circumstances which operate on the character are so various and on that account the influence of each of them is so precarious and the turn of mind from which each derives its force is so uncertain that we ought to reason on this subject with a peculiar degree of diffidence  it is easy to select a few circumstances in any profession which considered by themselves may appear to have an immoral tendency but we cannot thence infer that the profession has an immoral tendency upon the whole for the influence of these may be overballanced by other circumstances equally essential to it were we to estimate the character which any profession forms by the separate view of some circumstances belonging to it we might represent it in a very unfavourable light the character of a soldier is reckoned so amiable by this author that he judges it the fittest to be opposed to ours in order to set off its deformity but it is a soldiers business to fight and kill at the command of his superiors without examining the justice of the cause were it fair to attend to this circumstance alone we might say that his employment necessarily renders him cruel arbitrary a contemner of right and an absolute pest in society such precisely is the reasoning by which this author would prove that our office necessarily inflames many of the blackest vices of human nature he has by some oversight omitted many circumstances essential to it which have the most powerful influence on virtue he has fixed on a few circumstances some of them really foreign to our office and others of them but casually and remotely connected with it he has considered the effects which these would produce if they constituted the whole of our office and i will venture to say he has exaggerated both these effects and the causes from which they are represented as proceeding in this respect his reasoning is fallacious being built on an insufficient foundation  when it appears that any circumstance in a profession viewed in one light tends to vice we cannot always conclude that even this circumstance tends to vice upon the whole because it may as naturally or more naturally produce other effects of an opposite kind it is the office of a judge to pronounce sentence exactly according to law without regard to the ties of relation to compassion or to worthiness of character by considering this circumstance in one point of view we might be inclined to think that this office naturally banishes from the heart pity generosity friendship the love of relations and all the amiable offspring of benevolence but this will not be its natural effect for this unbiassed regard to right in opposition to all inducements from affection is fit to cherish an attachment to public happiness for promoting which all the rules of justice are calculated and by giving constant exercise to the sense of virtue it strengthens this sense and enables it to control all vicious dispositions and to lay the mind open by this means to the operation of every generous and kind and worthy affection but this author has considered those circumstances in our profession of which he takes notice only in one point of view he has observed only some of their consequences on the character but has unluckily overlooked others more essential and important and of a perfectly contrary nature if this be true his arguments will be inconclusive and that may be but a very partial tendency which they would represent as the prevailing spirit of our office  this author begins his character of our profession by adopting a trite maxim which he says is not altogether false that priests of all religions are the same i think it may be easily proved that this maxim cannot be true it necessarily supposes that the way of life and the occupation of priests of all religions is perfectly the same different causes can produce the same or similar effects only by means of those qualities which they possess in common every circumstance in an occupation has some influence upon the character characters therefore perfectly uniform cannot be the result of occupations which do not coincide in all respects politeness and the good qualities related to it make up the character which this author derives from the profession of a modern soldier he quotes a saying of an ancient writer who was perfectly acquainted with life and manners that it is not in the power even of the gods to make a polite soldier yet the way of life of an ancient soldier included almost all the circumstances from which he derives the politeness of a modern soldier the very same profession therefore may produce perfectly contrary characters in different periods by means of a difference in the prevailing manners of the world it is strange that an author of uncommon penetration who had remarked in this instance that a small change in the customs of common life could even reverse the spirit of one profession should immediately after produce a maxim which supposes that the greatest change in religious principles and customs cannot make any alteration in the character of priests  priests being the ministers of religion must derive from their office a character correspondent to the nature of that religion in which they minister but surely the nature of all religions is not perfectly the same this author acknowleges in another place natural history of religion page         that no two nations and scarce any two men have agreed precisely in the same religious sentiments that polytheism of every kind is most properly a sort of superstitious atheism similar to a belief of elves and fairies which it is great complaisance to dignify with the name of religion the pagan religion consisted wholly of groundless fables inconsistent traditions immoral tales insignificant ceremonies and empty pageantry ibid page     could it then have the same tendency with christianity which delivers the genuine principles of theism which institutes very few ceremonial duties which everywhere represents these as subservient to moral virtue which proclaims that the alone weighty matters of the law are justice mercy fidelity and the love of god matthew xxiii    luke xi    which sets before men the most illustrious examples of every virtue and the strongest motives to the practice of it can a pagan priest wholly employed in the absurd rites of the former derive from his office the same character to which a christian minister will be naturally formed by teaching the doctrines and inculcating the duties of the latter what one principle almost is common to their functions the protestant religion is very different from popery both in its form and in its spirit the office of a popish priest is in consequence of this very different from that of a protestant minister the one is continually recommending insignificant ceremonies as a compensation for real goodness the other is perpetually inculcating that nothing can compensate the want of it can these employments promote the very same turn of character it can scarce be said that priests of these two religions agree in the acknowlegement of the scriptures for in popery the scriptures are made void by legends and traditions but if they agree in this the only part of their character which they can on this account derive in common from their office is either that which results from the general tendency of revelation the love of god and man or those virtues which are recommended particularly to the ministers of religion and what are these the scripture commands them to be apt to teach blameless holy godly vigilant sober temperate not given to wine modest of good behavior just not covetous not strikers not brawlers not selfwilled not soon angry patient forbearing gentle meek peaceable benevolent given to hospitality lovers of good men   timothy iii     chap vi      timothy ii       tit i      may these ever be the qualities in which priests of all religions agree but then their character will be in every respect the reverse of what this author has drawn for them  in a word because different religions are unlike in many circumstances fit to operate on the character priests of all religions cannot be the same  it is not very easy to determine with certainty what place the false maxim which we have mentioned really possesses in this authors reasoning whether it be one of the principles which he uses in ascertaining the tendency of the sacerdotal office or whether it be the conclusion which he draws from circumstances supposed to belong to that office in all the various forms of religion  if it be a principle on which the reasoning proceeds it ought to have been clearly proved before it was adopted for if it be really false or doubtful every argument built upon it is destitute of evidence however plausible it may appear to those who take the principle for granted if it be considered in this light there is but one argument produced for proving it priests of all religions are the same for as chemists observe that spirits when raised to a certain height are all the same from whatever materials they be extracted so these men being elevated above humanity acquire an uniform character which is entirely their own do you think that this comparison bestows any evidence upon the maxim is the distillation of spirits by a chemical process a case exactly similar to the forming of a character by means of religious and moral principles and is it not somewhat strange to suppose all priests elevated above humanity as a step toward proving that they are all sunk into vices which depress humanity below itself to produce this as an argument would be unworthy of this ingenious philosopher who is well acquainted with the rules of reasoning who can easily discern the fallacy of very specious arguments who is even scrupulous in allowing men to reason from one subject to another in which the least circumstance of similarity is wanting essay on a particular providence etc page   0  it is a mere metaphor an allusion to a fact so wholly dissimilar that it has almost too much the appearance of a turn of wit to be admitted as an apposite image in the more serious kinds of poetry on this account i am inclined to think that the maxim in question was intended not for a principle in the reasoning but for the conclusion deducible from it  but if the author really designed to infer from the nature of our office that priests of all religions agree in the character which he describes he ought not to suppose this conclusion in determining the nature of that office this is plainly reasoning in a circle yet many of his arguments rest on this supposition and will be inconclusive without it could this manner of reasoning be allowed it is obvious that great advantage might be derived from it by means of it all the basest corruptions of religion come to be regarded as essential parts of it every thing which in consequence of the corruption of religion has ever been attempted by its ministers in the most degenerate state of things for supporting or promoting that corruption comes to be represented as a necessary part of the pastoral office tho it be in fact repugnant to the very nature and design of it  but if we would examine fairly and impartially what is the tendency of the pastoral office with respect to any virtue or vice we must distinguish the office itself from the abuses of it in order to this we must take our account of it only from the scriptures we must consider the end for which they declare that it was appointed the employment on which they put christian ministers for promoting that end and the rules which they prescribe concerning the manner of executing their employment an infidel cannot justly proceed in any other way for whether the scriptures have any real authority or not it is only in them that the institution of this office or the manner of executing it is said to be contained whatever is not by the scriptures incumbent on a clergyman is foreign to his office at least and may be inconsistent with it however generally it be practiced an enquirer must first discover in this manner what our office really is and then he must consider all the circumstances of it together trace out all the natural effects of each balance the good and the bad effects of the same circumstance and weigh the tendencies of different circumstances against one another before he can expect to determine its genuine spirit this will be indeed a difficult and complex induction but philosophers know well that an induction equally severe is requisite before a certain conclusion can be established in subjects of a less intricate nature than the formation of human characters whether the author whose arguments we are examining has observed this method whether in estimating our character he has not on the contrary fixed on some circumstances in our profession considered even these but in one light pointed out only some of their effects upon the character unduly exaggerated particulars and argued from circumstances foreign to the office of a christian minister nay wholly contradictory it i will appeal to the impartial i will appeal to his own candor after he has reviewed his arguments by the acknowleged rules of reasoning it will appear in some measure from the following examination of those vices which our office is said to have a fixed and unalterable tendency to promote they are hypocrisy superstition ambition vanity partyspirit rancour truly a black catalogue of the most diabolic vices had one of us drawn such a character for the laity in general or for any particular profession would not it have been cited as an instance of priestly fury but destitute as we are represented to be of the noble virtues of humanity meekness and moderation we will content ourselves with submitting our cause coolly to the cognizance of reason  do those abominable vices which have been mentioned indeed compose the genuine character of the ministers of jesus are these the natural result of their profession say christians when you look around you and observe the ministers who come within your knowledge do you really find these to be the qualities which are predominant in the temper and conduct of the greatest part of them  would you be disposed to give greater indulgence to these vices in a minister than in another or would not your hearts condemn them as unsuitable to his profession if these vices resulted necessarily from our office would it not follow that mankind must be disposed to excuse them in ministers on account of the difficulty of their avoiding them but can our adversaries say that hypocrisy ambition pride rancour or any other vice in that horrid catalogue by which they describe the spirit of our calling is regarded with a more favorable eye in one of us than in men of a different occupation the weak may not perceive some exertions of these principles to be vicious the prejudiced may mistake them for virtuous but whenever they are at all disapproved as wrong are not they as well as other vices condemned with singular severity in a clergyman does not the common sense of mankind thus declare that our office tends to promote the virtue opposite to these as well as other virtues some vices are reckoned more indecent in a clergyman than others but all vices are reckoned more indecent in him than in any other man some virtues are esteemed more indispensibly necessary than others but every virtue is esteemed more requisite in this profession than in other professions  there are two circumstances in our profession which it is said necessarily form us to hypocrisy  one is the obligation which it lays us under to observe strict decency  decency consists in abstaining from all behavior that is either vicious or offensive the most natural principle of this abstinence is virtue and our office obliges us to decency only by obliging us to blameless virtue did it exert its full influence upon our character we should not stand in need of dissimulation in order to appear virtuous indeed it cannot be expected in the present imperfect state that this office will exert its full influence universally or produce that exalted virtue which it demands in all who exercise it on this account many ministers may have an inducement from their profession to endeavor in particular instances to conceal vices and imperfections which really belong to them yet still this is but a secondary tendency by which the profession cannot be fairly characterized a tendency too which reflects honor upon it because it proceeds only from the strength of its original tendency to virtue  and is that conduct which even this secondary tendency produces absolutely blameable can it be allowed that all reserve is criminal hypocrisy is every man obliged in honesty to discover to others all the faults of which he is conscious in himself is it not right to conceal our vices from the knowledge of others by all lawful means will it not in some measure prevent the infection of our bad example certainly it is not criminal for a person to endeavor to reform himself from any vice which he has contracted yet this can be done only by setting a guard over his word and actions and abstaining from giving scope to those wrong passions which continue to solicit him very powerfully may not a minister abstain from the practice of vices to which he is disposed from a sense of duty or from a desire to extirpate them by degrees or may not he abstain from things which he knows to be lawful in charitable indulgence to the weakness of others or from a regard to character without any fault without being liable to the charge of hypocrisy without incurring any danger of destroying the candor and ingenuity of his temper or making an irreparable breach in his character is not the conduct rather laudable  indeed if a clergyman be obstinately wicked he will be exposed to a temptation from his office to blameable hypocrisy in every profession the vicious are often induced to affect an appearance of virtue in order to promote their designs the pastoral office will not render every individual really virtuous but it cannot be executed by a person who is known to be vicious it is therefore probable that a vicious minister will put on a false show of goodness but shall the whole order be for this reason charged with affecting a continued grimace in order to support the veneration of the ignorant vulgar and promote the spirit of superstition absurd corruptions of religion there have been which were intended for promoting a spirit of superstition and which could not be supported without an implicit veneration of the priest but to argue from these is to confound the vilest perversions of religion with christianity the basest prostitutions of the pastoral office with the office itself where do the scriptures enjoin a clergyman to promote a superstitious spirit the clergyman who aims at it pursues a wrong end suggested to him by his corrupt passions not by his office to which it is altogether foreign and the same corrupt passions lead him to pervert his office that it may become subservient to this end for what part of the pastoral function is the blind veneration of the ignorant vulgar requisite indeed we cannot execute our office without being careful to deserve esteem virtue alone deserves it our office therefore prompts us strongly to virtue if any of us attempt to supply the want of virtue by affected grimace in order to procure esteem he uses unlawful means of accomplishing a lawful end he is guilty of base hypocrisy the temptation to which arises indeed from his office but arises solely from its rendering virtue necessary for the execution of it if any of us weakly mistake grimace for the genuine dignity of virtue he confounds a vice with a good quality to which it bears some general resemblance but how does the ministerial office contribute to the mistake do any of the duties of that office described in scripture or does the example of our savior who came eating and drinking matthew xi     or the example of his apostles lead into it it arises only from the weakness of men which produces similar instances of selfdeceit in all profossions  we may add that our danger of being seduced into hypocritical grimace cannot justly make the character of our order appear in a disadvantageous light when it is compared with the character of other ranks of men the weakness of our nature may render that corruption of religion and of our office from which the temptation to hypocrisy arises very frequent but the same cause will as frequently introduce dishonest views and dishonest artifices of different kinds into other professions when the pastoral office is actually perverted from its real end to promote the purposes of a corrupt religion the temptation to hypocrisy may be very strong so as actually to prevail with many of our order but the perversions of other professions afford temptations to those species of dishonesty and craft which suit them as irresistible and as universally prevalent the hypocrisy which arises from our compliance with these temptations is highly blameable and pernicious but it is not generally baser or more destructive than the various frauds and artifices which are practiced by bad men in other callings  on the whole our office leads primarily to real virtue not to an affected appearance of it it very naturally produces a grave and serious temper and a cautious attention to our deportment which may be disagreeable to the gay and dissipated and which they may uncharitably charge with hypocrisy because of its contrariety to their own manners but which is totally distinct from vicious grimace corruptions of religion may pervert our office so far as to lead us to pursue ends which cannot be accomplished without affected grimace but the temptation to it is to be imputed not to our office or to religion but to the corruption of both and to the weakness and fault of individuals and whatever degree of grimace may really prevail among the clergy it cannot justly expose them to peculiar disapprobation because many kinds of dishonest art as odious to the full as this are equally general among other ranks of men  it is likewise said that our office promotes hypocrisy by leading us to be employed in the exercises of religion oftener than we can be possessed with the real spirit of devotion  it leads us indeed to be frequently employed in the exercises of religion the natural tendency of this is to improve a temper of piety in our souls for every habit is formed and strengthened by frequent exercise ministers will sometimes find their devotion languid when they are called to exercise it but the more constantly an affection is exerted the stronger and more habitual it is rendered by this means the less will a person be indisposed for exerting it if therefore our office leads us to be more constant in the exercises of devotion than other men it will necessarily render us less subject than others to fits of languor they who have not originally a higher or more constant spirit of devotion than the generality of mankind will naturally acquire it by being engaged in our profession it cannot be denied that our employment has an essential and strong tendency to form us to eminent and constant piety the most necessary and the most excellent of all virtues without absurdly supposing either that frequent acts of any virtue have no tendency to promote a habit of that virtue or that the strength of a habit has no tendency to lead us to act frequently upon it  but it is said that our office obliges us to affect devotion often when we are already jaded with the exercises of it or when our minds are engaged in worldly occupations suppose that it sometimes called us to devotion when we are in this situation is it necessarily unlawful to attempt to exert a good affection when a person is ill disposed to it if the attempt proceed from a sense of duty it is surely virtuous and it is remarked by philosophers bacon de aug scient lib   cap    that one of the most proper seasons for exerting a principle so as to improve it is when we are worst disposed then a strong effort will be necessary to overcome the opposition arising from our reluctance and by this effort the principle will acquire greater strength than if it had been exercised more easily humes dissert on the passions page      when other men find themselves indisposed for devotion they may be tempted to neglect it by neglecting it they will become more indisposed and are thus in danger of becoming by degrees habitually impious but a clergyman being under a necessity from his office to exercise it is led by this means to take one of the fittest opportunities for cultivating a temper of real piety  as our affections arise directly from just conceptions of their objects we can seldom be so averse from the exercise of any affection that it cannot be produced by due attention to its object our office leads us to frequent meditation on that god who is the object of devotion and on all those subjects which can render our sentiments of his perfections vigorous and lively it thus affords us the proper and direct mean of rousing pious affections when they are languid and since our office thus fixes us in contemplation of god and obliges us frequently to exercise devout affections toward him we must be grossly faulty if we be at any time so illdisposed as to approach to him with feigned devotion by these advantages which our profession gives us piety may be rendered so habitually predominant in our temper that it shall eagerly seize every opportunity of acting and that we shall be able to exercise sincere devotion in circumstances in which they who are seldom employed in religious duties judging of us by themselves may think it impossible and censure our worship as hypocritical  but is there no danger that we may be contented with going the round of religious exercises without being at pains to excite the inward affections which ought to animate them and if we should will not this produce hypocrisy undoubtedly mere formal worship frequently gone about tends to make us think that we are already possessed of those inward affections from which our worship should have proceeded and thus prevents our setting ourselves to cultivate them and confirms us in hypocrisy this danger arises from the very constitution of human nature and extends to all external actions which may sometimes proceed from other principles than the virtue to which they correspond and will in that case disguise our want of that virtue from us if ministers notwithstanding the peculiar advantages which their profession gives them for cultivating a temper of real piety engage in devotion without exciting that temper into act they will be in greater danger than others of becoming insensible of their want of piety and will more quickly contract a strong habit of hypocrisy by reason of their frequent calls to devotion but is this habit really worse than a want of all appearance of religion which these men would have infallibly run into from the same degeneracy of mind in any profession which did not give them frequent calls to devotion or tho it were can our profession be justly blamed for requiring those acts of devotion from the wrong performance of which that habit springs if it could it must follow that all exercise of devotion is not only useless but highly dangerous nay on this principle all good external actions must be censured as tending to corrupt the character because they may be performed when they do not proceed from their natural principle and because when they are thus performed they will rather obstruct than promote the improvement of that principle  but after all a clergyman can really be in no peculiar danger from the public exercises of religion because in them all the people profess to join and yet they alone appear to be intended by this author he seems to have had those priests in his eye who are almost constantly employed in running over forms of devotion in a language which the people do not understand but is it fair to draw an argument from them to clergymen who by their office only preside in these exercises of devotion in which all the people are as much concerned as they he seems likewise to confound mechanical warmth and ecstasy which must needs be transient with calm and rational piety which may actuate the mind as habitually and uninterruptedly and be as much in readiness to exert itself whenever an occasion offers as gratitude friendship or any other affection of the human heart  in a word our profession is singularly fit to form us to sincere and exalted piety by obliging us to frequency in those exercises of devotion by the right performance of which alone a temper of piety can be formed and by giving us great advantages for performing them aright we may indeed perform them in a wrong manner it may require strict attention to avoid it if we do not bestow this attention we may become hypocritical in our devotions but the fault will be chargeable not on our office but on ourselves who have resisted its primary and natural impulse  to conclude this head the prevailing tendency of those functions in which we are employed is to promote virtue and piety they will tempt the obstinately vicious to hypocrisy but they could not cease to tempt them to this without ceasing to urge powerfully to universal goodness those only will become hypocrites by being engaged in our profession who would have been either dishonest or abandoned if they had followed another occupation  another of the vices imputed to our office is superstition leading us to regard an appearance of religion or zeal for religious observances as a full compensation for all vices and violations of morality  but is there any spirit against which the scriptures the only rule of our instructions guard mankind with greater care can we teach the religion of jesus without making it a great part of our business to warn our people against this vile perversion of devotion what circumstance can there be then in our profession that puts us in peculiar danger of superstition this author really mentions none instead of supporting his charge instead of attempting to prove that superstition is one of those characters which are entirely our own he observes that all mankind almost have a strong propensity to it an observation which is inconsistent with its being peculiar to the clergy our office indeed naturally tends to form us to a temper of devotion but from the warmth of genuine devotion superstition never can arise on the contrary it is plain from the nature of the dispositions themselves as well as from the declarations of scripture that reverence and love of god gratitude to him submission to his providence regard to his authority and to his judgment of us and all the other parts of real piety lead to universal virtue and cannot be completed without producing it all mankind appear to be sensible of this they will allow a person to be really just or temperate though some other virtues be plainly wanting in his character but if a man want any virtue and have an appearance of piety they determine that his piety is insincere and hypocritical conscious that if it were genuine it could not sail to produce every moral virtue  if men be apt to suspect the probity of those who put on an extraordinary appearance of religion their judgment may be easily accounted for for it is too obvious to escape their notice that real piety is attended with little show and it is an observation which all men make in numberless other cases that whenever a man affects any good quality which he does not really possess he is sure to overact his part  but we need not dwell on this article of the charge for the author instead of producing any evidence for it indulges himself in remarks which only tend to depreciate all religion by confounding it with superstition an examination of this point though it be important in itself is foreign to our present subject  the clergy have been often accused of ambition and the accusation has been molded into many different forms this author chooses to represent them as a set of men whose ambition can be satisfied only by promoting ignorance and superstition and implicit faith and pious frauds that by arguments drawn from another world they may move this world at their pleasure whereas the ambition of other men may commonly be satisfied by excelling in their particular profession and thereby promoting the interests of society  is this a fair comparison of our character with that of others is it not plainly a comparison of laudable ambition in them with the greatest corruption of that principle in us but is the ambition of other men always of the praiseworthy kind is it this that has prompted individuals to raise themselves by supplanting better men by fraud by perfidy by assassinations by every the most shocking crime is it this that has distracted kingdoms with faction and rebellion and filled the world with war and bloodshed will it be said that the ambition of the laity has never appeared in this form or produced these effects and is not this the form of it which ought in just argument to have been opposed to wrong turned ambition in a clergyman on the other hand will it be asserted that our office does not suggest to us a laudable object of ambition which will bear to be compared with the desires of others to serve mankind by excelling in their own professions our office brethren naturally proposes to us only one object of ambition the noblest indeed that can be proposed to be workers together with god and with christ in recommending righteousness to mankind   cor v  0    chap vi    and thus promoting the most valuable interests of society it is the direct end of our office to excite mankind by the discoveries of a future world which reason and revelation make to that conduct which alone can promote their true happiness both in time and in eternity if we misapply these engines to move men at our pleasure or to render them subservient to our designs we basely deviate from the end of our vocation and instead of it pursue an opposite an unworthy and pernicious end and shall that be imputed to our office which is contradictory to its whole design  but may not our office contribute in some way to this conduct most men are prone to prefer present and temporal to spiritual and eternal objects and to pursue them by whatever means they can many who were not of our order have often prostituted religion by making it a tool for promoting their secular ends the vice is not therefore peculiar to our order to be employed in the functions of our office will never lead a man to form these worldly designs which can be accomplished by a prostitution of religion these are suggested by the viciousness of his own temper or by his being engaged in foreign occupations and would not probably have been formed if he had confined himself to his proper business indeed when ambitious views are from these causes once formed by a clergyman he will endeavor to promote them by those religious instruments which his office affords more readily than by any others because they are most directly in his eye his office obliges him to apply them to the most glorious purpose this is an argument for its excellence his wickedness prompts him to misapply them to bad purposes this is wholly his own fault ought the world to have been deprived of the only means by which virtue and happiness can be obtained because the abuse of them may sometimes be pernicious this vice cannot therefore justly be imputed to the genius of our calling for it has no primary or essential tendency to promote it on the contrary it has a very remote indirect and accidental influence upon it it will supply a temptation to it very seldom never except by reason of the previous corruption either of individuals or of the spirit of religion the vice will not be generally characteristical of our order except in the most degenerate state of things on this account and likewise because ambition often assumes the same form in the rest of mankind and because other forms of it are equally detestible and pernicious particular instances of clergymen applying religion to selfish or worldly purposes cannot with any reason render the character of the profession peculiarly odious  if we promote ignorance and superstition and implicit faith and pious frauds for any end we use the most unjustifiable means but it is impossible that our office can in the remotest manner prompt us to use them the method by which its genuine end can be promoted is the manifestation of the truth   cor iv    our business is rightly to divide the word of truth   timothy ii    to all to diffuse religious and moral knowledge to the utmost of our power is this the same with promoting ignorance and error say all the world is it not perfectly the reverse our office tends so directly to make us apt to teach   timothy iii     timothy ii     that it cannot even afford a temptation to the conduct of which we are accused till it be first perverted to the very opposite of what it ought to be it cannot put it in our power to pursue this conduct except all the rest of mankind be in one way or another as degenerate as ourselves  what then could lead a person to charge our office with a tendency absolutely contradictory to its genuine spirit there is one religion the priests of which pursue this unnatural conduct christianity was gradually corrupted from its genuine purity during several ages of ignorance and barbarity by a mixture of the grossest absurdities of paganism the monstrous medley could not bear examination and therefore the priests of the romish church betook themselves to the only means by which it could be protected from contempt or indignation but is it candid to transfer their character to other christian ministers whose conduct is avowedly the contrary this were to take it for granted that priests of all religions are the same not only without evidence but really in contradiction to the evidence of actual experience this character sprung not from the office of teaching religion but from mens having ceased to teach true religion it can be ascribed only to those causes which produced the corruption of religion and by that means necessarily changed the business of the sacred function and reversed the natural character of the clergy  it is affirmed likewise that we lie under a peculiar temptation from our office to vanity and an overweening conceit of ourselves because we are regarded with veneration and are even deemed sacred by the ignorant multitude  there are few situations from which men may not take occasion for criminal vanity for there are few which do not give persons some real or imaginary advantage and every opinion of advantage however trivial may produce an high conceit of ourselves but the more important or the more exalted any station is the stronger its temptations to this vice our office has plainly very considerable dignity the provinces of the philosopher and the orator are united in it it is designed for the noblest end for training men to virtue and fitting them for eternal happiness it is by its excellence alone that it leads us to set a value on ourselves and it has this tendency in common with every thing which has any degree of worth  but it is not every kind of selfesteem that can be reckoned faulty a just sense of any real and important advantage is not blamed in others and cannot be blameable in us it must be owned however that all men are very prone to an excess of pride and very ready to express it in an improper manner vanity ostentation arrogance insolence are highly censurable both in ministers and in others but the censure is due solely to the individuals who abuse the advantages of their situation to foster these vices in their souls the fault will be peculiarly chargeable on individuals in our profession because it gives us strong inducements to avoid it the very dignity of our office will fill a man of an ingenuous spirit with deep humility when he compares it with his own unworthiness who is sufficient for these things   cor ii     its functions will lead us to fix our thoughts often on the majesty of the divine nature and when we think of it what is man and what is the son of man psalm viii    and can we always avoid reflecting that the humble and lowly jesus mat xi    is our founder if we cannot will not his example have some tendency to form this mind in us which was also in him philip ii     the principle of sympathy is very powerful by means of it we enter into all the sentiments of others the good opinion of the world cannot fail to have a considerable influence on our judgment of ourselves but have ministers of the gospel any peculiar security for veneration or respect it is plain that many professions are in the general estimation of the world more reputable than theirs it will be difficult to point out any set of men on whom greater reproach and contempt has been poured out for their works sake than the teachers of religion undistinguished reflections on this order are thrown out without reserve and hearkened to with pleasure by many who would regard general censures of any other body in the gross as an evidence of prejudice and illbreeding if therefore general reproach and ridicule have any tendency to mortify the vanity of mankind the clergy at least in the present age are furnished with a peculiar antidote against vanity  all the veneration which we can expect on account of our office it is insinuated is that of the ignorant multitude we will not complain of the severity of this insinuation we hope that our profession may give us a right while we maintain a character becoming it to the respect of the most knowing it will prompt us more strongly to vanity by this means but if we allow that passion to have any other effect than to give us a new reason for endeavoring to deserve their esteem it will be wholly our own fault if we cannot expect the esteem of the discerning we can scarce have an irresistible temptation to vanity from the veneration of the ignorant except we be formed very differently from all other men who are most apt to be elated with the approbation of the most knowing judges and truly in the present age we cannot certainly obtain the veneration even of the ignorant they who oppose religion or inveigh against its ministers are formidable rivals to us these are not generally like this author his infidelity will probably rob him of some part of the attention and regard which his philosophical genius and taste would have otherwise commanded from the curious and intelligent but almost all the rest owe their reputation solely to their irreligion and must have been neglected or contemned even by the most ignorant and careless reader if they had attempted to write on any other subject  our office is also censured because it leads us to bear a great regard to the members of our own profession and to have a particular concern for the interests of our own body  but can this be culpable because our power to do good is very limited because our beneficence would become useless if it were dissipated equally among all mankind god has wisely formed our constitution in such a manner that benevolence rises in very different degrees toward different persons the human heart is so strongly turned to love that we eagerly take occasion for exercising a peculiar degree of this affection not only from relation personal qualities or favors received but also from more trivial circumstances a name a neighborhood or the like this constitution of nature necessarily leads men to love those of their own profession and to be concerned for the interest of the society to which they belong was this ever before censured as vicious to neglect this were highly blameable it is chiefly by particular kind affections that men are linked together in society  if the interests of clergymen of the same religion be really united more closely than the interests of those of other professions our office has a direct tendency by this circumstance to prompt us strongly to one species of benevolence and public spirit and thus is peculiarly fit to promote one of the most amiable virtues the interests of men of other professions not only are distinct because each carries on his business apart but often interfere and by this means the love which they ought to bear to one another is extinguished ought it not to be mentioned to the honor of our profession instead of being objected to it as a reproach that it does not expose us to this danger  all particular attachments may indeed be carried too far and obstract the exercise of other social virtues love to a family may render a man negligent of the good of his country even patriotism may make a man too careless about the interests of the kind but is that constitution of our nature which makes us capable of these attachments to be blamed on this account in like manner if some clergymen pervert that just benevolence which they owe to their society into a narrow partyspirit disposing them to sacrifice the interests of the laity or leading them to aim at the support of their own peculiar tenets or at the suppression of antagonists instead of the real interest of the order which always coincides with the interest of truth and virtue and by consequence with the interest of mankind is the office to be therefore censured it gives occasion to this misconduct only by containing a circumstance which has a direct tendency to promote an amiable virtue but which is capable of being abused by the folly or perverseness of men  at the same time our office tends strongly to prevent the abuses which might arise from an excessive attachment to our own society we teach a religion which represents us and all mankind as connected together by every endearing relation which can excite the tenderest love and by every similarity of condition which can improve our love by sympathy and fellowfeeling our office sets frequently in our view the general connections of the children of men and it unites us with mankind by peculiar ties it interests us in their most important concerns it engages us in the most affectionate intercourse with their very souls benevolence can be cherished only by those exercises of beneficence for which the circumstances of men give opportunity a minister has all the same opportunites of doing good with another man and if he really execute his office he must have many peculiar to himself for he can seldom spend a day without being led to inform the ignorant to comfort the distressed to confirm the wavering to cultivate the seeds of goodness in the minds of men such employment is certainly fit to melt the heart into love and to make it to overflow in streams of good will to the whole human race  when this author represented the clergy as a separate body wholly unconnected with society i am apt to think that he had in his eye only one set of clergymen those priests whom the law of celibacy and a monastic life cut off from all the ordinary relations to mankind indeed they are scarce a part of society they have an independent interest by which they are firmly united among themselves by which they are often prompted to conspire in opposing the interest of society and for promoting which their religion is evidently framed but is it fair to ascribe a character which springs from peculiarities in their situation to clergymen of other professions who are joined with society by all the same tender charities with other men to speak the truth by means of these the interest of individual clergymen is so much interwoven with that of the rest of mankind that they are in considerable danger of bearing too little regard to the members of their own body and of becoming the tools of the laity in promoting designs which a concern for the interests of their own society ought to urge them to oppose  in the last place the spirit of our profession is said to promote impatience of contradiction bigoted rancour bitterness and fury against antagonists  when we consider brethren the genius of the christian religion as it is delineated in scripture we can scarce expect to find this vice among either the ministers or the professors of it for it is indeed the gospel of peace romans x    its end is charity   timothy      its spirit is moderation and forbearance luke ix           it is wholly designed to root out of the hearts of men all bitterness wrath anger clamor evilspeaking malice and to make them kind tenderhearted forgiving loving and benevolent ephesians iv       chap v      is it possible that the teachers of this religion can derive from their office a perfectly contrary spirit if this office do not tend to sweeten the temper and to give peculiar advantages for meekness moderation and humanity it will be difficult to say what are the proper means of cultivating these noble virtues  the character and the office of a christian minister are described in scripture as perfectly suitable to the benign spirit of his religion the servant of the lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient in meekness instructing them that oppose themselves   timothy ii        reproving rebuking exhorting with all longsuffering and doctrine chap iv    this employment is so far from leading to the least degree of malevolence or wrath that it cannot be executed aright if we give any scope to this disposition  but when we attend to the history of the christian church we find it in contradiction to the spirit of the gospel filled with fierce contentions often about trifles producing angry zeal and cruel persecutions on account of religious differences had these things been peculiar to the clergy we might have regarded a temper of blind zeal as a vice to which our profession lays us under peculiar temptations intended for our trial which it will require our utmost vigilance to avoid complying with yet even in this case we should have been able to evince that they are temptations which reflect no real dishonor on the pastoral office because they arise from a perversion of it but indeed a spirit of bitter zeal has not been peculiar to the clergy it has infected all ranks among the laity in almost every age of the christian church what has been the cause of this and does not it affect the credit of the gospel itself  in order to answer these questions we may observe that christianity as it is exhibited in the scriptures is a system not of curious speculations or intricate disputes but of plain and simple facts fit to affect the heart and influence the practice it is proposed not with a view to exercise the ingenuity of men but expressly as a doctrine according to godliness and it is represented in that manner which fits it most for promoting this important end as the principles of common sense which the powerful hand of the god of nature has impressed indelibly upon the human soul influence the actions of those who have never made them an object of reflection or enquiry in ordinary life so the principles of true religion which the same god has revealed in the gospel firmly embraced and thoroughly digested will exert their full force upon the religious and moral conduct of those who are noways qualified to answer all the difficulties or even to comprehend all the abstruse questions that may be raised in relation to them but men are prone to refinement on every subject to nice disquisitions concerning the manner of things and to contentions with those who receive not their theories or advance others repugnant to them even the most obvious and irresistible dictates of common sense have been called in question by the subtlety of philosophers and had nature left it in our power not to act upon them till these disputes were determined the most necessary functions of life would have been suspended and immediate ruin would have ensued now brethren the christian religion has been treated like every thing else it has been made a subject of endless cavil and disputation men have set themselves to refine upon its simple tenets and instead of representing it in a manner fit to operate upon the principles of action they have reduced theology to a system of subtle controversies we are so prone to disputation that the greatest ignorance to which mankind can be reduced does not prevent it altogether but the introduction of this evil into religion was immensely forwarded by the universal authority obtained by that system of philosophy which aristotle had established in declared opposition to all his predecessors and which in conformity to the spirit of its author was wholly calculated for wrangling and altercation and absolutely untolerating to all who opposed it the spirit of this false philosophy diffused itself over religion as well as over every other subject filled it with innumerable subtle questions and by this means rendered it unfit to influence the practice for the manner of representing any doctrine with a view to guard it studiously against the cavils of adversaries will ever be very different from the manner in which it must be represented in order to move the heart a system of principles of any kind which spends itself in disputes must be barren of works and useless with respect to practice it can produce only contentions with all the fierce passions that must needs attend them thus christianity has been perverted by a false philosophy from its real nature and design and from this perve sion have arisen religious heats and animosities and a bitter and persecuting spirit  the apostles foresaw this depravation of religion and put both ministers and people on their guard against it warning them to beware lest any man should spoil them through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ col ii    not to give heed to fables which minister questions rather than godly edifying   timothy      to avoid foolish and unlearned questions knowing that they engender strifes and contentions and are unprofitable and vain   timothy ii    tit iii    and the apostle paul intimates plainly that they consent not to the wholesome words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness who dote about questions and logomachies whereof comes envy strifes railings evil surmisings perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds   timothy vi      but christians have not been so wise as to regard these warnings they have deviated from the spirit of the gospel they have corrupted it into a disputatious theology by foreign mixtures and hence malevolent passions have arisen but can they be imputed to the spirit of the gospel when they have been introduced by mens contradicting its spirit can we be infected with them by teaching the gospel when their cause is plainly teaching something else instead of the gospel they are a gross abuse of the gospel but there is nothing incapable of being abused they have been very frequent in the christian church perhaps god permitted them for the exercise and probation of christians that as they have much greater advantages than other men they might likewise have some peculiar temptations  when religious disputes arise they will naturally be managed with greater warmth than questions on other subjects by reason of their superior importance and the conviction of each party that their sentiments alone are agreeable to the will of god but this warmth will not be peculiar to the clergy the people will engage in the dispute with equal acrimony if there be instances in which the clergy have inflamed the people it is certain too that in some instances the clergy have been urged to fiery zeal by the art of designing laymen and that in some instances they have labored to curb the fury and to cure the bigotry of the people by illustrating and enforcing the principles of toleration and free enquiry nay uncommon ardor seizes not the friends of religion alone in questions where it is concerned but the opposers of religion likewise warmed with the moment of the subject they too urge their arguments without a strict regard to the rules of moderation is not the author to whom we have so often referred an example of it would he have reasoned on any other subject in the manner in which he has reasoned concerning the character of the ministers of religion had he been perfectly free from that zeal which he imputes to us and from the prejudice which it occasions i am persuaded that his benevolence of heart would have rejected with indignation the general reflections which he has thrown out against the clergy and that his strength of understanding would have enabled him to perceive that they prove nothing to the disadvantage of the pastoral office or of the christian religion wrongturned zeal has sometimes excited the clergy to call in the assistance of the secular arm for the suppression of their antagonists is not this author do you think under the influence of some degree of the same spirit when in imitation of their conduct he endeavors to alarm society against the attempts of the body of the clergy as necessarily factious ambitious and persecuting  thus the odium theologicum is not peculiar to priests it arises not from the particular genius of their calling the corrupt passions of all men often take occasion from the importance of religion to inflame it in questions where religion is anyways concerned fully convinced of the truth of their own opinions they are too apt to indulge intemperate zeal under the appearance of the love of truth  but have clergymen no temptations to this vice from which other men are free perhaps they have if religion be already perverted if the credit of peculiar tenets be substituted in the place of the interests of religion which always coincide with the interests of virtue they will in that situation but only in that have a temptation to support their peculiar tenets with intemperate zeal because their own credit and their livelihood will depend upon the belief which their opinions meet with but could either depend so much on this if the people were not fired with a bigoted attachment to certain peculiar tenets and disposed to desert or persecute their teachers when they differ from them into the corruption of the people therefore that temptation must in some measure be ultimately resolved which on a superficial view seems to arise from the pastoral office in truth religion is first corrupted through the weakness or wickedness of men this corruption enters into the characters of all who profess it both together pervert the pastoral office from its genuine spirit and the perversion of it increases that corruption from which it sprung  if a man enter into the pastoral office sired with a spirit of disputation or wrongturned zeal the fault is chargeable only on his natural temper or his education but if he enter into it without this spirit the office will give him some advantages for avoiding it it is acknowleged that in other subjects an acquaintance with the various opinions of learned men and with the arguments by which each supports his own tends to secure a man from unreasonable dogmatism if it has the same tendency in religion a clergyman must have an inducement to moderation from his office his office leads him also to study the scriptures in which meekness and all the kindred virtues are enforced by every method by examples by precepts by promises and their opposite vices are exposed prohibited and severely threatened and this surely has some tendency to sweeten the temper and humanize the heart  in a word my brethren a spirit of bitter zeal springs not from religion nor from the office of the teachers of religion but from a corruption of both from a corruption however to which human nature is so prone that it will require the greatest vigilance both of ministers and of the people to preserve themselves from its infection  i hope it is by this time evident that this author has hastily thrown off a portrait for the ministers of religion which does by no means express their genuine features and that the charge which he brings against the spirit of our office has been rendered in any degree plausible only by fixing on some separate circumstances of our profession by omitting some of their most natural effects upon the character and by exaggerating the rest nay by ascribing circumstances to our office which are not only foreign but even repugnant to it by confounding the temptations which may arise from the corruptions of it or of the gospel with the direct and essential tendency of both and by comparing the highest degree of the vices to which these temptations may solicit us with the lowest degree of the vices into which other men may be led by their particular situation if the vices to which clergymen are most exposed be compared with the same degree of the vices to which men of other professions are liable the former will not appear to be more odious than the latter it cannot be pretended that the peculiar temptations of the pastoral office are more generally complied with than the common temptations of our earthly state or the peculiar temptations of other professions there is therefore no reason for representing the character of the clergy as peculiarly disagreeable in comparison with other characters there is still less reason for censuring the spirit of our office or the gospel by which it is instituted in the preceding enquiry we have not dissembled any real temptation to the vices charged upon us which can arise from our profession but it has appeared that whatever these temptations be they arise from it only secondarily and indirectly from the corruptions of our office not from the office itself whose primary and prevailing tendency is only to virtue it has appeared that if our functions be performed aright they will naturally and strongly promote sincere and manly piety completed by universal virtue and will lead to warm and diffusive benevolence fit not only to check all angry passions and all designs hurtful to mankind but to prompt us likewise to uninterrupted assiduity in producing the happiness of others by instilling the most important knowledge and recommending the purest virtue  if this be the character which the ministerial office tends to form in the several individuals of our society it will be unnecessary to prove by any additional arguments that no government can have reason to dread the attempts of the society itself while its members retain the true spirit of their profession as long as they are actuated by it they must agree in considering all mankind as united into one great society under the supreme government of god and in regarding themselves as members of this system connected with all the parts of it employed to promote the order and enforce the laws of this most ancient and universal polity by doing their utmost to render all to whom their influence can reach wise and virtuous and happy they must totally apostatize from this spirit before they can form themselves into a faction eager to establish any separate interest any interest distinct from that of truth goodness and mankind they must contract a spirit opposite to that which results from the true genius of their calling before they can concur in giving scope to ambition pride or a persecuting spirit society can have no reason to be more jealous of their attempts than of the attempts of every other class of men for they are not more apt to degenerate from the virtuous spirit of their profession and to promote faction or persecution than other men are to become vicious and to form designs and pursue measures equally destructive of the peace and order of civil government a peculiar jealousy of the clergy and a desire to depress them will always indicate a prevailing corruption of manners a disaffection to religion an indifference about the practice of real virtue and about the eternal happiness of mankind in the societies or individuals who entertain that jealousy  it was remarked in the beginning of this discourse that the enquiry which we proposed for the subject of it is of a very practical nature it suggests important instructions both to ministers and to the people    every part of the investigation now attempted forces reflections into our view which merit the attention of all the ministers of the gospel it shows us my reverend fathers and brethren both the advantages and the difficulties of our situation both the strong obligations to virtue which we lie under and the dangerous temptations to vice to which we are exposed by exhibiting the former it urges us seeing we have this ministry not to faint   cor iv    till we have attained that blameless holiness which is so strictly incumbent on us by discovering the latter it warns us to take heed to ourselves   timothy iv    with the most constant vigilance lest we be seduced by them  the office of a bishop is indeed a good a worthy work chap iii    it has the strongest tendency to adorn the characters of those who exercise it with universal holiness the true beauty the only excellence of the human soul it gives us the noblest opportunities of saving ourselves by doing all that we can to promote the salvation of others the advantages which we enjoy demand from us the purest and the sublimest virtue the voice of mankind the nature of our office the credit of our religion call upon us to guard carefully against every sin and to study to excel others in every amiable quality in gratitude in duty in interest in honor by every possible tie we are indispensibly obliged to be blameless to have our souls deeply tinctured with all real goodness and to render our whole lives an uninterrupted series of conspicuous holiness every degree of vice in us is singularly atrocious not only in the opinion of the world but in the eye of unbiassed reason and in the unerring judgment of god and will be punished with the greatest severity and what would be esteemed only a defect of virtue in others will ever be accounted a positive and heinous vice in us in vain shall any minister of the gospel expect to derive esteem from the dignity of his calling if he do not walk worthy of it its dignity arises from its holiness a vicious minister will debase it more in the opinion of the world than all the groundless censures of its enemies nay brethren to our vices their reflections may justly be imputed for our vices alone put it in their power to censure the genius of our profession to revile our order or to blaspheme the gospel for our sakes our vices alone dispose mankind to listen in any degree to their aspersions or hinder them from rejecting them with indignation  by improving the advantages which our occupation gives us we may with the assistance of god which will never be wanting to us but through our own fault attain the highest degree of virtue but by misimproving them we shall sink into the lowest degeneracy as meat which is extremely nourishing to the healthful may inflame dangerous distempers in the weak so advantages for cultivating virtue which have the most powerful influence on the welldisposed will contribute to harden the wicked in their vices the danger of our falling short of that exalted virtue which our advantages render indispensible and the danger of our perishing for ever which will necessarily spring from our falling short of it have appeared so great to many pious persons of our prosession that they have not scrupled to express their fears that a smaller proportion of our order than of other ranks of men shall obtain salvation certainly we cannot be too careful to impress upon ourselves the deepest sense of both these dangers which the strictness of our obligations and our signal advantages render very great it is infinitely hazardous for a vicious man to enter into the pastoral office it is infinitely hazardous for us to neglect the immediate application of its advantages to the improvement of our own hearts for if the peculiar means of holiness which it affords do not very quickly excite the ministers of the gospel to virtue there is scarce a chance for their reformation where can they find means of reformation more efficacious than those with which they have already refused to comply it is of great importance that every person who aspires to this sacred office should devote himself early to piety and virtue that he may be qualified to improve its opportunities and to avoid its dangers it is of everlasting importance to his own soul every man who finds himself destitute of the seeds of exalted and uniform goodness ought to relinquish all thoughts of engaging in a profession to which his vices of whatever kind they are will be a reproach and ignominy whoever has entered into the pastoral office ought to give up himself to the practice of its duties and as much as possible to confine himself to them that he may not lose the advantages for cultivating virtue which this office puts in his power he ought to be extremely attentive to the manner in which he exercises his sacred functions that he may avoid the heinous vice which will infallibly arise from the negligent or the improper exercise of them and attain that improvement of heart which will be promoted by the diligent and right performance of the duties of his holy calling  some vices as intemperance impiety excessive dissipation are so unsuitable to our profession that they will be indulged only by the abandoned they demonstrate a total depravation of heart a mind lost to all the principles of goodness in the most degenerate state of things these vices will not be very frequent in our society the least approach to them is universally reckoned scandalous we should guard against these because they will infallibly render our characters odious and all our labors useless however slightly they may be disapproved in others let us remember not only that they are highly blameable in their own nature but also that the world will ever regard them with indignation in a clergyman that even the perverted judgment of those who practice them will pronounce them detestible in him that even they who solicit him to commit them and seem to like his gaiety will despise him in their hearts let not the example or corrupted sentiments of the world let not an affectation of spirit and freedom let not the fear of being reckoned austere morose or stubborn let not any inducement prevail with us to admit the lowest degree of these vices into our character or practice the virtues opposite to these are absolutely necessary to preserve us from universal infamy let us take care that we have not the appearance of them only but that we really possess the virtues themselves and excel in them they are enforced upon us by the spirit of our profession in its full strength they are inculcated by all the moral principles by which our employment operates on the temper  there are some other vices which have not so manifest a repugnance to our profession or which may even appear to spring from a common and probable abuse of it but for that very reason we have greater need to be upon our guard against them intemperate zeal and its kindred vices will insinuate themselves more imperceptibly than those which were mentioned before will disguise themselves more artfully will more easily elude the observation of the ignorant or perhaps will be even consecrated by them in general the vices which we are in greatest danger of indulging are those which admit of the fairest pretexts and which are most apt to be confounded with some virtuous principle our profession does not afford all the motives to abstinence from these which it affords to abstinence from other vices tho it affords all that their nature will allow if we attend to the exhortations which the inspired writers address to ministers of the gospel we shall find that they much oftener give us warning against the vices of this class than against others thus plainly intimating that we are obnoxious chiefly to these to avoid every degree of these will require the greatest circumspection these will be more frequent in our society than other vices these alone can with any plausibility be charged on the spirit of our office if we indulge ourselves in these their prevalence will furnish our more discerning enemies with the most specious arguments against us instead of entertaining resentment against them let us turn their censures to our own advantage the ministerial office has not such a tendency to any vice as can justly expose its spirit to reproach but the vices which are imputed to it may notwithstanding be those which a wicked or a careless minister will most probably indulge let us not be satisfied with a conviction that our office does not deserve censure but let every individual take care that he may not deserve it adversaries of penetration will be sure to attack us on the side where we are weakest let us take warning let us employ particular attention there let us beware of every thing that can lead us into the vices which they impute to us our office has its peculiar temptations let us not disguise them from ourselves let us rather be sollicitous to discover them they cannot reflect dishonor on that office or on religion yet they may sometimes put our virtue to a very difficult and hazardous trial they will overcome us and seduce us into vice if we be not vigilant and circumspect but if through the grace of god whom we serve in the gospel we strenuously resist them we shall acquire strong habits of sincere piety unfeigned humility diffusive benevolence meekness gentleness charity and every amiable virtue which can adorn our station or our religion    the enquiry in which we have been engaged likewise suggests useful instructions to the laity  in the present age and in this nation infidelity has erected its standard and many have enlisted in its service if there be any among these who think that they have rejected the gospel after a fair examination of its evidences we will pray fervently to god that he may have mercy upon them and bring them to the knowledge of the truth   timothy ii    we will beseech them for their own sakes to take care that they have been really unprejudiced in their enquiries prejudices against religion may insinuate themselves as imperceptibly as prejudices for it and they are at least as highly blameable if god has really given a revelation of his will to mankind every degree of unfairness in examining its evidence will be highly vicious in the judgment of reason and natural conscience and will evidently deserve the severest punishment but without pretending to judge of mens secret intentions we may surely say that when men attack religion either in public or private either in conversation or from the press by throwing out undistinguished reflections against the clergy when they exaggerate the failings of individual clergymen and charge them on the whole body when they attempt to reproach the spirit of the ministerial office by partial or wrong representations of its nature when they labor to overturn religion by raising a groundless prejudice against the teachers of it this affords a presumption of prejudice tho perhaps unsuspected by themselves which when it is pointed out to them may justly excite them to review the temper and care with which they have enquired into religion if an infidel be not possessed with blameable prejudice he will certainly confine himself in his attacks against religion to direct arguments carefully avoiding every topic which may weaken its influence without deciding concerning its truth let illiberal reflections against the clergy be left to the tribe of vulgar infidels who have not perhaps penetration enough to discover that they do not amount to a full confutation of christianity let those abstain from them who are capable of perceiving that many ministers may be extremely vicious and yet the office which they hold may have a virtuous tendency and the gospel may be true  my subject leads me also to address the christian people it leads me to warn you my friends not to allow any man to beguile you with enticing words by slight and cunning craftiness whereby many lie in wait to deceive col ii   ephesians iv     it leads me to exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints for there are many crept into christian countries who deny the only lord god and our lord jesus christ jude      let not example let not inconclusive cavils let not unsubstantial turns of wit prevail with you to deny the lord that bought you   pet ii    in opposition to your rational conviction you may adopt some of the maxims of infidels without perceiving their consequences you may be infected with their spirit while you reject their principles this is shameful inconsistence but every days experience evinces that men may fall into it infidels have no prejudice against ministers of gospel except on account of their being the teachers of christianity they reproach them only that they may wound religion but do not some of you join in despising ridiculing or reproaching the christian ministry tho you acknowledge the truth of the christian religion the conduct of infidels is extremely foolish because their reasoning is evidently fallacious but your conduct is infinitely more absurd you promote the designs of unbelievers against yourselves you inconsiderately contribute to the success of a cause which you abhor it has been often observed that modern deists have derived from those very scriptures which they reject juster opinions in natural religion than the wisest heathens were able to form by unassisted reason and that the gospel has thus insensibly refined the principles even of its enemies but it may be observed with equal truth that the prevalence of infidelity has greatly corrupted the sentiments and practice even of those whose faith it could not directly subvert be on your guard therefore against the contagion of its spirit  indeed you have a right to expect exemplary holiness from your ministers vice in them may justly excite your indignation and your expressing your disapprobation of it in every proper manner may prevent it from becoming frequent be sure however to find fault only with real vices confine your censures to the individuals who are guilty in your censures even of them remember still that they are weak and fallible creatures like yourselves exposed to all the temptations of this state of trial but let not the faults of a few be imputed to all do not on account of them despise or reproach the office blame vicious ministers for behaving unsuitably to their profession but remember that this very judgment implies the excellence of that profession while you believe the gospel you ought to preserve a high regard for the office of teaching it you ought to esteem those who are employed in it very highly in love for their works sake   thessalonians v     if you despise the order in general you despise their work you despise the gospel for the gospel both the source and the subject of their employment is this consistent with your being christians  you brethren as well as ministers enjoy great advantages for the practice of holiness by the gospel your obligations and your dangers are very similar to ours it is your business to study and to practice that religion which it is our business to teach and inculcate on you let your sense of the advantages which it affords animate you to blameless holiness let your sense of the danger of your misimproving these advantages excite your vigilance and caution in opposition to all temptations walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called ephesians iv    walk worthy of the lord unto all wellpleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god col    0  let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of christ philip i     which you have learned which we have taught and by which both you and we must be judged at last  may god fill
