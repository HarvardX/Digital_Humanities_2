not when from plate to plate your eyeballs roll and the brain dances to the mantling bowl hear bethels sermon one not versed in schools   then scorn a homely dinner if you can  or kept from fish the river yet unthawd if then plain bread and milk will do the feat the pleasure lies in you not in the meat  will choose a pheasant still before a hen yet hens of guinea full as good i hold except you eat the feathers green and gold  though cut in pieces ever my lord can eat yet for small turbots such esteem profess because god made these large the other less  cries send me gods a whole hog a westindian term of gluttony a hog roasted whole stuffed with spice and basted with madera wine barbecud oh blast it rank as the ripeness of a rabbits tail by what criterion do ye eat do you think if this is prized for sweetness that for stink when the tired glutton labors through a treat he will find no relish in the sweetest meat he calls for something bitter something sour and the rich feast concludes extremely poor  thus much is left of old simplicity robinredbreast till of late had rest and children sacred held a martins nest till beccaficos sold so devilish dear to one that was or would have been a peer cat on oysters fed i will have a party at the bedford head or even to crack live crawfish recommend i would never doubt at court to make a friend  about one vice and fall into the other between excess and famine lies a mean plain but not sordid though not splendid clean avidien or his wife no matter which for him you will call a sell their presented partridges and fruits and humbly live on rabbits and on roots  and is at once their vinegar and wine but on some a lost bankbill or heard their son was drowned at such a feast is what two souls so generous cannot bear oil though it stink they drop by drop impart but sowse the cabbage with a bounteous heart  and neither leans on this side or on that nor swears like albutius a good cook away nor lets like the musty wine foul cloth or greasy glass  thus said our friend and what he said i sing first health a tomb of boiled and roast and flesh and fish when bile and wind and phlegm and acid jar and all the man is one intestine war remembers often the temperate fleeps and spirits light as air  rise from a clergy or a city feast what life in all that ample body say what heavenly particle inspires the clay the soul subsides and wickedly inclines to seem but mortal even in sound divines  that leaves the load of yesterday behind how easy every labor it pursues how coming to the poet every muse  or tired in search of truth or search of rhyme ill health some just indulgence may engage and more the sickness of long life old age  if our intemprate youth the vessel drains  perhaps young men our fathers had no nose not so a buck was then a weeks repast and twas their point i ween to make it last better to keep it till their friends could come than eat the sweetest by themselves at home  ere coxcombpyes or coxcombs were on earth unworthy he the voice of fame to hear  for faith lord fanny you are in the wrong the worlds good word is better than a song who has not learned are no rewards for want and infamy when luxury has licked up all thy pelf cursed by thy to friends to fortune to mankind a shame think how posterity will treat thy name and thou have at least bestowed one penny well  to have a taste is insolence indeed in me it is noble suits my birth and state my wealth unwieldy and my heap too great then like the sun let and shine that superfluity away oh impudence of wealth with all thy store how dare thou let one worthy man be poor shall half the make keys build bridges or repair white hall or to thy country let that heap be lent as m  os was but not at five per cent  prepares a dreadful jest for all mankind and that spreads and swells in puffed prosperity or blessed with little whose preventing care in peace provides fit arms against a war  and always thinks the very thing he ought his equal mind i copy what i can and as i love would imitate the man in south sea days not happier when surmisd the lord of thousands than even now excisd in forests planted by a fathers hand than in five acres now of rented land content with little i can piddle here on but that touch my bell i cannot turn away it is true no but gudgeons flounders what my thames affords to hounslowheath i point and bansteddown thence comes your mutton and these chicks my own  and grapes longlingring on my only wall and figs from standard and espalier join the devilish is in you if you cannot dine then and what is more rare a poet shall say grace fortune not much of humbling me can boast though doubletaxd how little have i lost my lifes amusements have been just the same before and after my lands are sold my fathers house is gone i will hire anothers is not that my own and yours my friends through whose freeopening gate none comes too early none departs too late for i who hold sage homers rule the best welcome the coming speed the going guest pray heaven it last cries swift as you go on i wish to god this house had been your own pity to build without a son or wife why you will enjoy it only all your life  well if the use be mine can it concern one whether the name belong to pope or vernon what is property dear swift you see it alter from you to me from me to or in a mortgage prove the lawyers share or in a jointure vanish from the heir or in pure the chancry takes your rents for twenty year at best it falls to some that cries my fathers damned and all is my own  are now the portion of a booby lord and hemsley once proud villers duke of buckingham buckinghams delight slides to a scrivner or a city knight  let us be fixed and our own masters still
