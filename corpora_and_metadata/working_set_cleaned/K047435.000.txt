since she has arrived to procure a sight of her i have not been able  i would however fo myself into the house but it seems she has a young brother the marquis come down on a vit to her within these three days and he might take upon him to resent my gallantry  and i cannot say i am fond of resentments rage and hatred  no no the soster passions possess me wholly exi   scene ii a chamber at donna isabellas enter isabella followed by the marquis marquis but my dear sister did not you seduce me to this melancholy spot on a promise  ou would procure me an introduction to the rich idow the charming countess  interest first rompted my wishes but since i have beheld her  is love   isabel beheld her   marquis yes beheld her  walking in her rden  sitting negligently in an arbor   isabel but how  how contrive to see     marquis from the top of our house through elescope  but my dear sister do bring us a le nearer or i will purchase a speaking trumpet  make love to her through it though my ssion be heard by every soul within a quarter of ile   isabel i tell you i have great hopes   marquis but why not accept of her acintance and prevail on her yourself to see    sabel i tell you again the letters i expect n her uncle at madrid will have more weight n volumes i could say  she dare not disobey  and must see you   marquis and yet i would not compel her to  unless she consents to my acquaintance free without being constrained by force or deed by stratagem i had rather have recourse he top of the house and my telescope again   isabel do not let your scrupulous honor overcome all your future prospects  notwithstanding these letters will strongly recommend you yet it will be with her own consent only she will yield to the recommendation   marquis but when do you expect the letters   isabel every instant  my servants are no gone to the post office   marquis i will fly and see if they are turned   isabel do for as soon as the letters are rived i would not have you lose a moment  away and know your fate at once  yet if she  but see you i think with such a person as your there can be little to fear   marquis but they tell me she is so auste since this rigid vow  so awful  she will petr me with a look   isabel pshaw  away and see if the lette are come   marquis i will and if they are and i g admittance i am resolved i will obtain  husband within a week in return my dear sist for your kindness to me exit marqu   enter inis isabel well inis  i am impatient to he what success   inis delightful madam  i have been introced to the young countess  i first communited the intelligence of the pretended plot formg against her to her waiting woman who was fficiently alarmed at it to take me to her lady mediately   isabel well   inis and so madam as soon as i was induced i fell a crying  i thought that was the st way   isabel very well   inis and then before i discovered what i had say i made her promise not to betray me ch she did most solemnly and without the st reluctance  and now madam says i i  servant with your neighbor donna isabella ighty lady who turns every thing serious and ed into ridicule and she has resolved to make t of you for pretending an aversion to men  for that purpose she has procured recomndations for you to receive the visits of the ng marquis her brother but instead of him  purposes to come herself disguised as a man vail on you to consent to be married to her  then throw off the mask and make you and  vow the jest of the whole kingdom   isabel this is all right  go on   nis on this she thanked me a thousand times  the discovery   sabel but did she say she would receive    inis oh yes  she has promised to receive you on my account that my divulging the scheme may not be detected   isabel and she is absolutely resolved to receive me under the title of my brother   inis you may depend upon it  but how are you to proceed now   isabel send my brother to her immediately   inis your brother   isabel yes  the countess from what you have told her will suppose him a woman receive him and consequently suffer a thousand endearing familiarities till charmed by the graces of his mind and person she shall love him without knowing it and when she detects the impostor be unable to part with him   inis and if she is like me she will think it the happiest day of her life  but have you prepared your brother how to act his part   isabel he has nothing to act being the very person he represents and therefore shall not know of the art by which he is introduced  for except being a little too attentive to dress and etiquette a circumstance which with his youthful appearance favors our design he is one of the mo amiable young men in the world and the le idea of imposition would shock his honor and put an end to my scheme   inis then he is not to know he is to be taken for a woman   isabel certainly not  hush here he is now for my credentials taking out letters from her packet   enter marquis marquis oh my dear sister there are no letters arrived   isabel yes here they are  gives a packet f letters my maid has just brought them me   marquis o with what joy i receive them  they are all right  there will be no mistake i ope  nothing to make me appear ridiculous  i would not appear ridiculous for the world   isabel all is right  no no   marquis they are addressed to her uncle   isabel yes because it will be far more deicate to be introduced through his means  ut there is one enclosed to her   marquis do you think she will see me   isabel yes i dare say  there is little doubt f it   inis by my dream last night i would lay my life he will   marquis why what did you dream   inis i dreamt she ordered her servants to drag your lordship by force out of the house and duck you in the great fish pond for a whole hour   marquis is that a sign    inis o yes  dreams always go by contraries   marquis going returns but i know she is so haughty and reserved that should she admit me i shall appear confused and awkward    inis so much the better  she expects you will be awkward   marquis expects i shall be awkward   isabel pshaw pshaw  hesitate no longe with your fears but away  you know your first court must be to the uncle and when you have been a little time in the house your apprehension will vanish  away away   marquis but if she should not condescen to see me   inis oh my lord you
