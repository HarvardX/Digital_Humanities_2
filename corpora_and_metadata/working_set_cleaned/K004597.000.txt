you   harlequin always at hand  why cannot you as well give it me and let me relieve myself   fairy it has no virtue in any hand but mine  but in lieu of it take this ring  whenever you touch it you may appear to any beholder whatever or whomsoever you shall wish to be thought nay to different spectators at once as many different beings  by removing it from one finger to another it shall render your opponents deaf dumb or blind as occasion shall require  it will also enable you to imitate any voice as well as assume whatever character you please   harlequin assume whatever character i please  i am told london swarms with people who can do that without a magic ring  one part of its virtue i can easily conceive to be inestimable for i am not to learn that great things may be done there by having what they call the command of a few voices   fairy yes yes  you will not find liberty of speech the least of my favors   harlequin o i know the first men in the kingdom are speechmakers and practice their trade not only all day but sometimes all night too but however fond i may be of the speaking harlequins my strong attachment is to my brethren of the sword   fairy i perceive you have been in london before  then you admire the english   harlequin admire them  who does not  an englishman takes to fighting as a newfoundland dog takes to the water  your true british harlequin leaps at a breach made by a cannon ball as eagerly as a hunter leaps at a hedge  liberty is his colombine the goddess of his idolatry  for her he dares the most imminent danger and courage is the magic sword with which he is endowed to conquer every difficulty  so my dear dear little fairy take the other dip in the well and follow me  for i say  hey for london  exeunt here follows comic business of the pantomime air  angelica though as a shield against surprise the cautious tongue may silence prove unable to assume disguise the eyes still tell the tale of love ii in foreign climes thuntutord mind

as my spells have been feeble may the speech you are about to acquire be ever employed in reproaches and revilings and trebly unpropitious be those revels which i must neither partake of nor behold  last chorus the fairy invites you and mirths chosen band attend in her palace to welcome each guest with hymen uniting to join hand in hand each pair fondly suing to bless and be blessed dance finis
