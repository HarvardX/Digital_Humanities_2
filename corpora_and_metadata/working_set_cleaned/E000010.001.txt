preface   the following sheets were as the note on the opposite page expresses printed so long ago as the year    0 the design in pursuance of which they were written was not so extensive as that announced by the present title they had at that time no other destination than that of serving as an introduction to a plan of a penal code in terminus designed to follow them in the same volume  the body of the work had received its completion according to the then present extent of the authors views when in the investigation of some flaws he had discovered he found himself unexpectedly entangled in an unsuspected corner of the metaphysical maze a suspension at first not apprehended to be more than a temporary one necessarily ensued suspension brought on coolness and coolness aided by other concurrent causes ripened into disgust  imperfections pervading the whole mass had already been pointed out by the sincerity of severe and discerning friends and conscience had certified the justness of their censure the inordinate length of some of the chapters the apparent inutility of others and the dry and metaphysical turn of the whole suggested an apprehension that if published in its present form the work would contend under great disadvantages for any chance it might on other accounts possess of being read and consequently of being of use but though in this manner the idea of completing the present work slid insensibly aside that was not by any means the case with the considerations which had led him to engage in it every opening which promised to afford the lights he stood in need of was still pursued as occasion arose the several departments connected with that in which he had at first engaged were successively explored insomuch that in one branch or other of the pursuit his researches have nearly embraced the whole field of legislation ⚓ ✪  several causes have conspired at present to bring to light under this new title a work which under its original one had been imperceptibly but as it had seemed irrevocably doomed to oblivion in the course of eight years materials for various works corresponding to the different branches of the subject of legislation had been produced and some nearly reduced to shape and in every one of those works the principles exhibited in the present publication had been found so necessary that either to transcribe them piecemeal or to exhibit them somewhere where they could be referred to in the lump was found unavoidable the former course would have occasioned repetitions too bulky to be employed without necessity in the execution of a plan unavoidably so voluminous the latter was therefore indisputably the preferable one to publish the materials in the form in which they were already printed or to work them up into a new one was therefore the only alternative the latter had all along been his wish and had time and the requisite degree of alacrity been at command it would as certainly have been realised cogent considerations however concur with the irksomeness of the task in placing the accomplishment of it at present at an unfathomable distance  another consideration is that the suppression of the present work had it been ever so decidedly wished is no longer altogether in his power in the course of so long an interval various incidents have introduced copies into various hands from some of which they have been transferred by deaths and other accidents into others that are unknown to him detached but considerable extracts have even been published without any dishonourable views for the name of the author was very honestly subjoined to them but without his privity and in publications undertaken without his knowledge  it may perhaps be necessary to add to complete his excuse for offering to the public a work pervaded by blemishes which have not escaped even the authors partial eye that the censure so justly bestowed upon the form did not extend itself to the matter  in sending it thus abroad into the world with all its imperfections upon its head he thinks it may be of assistance to the few readers he can expect to receive a short intimation of the chief particulars in respect of which it fails of corresponding with his maturer views it will thence be observed how in some respects it fails of quadrating with the design announced by its original title as in others it does with that announced by the one it bears at present  an introduction to a work which takes for its subject the totality of any science ought to contain all such matters and such matters only as belong in common to every particular branch of that science or at least to more branches of it than one compared with its present title the present work fails in both ways of being conformable to that rule  as an introduction to the principles of morals in addition to the analysis it contains of the extensive ideas signified by the terms pleasure pain motive and disposition it ought to have given a similar analysis of the not less extensive though much less determinate ideas annexed to the terms emotion passion appetite virtue vice and some others including the names of the particular virtues and vices but as the true and if he conceives right the only true groundwork for the development of the latter set of terms has been laid by the explanation of the former the completion of such a dictionary so to style it would in comparison of the commencement be little more than a mechanical operation  again as an introduction to the principles of legislation in general it ought rather to have included matters belonging exclusively to the civil branch than matters more particularly applicable to the penal the latter being but a means of compassing the ends proposed by the former in preference therefore or at least in priority to the several chapters which will be found relative to punishment it ought to have exhibited a set of propositions which have since presented themselves to him as affording a standard for the operations performed by government in the creation and distribution of proprietary and other civil rights he means certain axioms of what may be termed mental pathology expressive of the connection betwixt the feelings of the parties concerned and the several classes of incidents which either call for or are produced by operations of the nature above mentioned   the consideration of the division of offences and every thing else that belongs to offences ought besides to have preceded the consideration of punishment for the idea of punishment presupposes the idea of offence punishment as such not being inflicted but in consideration of offence  lastly the analytical discussions relative to the classification of offences would according to his present views be transferred to a separate treatise in which the system of legislation is considered solely in respect of its form in other words in respect of its method and terminology  in these respects the performance fails of coming up to the authors own ideas of what should have been exhibited in a work bearing the title he has now given it viz that of an introduction to the principles of morals and legislation he knows however of no other that would be less unsuitable nor in particular would so adequate an intimation of its actual contents have been given by a title corresponding to the more limited design with which it was written viz that of serving as an introduction to a penal code  yet more dry and tedious as a great part of the discussions it contains must unavoidably be found by the bulk of readers he knows not how to regret the having written them nor even the having made them public under every head the practical uses to which the discussions contained under that head appeared applicable are indicated nor is there he believes a single proposition that he has not found occasion to build upon in the penning of some article or other of those provisions of detail of which a body of law authoritative or unauthoritative must be composed he will venture to specify particularly in this view the several chapters shortly characterized by the words sensibility actions intentionality consciousness motives dispositions consequences even in the enormous chapter on the division of offenses which notwithstanding the forced compression the plan has undergone in several of its parts in manner there mentioned occupies no fewer than one hundred and four closely printed quarto pages  the ten concluding ones are employed in a statement of the practical advantages that may be reaped from the plan of classification which it exhibits those in whose sight the defence of usury has been fortunate enough to find favour may reckon as one instance of those advantages the discovery of the principles developed in that little treatise in the preface to an anonymous tract published so long ago as in       he had hinted at the utility of a natural classification of offenses in the character of a test for distinguishing genuine from spurious ones the case of usury is one among a number of instances of the truth of that observation a note at the end of sect xxxv chap xvi of the present publication may serve to show how the opinions developed in that tract owed their origin to the difficulty experienced in the attempt to find a place in his system for that imaginary offense to some readers as a means of helping them to support the fatigue of wading through an analysis of such enormous length he would almost recommend the beginning with those ten concluding pages  one good at least may result from the present publication viz that the more he has trespassed on the patience of the reader on this occasion the less need he will have so to do on future ones so that this may do to those the office which is done by books of pure mathematics to books of mixed mathematics and natural philosophy the narrower the circle of readers is within which the present work may be condemned to confine itself the less limited may be the number of those to whom the fruits of his succeeding labours may be found accessible he may therefore in this respect find himself in the condition of those philosophers of antiquity who are represented as having held two bodies of doctrine a popular and an occult one but with this difference that in his instance the occult and the popular will he hopes be found as consistent as in those they were contradictory and that in his production whatever there is of occultness has been the pure result of sad necessity and in no respect of choice  having in the course of this advertisement had such frequent occasion to allude to different arrangements as having been suggested by more extensive and maturer views it may perhaps contribute to the satisfaction of the reader to receive a short intimation of their nature the rather as without such explanation references made here and there to unpublished works might be productive of perplexity and mistake the following then are the titles of the works by the publication of which his present designs would be completed they are exhibited in the order which seemed to him best fitted for apprehension and in which they would stand disposed were the whole assemblage ready to come out at once but the order in which they will eventually appear may probably enough be influenced in some degree by collateral and temporary considerations  part the  st principles of legislation in matters of civil more distinctively termed private distributive or for shortness distributive law  part the  nd principles of legislation in matters of penal law  part the  rd principles of legislation in matters of procedure uniting in one view the criminal and civil branches between which no line can be drawn but a very indistinct one and that continually liable to variation  part the  th principles of legislation in matters of reward  part the  th principles of legislation in matters of public distributive more concisely as well as familiarly termed constitutional law  part the  th principles of legislation in matters of political tactics or of the art of maintaining order in the proceedings of political assemblies so as to direct them to the end of their institution viz by a system of rules which are to the constitutional branch in some respects what the law of procedure is to the civil and the penal  part the  th principles of legislation in matters betwixt nation and nation or to use a new though not inexpressive appellation in matters of international law  part the  th principles of legislation in matters of finance  part the  th principles of legislation in matters of political economy  part the  0th plan of a body of law complete in all its branches considered in respect of its form in other words in respect of its method and terminology including a view of the origination and connexion of the ideas expressed by the short list of terms the exposition of which contains all that can be said with propriety to belong to the head of universal jurisprudence   the use of the principles laid down under the above several heads is to prepare the way for the body of law itself exhibited in terminis and which to be complete with reference to any political state must consequently be calculated for the meridian and adapted to the circumstances of some one such state in particular  had he an unlimited power of drawing upon time and every other condition necessary it would be his wish to postpone the publication of each part to the completion of the whole in particular the use of the ten parts which exhibit what appear to him the dictates of utility in every line being no other than to furnish reasons for the several corresponding provisions contained in the body of law itself the exact truth of the former can never be precisely ascertained till the provisions to which they are destined to apply are themselves ascertained and that in terminis but as the infirmity of human nature renders all plans precarious in the execution in proportion as they are extensive in the design and as he has already made considerable advances in several branches of the theory without having made correspondent advances in the practical applications he deems it more than probable that the eventual order of publication will not correspond exactly with that which had it been equally practicable would have appeared most eligible of this irregularity the unavoidable result will be a multitude of imperfections which if the execution of the body of law in terminis had kept pace with the development of the principles so that each part had been adjusted and corrected by the other might have been avoided his conduct however will be the less swayed by this inconvenience from his suspecting it to be of the number of those in which the personal vanity of the author is much more concerned than the instruction of the public since whatever amendments may be suggested in the detail of the principles by the literal fixation of the provisions to which they are relative may easily be made in a corrected edition of the former succeeding upon the publication of the latter  in the course of the ensuing pages references will be found as already intimated some to the plan of a penal code to which this work was meant as an introduction some to other branches of the abovementioned general plan under titles somewhat different from those by which they have been mentioned here the giving this warning is all which it is in the authors power to do to save the reader from the perplexity of looking out for what has not as yet any existence the recollection of the change of plan will in like manner account for several similar incongruities not worth particularizing  allusion was made at the outset of this advertisement to some unspecified difficulties as the causes of the original suspension and unfinished complexion of the present work ashamed of his defeat and unable to dissemble it he knows not how to reface himself the benefit of such an apology as a slight sketch of the nature of those difficulties may afford  the discovery of them was produced by the attempt to solve the questions that will be found at the conclusion of the volume wherein consisted the identity and completeness of a law what the distinction and where the separation between a penal and a civil law what the distinction and where the separation between the penal and other branches of the law  to give a complete and correct answer to these questions it is but too evident that the relations and dependencies of every part of the legislative system with respect to every other must have been comprehended and ascertained but it is only upon a view of these parts themselves that such an operation could have been performed to the accuracy of such a survey one necessary condition would therefore be the complete existence of the fabric to be surveyed to the performance of this condition no example is as yet to be met with any where common law as it styles itself in england judiciary law as it might aptly be styled every where that fictitious composition which has no known person for its author no known assemblage of words for its substance forms every where the main body of the legal fabric like that fancied ether which in default of sensible matter fills up the measure of the universe shreds and scraps of real law stuck on upon that imaginary ground compose the furniture of every national code what follows—that he who for the purpose just mentioned or for any other wants an example of a complete body of law to refer to must begin with making one  there is or rather there ought to be a logic of the will as well as of the understanding the operations of the former faculty are neither less susceptible nor less worthy then those of the latter of being delineated by rules of these two branches of that recondite art aristotle saw only the latter succeeding logicians treading in the steps of their great founder have concurred in seeing with no other eyes yet so far as a difference can be assigned between branches so intimately connected whatever difference there is in point of importance is in favour of the logic of the will since it is only by their capacity of directing the operations of this faculty that the operations of the understanding are of any consequence  of this logic of the will the science of law considered in respect of its form is the most considerable branch—the most important application it is to the art of legislation what the science of anatomy is to the art of medicine with this difference that the subject of it is what the artist has to work with instead of being what he has to operate upon nor is the body politic less in danger from a want of acquaintance with the one science than the body natural from ignorance in the other one example amongst a thousand that might be adduced in proof of this assertion may be seen in the note which terminates this volume  such then were the difficulties such the preliminaries—an unexampled work to achieve and then a new science to create a new branch to add to one of the most abstruse of sciences  yet more a body of proposed law how complete soever would be comparatively useless and uninstructive unless explained and justified and that in every tittle by a continued accompaniment a perpetual commentary of reasons  which reasons that the comparative value of such as point in opposite directions may be estimated and the conjunct force of such as point in the same direction may be felt must be marshalled and put under subordination to such extensive and leading ones as are termed principles there must be therefore not one system only but two parallel and connected systems running on together the one of legislative provisions the other of political reasons each affording to the other correction and support  are enterprises like these achievable he knows not this only he knows that they have been undertaken proceeded in and that some progress has been made in all of them he will venture to add if at all achievable never at least by one to whom the fatigue of attending to discussions as arid as those which occupy the ensuing pages would either appear useless or feel intolerable he will repeat it boldly for it has been said before him truths that form the basis of political and moral science are not to be discovered but by investigations as severe as mathematical ones and beyond all comparison more intricate and extensive the familiarity of the terms is a presumption but is a most fallacious one of the facility of the matter truths in general have been called stubborn things the truths just mentioned are so in their own way they are not to be forced into detached and general propositions unincumbered with explanations and exceptions they will not compress themselves into epigrams they recoil from the tongue and the pen of the declaimer they flourish not in the same soil with sentiment they grow among thorns and are not to be plucked like daisies by infants as they run labour the inevitable lot of humanity is in no track more inevitable than here in vain would an alexander bespeak a peculiar road for royal vanity or a ptolemy a smoother one for royal indolence there is no kings road no stadtholders gate to legislative any more than to mathematic science  chapter i of the principle of utility i nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters pain and pleasure it is for them alone to point out what we ought to do as well as to determine what we shall do on the one hand the standard of right and wrong on the other the chain of causes and effects are fastened to their throne they govern us in all we do in all we say in all we think every effort we can make to throw off our subjection will serve but to demonstrate and confirm it in words a man may pretend to abjure their empire but in reality he will remain subject to it all the while the principle of utility  recognizes this subjection and assumes it for the foundation of that system the object of which is to rear the fabric of felicity by the hands of reason and of law systems which attempt to question it deal in sounds instead of sense in caprice instead of reason in darkness instead of light  but enough of metaphor and declamation it is not by such means that moral science is to be improved  ii the principle of utility is the foundation of the present work it will be proper therefore at the outset to give an explicit and determinate account of what is meant by it by the principle  of utility is meant that principle which approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever according to the tendency it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question or what is the same thing in other words to promote or to oppose that happiness i say of every action whatsoever and therefore not only of every action of a private individual but of every measure of government  iii by utility is meant that property in any object whereby it tends to produce benefit advantage pleasure good or happiness all this in the present case comes to the same thing or what comes again to the same thing to prevent the happening of mischief pain evil or unhappiness to the party whose interest is considered if that party be the community in general then the happiness of the community if a particular individual then the happiness of that individual  iv the interest of the community is one of the most general expressions that can occur in the phraseology of morals no wonder that the meaning of it is often lost when it has a meaning it is this the community is a fictitious body composed of the individual persons who are considered as constituting as it were its members the interest of the community then is what—the sum of the interests of the several members who compose it  v it is in vain to talk of the interest of the community without understanding what is the interest of the individual  a thing is said to promote the interest or to be for the interest of an individual when it tends to add to the sum total of his pleasures or what comes to the same thing to diminish the sum total of his pains  vi an action then may be said to be conformable to the principle of utility or for shortness sake to utility meaning with respect to the community at large when the tendency it has to augment the happiness of the community is greater than any it has to diminish it  vii a measure of government which is but a particular kind of action performed by a particular person or persons may be said to be conformable to or dictated by the principle of utility when in like manner the tendency which it has to augment the happiness of the community is greater than any which it has to diminish it  viii when an action or in particular a measure of government is supposed by a man to be conformable to the principle of utility it may be convenient for the purposes of discourse to imagine a kind of law or dictate called a law or dictate of utility and to speak of the action in question as being conformable to such law or dictate  ix a man may be said to be a partizan of the principle of utility when the approbation or disapprobation he annexes to any action or to any measure is determined by and proportioned to the tendency which he conceives it to have to augment or to diminish the happiness of the community or in other words to its conformity or unconformity to the laws or dictates of utility  x of an action that is conformable to the principle of utility one may always say either that it is one that ought to be done or at least that it is not one that ought not to be done one may say also that it is right it should be done at least that it is not wrong it should be done that it is a right action at least that it is not a wrong action when thus interpreted the words ought and right and wrong and others of that stamp have a meaning when otherwise they have none  xi has the rectitude of this principle been ever formally contested it should seem that it had by those who have not known what they have been meaning is it susceptible of any direct proof it should seem not for that which is used to prove every thing else cannot itself be proved a chain of proofs must have their commencement somewhere to give such proof is as impossible as it is needless  xii not that there is or ever has been that human creature at breathing however stupid or perverse who has not on many perhaps on most occasions of his life deferred to it by the natural constitution of the human frame on most occasions of their lives men in general embrace this principle without thinking of it if not for the ordering of their own actions yet for the trying of their own actions as well as of those of other men there have been at the same time not many perhaps even of the most intelligent who have been disposed to embrace it purely and without reserve there are even few who have not taken some occasion or other to quarrel with it either on account of their not understanding always how to apply it or on account of some prejudice or other which they were afraid to examine into or could not bear to part with for such is the stuff that man is made of in principle and in practice in a right track and in a wrong one the rarest of all human qualities is consistency  xiii when a man attempts to combat the principle of utility it is with reasons drawn without his being aware of it from that very principle itself  his arguments if they prove any thing prove not that the principle is wrong but that according to the applications he supposes to be made of it it is misapplied is it possible for a man to move the earth yes but he must first find out another earth to stand upon  xiv to disprove the propriety of it by arguments is impossible but from the causes that have been mentioned or from some confused or partial view of it a man may happen to be disposed not to relish it where this is the case if he thinks the settling of his opinions on such a subject worth the trouble let him take the following steps and at length perhaps he may come to reconcile himself to it    let him settle with himself whether he would wish to discard this principle altogether if so let him consider what it is that all his reasonings in matters of politics especially can amount to    if he would let him settle with himself whether he would judge and act without any principle or whether there is any other he would judge an act by    if there be let him examine and satisfy himself whether the principle he thinks he has found is really any separate intelligible principle or whether it be not a mere principle in words a kind of phrase which at bottom expresses neither more nor less than the mere averment of his own unfounded sentiments that is what in another person he might be apt to call caprice    if he is inclined to think that his own approbation or disapprobation annexed to the idea of an act without any regard to its consequences is a sufficient foundation for him to judge and act upon let him ask himself whether his sentiment is to be a standard of right and wrong with respect to every other man or whether every mans sentiment has the same privilege of being a standard to itself    in the first case let him ask himself whether his principle is not despotical and hostile to all the rest of human race    in the second case whether it is not anarchial and whether at this rate there are not as many different standards of right and wrong as there are men and whether even to the same man the same thing which is right today may not without the least change in its nature be wrong tomorrow and whether the same thing is not right and wrong in the same place at the same time and in either case whether all argument is not at an end and whether when two men have said i like this and i dont like it they can upon such a principle have any thing more to say    if he should have said to himself no for that the sentiment which he proposes as a standard must be grounded on reflection let him say on what particulars the reflection is to turn if on particulars having relation to the utility of the act then let him say whether this is not deserting his own principle and borrowing assistance from that very one in opposition to which he sets it up or if not on those particulars on what other particulars    if he should be for compounding the matter and adopting his own principle in part and the principle of utility in part let him say how far he will adopt it    when he has settled with himself where he will stop then let him ask himself how he justifies to himself the adopting it so far and why he will not adopt it any farther   0 admitting any other principle than the principle of utility to be a right principle a principle that it is right for a man to pursue admitting what is not true that the word right can have a meaning without reference to utility let him say whether there is any such thing as a motive that a man can have to pursue the dictates of it if there is let him say what that motive is and how it is to be distinguished from those which enforce the dictates of utility if not then lastly let him say what it is this other principle can be good for  chapter ii of principles adverse to that of utility   if the principle of utility be a right principle to be governed by and that in all cases it follows from what has been just observed that whatever principle differs from it in any case must necessarily be a wrong one to prove any other principle therefore to be a wrong one there needs no more than just to show it to be what it is a principle of which the dictates are in some point or other different from those of the principle of utility to state it is to confute it  ii a principle may be different from that of utility in two ways   by being constantly opposed to it this is the case with a principle which may be termed the principle of asceticism 0   by being sometimes opposed to it and sometimes not as it may happen this is the case with another which may be termed the principle of sympathy and antipathy  iii by the principle of asceticism i mean that principle which like the principle of utility approves or disapproves of any action according to the tendency which it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question but in an inverse manner approving of actions in as far as they tend to diminish his happiness disapproving of them in as far as they tend to augment it  iv it is evident that any one who reprobates any the least particle of pleasure as such from whatever source derived is pro tanto a partizan of the principle of asceticism it is only upon that principle and not from the principle of utility that the most abominable pleasure which the vilest of malefactors ever reaped from his crime would be to be reprobated if it stood alone the case is that it never does stand alone but is necessarily followed by such a quantity of pain or what comes to the same thing such a chance for a certain quantity of pain that the pleasure in comparison of it is as nothing and this is the true and sole but perfectly sufficient reason for making it a ground for punishment  v there are two classes of men of very different complexions by whom the principle of asceticism appears to have been embraced the one a set of moralists the other a set of religionists different accordingly have been the motives which appear to have recommended it to the notice of these different parties hope that is the prospect of pleasure seems to have animated the former hope the aliment of philosophic pride the hope of honour and reputation at the hands of men fear that is the prospect of pain the latter fear the offspring of superstitious fancy the fear of future punishment at the hands of a splenetic and revengeful deity i say in this case fear for of the invisible future fear is more powerful than hope these circumstances characterize the two different parties among the partisans of the principle of asceticism the parties and their motives different the principle the same  vi the religious party however appear to have carried it farther than the philosophical they have acted more consistently and less wisely the philosophical party have scarcely gone farther than to reprobate pleasure the religious party have frequently gone so far as to make it a matter of merit and of duty to court pain the philosophical party have hardly gone farther than the making pain a matter of indifference it is no evil they have said they have not said it is a good they have not so much as reprobated all pleasure in the lump they have discarded only what they have called the gross that is such as are organical or of which the origin is easily traced up to such as are organical they have even cherished and magnified the refined yet this however not under the name of pleasure to cleanse itself from the sordes of its impure original it was necessary it should change its name the honourable the glorious the reputable the becoming the honestum the decorum it was to be called in short any thing but pleasure  vii from these two sources have flowed the doctrines from which the sentiments of the bulk of mankind have all along received a tincture of this principle some from the philosophical some from the religious some from both men of education more frequently from the philosophical as more suited to the elevation of their sentiments the vulgar more frequently from the superstitious as more suited to the narrowness of their intellect undilated by knowledge and to the abjectness of their condition continually open to the attacks of fear the tinctures however derived from the two sources would naturally intermingle insomuch that a man would not always know by which of them he was most influenced and they would often serve to corroborate and enliven one another it was this conformity that made a kind of alliance between parties of a complexion otherwise so dissimilar and disposed them to unite upon various occasions against the common enemy the partizan of the principle of utility whom they joined in branding with the odious name of epicurean  viii the principle of asceticism however with whatever warmth it may have been embraced by its partizans as a rule of private conduct seems not to have been carried to any considerable length when applied to the business of government in a few instances it has been carried a little way by the philosophical party witness the spartan regimen though then perhaps it maybe considered as having been a measure of security and an application though a precipitate and perverse application of the principle of utility scarcely in any instances to any considerable length by the religious for the various monastic orders and the societies of the quakers dumplers moravians and other religionists have been free societies whose regimen no man has been astricted to without the intervention of his own consent whatever merit a man may have thought there would be in making himself miserable no such notion seems ever to have occurred to any of them that it may be a merit much less a duty to make others miserable although it should seem that if a certain quantity of misery were a thing so desirable it would not matter much whether it were brought by each man upon himself or by one man upon another it is true that from the same source from whence among the religionists the attachment to the principle of asceticism took its rise flowed other doctrines and practices from which misery in abundance was produced in one man by the instrumentality of another witness the holy wars and the persecutions for religion but the passion for producing misery in these cases proceeded upon some special ground the exercise of it was confined to persons of particular descriptions they were tormented not as men but as heretics and infidels to have inflicted the same miseries on their fellow believers and fellowsectaries would have been as blameable in the eyes even of these religionists as in those of a partizan of the principle of utility for a man to give himself a certain number of stripes was indeed meritorious but to give the same number of stripes to another man not consenting would have been a sin we read of saints who for the good of their souls and the mortification of their bodies have voluntarily yielded themselves a prey to vermin but though many persons of this class have wielded the reins of empire we read of none who have set themselves to work and made laws on purpose with a view of stocking the body politic with the breed of highwaymen housebreakers or incendiaries if at any time they have suffered the nation to be preyed upon by swarms of idle pensioners or useless placemen it has rather been from negligence and imbecility than from any settled plan for oppressing and plundering of the people if at any time they have sapped the sources of national wealth by cramping commerce and driving the inhabitants into emigration it has been with other views and in pursuit of other ends if they have declaimed against the pursuit of pleasure and the use of wealth they have commonly stopped at declamation they have not like lycurgus made express ordinances for the purpose of banishing the precious metals if they have established idleness by a law it has been not because idleness the mother of vice and misery is itself a virtue but because idleness say they is the road to holiness if under the notion of fasting they have joined in the plan of confining their subjects to a diet thought by some to be of the most nourishing and prolific nature it has been not for the sake of making them tributaries to the nations by whom that diet was to be supplied but for the sake of manifesting their own power and exercising the obedience of the people if they have established or suffered to be established punishments for the breach of celibacy they have done no more than comply with the petitions of those deluded rigorists who dupes to the ambitious and deeplaid policy of their rulers first laid themselves under that idle obligation by a vow  ix the principle of asceticism seems originally to have been the reverie of certain hasty speculators who having perceived or fancied that certain pleasures when reaped in certain circumstances have at the long run been attended with pains more than equivalent to them took occasion to quarrel with every thing that offered itself under the name of pleasure having then got thus far and having forgot the point which they set out from they pushed on and went so much further as to think it meritorious to fall in love with pain even this we see is at bottom but the principle of utility misapplied  x the principle of utility is capable of being consistently pursued and it is but tautology to say that the more consistently it is pursued the better it must ever be for humankind the principle of asceticism never was nor ever can be consistently pursued by any living creature let but one tenth part of the inhabitants of this earth pursue it consistently and in a days time they will have turned it into a hell  xi among principles adverse   to that of utility that which at this day seems to have most influence in matters of government is what may be called the principle of sympathy and antipathy by the principle of sympathy and antipathy i mean that principle which approves or disapproves of certain actions not on account of their tending to augment the happiness nor yet on account of their tending to diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question but merely because a man finds himself disposed to approve or disapprove of them holding up that approbation or disapprobation as a sufficient reason for itself and disclaiming the necessity of looking out for any extrinsic ground thus far in the general department of morals and in the particular department of politics measuring out the quantum as well as determining the ground of punishment by the degree of the disapprobation  xii it is manifest that this is rather a principle in name than in reality it is not a positive principle of itself so much as a term employed to signify the negation of all principle what one expects to find in a principle is something that points out some external consideration as a means of warranting and guiding the internal sentiments of approbation and disapprobation this expectation is but ill fulfilled by a proposition which does neither more nor less than hold up each of those sentiments as a ground and standard for itself  xiii in looking over the catalogue of human actions says a partizan of this principle in order to determine which of them are to be marked with the seal of disapprobation you need but to take counsel of your own feelings whatever you find in yourself a propensity to condemn is wrong for that very reason for the same reason it is also meet for punishment in what proportion it is adverse to utility or whether it be adverse to utility at all is a matter that makes no difference in that same proportion also is it meet for punishment if you hate much punish much if you hate little punish little punish as you hate if you hate not at all punish not at all the fine feelings of the soul are not to be overborne and tyrannized by the harsh and rugged dictates of political utility  xiv the various systems that have been formed concerning the standard of right may all be reduced to the principle of sympathy and antipathy one account may serve for all of them they consist all of them in so many contrivances for avoiding the obligation of appealing to any external standard and for prevailing upon the reader to accept of the authors sentiment or opinion as a reason for itself the phrases different but the principle the same    xv it is manifest that the dictates of this principle will frequently coincide with those of utility though perhaps without intending any such thing probably more frequently than not and hence it is that the business of penal justice is carried upon that tolerable sort of footing upon which we see it carried on in common at this day for what more natural or more general ground of hatred to a practice can there be than the mischievousness of such practice what all men are exposed to suffer by all men will be disposed to hate it is far yet however from being a constant ground for when a man suffers it is not always that he knows what it is he suffers by a man may suffer grievously for instance by a new tax without being able to trace up the cause of his sufferings to the injustice of some neighbour who has eluded the payment of an old one  xvi the principle of sympathy and antipathy is most apt to err on the side of severity it is for applying punishment in many cases which deserve none in many cases which deserve some it is for applying more than they deserve there is no incident imaginable be it ever so trivial and so remote from mischief from which this principle may not extract a ground of punishment any difference in taste any difference in opinion upon one subject as well as upon another no disagreement so trifling which perseverance and altercation will not render serious each becomes in the others eyes an enemy and if laws permit a criminal   this is one of the circumstances by which the human race is distinguished not much indeed to its advantage from the brute creation  xvii it is not however by any means unexampled for this principle to err on the side of lenity a near and perceptible mischief moves antipathy a remote and imperceptible mischief though not less real has no effect instances in proof of this will occur in numbers in the course of the work   it would be breaking in upon the order of it to give them here  xviii it may be wondered perhaps that in all this no mention has been made of the theological principle meaning that principal which professes to recur for the standard of right and wrong to the will of god but the case is this is not in fact a distinct principle it is never any thing more or less than one or other of the three beforementioned principles presenting itself under another shape the will of god here meant cannot be his revealed will as contained in the sacred writings for that is a system which nobody ever thinks of recurring to at this time of day for the details of political administration and even before it can be applied to the details of private conduct it is universally allowed by the most eminent divines of all persuasions to stand in need of pretty ample interpretations else to what use are the works of those divines and for the guidance of these interpretations it is also allowed that some other standard must be assumed the will then which is meant on this occasion is that which may be called the presumptive will that is to say that which is presumed to be his will by virtue of the conformity of its dictates to those of some other principle what then may be this other principle it must be one or other of the three mentioned above for there cannot as we have seen be any more it is plain therefore that setting revelation out of the question no light can ever be thrown upon the standard of right and wrong by any thing that can be said upon the question what is gods will we may be perfectly sure indeed that whatever is right is conformable to the will of god but so far is that from answering the purpose of showing us what is right that it is necessary to know first whether a thing is right in order to know from thence whether it be conformable to the will of god    xix there are two things which are very apt to be confounded but which it imports us carefully to distinguish—the motive or cause which by operating on the mind of an individual is productive of any act and the ground or reason which warrants a legislator or other bystander in regarding that act with an eye of approbation when the act happens in the particular instance in question to be productive of effects which we approve of much more if we happen to observe that the same motive may frequently be productive in other instances of the like effects we are apt to transfer our approbation to the motive itself and to assume as the just ground for the approbation we bestow on the act the circumstance of its originating from that motive it is in this way that the sentiment of antipathy has often been considered as a just ground of action antipathy for instance in such or such a case is the cause of an action which is attended with good effects but this does not make it a right ground of action in that case any more than in any other still farther not only the effects are good but the agent sees beforehand that they will be so this may make the action indeed a perfectly right action but it does not make antipathy a right ground of action for the same sentiment of antipathy if implicitly deferred to may be and very frequently is productive of the very worst effects antipathy therefore can never be a right ground of action no more therefore can resentment which as will be seen more particularly hereafter is but a modification of antipathy the only right ground of action that can possibly subsist is after all the consideration of utility which if it is a right principle of action and of approbation in any one case is so in every other other principles in abundance that is other motives may be the reasons why such and such an act has been done that is the reasons or causes of its being done but it is this alone that can be the reason why it might or ought to have been done antipathy or resentment requires always to be regulated to prevent its doing mischief to be regulated by what always by the principle of utility the principle of utility neither requires nor admits of any another regulator than itself  chapter iii of the four sanctions or sources of pain and pleasure i it has been shown that the happiness of the individuals of whom a community is composed that is their pleasures and their security is the end and the sole end which the legislator ought to have in view the sole standard in conformity to which each individual ought as far as depends upon the legislator to be made to fashion his behaviour but whether it be this or any thing else that is to be done there is nothing by which a man can ultimately be made to do it but either pain or pleasure having taken a general view of these two grand objects viz pleasure and what comes to the same thing immunity from pain in the character of final causes it will be necessary to take a view of pleasure and pain itself in the character of efficient causes or means  ii there are four distinguishable sources from which pleasure and pain are in use to flow considered separately they may be termed the physical the political the moral and the religious and inasmuch as the pleasures and pains belonging to each of them are capable of giving a binding force to any law or rule of conduct they may all of them termed sanctions    iii if it be in the present life and from the ordinary course of nature not purposely modified by the interposition of the will of any human being nor by any extraordinary interposition of any superior invisible being that the pleasure or the pain takes place or is expected it may be said to issue from or to belong to the physical sanction  iv if at the hands of a particular person or set of persons in the community who under names correspondent to that of judge are chosen for the particular purpose of dispensing it according to the will of the sovereign or supreme ruling power in the state it may be said to issue from the political sanction  v if at the hands of such chance persons in the community as the party in question may happen in the course of his life to have concerns with according to each mans spontaneous disposition and not according to any settled or concerted rule it may be said to issue from the moral or popular sanction    vi if from the immediate hand of a superior invisible being either in the present life or in a future it may be said to issue from the religious sanction  vii pleasures or pains which may be expected to issue from the physical political or moral sanctions must all of them be expected to be experienced if ever in the present life those which may be expected to issue from the religious sanction may be expected to be experienced either in the present life or in a future  viii those which can be experienced in the present life can of course be no others than such as human nature in the course of the present life is susceptible of and from each of these sources may flow all the pleasures or pains of which in the course of the present life human nature is susceptible with regard to these then with which alone we have in this place any concern those of them which belong to any one of those sanctions differ not ultimately in kind from those which belong to any one of the other three the only difference there is among them lies in the circumstances that accompany their production a suffering which befalls a man in the natural and spontaneous course of things shall be styled for instance a calamity in which case if it be supposed to befall him through any imprudence of his it may be styled a punishment issuing from the physical sanction now this same suffering if inflicted by the law will be what is commonly called a punishment if incurred for want of any friendly assistance which the misconduct or supposed misconduct of the sufferer has occasioned to be withholden a punishment issuing from the moral sanction if through the immediate interposition of a particular providence a punishment issuing from the religious sanction  ix a mans goods or his person are consumed by fire if this happened to him by what is called an accident it was a calamity if by reason of his own imprudence for instance from his neglecting to put his candle out it may be styled a punishment of the physical sanction if it happened to him by the sentence of the political magistrate a punishment belonging to the political sanction that is what is commonly called a punishment if for want of any assistance which his neighbour withheld from him out of some dislike to his moral character a punishment of the moral sanction if by an immediate act of gods displeasure manifested on account of some sin committed by him or through any distraction of mind occasioned by the dread of such displeasure a punishment of the religious sanction    x as to such of the pleasures and pains belonging to the religious sanction as regard a future life of what kind these may be we cannot know these lie not open to our observation during the present life they are matter only of expectation and whether that expectation be derived from natural or revealed religion the particular kind of pleasure or pain if it be different from all those which lie open to our observation is what we can have no idea of the best ideas we can obtain of such pains and pleasures are altogether unliquidated in point of quality in what other respects our ideas of them may be liquidated will be considered in another place    xi of these four sanctions the physical is altogether we may observe the groundwork of the political and the moral so is it also of the religious in as far as the latter bears relation to the present life it is included in each of those other three this may operate in any case that is any of the pains or pleasures belonging to it may operate independently of them none of them can operate but by means of this in a word the powers of nature may operate of themselves but neither the magistrate nor men at large can operate nor is god in the case in question supposed to operate but through the powers of nature  xii for these four objects which in their nature have so much in common it seemed of use to find a common name it seemed of use in the first place for the convenience of giving a name to certain pleasures and pains for which a name equally characteristic could hardly otherwise have been found in the second place for the sake of holding up the efficacy of certain moral forces the influence of which is apt not to be sufficiently attended to does the political sanction exert an influence over the conduct of mankind the moral the religious sanctions do so too in every inch of his career are the operations of the political magistrate liable to be aided or impeded by these two foreign powers who one or other of them or both are sure to be either his rivals or his allies does it happen to him to leave them out in his calculations he will be sure almost to find himself mistaken in the result of all this we shall find abundant proofs in the sequel of this work it behoves him therefore to have them continually before his eyes and that under such a name as exhibits the relation they bear to his own purposes and designs  chapter iv value of a lot of pleasure or pain how to be measured i pleasures then and the avoidance of pains are the ends that the legislator has in view it behoves him therefore to understand their value pleasures and pains are the instruments he has to work with it behoves him therefore to understand their force which is again in other words their value  ii to a person considered by himself the value of a pleasure or pain considered by itself will be greater or less according to the four following circumstances 0    its intensity   its duration   its certainty or uncertainty   its propinquity or remoteness iii these are the circumstances which are to be considered in estimating a pleasure or a pain considered each of them by itself but when the value of any pleasure or pain is considered for the purpose of estimating the tendency of any act by which it is produced there are two other circumstances to be taken into the account these are    its fecundity or the chance it has of being followed by sensations of the same kind that is pleasures if it be a pleasure pains if it be a pain   its purity or the chance it has of not being followed by sensations of the opposite kind that is pains if it be a pleasure pleasures if it be a pain these two last however are in strictness scarcely to be deemed properties of the pleasure or the pain itself they are not therefore in strictness to be taken into the account of the value of that pleasure or that pain they are in strictness to be deemed properties only of the act or other event by which such pleasure or pain has been produced and accordingly are only to be taken into the account of the tendency of such act or such event  iv to a number of persons with reference to each of whom to the value of a pleasure or a pain is considered it will be greater or less according to seven circumstances to wit the six preceding ones viz    its intensity   its duration   its certainty or uncertainty   its propinquity or remoteness   its fecundity   its purity and one other to wit    its extent that is the number of persons to whom it extends or in other words who are affected by it v to take an exact account then of the general tendency of any act by which the interests of a community are affected proceed as follows begin with any one person of those whose interests seem most immediately to be affected by it and take an account    of the value of each distinguishable pleasure which appears to be produced by it in the first instance    of the value of each pain which appears to be produced by it in the first instance    of the value of each pleasure which appears to be produced by it after the first this constitutes the fecundity of the first pleasure and the impurity of the first pain    of the value of each pain which appears to be produced by it after the first this constitutes the fecundity of the first pain and the impurity of the first pleasure    sum up all the values of all the pleasures on the one side and those of all the pains on the other the balance if it be on the side of pleasure will give the good tendency of the act upon the whole with respect to the interests of that individual person if on the side of pain the bad tendency of it upon the whole    take an account of the number of persons whose interests appear to be concerned and repeat the above process with respect to each sum up the numbers expressive of the degrees of good tendency which the act has with respect to each individual in regard to whom the tendency of it is good upon the whole do this again with respect to each individual in regard to whom the tendency of it is good upon the whole do this again with respect to each individual in regard to whom the tendency of it is bad upon the whole take the balance which if on the side of pleasure will give the general good tendency of the act with respect to the total number or community of individuals concerned if on the side of painthe general evil tendency with respect to the same community  vi it is not to be expected that this process should be strictly pursued previously to every moral judgment or to every legislative or judicial operation it may however be always kept in view and as near as the process actually pursued on these occasions approaches to it so near will such process approach to the character of an exact one  vii the same process is alike applicable to pleasure and pain in whatever shape they appear and by whatever denomination they are distinguished to pleasure whether it be called good which is properly the cause or instrument of pleasure or profit which is distant pleasure or the cause or instrument of distant pleasure or convenience or advantage benefit emolument happiness and so forth to pain whether it be called evil which corresponds to good or mischief or inconvenience or disadvantage or loss or unhappiness and so forth  viii nor is this a novel and unwarranted any more than it is a useless theory in all this there is nothing but what the practice of mankind wheresoever they have a clear view of their own interest is perfectly conformable to an article of property an estate in land for instance is valuable on what account on account of the pleasures of all kinds which it enables a man to produce and what comes to the same thing the pains of all kinds which it enables him to avert but the value of such an article of property is universally understood to rise or fall according to the length or shortness of the time which a man has in it the certainty or uncertainty of its coming into possession and the nearness or remoteness of the time at which if at all it is to come into possession as to the intensity of the pleasures which a man may derive from it this is never thought of because it depends upon the use which each particular person may come to make of it which cannot be estimated till the particular pleasures he may come to derive from it or the particular pains he may come to exclude by means of it are brought to view for the same reason neither does he think of the fecundity or purity of those pleasures  thus much for pleasure and pain happiness and unhappiness in general we come now to consider the several particular kinds of pain and pleasure  chapter v pleasures and pains their kinds i having represented what belongs to all sorts of pleasures and pains alike we come now to exhibit each by itself the several sorts of pains and pleasures pains and pleasures may be called by one general word interesting perceptions interesting perceptions are either simple or complex the simple ones are those which cannot any one of them be resolved into more complex are those which are resolvable into divers simple ones a complex interesting perception may accordingly be composed either   of pleasures alone   of pains alone or   of a pleasure or pleasures and a pain or pains together what determines a lot of pleasure for example to be regarded as one complex pleasure rather than as divers simple ones is the nature of the exciting cause whatever pleasures are excited all at once by the action of the same cause are apt to be looked upon as constituting all together but one pleasure  ii the several simple pleasures of which human nature is susceptible seem to be as follows   the pleasures of sense   the pleasures of wealth   the pleasures of skill   the pleasures of amity   the pleasures of a good name   the pleasures of power   the pleasures of piety   the pleasures of benevolence   the pleasures of malevolence  0 the pleasures of memory    the pleasures of imagination    the pleasures of expectation    the pleasures dependent on association    the pleasures of relief  iii the several simple pains seem to be as follows   the pains of privation   the pains of the senses   the pains of awkwardness   the pains of enmity   the pains of an ill name   the pains of piety   the pains of benevolence   the pains of malevolence   the pains of the memory  0 the pains of the imagination    the pains of expectation    the pains dependent on association    iv   the pleasures of sense seem to be as follows   the pleasures of the taste or palate including whatever pleasures are experienced in satisfying the appetites of hunger and thirst   the pleasure of intoxication   the pleasures of the organ of smelling   the pleasures of the touch   the simple pleasures of the ear independent of association   the simple pleasures of the eye independent of association   the pleasure of the sexual sense   the pleasure of health or the internal pleasureable feeling or flow of spirits as it is called which accompanies a state of full health and vigour especially at times of moderate bodily exertion   the pleasures of novelty or the pleasures derived from the gratification of the appetite of curiosity by the application of new objects to any of the senses    v   by the pleasures of wealth may be meant those pleasures which a man is apt to derive from the consciousness of possessing any article or articles which stand in the list of instruments of enjoyment or security and more particularly at the time of his first acquiring them at which time the pleasure may be styled a pleasure of gain or a pleasure of acquisition at other times a pleasure of possession    the pleasures of skill as exercised upon particular objects are those which accompany the application of such particular instruments of enjoyment to their uses as cannot be so applied without a greater or less share of difficulty or exertion    vi   the pleasures of amity or selfrecommendation are the pleasures that may accompany the persuasion of a mans being in the acquisition or the possession of the goodwill of such or such assignable person or persons in particular or as the phrase is of being upon good terms with him or them and as a fruit of it of his being in a way to have the benefit of their spontaneous and gratuitous services  vii   the pleasures of a good name are the pleasures that accompany the persuasion of a mans being in the acquisition or the possession of the goodwill of the world about him that is of such members of society as he is likely to have concerns with and as a means of it either their love or their esteem or both and as a fruit of it of his being in the way to have the benefit of their spontaneous and gratuitous services these may likewise be called the pleasures of good repute the pleasures of honour or the pleasures of the moral sanction    viii   the pleasures of power are the pleasures that accompany the persuasion of a mans being in a condition to dispose people by means of their hopes and fears to give him the benefit of their services that is by the hope of some service or by the fear of some disservice that he may be in the way to render them  ix   the pleasures of piety are the pleasures that accompany the belief of a mans being in the acquisition or in possession of the goodwill or favour of the supreme being and as a fruit of it of his being in a way of enjoying pleasures to be received by gods special appointment either in this life or in a life to come these may also be called the pleasures of religion the pleasures of a religious disposition or the pleasures of the religious sanction    x   the pleasures of benevolence are the pleasures resulting from the view of any pleasures supposed to be possessed by the beings who may be the objects of benevolence to wit the sensitive beings we are acquainted with under which are commonly included   the supreme being   human beings   other animals these may also be called the pleasures of goodwill the pleasures of sympathy or the pleasures of the benevolent or social affections  xi   the pleasures of malevolence are the pleasures resulting from the view of any pain supposed to be suffered by the beings who may become the objects of malevolence to wit   human beings   other animals these may also be styled the pleasures of illwill the pleasures of the irascible appetite the pleasures of antipathy or the pleasures of the malevolent or dissocial affections  xii  0 the pleasures of the memory are the pleasures which after having enjoyed such and such pleasures or even in some case after having suffered such and such pains a man will now and then experience at recollecting them exactly in the order and in the circumstances in which they were actually enjoyed or suffered these derivative pleasures may of course be distinguished into as many species as there are of original perceptions from whence they may be copied they may also be styled pleasures of simple recollection  xiii    the pleasures of the imagination are the pleasures which may be derived from the contemplation of any such pleasures as may happen to be suggested by the memory but in a different order and accompanied by different groups of circumstances these may accordingly be referred to any one of the three cardinal points of time present past or future it is evident they may admit of as many distinctions as those of the former class  xiv    the pleasures of expectation are the pleasures that result from the contemplation of any sort of pleasure referred to time future and accompanied with the sentiment of belief these also may admit of the same distinctions    xv    the pleasures of association are the pleasures which certain objects or incidents may happen to afford not of themselves but merely in virtue of some association they have contracted in the mind with certain objects or incidents which are in themselves pleasurable such is the case for instance with the pleasure of skill when afforded by such a set of incidents as compose a game of chess this derives its pleasurable quality from its association partly with the pleasures of skill as exercised in the production of incidents pleasurable of themselves partly from its association with the pleasures of power such is the case also with the pleasure of good luck when afforded by such incidents as compose the game of hazard or any other game of chance when played at for nothing this derives its pleasurable quality from its association with one of the pleasures of wealth to wit with the pleasure of acquiring it  xvi    farther on we shall see pains grounded upon pleasures in like manner may we now see pleasures grounded upon pains to the catalogue of pleasures may accordingly be added the pleasures of relief or the pleasures which a man experiences when after he has been enduring a pain of any kind for a certain time it comes to cease or to abate these may of course be distinguished into as many species as there are of pains and may give rise to so many pleasures of memory of imagination and of expectation  xvii   pains of privation are the pains that may result from the thought of not possessing in the time present any of the several kinds of pleasures pains of privation may accordingly be resolved into as many kinds as there are of pleasures to which they may correspond and from the absence whereof they may be derived  xviii there are three sorts of pains which are only so many modifications of the several pains of privation when the enjoyment of any particular pleasure happens to be particularly desired but without any expectation approaching to assurance the pain of privation which thereupon results takes a particular name and is called the pain of desire or of unsatisfied desire  xix where the enjoyment happens to have been looked for with a degree of expectation approaching to assurance and that expectation is made suddenly to cease it is called a pain of disappointment  xx a pain of privation takes the name of a pain of regret in two cases   where it is grounded on the memory of a pleasure which having been once enjoyed appears not likely to be enjoyed again   where it is grounded on the idea of a pleasure which was never actually enjoyed nor perhaps so much as expectedbut which might have been enjoyed it is supposed had such or such a contingency happened which in fact did not happen  xxi   the several pains of the senses seem to be as follows   the pains of hunger and thirst or the disagreeable sensations produced by the want of suitable substances which need at times to be applied to the alimentary canal   the pains of the taste or the disagreeable sensations produced by the application of various substances to the palate and other superior parts of the same canal   the pains of the organ of smell or the disagreeable sensations produced by the effluvia of various substances when applied to that organ   the pains of the touch or the disagreeable sensations produced by the application of various substances to the skin   the simple pains of the hearing or the disagreeable sensations excited in the organ of that sense by various kinds of sounds independently as before of association   the simple pains of the sight or the disagreeable sensations if any such there be that may be excited in the organ of that sense by visible images independent of the principle of association     the pains resulting from excessive heat or cold unless these be referable to the touch   the pains of disease or the acute and uneasy sensations resulting from the several diseases and indispositions to which human nature is liable   the pain of exertion whether bodily or mental or the uneasy sensation which is apt to accompany any intense effort whether of mind or body  xxii     the pains of awkwardness are the pains which sometimes result from the unsuccessful endeavour to apply any particular instruments of enjoyment or security to their uses or from the difficulty a man experiences in applying them    xxiii   the pains of enmity are the pains that may accompany the persuasion of a mans being obnoxious to the illwill of such or such an assignable person or persons in particular or as the phrase is of being upon ill terms with him or them and in consequence of being obnoxious to certain pains of some sort or other of which he may be the cause  xxiv   the pains of an illname are the pains that accompany the persuasion of a mans being obnoxious or in a way to be obnoxious to the illwill of the world about him these may likewise be called the pains of illrepute the pains of dishonour or the pains of the moral sanction 0  xxv     the pains of piety are the pains that accompany the belief of a mans being obnoxious to the displeasure of the supreme being and in consequence to certain pains to be inflicted by his especial appointment either in this life or in a life to come these may also be called the pains of religion the pains of a religious disposition or the pains of the religious sanction when the belief is looked upon as wellgrounded these pains are commonly called religious terrors when looked upon as illgrounded superstitious terrors    xxvi   the pains of benevolence are the pains resulting from the view of any pains supposed to be endured by other beings these may also be called the pains of goodwill of sympathy or the pains of the benevolent or social affections  xxvii   the pains of malevolence are the pains resulting from the view of any pleasures supposed to be enjoyed by any beings who happen to be the objects of a mans displeasure these may also be styled the pains of illwill of antipathy or the pains of the malevolent or dissocial affections  xxviii   the pains of the memory may be grounded on every one of the above kinds as well of pains of privation as of positive pains these correspond exactly to the pleasures of the memory  xxix  0 the pains of the imagination may also be grounded on any one of the above kinds as well of pains of privation as of positive pains in other respects they correspond exactly to the pleasures of the imagination  xxx    the pains of expectation may be grounded on each one of the above kinds as well of pains of privation as of positive pains these may be also termed pains of apprehension    xxxi    the pains of association correspond exactly to the pleasures of association  xxxii of the above list there are certain pleasures and pains which suppose the existence of some pleasure or pain of some other person to which the pleasure or pain of the person in question has regard such pleasures and pains may be termed extraregarding others do not suppose any such thing these may be termed selfregarding   the only pleasures and pains of the extraregarding class are those of benevolence and those of malevolence all the rest   are selfregarding  xxxiii of all these several sorts of pleasures and pains there is scarce any one which is not liable on more accounts than one to come under the consideration of the law is an offense committed it is the tendency which it has to destroy in such or such persons some of these pleasures or to produce some of these pains that constitutes the mischief of it and the ground for punishing it it is the prospect of some of these pleasures or of security from some of these pains that constitutes the motive or temptation it is the attainment of them that constitutes the profit of the offense is the offender to be punished it can be only by the production of one or more of these pains that the punishment can be inflicted    chapter vi of circumstances influencing sensibility i pain and pleasure are produced in mens minds by the action of certain causes but the quantity of pleasure and pain runs not uniformly in proportion to the cause in other words to the quantity of force exerted by such cause the truth of this observation rests not upon any metaphysical nicety in the import given to the terms cause quantity and force it will be equally true in whatsoever manner such force be measured  ii the disposition which any one has to feel such or such a quantity of pleasure or pain upon the application of a cause of given force is what we term the degree or quantum of his sensibility this may be either general referring to the sum of the causes that act upon him during a given period or particular referring to the action of any one particular cause or sort of cause  iii but in the same mind such and such causes of pain or pleasure will produce more pain or pleasure than such or such other causes of pain or pleasure and this proportion will in different minds be different the disposition which any one has to have the proportion in which he is affected by two such causes different from that in which another man is affected by the same two causes may be termed the quality or bias of his sensibility one man for instance may be most affected by the pleasures of the taste another by those of the ear so also if there be a difference in the nature or proportion of two pains or pleasures which they respectively experience from the same cause a case not so frequent as the former from the same injury for instance one man may feel the same quantity of grief and resentment together as another man but one of them shall feel a greater share of grief than of resentment the other a greater share of resentment than of grief  iv any incident which serves as a cause either of pleasure or of pain may be termed an exciting cause if of pleasure a pleasurable cause if of pain a painful afflictive or dolorific cause    v now the quantity of pleasure or of pain which a man is liable to experience upon the application of an exciting cause since they will not depend altogether upon that cause will depend in some measure upon some other circumstance or circumstances these circumstances whatsoever they be maybe termed circumstances influencing sensibility    vi these circumstances will apply differently to different exciting causes insomuch that to a certain exciting cause a certain circumstance shall not apply at all which shall apply with great force to another exciting cause but without entering for the present into these distinctions it may be of use to sum up all the circumstances which can be found to influence the effect of any exciting cause these as on a former occasion it may be as well first to sum up together in the concisest manner possible and afterwards to allot a few words to the separate

are among the symptoms of disease a man may be said to be in a state of health when he is not conscious of any uneasy sensations the primary seat of which can be perceived to be anywhere in his body 0 in point of of general sensibility a man who is under the pressure of any bodily indisposition or as the phrase is is in an ill state of health is less sensible to the influence of any pleasurable cause and more so to that of any afflictive one than if he were well  viii   the circumstance of strength though in point of causality closely connected with that of health is perfectly distinguishable from it the same man will indeed generally be stronger in a good state of health than in a bad one but one man even in a bad state of health may be stronger than another even in a good one weakness is a common concomitant of disease but in consequence of his radical frame of body a man may be weak all his life long without experiencing any disease health as we have observed is principally a negative circumstance strength a positive one the degree of a mans strength can be measured with tolerable accuracy    ix   hardiness is a circumstance which though closely connected with that of strength is distinguishable from it hardiness is the absence of irritability irritability respects either pain resulting from the action of mechanical causes or disease resulting from the action of causes purely physiological irritability in the former sense is the disposition to undergo a greater or less degree of pain upon the application of a mechanical cause such as are most of those applications by which simple afflictive punishments are inflicted as whipping beating and the like in the latter sense it is the disposition to contract disease with greater or less facility upon the application of any instrument acting on the body by its physiological properties as in the case of fevers or of colds or other inflammatory diseases produced by the application of damp air or to experience immediate uneasiness as in the case of relaxation or chilliness produced by an over or under proportion of the matter of heat  hardiness even in the sense in which it is opposed to the action of mechanical causes is distinguishable from strength the external indications of strength are the abundance and firmness of the muscular fibres those of hardiness in this sense are the firmness of the muscular fibres and the callosity of the skin strength is more peculiarly the gift of nature hardiness of education of two persons who have had the one the education of a gentleman the other that of a common sailor the first may be the stronger at the same time that the other is the hardier  x   by bodily imperfection may be understood that condition which a person is in who either stands distinguished by any remarkable deformity or wants any of those parts or faculties which the ordinary run of persons of the same sex and age are furnished with who for instance has a harelip is deaf or has lost a hand this circumstance like that of illhealth tends in general to diminish more or less the effect of any pleasurable circumstance and to increase that of any afflictive one the effect of this circumstance however admits of great variety inasmuch as there are a great variety of ways in which a man may suffer in his personal appearance and in his bodily organs and faculties all which differences will be taken notice of in their proper places    xi   so much for circumstances belonging to the condition of the body we come now to those which concern the condition of the mind the use of mentioning these will be seen hereafter in the first place may be reckoned the quantity and quality of the knowledge the person in question happens to possess that is of the ideas which he has actually in store ready upon occasion to call to mind meaning such ideas as are in some way or other of an interesting nature that is of a nature in some way or other to influence his happiness or that of other men when these ideas are many and of importance a man is said to be a man of knowledge when few or not of importance ignorant  xii   by strength of intellectual powers may be understood the degree of facility which a man experiences in his endeavours to call to mind as well such ideas as have been already aggregated to his stock of knowledge as any others which upon any occasion that may happen he may conceive a desire to place there it seems to be on some such occasion as this that the words parts and talents are commonly employed to this head may be referred the several qualities of readiness of apprehension accuracy and tenacity of memory strength of attention clearness of discernment amplitude of comprehension vividity and rapidity of imagination strength of intellectual powers in general seems to correspond pretty exactly to general strength of body as any of these qualities in particular does to particular strength  xiii   firmness of mind on the one hand and irritability on the other regard the proportion between the degrees of efficacy with which a man is acted upon by an exciting cause of which the value lies chiefly in magnitude and one of which the value lies chiefly in propinquity   a man may be said to be of a firm mind when small pleasures or pains which are present or near do not affect him in a greater proportion to their value than greater pleasures or pains which are uncertain or remote   of an irritable mind when the contrary is the case  xiv   steadiness regards the time during which a given exciting cause of a given value continues to affect a man in nearly the same manner and degree as at first no assignable external event or change of circumstances intervening to make an alteration in its force    xv   by the bent of a mans inclinations may be understood the propensity he has to expect pleasure or pain from certain objects rather than from others a mans inclinations may be said to have such or such a bent when amongst the several sorts of objects which afford pleasure in some degree to all men he is apt to expect more pleasure from one particular sort than from another particular sort or more from any given particular sort than another man would expect from that sort or when amongst the several sorts of objects which to one man afford pleasure whilst to another they afford none he is apt to expect or not to expect pleasure from an object of such or such a sort so also with regard to pains this circumstance though intimately connected with that of the bias of a mans sensibility is not undistinguishable from it the quantity of pleasure or pain which on any given occasion a man may experience from an application of any sort may be greatly influenced by the expectations he has been used to entertain of pleasure or pain from that quarter but it will not be absolutely determined by them for pleasure or pain may come upon him from a quarter from which he was not accustomed to expect it  xvi  0 the circumstances of moral religious sympathetic and antipathetic sensibility when closely considered will appear to be included in some sort under that of bent of inclination on account of their particular importance they may however be worth mentioning apart a mans moral sensibility may be said to be strong when the pains and pleasures of the moral sanction   show greater in his eyes in comparison with other pleasures and pains and consequently exert a stronger influence than in the eyes of the persons he is compared with in other words when he is acted on with more than ordinary efficacy by the sense of honour it may be said to be weak when the contrary is the case  xvii    moral sensibility seems to regard the average effect or influence of the pains and pleasures of the moral sanction upon all sorts of occasions to which it is applicable or happens to be applied it regards the average force or quantity of the impulses the mind receives from that source during a given period moral bias regards the particular acts on which upon so many particular occasions the force of that sanction is looked upon as attaching it regards the quality or direction of those impulses it admits of as many varieties therefore as there are dictates which the moral sanction may be conceived to issue forth a man may be said to have such or such a moral bias or to have a moral bias in favour of such or such an action when he looks upon it as being of the number of those of which the performance is dictated by the moral sanction  xviii    what has been said with regard to moral sensibility may be applied mutatis mutandis to religious  xix    what has been said with regard to moral biases may also be applied mutatis mutandis to religious biases  xx    by sympathetic sensibility is to be understood the propensity that a man has to derive pleasure from the happiness and pain from the unhappiness of other sensitive beings it is the stronger the greater the ratio of the pleasure or pain he feels on their account is to that of the pleasure or pain which according to what appears to him they feel for themselves  xxi    sympathetic bias regards the description of the parties who are the objects of a mans sympathy and of the acts or other circumstances of or belonging to those persons by which the sympathy is excited these parties may be   certain individuals   any subordinate class of individuals   the whole nation   human kind in general   the whole sensitive creation according as these objects of sympathy are more numerous the affection by which the man is biased may be said to be the more enlarged  xxii       antipathetic sensibility and antipathetic biases are just the reverse of sympathetic sensibility and sympathetic biases by antipathetic sensibility is to be understood the propensity that a man has to derive pain from the happiness and pleasure from the unhappiness of other sensitive beings  xxiii    the circumstance of insanity of mind corresponds to that of bodily imperfection it admits however of much less variety inasmuch as the soul is for aught we can perceive one indivisible thing not distinguishable like the body into parts what lesser degrees of imperfection the mind may be susceptible of seem to be comprisable under the alreadymentioned heads of ignorance weakness of mind irritability or unsteadiness or under such others as are reducible to them those which are here in view are those extraordinary species and degrees of mental imperfection which wherever they take place are as conspicuous and as unquestionable as lameness or blindness in the body operating partly it should seem by inducing an extraordinary degree of the imperfections above mentioned partly by giving an extraordinary and preposterous bent to the inclinations  xxiv    under the head of a mans habitual occupations are to be understood on this occasion as well those which he pursues for the sake of profit as those which he pursues for the sake of present pleasure the consideration of the profit itself belongs to the head of a mans pecuniary circumstances it is evident that if by any means a punishment or any other exciting cause has the effect of putting it out of his power to continue in the pursuit of any such occupation it must on that account be much the more distressing a mans habitual occupations though intimately connected in point of causality with the bent of his inclinations are not to be looked upon as precisely the same circumstance an amusement or channel of profit may be the object of a mans inclinations which has never been the subject of his habitual occupations for it may be that though he wished to betake himself to it he never did it not being in his power a circumstance which may make a good deal of difference in the effect of any incident by which he happens to be debarred from it  xxv  0 under the head of pecuniary circumstances i mean to bring to view the proportion which a mans means bear to his wants the sum total of his means of every kind to the sum total of his wants of every kind a mans means depend upon three circumstances   his property   the profit of his labour   his connexions in the way of support his wants seem to depend upon four circumstances   his habits of expense   his connexions in the way of burthen   any present casual demand he may have   the strength of his expectation by a mans property is to be understood whatever he has in store independent of his labour by the profit of his labour is to be understood the growing profit as to labour it may be either of the body principally or of the mind principally or of both indifferently nor does it matter in what manner nor on what subject it be applied so it produce a profit by a mans connexions in the way of support are to be understood the pecuniary assistances of whatever kind which he is in a way of receiving from any persons who on whatever account and in whatever proportion he has reason to expect should contribute gratis to his maintenance such as his parents patrons and relations it seems manifest that a man can have no other means than these what he uses he must have either of his own or from other people if from other people either gratis or for a price as to habits of expense it is well known that a mans desires are governed in a great degree by his habits many are the cases in which desire and consequently the pain of privation connected with it   would not even subsist at all but for previous enjoyment by a mans connexions in the way of burthen are to be understood whatever expense he has reason to look upon himself as bound to be at in the support of those who by law or the customs of the world are warranted in looking up to him for assistance such as children poor relations superannuated servants and any other dependents whatsoever as to present casual demand it is manifest that there are occasions on which a given sum will be worth infinitely more to a man than the same sum would at another time where for example in a case of extremity a man stands in need of extraordinary medical assistance or wants money to carry on a lawsuit on which his all depends or has got a livelihood waiting for him in a distant country and wants money for the charges of conveyance in such cases any piece of good or ill fortune in the pecuniary way might have a very different effect from what it would have at any other time with regard to strength of expectation when one man expects to gain or to keep a thing which another does not it is plain the circumstance of not having it will affect the former very differently from the latter who indeed commonly will not be affected by it at all  xxvi    under the head of a mans connexions in the way of sympathy i would bring to view the number and description of the persons in whose welfare he takes such a concern as that the idea of their happiness should be productive of pleasure and that of their unhappiness of pain to him for instance a mans wife his children his parents his near relations and intimate friends this class of persons it is obvious will for the most part include the two classes by which his pecuniary circumstances are affected those to wit from whose means he may expect support and those whose wants operate on him as a burthen but it is obvious that besides these it may very well include others with whom he has no such pecuniary connexion and even with regard to these it is evident that the pecuniary dependence and the union of affections are circumstances perfectly distinguishable accordingly the connexions here in question independently of any influence they may have on a mans pecuniary circumstances have an influence on the effect of any exciting causes whatsoever the tendency of them is to increase a mans general sensibility to increase on the one hand the pleasure produced by all pleasurable causes on the other the pain produced by all afflictive ones when any pleasurable incident happens to a man he naturally in the first moment thinks of the pleasure it will afford immediately to himself presently afterwards however except in a few cases which is not worth while here to insist on he begins to think of the pleasure which his friends will feel upon their coming to know of it and this secondary pleasure is commonly no mean addition to the primary one first comes the selfregarding pleasure then comes the idea of the pleasure of sympathy which you suppose that pleasure of yours will give birth to in the bosom of your friend and this idea excites again in yours a new pleasure of sympathy grounded upon his the first pleasure issuing from your own bosom as it were from a radiant point illuminates the bosom of your friend reverberated from thence it is reflected with augmented warmth to the point from whence it first proceeded and so it is with pains    nor does this effect depend wholly upon affection among near relations although there should be no kindness the pleasures and pains of the moral sanction are quickly propagated by a peculiar kind of sympathy no article either of honour or disgrace can well fall upon a man without extending to a certain distance within the circle of his family what reflects honour upon the father reflects honour upon the son what reflects disgrace disgrace the cause of this singular and seemingly unreasonable circumstance that is its analogy to the rest of the phenomena of the human mind belongs not to the present purpose it is sufficient if the effect be beyond dispute  xxvii    of a mans connexions in the way of antipathy there needs not any thing very particular to be observed happily there is no primeval and constant source of antipathy in a human nature as there is of sympathy there are no permanent sets of persons who are naturally and of course the objects of antipathy to a man as there are who are the objects of the contrary affection sources however but too many of antipathy are apt to spring up upon various occasions during the course of a mans life and whenever they do this circumstance may have a very considerable influence on the effects of various exciting causes as on the one hand a punishment for instance which tends to separate a man from those with whom he is connected in the way of sympathy so on the other hand one which tends to force him into the company of those with whom he is connected in the way of antipathy will on that account be so much the more distressing it is to be observed that sympathy itself multiplies the sources of antipathy sympathy for your friend gives birth to antipathy on your part against all those who are objects of antipathy as well as to sympathy for those who are objects of sympathy to him in the same manner does antipathy multiply the sources of sympathy though commonly perhaps with rather a less degree of efficacy antipathy against your enemy is apt to give birth to sympathy on your part towards those who are objects of antipathy as well as to antipathy against those who are objects of sympathy to him  xxviii    thus much for the circumstances by which the effect of any exciting cause may be influenced when applied upon any given occasion at any given period but besides these supervening incidents there are other circumstances relative to a man that may have their influence and which are coeval to his birth in the first place it seems to be universally agreed that in the original frame or texture of every mans body there is a something which independently of all subsequently intervening circumstances renders him liable to be affected by causes producing bodily pleasure or pain in a manner different from that in which another man would be affected by the same causes to the catalogue of circumstances influencing a mans sensibility we may therefore add his original or radical frame texture constitution or temperament of body  xxix    in the next place it seems to be pretty well agreed that there is something also in the original frame or texture of every mans mind which independently of all exterior and subsequently intervening circumstances and even of his radical frame of body makes him liable to be differently affected by the same exciting causes from what another man would be to the catalogue of circumstances influencing a mans sensibility we may therefore further add his original or radical frame texture constitution or temperament of mind    xxx it seems pretty certain all this while that a mans sensibility to causes producing pleasure or pain even of mind may depend in a considerable degree upon his original and acquired frame of body but we have no reason to think that it can depend altogether upon that frame since on the one hand we see persons whose frame of body is as much alike as can be conceived differing very considerably in respect of their mental frame and on the other hand persons whose frame of mind is as much alike as can be conceived differing very conspicuously in regard to their bodily frame 0  xxxi it seems indisputable also that the different sets of a external occurrences that may befall a man in the course of his life will make great differences in the subsequent texture of his mind at any given period yet still those differences are not solely to be attributed to such occurrences equally far from the truth seems that opinion to be if any such be maintained which attributes all to nature and that which attributes all to education the two circumstances will therefore still remain distinct as well from one another as from all others  xxxii distinct however as they are it is manifest that at no period in the active part of a mans life can they either of them make their appearance by themselves all they do is to constitute the latent groundwork which the other supervening circumstances have to work upon and whatever influence those original principles may have is so changed and modified and covered over as it were by those other circumstances as never to be separately discernible the effects of the one influence are indistinguishably blended with those of the other  xxxiii the emotions of the body are received and with reason as probable indications of the temperature of the mind but they are far enough from conclusive a man may exhibit for instance the exterior appearances of grief without really grieving at all or at least in any thing near the proportion in which he appears to grieve oliver cromwell whose conduct indicated a heart more than ordinarily callous was as remarkably profuse in tears   many men can command the external appearances of sensibility with very little real feeling   the female sex commonly with greater facility than the male hence the proverbial expression of a womans tears to have this kind of command over ones self was the characteristic excellence of the orator of ancient times and is still that of the player in our own  xxxiv the remaining circumstances may with reference to those already mentioned be termed secondary influencing circumstances these have an influence it is true on the quantum or bias of a mans sensibility but it is only by means of the other primary ones the manner in which these two sets of circumstances are concerned is such that the primary ones do the business while the secondary ones lie most open to observation the secondary ones therefore are those which are most heard of on which account it will be necessary to take notice of them at the same time that it is only by means of the primary ones that their influence can be explained whereas the influence of the primary ones will be apparent enough without any mention of the secondary ones  xxxv    among such of the primitive modifications of the corporeal frame as may appear to influence the quantum and bias of sensibility the most obvious and conspicuous are those which constitute the sex in point of quantity the sensibility of the female sex appears in general to be greater than that of the male the health of the female is more delicate than that of the male in point of strength and hardiness of body in point of quantity and quality of knowledge in point of strength of intellectual powers and firmness of mind she is commonly inferior moral religious sympathetic and antipathetic sensibility are commonly stronger in her than in the male the quality of her knowledge and the bent of her inclinations are commonly in many respects different her moral biases are also in certain respects remarkably different chastity modesty and delicacy for instance are prized more than courage in a woman courage more than any of those qualities in a man the religious biases in the two sexes are not apt to be remarkably different except that the female is rather more inclined than the male to superstition that is to observances not dictated by the principle of utility a difference that may be pretty well accounted for by some of the beforementioned circumstances her sympathetic biases are in many respects different for her own offspring all their lives long and for children in general while young her affection is commonly stronger than that of the male her affections are apt to be less enlarged seldom expanding themselves so much as to take in the welfare of her country in general much less that of mankind or the whole sensitive creation seldom embracing any extensive class or division even of her own countrymen unless it be in virtue of her sympathy for some particular individuals that belong to it in general her antipathetic as well as sympathetic biases are apt to be less conformable to the principle of utility than those of the male owing chiefly to some deficiency in point of knowledge discernment and comprehension her habitual occupations of the amusing kind are apt to be in many respects different from those of the male with regard to her connexions in the way of sympathy there can be no difference in point of pecuniary circumstances according to the customs of perhaps all countries she is in general less independent  xxxvi    age is of course divided into divers periods of which the number and limits are by no means uniformly ascertained one might distinguish it for the present purpose into   infancy   adolescence   youth   maturity   decline   decrepitude it were lost time to stop on the present occasion to examine it at each period and to observe the indications it gives with respect to the several primary circumstances just reviewed infancy and decrepitude are commonly inferior to the other periods in point of health strength hardiness and so forth in infancy on the part of the female the imperfections of that sex are enhanced on the part of the male imperfections take place mostly similar in quality but greater in quantity to those attending the states of adolescence youth and maturity in the female in the stage of decrepitude both sexes relapse into many of the imperfections of infancy the generality of these observations may easily be corrected upon a particular review  xxxvii    station or rank in life is a circumstance that among a civilized people will commonly undergo a multiplicity of variations cæteris paribus the quantum of sensibility appears to be greater in the higher ranks of men than in the lower the primary circumstances in respect of which this secondary circumstance is apt to induce or indicate a difference seem principally to be as follows   quantity and quality of knowledge   strength of mind   bent of inclination   moral sensibility   moral biases   religious sensibility   religious biases   sympathetic sensibility   sympathetic biases  0 antipathetic sensibility    antipathetic biases    habitual occupations    nature and productiveness of a mans means of livelihood    connexions importing profit    habit of expense    connexions importing burthen a man of a certain rank will frequently have a number of dependents besides those whose dependency is the result of natural relationship as to health strength and hardiness if rank has any influence on these circumstances it is but in a remote way chiefly by the influence it may have on its habitual occupations  xxxviii    the influence of education is still more extensive education stands upon a footing somewhat different from that of the circumstances of age sex and rank these words though the influence of the circumstances they respectively denote exerts itself principally if not entirely through the medium of certain of the primary circumstances before mentioned present however each of them a circumstance which has a separate existence of itself this is not the case with the word education which means nothing any farther than as it serves to call up to view some one or more of those primary circumstances education may be distinguished into physical and mental the education of the body and that of the mind mental again into intellectual and moral the culture of the understanding and the culture of the affections the education a man receives is given to him partly by others partly by himself by education then nothing more can be expressed than the condition a man is in in respect of those primary circumstances as resulting partly from the management and contrivance of others principally of those who in the early periods of his life have had dominion over him partly from his own to the physical part of his education belong the circumstances of health strength and hardiness sometimes by accident that of bodily imperfection as where by intemperance or negligence an irreparable mischief happens to his person to the intellectual part those of quantity and quality of knowledge and in some measure perhaps those of firmness of mind and steadiness to the moral part the bent of his inclinations the quantity and quality of his moral religious sympathetic and antipathetic sensibility to all three branches indiscriminately but under the superior control of external occurrences his habitual recreations his property his means of livelihood his connexions in the way of profit and of burthen and his habits of expense with respect indeed to all these points the influence of education is modified in a manner more or less apparent by that of exterior occurrences and in a manner scarcely at all apparent and altogether out of the reach of calculation by the original texture and constitution as well of his body as of his mind  xxxix    among the external circumstances by which the influence of education is modified the principal are those which come under the head of climate this circumstance places itself in front and demands a separate denomination not merely on account of the magnitude of its influence but also on account of its being conspicuous to every body and of its applying indiscriminately to great numbers at a time this circumstance depends for its essence upon the situation of that part of the earth which is in question with respect to the course taken by the whole planet in its revolution round the sun but for its influence it depends upon the condition of the bodies which compose the earths surface at that part principally upon the quantities of sensible heat at different periods and upon the density and purity and dryness or moisture of the circumambient air of the so often mentioned primary circumstances there are few of which the production is not influenced by this secondary one partly by its manifest effects upon the body partly by its less perceptible effects upon the mind in hot climates mens health is apt to be more precarious than in cold their strength and hardiness less their vigour firmness and steadiness of mind less and thence indirectly their quantity of knowledge the bent of their inclinations different most remarkably so in respect of their superior propensity to sexual enjoyments and in respect of the earliness of the period at which that propensity begins to manifest itself their sensibilities of all kinds more intense their habitual occupations savouring more of sloth than of activity their radical frame of body less strong probably and less hardy their radical frame of mind less vigorous less firm less steady  xl  0 another article in the catalogue of secondary circumstances is that of race or lineage the national race or lineage a man issues from this circumstance independently of that of climate will commonly make some difference in point of radical frame of mind and body a man of negro race born in france or england is a very different being in many respects from a man of french or english race a man of spanish race born in mexico or peru is at the hour of his birth a different sort of being in many respects from a man of the original mexican or peruvian race this circumstance as far as it is distinct from climate rank and education and from the two just mentioned operates chiefly through the medium of moral religious sympathetic and antipathetic biases  xli    the last circumstance but one is that of government the government a man lives under at the time in question or rather that under which he has been accustomed most to live this circumstance operates principally through the medium of education the magistrate operating in the character of a tutor upon all the members of the state by the direction he gives to their hopes and to their fears indeed under a solicitous and attentive government the ordinary preceptor nay even the parent himself is but a deputy as it were to the magistrate whose controlling influence different in this respect from that of the ordinary preceptor dwells with a man to his lifes end the effects of the peculiar power of the magistrate are seen more particularly in the influence it exerts over the quantum and bias of mens moral religious sympathetic and antipathetic sensibilities under a wellconstituted or even under a welladministered though illconstituted government mens moral sensibility is commonly stronger and their moral biases more conformable to the dictates of utility their religious sensibility frequently weaker but their religious biases less unconformable to the dictates of utility their sympathetic affections more enlarged directed to the magistrate more than to small parties or to individuals and more to the whole community than to either their antipathetic sensibilities less violent as being more obsequious to the influence of welldirected moral biases and less apt to be excited by that of illdirected religious ones their antipathetic biases more conformable to welldirected moral ones more apt in proportion to be grounded on enlarged and sympathetic than on narrow and selfregarding affections and accordingly upon the whole more conformable to the dictates of utility  xlii    the last circumstance is that of religious profession the religious profession a man is of the religious fraternity of which he is a member this circumstance operates principally through the medium of religious sensibility and religious biases it operates however as an indication more or less conclusive with respect to several other circumstances with respect to some scarcely but through the medium of the two just mentioned this is the case with regard to the quantum and bias of a mans moral sympathetic and antipathetic sensibility perhaps in some cases with regard to quantity and quality of knowledge strength of intellectual powers and bent of inclination with respect to others it may operate immediately of itself this seems to be the case with regard to a mans habitual occupations pecuniary circumstances and connexions in the way of sympathy and antipathy a man who pays very little inward regard to the dictates of the religion which he finds it necessary to profess may find it difficult to avoid joining in the ceremonies of it and bearing a part in the pecuniary burthens it imposes   by the force of habit and example he may even be led to entertain a partiality for persons of the same profession and a proportionable antipathy against those of a rival one in particular the antipathy against persons of different persuasions is one of the last points of religion which men part with lastly it is obvious that the religious profession a man is of cannot but have a considerable influence on his education but considering the import of the term education to say this is perhaps no more than saying in other words what has been said already  xliii these circumstances all or many of them will need to be attended to as often as upon any occasion any account is taken of any quantity of pain or pleasure as resulting from any cause has any person sustained an injury they will need to be considered in estimating the mischief of the offense is satisfaction to be made to him they will need to be attended to in adjusting the quantum of that satisfaction is the injurer to be punished they will need to be attended to in estimating the force of the impression that will be made on him by any given punishment  xliv it is to be observed that though they seem all of them on some account or other to merit a place in the catalogue they are not all of equal use in practice different articles among them are applicable to different exciting causes of those that may influence the effect of the same exciting cause some apply indiscriminately to whole classes of persons together being applicable to all without any remarkable difference in degree these may be directly and pretty fully provided for by the legislator this is the case for instance with the primary circumstances of bodily imperfection and insanity with the secondary circumstance of sex perhaps with that of age at any rate with those of rank of climate of lineage and of religious profession others however they may apply to whole classes of persons yet in their application to different individuals are susceptible of perhaps an indefinite variety of degrees these cannot be fully provided for by the legislator but as the existence of them in every sort of case is capable of being ascertained and the degree in which they take place is capable of being measured provision may be made for them by the judge or other executive magistrate to whom the several individuals that happen to be concerned may be made known this is the case   with the circumstance of health   in some sort with that of strength   scarcely with that of hardiness still less with those of quantity and quality of knowledge strength of intellectual powers firmness or steadiness of mind except in as far as a mans condition in respect of those circumstances may be indicated by the secondary circumstances of sex age or rank hardly with that of bent of inclination except in as far as that latent circumstance is indicated by the more manifest one of habitual occupations hardly with that of a mans moral sensibility or biases except in as far as they may be indicated by his sex age rank and education not at all with his religious sensibility and religious biases except in as far as they may be indicated by the religious profession he belongs to not at all with the quantity or quality of his sympathetic or antipathetic sensibilities except in as far as they may be presumed from his sex age rank education lineage or religious profession it is the case however with his habitual occupations with his pecuniary circumstances and with his connexions in the way of sympathy of others again either the existence cannot be ascertained or the degree cannot be measured these therefore cannot be taken into account either by the legislator or the executive magistrate accordingly they would have no claim to be taken notice of were it not for those secondary circumstances by which they are indicated and whose influence could not well be understood without them what these are has been already mentioned  xlv it has already been observed that different articles in this list of circumstances apply to different exciting causes the circumstance of bodily strength for instance has scarcely any influence of itself whatever it may have in a roundabout way and by accident on the effect of an incident which should increase or diminish the quantum of a mans property it remains to be considered what the exciting causes are with which the legislator has to do these may by some accident or other be any whatsoever but those which he has principally to do are those of the painful or afflictive kind with pleasurable ones he has little to do except now and then by accident the reasons of which may be easily enough perceived at the same time that it would take up too much room to unfold them here the exciting causes with which he has principally to do are on the one hand the mischievous acts which it is his business to prevent on the other hand the punishments by the terror of which it is his endeavour to prevent them now of these two sets of exciting causes the latter only is of his production being produced partly by his own special appointment partly in conformity to his general appointment by the special appointment of the judge for the legislator therefore as well as for the judge it is necessary if they would know what it is they are doing when they are appointing punishment to have an eye to all these circumstances for the legislator lest meaning to apply a certain quantity of punishment to all persons who shall put themselves in a given predicament he should unawares apply to some of those persons much more or much less than he himself intended for the judge lest in applying to a particular person a particular measure of punishment he should apply much more or much less than was intended perhaps by himself and at any rate by the legislator they ought each of them therefore to have before him on the one hand a list of the several circumstances by which sensibility may be influenced on the other hand a list of the several species and degrees of punishment which they purpose to make use of and then by making a comparison between the two to form a detailed estimate of the influence of each of the circumstances in question upon the effect of each species and degree of punishment  there are two plans or orders of distribution either of which might be pursued in the drawing up this estimate the one is to make the name of the circumstance take the lead and under it to represent the different influences it exerts over the effects of the several modes of punishment the other is to make the name of the punishment take the lead and under it to represent the different influences which are exerted over the effects of it by the several circumstances above mentioned now of these two sorts of objects the punishment is that to which the intention of the legislator is directed in the first instance this is of his own creation and will be whatsoever he thinks fit to make it the influencing circumstance exists independently of him and is what it is whether he will or no what he has occasion to do is to establish a certain species and degree of punishment and it is only with reference to that punishment that he has occasion to make any inquiry concerning any of the circumstances here in question the latter of the two plans therefore is that which appears by far the most useful and commodious but neither upon the one nor the other plan can any such estimate be delivered here    xlvi of the several circumstances contained in this catalogue it may be of use to give some sort of analytic view in order that it may be the more easily discovered if any which ought to have been inserted are omitted and that with regard to those which are inserted it may be seen how they differ and agree  in the first place they may be distinguished into primary and secondary those may be termed primary which operate immediately of themselves those secondary which operate not but by the medium of the former to this latter head belong the circumstances of sex age station in life education climate lineage government and religious profession the rest are primary these again are either connate or adventitious those which are connate are radical frame of body and radical frame of mind those which are adventitious are either personal or exterior the personal again concern either a mans dispositions or his actions those which concern his dispositions concern either his body or his mind those which concern his body are health strength hardiness and bodily imperfection those which concern his mind again concern either his understanding or his affections to the former head belong the circumstances of quantity and quality of knowledge strength of understanding and insanity to the latter belong the circumstances of firmness of mind steadiness bent of inclination moral sensibility moral biases religious sensibility religious biases sympathetic sensibility sympathetic biases antipathetic sensibility and antipathetic biases those which regard his actions are his habitual occupations those which are exterior to him regard either the things or the persons which he is concerned with under the former head come his pecuniary circumstances   under the latter his connexions in the way of sympathy and antipathy  chapter vii of human actions in general i the business of government is to promote the happiness of the society by punishing and rewarding that part of its business which consists in punishing is more particularly the subject of penal law in proportion as an act tends to disturb that happiness in proportion as the tendency of it is pernicious will be the demand it creates for punishment what happiness consists of we have already seen enjoyment of pleasures security from pains  ii the general tendency of an act is more or less pernicious according to the sum total of its consequences that is according to the difference between the sum of such as are good and the sum of such as are evil  iii it is to be observed that here as well as henceforward wherever consequences are spoken of such only are meant as are material of the consequences of any act the multitude and variety must needs be infinite but such of them only as are material are worth regarding now among the consequences of an act be they what they may such only by one who views them in the capacity of a legislator can be said to be material   as either consist of pain or pleasure or have an influence in the production of pain or pleasure    iv it is also to be observed that into the account of the consequences of the act are to be taken not such only as might have ensued were intention out of the question but such also as depend upon the connexion there may be between these firstmentioned consequences and the intention the connexion there is between the intention and certain consequences is as we shall see hereafter   a means of producing other consequences in this lies the difference between rational agency and irrational  v now the intention with regard to the consequences of an act will depend upon two things   the state of the will or intention with respect to the act itself and   the state of the understanding or perceptive faculties with regard to the circumstances which it is or may appear to be accompanied with now with respect to these circumstances the perceptive faculty is susceptible of three states consciousness unconsciousness and false consciousness consciousness when the party believes precisely those circumstances and no others to subsist which really do subsist unconsciousness when he fails of perceiving certain circumstances to subsist which however do subsist false consciousness when he believes or imagines certain circumstances to subsist which in truth do not subsist  vi in every transaction therefore which is examined with a view to punishment there are four articles to be considered   the act itself which is done   the circumstances in which it is done   the intentionality that may have accompanied it   the consciousness unconsciousness or false consciousness that may have accompanied it  what regards the act and the circumstances will be the subject of the present chapter what regards intention and consciousness that of the two succeeding  vii there are also two other articles on which the general tendency of an act depends and on that as well as on other accounts the demand which it creates for punishment these are   the particular motive or motives which gave birth to it   the general disposition which it indicates these articles will be the subject of two other chapters  viii acts may be distinguished in several ways for several purposes  they may be distinguished in the first place into positive and negative by positive are meant such as consist in motion or exertion by negative such as consist in keeping at rest that is in forbearing to move or exert ones self in such and such circumstances thus to strike is a positive act not to strike on a certain occasion a negative one positive acts are styled also acts of commission negative acts of omission or forbearance    ix such acts again as are negative may either be absolutely so or relatively absolutely when they import the negation of all positive agency whatsoever for instance not to strike at all relatively when they import the negation of such or such a particular mode of agency for instance not to strike such a person or such a thing or in such a direction  x it is to be observed that the nature of the act whether positive or negative is not to be determined immediately by the form of the discourse made use of to express it an act which is positive in its nature may be characterized by a negative expression thus not to be at rest is as much as to say to move so also an act which is negative in its nature may be characterized by a positive expression thus to forbear or omit to bring food to a person in certain circumstances is signified by the single and positive term to starve  xi in the second place acts may be distinguished into external and internal by external are meant corporal acts acts of the body by internal mental acts acts of the mind thus to strike is an external or exterior 0 act to intend to strike an internal or interior one  xii acts of discourse are a sort of mixture of the two external acts which are no ways material nor attended with any consequences any farther than as they serve to express the existence of internal ones to speak to another to strike to write to him to strike to make signs to him to strike are all so many acts of discourse  xiii third acts that are external may be distinguished into transitive and intransitive acts may be called transitive when the motion is communicated from the person of the agent to some foreign body that is to such a foreign body on which the effects of it are considered as being material as where a man runs against you or throws water in your face acts may be called intransitive when the motion is communicated to no other body on which the effects of it are regarded as material than some part of the same person in whom it originated as where a man runs or washes himself    xiv an act of the transitive kind may be said to be in its commencement or in the first stage of its progress while the motion is confined to the person of the agent and has not yet been communicated to any foreign body on which the effects of it can be material it may be said to be in its termination or to be in the last stage of its progress as soon as the motion or impulse has been communicated to some such foreign body it may be said to be in the middle or intermediate stage or stages of its progress while the motion having passed from the person of the agent has not yet been communicated to any such foreign body thus as soon as a man has lifted up his hand to strike the act he performs in striking you is in its commencement as soon as his hand has reached you it is in its termination if the act be the motion of a body which is separated from the person of the agent before it reaches the object it may be said during that interval to be in its intermediate progress   or in gradu mediativo as in the case where a man throws a stone or fires a bullet at you  xv an act of the intransitive kind may be said to be in its commencement when the motion or impulse is as yet confined to the member or organ in which it originated and has not yet been communicated to any member or organ that is distinguishable from the former it may be said to be in its termination as soon as it has been applied to any other part of the same person thus where a man poisons himself while he is lifting up the poison to his mouth the act is in its commencement as soon as it has reached his lips it is in its termination    xvi in the third place acts may be distinguished into transient and continued thus to strike is a transient act to lean a continued one to buy a transient act to keep in ones possession a continued one  xvii in strictness of speech there is a difference between a continued act and a repetition of acts it is a repetition of acts when there are intervals filled up by acts of different natures a continued act when there are no such intervals thus to lean is continued act to keep striking a repetition of acts  xviii there is a difference again between a repetition of acts and a habit or practice the term repetition of acts may be employed let the acts in question be separated by ever such short intervals and let the sum total of them occupy ever so short a space of time the term habit is not employed but when the acts in question are supposed to be separated by longcontinued intervals and the sum total of them to occupy a considerable space of time it is not for instance the drinking ever so many times nor ever so much at a time in the course of the same sitting that will constitute a habit of drunkenness it is necessary that such sittings themselves be frequently repeated every habit is a repetition of acts or to speak more strictly when a man has frequently repeated such and such acts after considerable intervals he is said to have persevered in or contracted a habit but every repetition of acts is not a habit    xix fourth acts may be distinguished into indivisible and divisible indivisible acts are merely imaginary they may be easily conceived but can never be known to be exemplified such as are divisible may be so with regard either to matter or to motion an act indivisible with regard to matter is the motion or rest of one single atom of matter an act indivisible with regard to motion is the motion of any body from one single atom of space to the next to it  fifth acts may be distinguished into simple and complex simple such as the act of striking the act of leaning or the act of drinking above instanced complex consisting each of a multitude of simple acts which though numerous and heterogeneous derive a sort of unity from the relation they bear to some common design or end such as the act of giving a dinner the act of maintaining a child the act of exhibiting a triumph the act of bearing arms the act of holding a court and so forth  xx it has been every now and then made a question what it is in such a case that constitutes one act where one act has ended and another act has begun whether what has happened has been one act or many   these questions it is now evident may frequently be answered with equal propriety in opposite ways and if there be any occasions on which they can be answered only in one way the answer will depend upon the nature of the occasion and the purpose for which the question is proposed a man is wounded in two fingers at one stroke—is it one wound or several a man is beaten at    oclock and again at   minutes after   —is it one beating or several you beat one man and instantly in the same breath you beat another—is this one beating or several in any of these cases it may be one perhaps as to some purposes and several as to others these examples are given that men may be aware of the ambiguity of language and neither harass themselves with unsolvable doubts nor one another with interminable disputes  xxi so much with regard to acts considered in themselves we come now to speak of the circumstances with which they may have been accompanied these must necessarily be taken into the account before any thing can be determined relative to the consequences what the consequences of an act may be upon the whole can never otherwise be ascertained it can never be known whether it is beneficial or indifferent or mischievous in some circumstances even to kill a man may be a beneficial act in others to set food before him may be a pernicious one  xxii now the circumstances of an act are what any objects   whatsoever take any act whatsoever there is nothing in the nature of things that excludes any imaginable object from being a circumstance to it any given object may be a circumstance to any other    xxiii we have already had occasion to make mention for a moment of the consequences of an act these were distinguished into material and immaterial in like manner may the circumstances of it be distinguished now materiality is a relative term applied to the consequences of an act it bore relation to pain and pleasure applied to the circumstances it bears relation to the consequences a circumstance may be said to be material when it bears a visible relation in point of causality to the consequences immaterial when it bears no such visible relation  xxiv the consequences of an act are events   a circumstance may be related to an event in point of causality in any one of four ways   in the way of causation or production   in the way of derivation   in the way of collateral condition   in the way of conjunct influence it may be said to be related to the event in the way of causation when it is of the number of those that contribute to the production of such event in the way of derivation when it is of the number of the events to the production of which that in question has been contributory in the way of collateral connexion where the circumstance in question and the event in question without being either of them instrumental in the production of the other are related each of them to some common object which has been concerned in the production of them both in the way of conjunct influence when whether related in any other way or not they have both of them concurred in the production of some common consequence  xxv an example may be of use in the year      villiers duke of buckingham favourite and minister of charles i of england received a wound and died the man who gave it him was one felton who exasperated at the maladministration of which that minister was accused went down from london to portsmouth where buckingham happened then to be made his way into his antichamber and finding him busily engaged in conversation with a number of people round him got close to him drew a knife and stabbed him in the effort the assassins hat fell off which was found soon after and upon searching him the bloody knife in the crown of the hat were found scraps of paper with sentences expressive of the purpose he was come upon here then suppose the event in question is the wound received by buckingham feltons drawing out his knife his making his way into the chamber his going down to portsmouth his conceiving an indignation at the idea of buckinghams administration that administration itself charless appointing such a minister and so on higher and higher without end are so many circumstances related to the event of buckinghams receiving the wound in the way of causation or production the bloodiness of the knife a circumstance related to the same event in the way of derivation the finding of the hat upon the ground the finding the sentences in the hat and the writing them so many circumstances related to it in the way of collateral connexion and the situation and conversations of the people about buckingham were circumstances related to the circumstances of feltons making his way into the room going down to portsmouth and so forth in the way of conjunct influence inasmuch as they contributed in common to the event of buckinghams receiving the wound by preventing him from putting himself upon his guard upon the first appearance of the intruder    xxvi these several relations do not all of them attach upon an event with equal certainty in the first place it is plain indeed that every event must have some circumstance or other and in truth an indefinite multitude of circumstances related to it in the way of production it must of course have a still greater multitude of circumstances related to it in the way of collateral connexion but it does not appear necessary that every event should have circumstances related to it in the way of derivation nor therefore that it should have any related to it in the way of conjunct influence but of the circumstances of all kinds which actually do attach upon an event it is only a very small number that can be discovered by the utmost exertion of the human faculties it is a still smaller number that ever actually do attract our notice when occasion happens more or fewer of them will be discovered by a man in proportion to the strength partly of his intellectual powers partly of his inclination 0 it appears therefore that the multitude and description of such of the circumstances belonging to an act as may appear to be material will be determined by two considerations   by the nature of things themselves   by the strength or weakness of the faculties of those who happen to consider them  xxvii thus much it seemed necessary to premise in general concerning acts and their circumstances previously to the consideration of the particular sorts of acts with their particular circumstances with which we shall have to do in the body of the work an act of some sort or other is necessarily included in the notion of every offense together with this act under the notion of the same offense are included certain circumstances which circumstances enter into the essence of the offense contribute by their conjunct influence to the production of its consequences and in conjunction with the act are brought into view by the name by which it stands distinguished these we shall have occasion to distinguish hereafter by the name of criminative circumstances   other circumstances again entering into combination with the act and the former set of circumstances are productive of still farther consequences these additional consequences if they are of the beneficial kind bestow according to the value they bear in that capacity upon the circumstances to which they owe their birth the appellation of exculpative   or extenuative circumstances   if of the mischievous kind they bestow on them the appellation of aggravative circumstances   of all these different sets of circumstances the criminative are connected with the consequences of the original offence in the way of production with the act and with one another in the way of conjunct influence the consequences of the original offense with them and with the act respectively in the way of derivation the consequences of the modified offense with the criminative exculpative and extenuative circumstances respectively in the way also of derivation these different sets of circumstances with the consequences of the modified act or offense in the way of production and with one another in respect of the consequences of the modified act or offense in the way of conjunct influence lastly whatever circumstances can be seen to be connected with the consequences of the offense whether directly in the way of derivation or obliquely in the way of collateral affinity to wit in virtue of its being connected in the way of derivation with some of the circumstances with which they stand connected in the same manner bear a material relation to the offense in the way of evidence they may accordingly be styled evidentiary circumstances and may become of use by being held forth upon occasion as so many proofs indications or evidences of its having been committed    chapter viii of intentionality i so much with regard to the two first of the articles upon which the evil tendency of an action may depend viz the act itself and the general assemblage of the circumstances with which it may have been accompanied we come now to consider the ways in which the particular circumstance of intention may be concerned in it  ii first then the intention or will may regard either of two objects   the act itself or   its consequences of these objects that which the intention regards may be styled intentional if it regards the act then the act may be said to be intentional   if the consequences so also then may the consequences if it regards both the act and consequences the whole action may be said to be intentional whichever of those articles is not the object of the intention may of course be said to be unintentional  iii the act may very easily be intentional without the consequences and often is so thus you may intend to touch a man without intending to hurt him and yet as the consequences turn out you may chance to hurt him  iv the consequences of an act may also be intentional without the acts being intentional throughout that is without its being intentional in every stage of it but this is not so frequent a case as the former you intend to hurt a man suppose by running against him and pushing him down and you run towards him accordingly but a second man coming in on a sudden between you and the first man before you can stop yourself you run against the second man and by him push down the first  v but the consequences of an act cannot be intentional without the acts being itself intentional in at least the first stage if the act be not intentional in the first stage it is no act of yours there is accordingly no intention on your part to produce the consequences that is to say the individual consequences all there can have been on your part is a distant intention to produce other consequences of the same nature by some act of yours at a future time or else without any intention a bare wish to see such event take place the second man suppose runs of his own accord against the first and pushes him down you had intentions of doing a thing of the same nature viz to run against him and push him down yourself but you had done nothing in pursuance of those intentions the individual consequences therefore of the act which the second man performed in pushing down the first cannot be said to have been on your part intentional    vi second a consequence when it is intentional may either be directly so or only obliquely it may be said to be directly or lineally intentional when the prospect of producing it constituted one of the links in the chain of causes by which the person was determined to do the act it may be said to be obliquely or collaterally intentional when although the consequence was in contemplation and appeared likely to ensue in case of the acts being performed yet the prospect of producing such consequence did not constitute a link in the aforesaid chain  vii third an incident which is directly intentional may either be ultimately so or only mediately it may be said to be ultimately intentional when it stands last of all exterior events in the aforesaid chain of motives insomuch that the prospect of the production of such incident could there be a certainty of its taking place would be sufficient to determine the will without the prospect of its producing any other it may be said to be mediately intentional and no more when there is some other incident the prospect of producing which forms a subsequent link in the same chain insomuch that the prospect of producing the former would not have operated as a motive but for the tendency which it seemed to have towards the production of the latter  viii fourth when an incident is directly intentional it may either be exclusively so or inexclusively it may be said to be exclusively intentional when no other but that very individual incident would have answered the purpose insomuch that no other incident had any share in determining the will to the act in question it may be said to have been inexclusively   intentional when there was some other incident the prospect of which was acting upon the will at the same time  ix fifth when an incident is inexclusively intentional it may be either conjunctively so disjunctively or indiscriminately it may be said to be conjunctively intentional with regard to such other incident when the intention is to produce both disjunctively when the intention is to produce either the one or the other indifferently but not both indiscriminately when the intention is indifferently to produce either the one or the other or both as it may happen  x sixth when two incidents are disjunctively intentional they may be so with or without preference they may be said to be so with preference when the intention is that one of them in particular should happen rather than the other without preference when the intention is equally fulfilled whichever of them happens    xi one example will make all this clear william ii king of england being out a staghunting received from sir walter tyrrel a wound of which he died 0 let us take this case and diversify it with a variety of suppositions correspondent to the distinctions just laid down    first then tyrrel did not so much as entertain a thought of the kings death or if he did looked upon it as an event of which there was no danger in either of these cases the incident of his killing the king was altogether unintentional    he saw a stag running that way and he saw the king riding that way at the same time what he aimed at was to kill the stag he did not wish to kill the king at the same time he saw that if he shot it was as likely he should kill the king as the stag yet for all that he shot and killed the king accordingly in this case the incident of his killing the king was intentional but obliquely so    he killed the king on account of the hatred he bore him and for no other reason than the pleasure of destroying him in this case the incident of the kings death was not only directly but ultimately intentional    he killed the king intending fully so to do not for any hatred he bore him but for the sake of plundering him when dead in this case the incident of the kings death was directly intentional but not ultimately it was mediately intentional    he intended neither more nor less than to kill the king he had no other aim nor wish in this case it was exclusively as well as directly intentional exclusively to wit with regard to every other material incident    sir walter shot the king in the right leg as he was plucking a thorn out of it with his left hand his intention was by shooting the arrow into his leg through his hand to cripple him in both those limbs at the same time in this case the incident of the kings being shot in the leg was intentional and that conjunctively with another which did not happen viz his being shot in the hand    the intention of tyrrel was to shoot the king either in the hand or in the leg but not in both and rather in the hand than in the leg in this case the intention of shooting in the hand was disjunctively concurrent with regard to the other incident and that with preference    his intention was to shoot the king either in the leg or the hand whichever might happen but not in both in this case the intention was inexclusive but disjunctively so yet that however without preference    his intention was to shoot the king either in the leg or the hand or in both as it might happen in this case the intention was indiscriminately concurrent with respect to the two incidents  xii it is to be observed that an act may be unintentional in any stage or stages of it though intentional in the preceding and on the other hand it may be intentional in any stage or stages of it and yet unintentional in the succeeding   but whether it be intentional or no in any preceding stage is immaterial with respect to the consequences so it be unintentional in the last the only point with respect to which it is material is the proof the more stages the act is unintentional in the more apparent it will commonly be that it was unintentional with respect to the last if a man intending to strike you on the cheek strikes you in the eye and puts it out it will probably be difficult for him to prove that it was not his intention to strike you in the eye it will probably be easier if his intention was really not to strike you or even not to strike at all  xiii it is frequent to hear men speak of a good intention of a bad intention of the goodness and badness of a mans intention a circumstance on which great stress is generally laid it is indeed of no small importance when properly understood but the import of it is to the last degree ambiguous and obscure strictly speaking nothing can be said to be good or bad but either in itself which is the case only with pain or pleasure or on account of its effects which the case only with things that are the causes or preventives of pain and pleasure but in a figurative and less proper way of speech a thing may also be styled good or bad in consideration of its cause now the effects of an intention to do such or such an act are the same objects which we have been speaking of under the appellation of its consequences and the causes of intention are called motives a mans intention then on any occasion may be styled good or bad with reference either to the consequences of the act or with reference to his motives if it be deemed good or bad in any sense it must be either because it is deemed to be productive of good or of bad consequences or because it is deemed to originate from a good or from a bad motive but the goodness or badness of the consequences depend upon the circumstances now the circumstances are no objects of the intention a man intends the act and by his intention produces the act but as to the circumstances he does not intend them he does not inasmuch as they are circumstances of it produce them if by accident there be a few which he has been instrumental in producing it has been by former intentions directed to former acts productive of those circumstances as the consequences at the time in question he takes them as he finds them acts with their consequences are objects of the will as well as of the understanding circumstances as such are objects of the understanding only all he can do with these as such is to know or not to know them in other words to be conscious of them or not conscious to the title of consciousness belongs what is to be said of the goodness or badness of a mans intention as resulting from the consequences of the act and to the head of motives what is to be said of his intention as resulting from the motive  chapter ix of consciousness i so far with regard to the ways in which the will or intention may be concerned in the production of any incident we come now to consider the part which the understanding or perceptive faculty may have borne with relation to such incident  ii a certain act has been done and that intentionally that act was attended with certain circumstances upon these circumstances depended certain of its consequences and amongst the rest all those which were of a nature purely physical now then take any one of these circumstances it is plain that a man at the time of doing the act from whence such consequences ensued may have been either conscious with respect to this circumstance or unconscious in other words he may either have been aware of the circumstance or not aware it may either have been present to his mind or not present in the first case the act may be said to have been an advised act with respect to that circumstance in the other case an unadvised one  iii there are two points with regard to which an act may have been advised or unadvised   the existence of the circumstance itself   the materiality of it    iv it is manifest that with reference to the time of the act such circumstance may have been either present past or future  v an act which is unadvised is either heedless or not heedless it is termed heedless when the case is thought to be such that a person of ordinary prudence   if prompted by an ordinary share of benevolence would have been likely to have bestowed such and so much attention and reflection upon the material circumstances as would have effectually disposed him to prevent the mischievous incident from taking place not heedless when the case is not thought to be such as above mentioned    vi again whether a man did or did not suppose the existence or materiality of a given circumstance it may be that he did suppose the existence and materiality of some circumstance which either did not exist or which though existing was not material in such case the act may be said to be misadvised with respect to such imagined circumstance and it may be said that there has been an erroneous supposition or a missupposal in the case  vii now a circumstance the existence of which is thus erroneously supposed may be material either   in the way of prevention or   in that of compensation it may be said to be material in the way of prevention when its effect or tendency had it existed would have been to prevent the obnoxious consequences in the way of compensation when that effect or tendency would have been to produce other consequences the beneficialness of which would have outweighed the mischievousness of the others  viii it is manifest that with reference to the time of the act such imaginary circumstance may in either case have been supposed either to be present past or future  ix to return to the example exhibited in the preceding chapter   0 tyrrel intended to shoot in the direction in which he shot but he did not know that the king was riding so near that way in this case the act he performed in shooting the act of shooting was unadvised with respect to the existence of the circumstance of the kings being so near riding that way     he knew that the king was riding that way but at the distance at which the king was he knew not of the probability there was that the arrow would reach him in this case the act was unadvised with respect to the materiality of the circumstance     somebody had dipped the arrow in poison without tyrrels knowing of it in this case the act was unadvised with respect to the existence of a past circumstance     at the very instant that tyrrel drew the bow the king being screened from his view by the foliage of some bushes was riding furiously in such manner as to meet the arrow in a direct line which circumstance was also more than tyrrel knew of in this case the act was unadvised with respect to the existence of a present circumstance     the king being at a distance from court could get nobody to dress his wound till the next day of which circumstance tyrrel was not aware in this case the act was unadvised with respect to what was then future circumstance     tyrrel knew of the kings being riding that way of his being so near and so forth but being deceived by the foliage of the bushes he thought he saw a bank between the spot from which he shot and that to which the king was riding in this case the act was misadvised proceeding on the missupposal of a preventive circumstance     tyrrel knew that every thing was as above nor was he deceived by the supposition of any preventive circumstance but he believed the king to be an usurper and supposed he was coming up to attack a person whom tyrrel believed to be the rightful king and who was riding by tyrrels side in this case the act was also misadvised but proceeded on the missupposal of a compensative circumstance  x let us observe the connexion there is between intentionality and consciousness when the act itself is intentional and with respect to the existence of all the circumstances advised as also with respect to the materiality of those circumstances in relation to a given consequence and there is no missupposal with regard to any preventive circumstance that consequence must also be intentional in other words advisedness with respect to the circumstances if clear from the missupposal of any preventive circumstance extends the intentionality from the act to the consequences those consequences may be either directly intentional or only obliquely so but at any rate they cannot but be intentional  xi to go on with the example if tyrrel intended to shoot in the direction in which the king was riding up and knew that the king was coming to meet the arrow and knew the probability there was of his being shot in that same part in which he was shot or in another as dangerous and with that same degree of force and so forth and was not misled by the erroneous supposition of a circumstance by which the shot would have been prevented from taking place or any such other preventive circumstance it is plain he could not but have intended the kings death perhaps he did not positively wish it but for all that in a certain sense he intended it  xii what heedlessness is in the case of an unadvised act rashness is in the case of a misadvised one a misadvised act then may be either rash or not rash it may be termed rash when the case is thought to be such that a person of ordinary prudence if prompted by an ordinary share of benevolence would have employed such and so much attention and reflection to the imagined circumstance as by discovering to him the nonexistence improbability or immateriality of it would have effectually disposed him to prevent the mischievous incident from taking place  xiii in ordinary discourse when a man does an act of which the consequences prove mischievous it is a common thing to speak of him as having acted with a good intention or with a bad intention of his intentions being a good one or a bad one the epithets good and bad are all this while applied we see to the intention but the application of them is most commonly governed by a supposition formed with regard to the nature of the motive the act though eventually it prove mischievous is said to be done with a good intention when it is supposed to issue from a motive which is looked upon as a good motive with a bad intention when it is supposed to be the result of a motive which is looked upon as a bad motive but the nature of the consequences intended and the nature of the motive which gave birth to the intention are objects which though intimately connected are perfectly distinguishable the intention might therefore with perfect propriety be styled a good one whatever were the motive it might be styled a good one when not only the consequences of the act prove mischievous but the motive which gave birth to it was what is called a bad one to warrant the speaking of the intention as being a good one it is sufficient if the consequences of the act had they proved what to the agent they seemed likely to be would have been of a beneficial nature and in the same manner the intention may be bad when not only the consequences of the act prove beneficial but the motive which gave birth to it was a good one  xiv now when a man has a mind to speak of your intention as being good or bad with reference to the consequences if he speaks of it at all he must use the word intention for there is no other but if a man means to speak of the motive from which your intention originated as being a good or a bad one he is certainly not obliged to use the word intention it is at least as well to use the word motive by the supposition he means the motive and very likely he may not mean the intention for what is true of the one is very often not true of the other the motive may be good when the intention is bad the intention may be good when the motive is bad whether they are both good or both bad or the one good and the other bad makes as we shall see hereafter a very essential difference with regard to the consequences   it is therefore much better when motive is meant never to say intention  xv an example will make this clear out of malice a man prosecutes you for a crime of which he believes you to be guilty but of which in fact you are not guilty here the consequences of his conduct are mischievous for they are mischievous to you at any rate in virtue of the shame and anxiety which you are made to suffer while the prosecution is depending to which is to be added in case of your being convicted the evil of the punishment to you therefore they are mischievous nor is there any one to whom they are beneficial the mans motive was also what is called a bad one for malice will be allowed by every body to be a bad motive however the consequences of his conduct had they proved such as he believed them likely to be would have been good for in them would have been included the punishment of a criminal which is a benefit to all who are exposed to suffer by a crime of the like nature the intention therefore in this case though not in a common way of speaking the motive might be styled a good one but of motives more particularly in the next chapter  xvi in the same sense the intention whether it be positively good or no so long as it is not bad may be termed innocent accordingly let the consequences have proved mischievous and let the motive have been what it will the intention may be termed innocent in either of two cases   in the case of unadvisedness with respect to any of the circumstances on which the mischievousness of the consequences depended   in the case of misadvisedness with respect to any circumstance which had it been what it appeared to be would have served either to prevent or to outweigh the mischief  xvii a few words for the purpose of applying what has been said to the roman law unintentionality and innocence of intention seem both to be included in the case of infortunium where there is neither dolus nor culpa unadvisedness coupled with heedlessness and misadvisedness coupled with rashness correspond to the culpa sine dolo direct intentionality corresponds to dolus oblique intentionality seems hardly to have been distinguished from direct were it to occur it would probably be deemed also to correspond to dolus the division into culpa lata levis and levissima is such as nothing certain can correspond to what is it that it expresses a distinction not in the case itself but only in the sentiments which any person a judge for instance may find himself disposed to entertain with relation to it supposing it already distinguished into three subordinate cases by other means  the word dolus seems ill enough contrived the word culpa as indifferently dolus upon any other occasion would be understood to imply deceit concealment   clandestinity   but here it is extended to open force culpa upon any other occasion would be understood to extend to blame of every kind it would therefore include dolus    xviii the abovementioned definitions and distinctions are far from being mere matters of speculation they are capable of the most extensive and constant application as well to moral discourse as to legislative practice upon the degree and bias of a mans intention upon the absence or presence of consciousness or missupposal depend a great part of the good and bad more especially of the bad consequences of an act and on this as well as other grounds a great part of the demand for punishment   the presence of intention with regard to such or such a consequence and of consciousness with regard to such or such a circumstance of the act will form so many criminative circumstances 0 or essential ingredients in the composition of this or that offence applied to other circumstances consciousness will form a ground of aggravation annexable to the like offence   in almost all cases the absence of intention with regard to certain consequences and the absence of consciousness or the presence of missupposal with regard to certain circumstances will constitute so many grounds of extenuation    chapter x of motives sect   different senses of the word motive  i it is an acknowledged truth that every kind of act whatever and consequently every kind of offense is apt to assume a different character and be attended with different effects according to the nature of the motive which gives birth to it this makes it requisite to take a view of the several motives by which human conduct is liable to be influenced  ii by a motive in the most extensive sense in which the word is ever used with reference to a thinking being is meant any thing that can contribute to give birth to or even to prevent any kind of action now the actions of a thinking being is the act either of the body or only of the mind and an act of the mind is an act either of the intellectual faculty or of the will acts of the intellectual faculty will sometimes rest in the understanding merely without exerting any influence in the production of any acts of the will motives which are not of a nature to influence any other acts than those may be styled purely speculative motives or motives resting in speculation but as to these acts neither do they exercise any influence over external acts or over their consequences nor consequently over any pain or any pleasure that may be in the number of such consequences now it is only on account of their tendency to produce either pain or pleasure that any acts can be material with acts therefore that rest purely in the understanding we have not here any concern nor therefore with any object if any such there be which in the character of a motive can have no influence on any other acts than those  iii the motives with which alone we have any concern are such as are of a nature to act upon the will by a motive then in this sense of the word is to be understood any thing whatsoever which by influencing the will of a sensitive being is supposed to serve as a means of determining him to act or voluntarily to forbear to act  upon any occasion motives of this sort in contradistinction to the former may be styled practical motives or motives applying to practice  iv owing to the poverty and unsettled state of language the word motive is employed indiscriminately to denote two kinds of objects which for the better understanding of the subject it is necessary should be distinguished on some occasions it is employed to denote any of those really existing incidents from whence the act in question is supposed to take its rise the sense it bears on these occasions may be styled its literal or unfigurative sense on other occasions it is employed to denote a certain fictitious entity a passion an affection of the mind an ideal being which upon the happening of any such incident is considered as operating upon the mind and prompting it to take that course towards which it is impelled by the influence of such incident motives of this class are avarice indolence benevolence and so forth as we shall see more particularly farther on this latter may be styled the figurative sense of the term motive  v as to the real incidents to which the name of motive is also given these too are of two very different kinds they may be either   the internal perception of any individual lot of pleasure or pain the expectation of which is looked upon as calculated to determine you to act in such or such a manner as the pleasure of acquiring such a sum of money the pain of exerting yourself on such an occasion and so forth or   any external event the happening whereof is regarded as having a tendency to bring about the perception of such pleasure or such pain for instance the coming up of a lottery ticket by which the possession of the money devolves to you or the breaking out of a fire in the house you are in which makes it necessary for you to quit it the former kind of motives may be termed interior or internal the latter exterior or external  vi two other senses of the term motive need also to be distinguished motive refers necessarily to action it is a pleasure pain or other event that prompts to action motive then in one sense of the word must be previous to such event but for a man to be governed by any motive he must in every case look beyond that event which is called his action he must look to the consequences of it and it is only in this way that the idea of pleasure of pain or of any other event can give birth to it he must look therefore in every case to some event posterior to the act in contemplation an event which as yet exists not but stands only in prospect now as it is in all cases difficult and in most cases unnecessary to distinguish between objects so intimately connected as the posterior possible object which is thus looked forward to and the present existing object or event which takes place upon a mans looking forward to the other they are both of them spoken of under the same appellation motive to distinguish them the one first mentioned may be termed a motive in prospect the other a motive in esse and under each of these denominations will come as well exterior as internal motives a fire breaks out in your neighbours house you are under apprehension of its extending to your own you are apprehensive that if you stay in it you will be burnt you accordingly run out of it this then is the act the others are all motives to it the event of the fires breaking out in your neighbours house is an external motive and that in esse the idea or belief of the probability of the fires extending to your own house that of your being burnt if you continue and the pain you feel at the thought of such a catastrophe are all so many internal events but still in esse the event of the fires actually extending to your own house and that of your being actually burnt by it external motives in prospect the pain you would feel at seeing your house a burning and the pain you would feel while you yourself were burning internal motives in prospect which events according as the matter turns out may come to be in esse but then of course they will cease to act as motives  vii of all these motives which stand nearest to the act to the production of which they all contribute is that internal motive in esse which consists in the expectation of the internal motive in prospect the pain or uneasiness you feel at the thoughts of being burnt  all other motives are more or less remote the motives in prospect in proportion as the period at which they are expected to happen is more distant from the period at which the act takes place and consequently later in point of time the motives in esse in proportion as they also are more distant from that period and consequently earlier in point of time   viii it has already been observed that with motives of which the influence terminates altogether in the understanding we have nothing here to do if then amongst objects that are spoken of as motives with reference to the understanding there be any which concern us here it is only in as far as such objects may through the medium of the understanding exercise an influence over the will it is in this way and in this way only that any objects in virtue of any tendency they may have to influence the sentiment of belief may in a practical sense act in the character of motives any objects by tending to induce a belief concerning the existence actual or probable of a practical motive that is concerning the probability of a motive in prospect or the existence of a motive in esse may exercise an influence on the will and rank with those other motives that have been placed under the name of practical the pointing out of motives such as these is what we frequently mean when we talk of giving reasons your neighbours house is on fire as before i observe to you that at the lower part of your neighbours house is some woodwork which joins on to yours that the flames have caught this woodwork and so forth which i do in order to dispose you to believe as i believe that if you stay in your house much longer you will be burnt in doing this then i suggest motives to your understanding which motives by the tendency they have to give birth to or strengthen a pain which operates upon you in the character of an internal motive in esse join their force and act as motives upon the will  sect   no motives either constantly good or constantly bad ix in all this chain of motives the principal or original link seems to be the last internal motive in prospect it is to this that all the other motives in prospect owe their materiality and the immediately acting motive its existence this motive in prospect we see is always some pleasure or some pain some pleasure which the act in question is expected to be a means of continuing or producing some pain which it is expected to be a means of discontinuing or preventing a motive is substantially nothing more than pleasure or pain operating in a certain manner  x now pleasure is in itself a good nay even setting aside immunity from pain the only good pain is in itself an evil and indeed without exception the only evil or else the words good and evil have no meaning and this is alike true of every sort of pain and of every sort of pleasure it follows therefore immediately and incontestibly that there is no such thing as any sort of motive that is in itself a bad one   xi it is common however to speak of actions as proceeding from good or bad motives in which case the motives meant are such as are internal the expression is far from being an accurate one and as it is apt to occur in the consideration of most every kind of offence it will be requisite to settle the precise meaning of it and observe how far it quadrates with the truth of things  xii with respect to goodness and badness as it is with everything else that is not itself either pain or pleasure so is it with motives if they are good or bad it is only on account of their effects good on account of their tendency to produce pleasure or avert pain bad on account of their tendency to produce pain or avert pleasure now the case is that from one and the same motive and from every kind of motive may proceed actions that are good others that are bad and others that are indifferent this we shall proceed to shew with respect to all the different kinds of motives as determined by the various kinds of pleasures and pains  xiii such an analysis useful as it is will be found to be a matter of no small difficulty owing in great measure to a certain perversity of structure which prevails more or less throughout all languages to speak of motives as of anything else one must call them by their names but the misfortune is that it is rare to meet with a motive of which the name expresses that and nothing more commonly along with the very name of the motive is tacitly involved a proposition imputing to it a certain quality a quality which in many cases will appear to include that very goodness or badness concerning which we are here inquiring whether properly speaking it be or be not imputable to motives to use the common phrase in most cases the name of the motive is a word which is employed either only in a good sense or else only in a bad sense now when a word is spoken of as being used in a good sense all that is necessarily meant is this that in conjunction with the idea of the object it is put to signify it conveys an idea of approbation that is of a pleasure or satisfaction entertained by the person who employs the term at the thoughts of such object in like manner when a word is spoken of as being used in a bad sense all that is necessarily meant is this that in conjunction with the idea of the object it is put to signify it conveys an idea of disapprobation that is of a displeasure entertained by the person who employs the term at the thoughts of such object now the circumstance on which such approbation is grounded will as naturally as any other be the opinion of the goodness of the object in question as above explained such at least it must be upon the principle of utility so on the other hand the circumstance on which any such disapprobation is grounded will as naturally as any other be the opinion of the badness of the object such at least it must be in as far as the principle of utility is taken for the standard  now there are certain motives which unless in a few particular cases have scarcely any other name to be expressed by but such a word as is used only in a good sense this is the case for example with the motives of piety and honour the consequence of this is that if in speaking of such a motive a man should have occasion to apply the epithet bad to any actions which he mentions as apt to result from it he must appear to be guilty of a contradiction in terms but the names of motives which have scarcely any other name to be expressed by but such a word as is used only in a bad sense are many more  this is the case for example with the motives of lust and avarice and accordingly if in speaking of any such motive a man should have occasion to apply the epithets good or indifferent to any actions which he mentions as apt to result from it he must here also appear to be guilty of a similar contradiction   this perverse association of ideas cannot it is evident but throw great difficulties in the way of the inquiry now before us confining himself to the language most in use a man can scarce avoid running in appearance into perpetual contradictions his propositions will appear on the one hand repugnant to truth and on the other hand adverse to utility as paradoxes they will excite contempt as mischievous paradoxes indignation for the truths he labours to convey however important and however salutary his reader is never the better and he himself is much the worse to obviate this inconvenience completely he has but this one unpleasant remedy to lay aside the old phraseology and invent a new one happy the man whose language is ductile enough to permit him this resource to palliate the inconvenience where that method of obviating it is impracticable he has nothing left for it but to enter into a long discussion to state the whole matter at large to confess that for the sake of promoting the purposes he has violated the established laws of language and to throw himself upon the mercy of his readers   sect   catalogue of motives corresponding to that of pleasures and pains xiv from the pleasures of the senses considered in the gross results the motive which in a neutral sense maybe termed physical desire in a bad sense it is termed sensuality name used in a good sense it has none of this nothing can be determined till it be considered separately with reference to the several species of pleasures to which it corresponds  xv in particular then to the pleasures of the taste or palate corresponds a motive which in a neutral sense having received no name that can serve to express it in all cases can only be termed by circumlocution the love of the pleasures of the palate in particular cases it is styled hunger in others thirst  the love of good cheer expresses this motive but seems to go beyond intimating that the pleasure is to be partaken of in company and involving a kind of sympathy in a bad sense it is styled in some cases greediness voraciousness gluttony in others principally when applied to children lickerishness it may in some cases also be represented by the word daintiness name used in a good sense it has none   a boy who does not want for victuals steals a cake out of a pastrycooks shop and eats it in this case his motive will be universally deemed a bad one and if it be asked what it is it may be answered perhaps lickerishness   a boy buys a cake out of a pastrycooks shop and eats it in this case his motive can scarcely be looked upon as either good or bad unless his master should be out of humour with him and then perhaps he may call it lickerishness as before in both cases however his motive is the same it is neither more nor less than the motive corresponding to the pleasures of the palate 0  xvi to the pleasures of the sexual sense corresponds the motive which in a neutral sense may be termed sexual desire in a bad sense it is spoken of under the name of lasciviousness and a variety of other names of reprobation name used in a good sense it has none      a man ravishes a virgin in this case the motive is without scruple termed by the name of lust lasciviousness and so forth and is universally looked upon as a bad one   the same man at another time exercises the rights of marriage with his wife in this case the motive is accounted perhaps a good one or at least indifferent and here people would scruple to call it by any of those names in both cases however the motive may be precisely the same in both cases it may be neither more nor less than sexual desire  xvii to the pleasures of curiosity corresponds the motive known by the same name and which may be otherwise called the love of novelty or the love of experiment and on particular occasions sport and sometimes play    a boy in order to divert himself reads an improving book the motive is accounted perhaps a good one at any rate not a bad one   he sets his top a spinning the motive is deemed at any rate not a bad one   he sets loose a mad ox among a crowd his motive is now perhaps termed an abominable one yet in all three cases the motive may be the very same it may be neither more nor less than curiosity  xviii as to the other pleasures of sense they are of too little consequence to have given any separate denominations to the corresponding motives  xix to the pleasures of wealth corresponds the sort of motive which in a neutral sense may be termed pecuniary interest in a bad sense it is termed in some cases avarice covetousness rapacity or lucre in other cases niggardliness in a good sense but only in particular cases economy and frugality and in some cases the word industry may be applied to it in a sense nearly indifferent but rather bad than otherwise it is styled though only in particular cases parsimony    for money you gratify a mans hatred by putting his adversary to death   for money you plough his field for him—in the first case your motive is termed lucre and is accounted corrupt and abominable and in the second for want of a proper appellation it is styled industry and is looked upon as innocent at least if not meritorious yet the motive is in both cases precisely the same it is neither more nor less than pecuniary interest  xx the pleasures of skill are neither distinct enough nor of consequence enough to have given any name to the corresponding motive  xxi to the pleasures of amity corresponds a motive which in a neutral sense may be termed the desire of ingratiating ones self in a bad sense it is in certain cases styled servility in a good sense it has no name that is peculiar to it in the cases in which it has been looked on with a favourable eye it has seldom been distinguished from the motive of sympathy or benevolence with which in such cases it is commonly associated    to acquire the affections of a woman before marriage to preserve them afterwards you do every thing that is consistent with other duties to make her happy in this case your motive is looked upon as laudable though there is no name for it   for the same purpose you poison a woman with whom she is at enmity in this case your motive is looked upon as abominable though still there is no name for it   to acquire or preserve the favour of a man who is richer or more powerful than yourself you make yourself subservient to his pleasures let them even be lawful pleasures if people choose to attribute your behaviour to this motive you will not get them to find any other name for it than servility yet in all three cases the motive is the same it is neither more nor less than the desire of ingratiating yourself  xxii to the pleasures of the moral sanction or as they may otherwise be called the pleasures of a good name corresponds a motive which in a neutral sense has scarcely yet obtained any adequate appellative it may be styled the love of reputation it is nearly related to the motive last preceding being neither more nor less than the desire of ingratiating ones self with or as in this case we should rather say of recommending ones self to the world at large in a good sense it is termed honour or the sense of honour or rather the word honour is introduced somehow or other upon the occasion of its being brought to view for in strictness the word honour is put rather to signify that imaginary object which a man is spoken of as possessing upon the occasion of his obtaining a conspicuous share of the pleasures that are in question in particular cases it is styled the love of glory in a bad sense it is styled in some cases false honour in others pride in others vanity in a sense not decidedly bad but rather bad than otherwise ambition in an indifferent sense in some cases the love of fame in others the sense of shame and as the pleasures belonging to the moral sanction run undistinguishably into the pains derived from the same source   it may also be styled in some cases the fear of dishonour the fear of disgrace the fear of infamy the fear of ignominy or the fear of shame    you have received an affront from a man according to the custom of the country in order on the one hand to save yourself from the shame of being thought to bear it patiently   on the other hand to obtain the reputation of courage you challenge him to fight with mortal weapons in this case your motive will by some people be accounted laudable and styled honour by others it will be accounted blameable and these if they call it honour will prefix an epithet of improbation to it and call it false honour   in order to obtain a post of rank and dignity and thereby to increase the respects paid you by the public you bribe the electors who are to confer it or the judge before whom the title to it is in dispute in this case your motive is commonly accounted corrupt and abominable and is styled perhaps by some such name as dishonest or corrupt ambition as there is no single name for it   in order to obtain the goodwill of the public you bestow a large sum in works of private charity or public utility in this case people will be apt not to agree about your motive your enemies will put a bad colour upon it and call it ostentation your friends to save you from this reproach will choose to impute your conduct not to this motive but to some other such as that of charity the denomination in this case given to private sympathy or that of public spirit   a king for the sake of gaining the admiration annexed to the name of conqueror we will suppose power and resentment out of the question engages his kingdom in a bloody war his motive by the multitude whose sympathy for millions is easily overborne by the pleasure which their imagination finds in gaping at any novelty they observe in the conduct of a single person is deemed an admirable one men of feeling and reflection who disapprove of the dominion exercised by this motive on this occasion without always perceiving that it is the same motive which in other instances meets with their approbation deem it an abominable one and because the multitude who are the manufacturers of language have not given them a simple name to call it by they will call it by some such compound name as the love of false glory or false ambition yet in all four cases the motive is the same it is neither more nor less than the love of reputation  xxiii to the pleasures of power corresponds the motive which in a neutral sense may be termed the love of power people who are out of humour with it sometimes call it the lust of power in a good sense it is scarcely provided with a name in certain cases this motive as well as the love of reputation are confounded under the same name ambition this is not to be wondered at considering the intimate connexion there is between the two motives in many cases since it commonly happens that the same object which affords the one sort of pleasure affords the other sort at the same time for instance offices which are at once posts of honour and places of trust and since at any rate reputation is the road to power    if in order to gain a place in administration you poison the man who occupies it   if in the same view you propose a salutary plan for the advancement of the public welfare your motive is in both cases the same yet in the first case it is accounted criminal and abominable in the second case allowable and even laudable  xxiv to the pleasures as well as to the pains of the religious sanction corresponds a motive which has strictly speaking no perfectly neutral name applicable to all cases unless the word religion be admitted in this character though the word religion strictly speaking seems to mean not so much the motive itself as a kind of fictitious personage by whom the motive is supposed to be created or an assemblage of acts supposed to be dictated by that personage nor does it seem to be completely settled into a neutral sense in the same sense it is also in some cases styled religious zeal in other cases the fear of god the love of god though commonly contrasted with the fear of god does not come strictly under this head it coincides properly with a motive of a different denomination viz a kind of sympathy or goodwill which has the deity for its object in a good sense it is styled devotion piety and pious zeal in a bad sense it is styled in some cases superstition or superstitious zeal in other cases fanaticism or fanatic zeal in a sense not decidedly bad because not appropriated to this motive enthusiasm or enthusiastic zeal    in order to obtain the favour of the supreme being a man assassinates his lawful sovereign in this case the motive is now almost universally looked upon as abominable and is termed fanaticism formerly it was by great numbers accounted laudable and was by them called pious zeal   in the same view a man lashes himself with thongs in this case in yonder house the motive is accounted laudable and is called pious zeal in the next house it is deemed contemptible and called superstition   in the same view a man eats a piece of bread or at least what to external appearance is a piece of bread with certain ceremonies in this case in yonder house his motive is looked upon as laudable and is styled piety and devotion in the next house it is deemed abominable and styled superstition as before perhaps even it is absurdly styled impiety   in the same view a man holds a cow by the tail while he is dying on the thames the motive would in this case be deemed contemptible and called superstition on the ganges it is deemed meritorious and called piety   in the same view a man bestows a large sum in works of charity or public utility in this case the motive is styled laudable by those at least to whom the works in question appear to come under this description and by these at least it would be styled piety yet in all these cases the motive is precisely the same it is neither more nor less than the motive belonging to the religious sanction    xxv to the pleasures of sympathy corresponds the motive which in a neutral sense is termed goodwill the word sympathy may also be used on this occasion though the sense of it seems to be rather more extensive in a good sense it is styled benevolence and in certain cases philanthropy and in a figurative way brotherly love in others humanity in others charity in others pity and compassion in others mercy in others gratitude in others tenderness in others patriotism in others public spirit love is also employed in this as in so many other senses in a bad sense it has no name applicable to it in all cases in particular cases it is styled partiality the word zeal with certain epithets prefixed to it might also be employed sometimes on this occasion though the sense of it be more extensive applying sometimes to ill as well as to good will it is thus we speak of party zeal national zeal and public zeal the word attachment is also used with the like epithets we also say familyattachment the french expression esprit de corps for which as yet there seems to be scarcely any name in english might be rendered in some cases though rather inadequately by the terms corporation spirit corporation attachment or corporation zeal    a man who has set a town on fire is apprehended and committed out of regard or compassion for him you help him to break prison in this case the generality of people will probably scarcely know whether to condemn your motive or to applaud it those who condemn your conduct will be disposed rather to impute it to some other motive if they style it benevolence or compassion they will be for prefixing an epithet and calling it false benevolence or false compassion     the man is taken again and is put upon his trial to save him you swear falsely in his favour people who would not call your motive a bad one before will perhaps call it so now   a man is at law with you about an estate he has no right to it the judge knows this yet having an esteem or affection for your adversary adjudges it to him in this case the motive is by every body deemed abominable and is termed injustice and partiality   you detect a statesman in receiving bribes out of regard to the public interest you give information of it and prosecute him in this case by all who acknowledge your conduct to have originated from this motive your motive will be deemed a laudable one and styled public spirit but his friends and adherents will not choose to account for your conduct in any such manner they will rather attribute it to party enmity   you find a man on the point of starving you relieve him and save his life in this case your motive will by every body be accounted laudable and it will be termed compassion pity charity benevolence yet in all these cases the motive is the same it is neither more nor less than the motive of goodwill  xxvi to the pleasures of malevolence or antipathy corresponds the motive which in a neutral sense is termed antipathy or displeasure and in particular cases dislike aversion abhorrence and indignation in a neutral sense or perhaps a sense leaning a little to the bad side illwill and in particular cases anger wrath and enmity in a bad sense it is styled in different cases wrath spleen illhumour hatred malice rancour rage fury cruelty tyranny envy jealousy revenge misanthropy and by other names which it is hardly worth while to endeavour to collect   like goodwill it is used with epithets expressive of the persons who are the objects of the affection hence we hear of party enmity party rage and so forth in a good sense there seems to be no single name for it in compound expressions it may be spoken of in such a sense by epithets such as just and laudable prefixed to words that are used in a neutral or nearly neutral sense    you rob a man he prosecutes you and gets you punished out of resentment you set upon him and hang him with your own hands in this case your motive will universally be deemed detestable and will be called malice cruelty revenge and so forth   a man has stolen a little money from you out of resentment you prosecute him and get him hanged by course of law in this case people will probably be a little divided in their opinions about your motive your friends will deem it a laudable one and call it a just or laudable resentment your enemies will perhaps be disposed to deem it blameable and call it cruelty malice revenge and so forth to obviate which your friends will try perhaps to change the motive and call it public spirit   a man has murdered your father out of resentment you prosecute him and get him put to death in course of law in this case your motive will be universally deemed a laudable one and styled as before a just or laudable resentment and your friends in order to bring forward the more amiable principle from which the malevolent one which was your immediate motive took its rise will be for keeping the latter out of sight speaking of the former only under some such name as filial piety yet in all these cases the motive is the same it is neither more nor less than the motive of illwill  xxvii to the several sorts of pains or at least to all such of them as are conceived to subsist in an intense degree and to death which as far as we can perceive is the termination of all the pleasures as well as all the pains we are acquainted with corresponds the motive which in a neutral sense is styled in general selfpreservation the desire of preserving ones self from the pain or evil in question now in many instances the desire of pleasure and the sense of pain run into one another undistinguishably selfpreservation therefore where the degree of the pain which it corresponds to is but slight will scarcely be distinguishable by any precise line from the motives corresponding to the several sorts of pleasures thus in the case of the pains of hunger and thirst physical want will in many cases be scarcely distinguishable from physical desire in some cases it is styled still in a neutral sense selfdefence between the pleasures and the pains of the moral and religious sanctions and consequently of the motives that correspond to them as likewise between the pleasures of amity and the pains of enmity this want of boundaries has already been taken notice of   the case is the same between the pleasures of wealth and the pains of privation corresponding to those pleasures there are many cases therefore in which it will be difficult to distinguish the motive of selfpreservation from pecuniary interest from the desire of ingratiating ones self from the love of reputation and from religious hope in which cases those more specific and explicit names will naturally be preferred to this general and inexplicit one there are also a multitude of compound names which either are already in use or might be devised to distinguish the specific branches of the motive of selfpreservation from those several motives of a pleasurable origin such as the fear of poverty the fear of losing such or such a mans regard the fear of shame and the fear of god moreover to the evil of death corresponds in a neutral sense the love of life in a bad sense cowardice which corresponds also to the pains of the senses at least when considered as subsisting in an acute degree there seems to be no name for the love of life that has a good sense unless it be the vague and general name of prudence    to save yourself from being hanged pilloried imprisoned or fined you poison the only person who can give evidence against you in this case your motive will universally be styled abominable but as the term selfpreservation has no bad sense people will not care to make this use of it they will be apt rather to change the motive and call it malice   a woman having been just delivered of an illegitimate child in order to save herself from shame destroys the child or abandons it in this case also people will call the motive a bad one and not caring to speak of it under a neutral name they will be apt to change the motive and call it by some such name as cruelty   to save the expense of a halfpenny you suffer a man whom you could preserve at that expense to perish with want before your eyes in this case your motive will be universally deemed an abominable one and to avoid calling it by so indulgent a name as selfpreservation people will be apt to call it avarice and niggardliness with which indeed in this case it indistinguishably coincides for the sake of finding a more reproachful appellation they will be apt likewise to change the motive and term it cruelty   to put an end to the pain of hunger you steal a loaf of bread in this case your motive will scarcely perhaps be deemed a very bad one and in order to express more indulgence for it people will be apt to find a stronger name for it than selfpreservation terming it necessity   to save yourself from drowning you beat off an innocent man who has got hold of the same plank in this case your motive will in general be deemed neither good nor bad and it will be termed selfpreservation or necessity or the love of life   to save your life from a gang of robbers you kill them in the conflict in this case the motive may perhaps be deemed rather laudable than otherwise and besides selfpreservation is styled also selfdefence   a soldier is sent out upon a party against a weaker party of the enemy before he gets up with them to save his life he runs away in this case the motive will universally be deemed a contemptible one and will be called cowardice yet in all these various cases the motive is still the same it is neither more nor less than selfpreservation  xxviii in particular to the pains of exertion corresponds the motive which in a neutral sense may be termed the love of ease or by a longer circumlocution the desire of avoiding trouble in a bad sense it is termed indolence   it seems to have no name that carries with it a good sense    to save the trouble of taking care of it a parent leaves his child to perish in this case the motive will be deemed an abominable one and because indolence will seem too mild a name for it the motive will perhaps be changed and spoken of under some such term as cruelty   to save yourself from an illegal slavery you make your escape in this case the motive will be deemed certainly not a bad one and because indolence or even the love of ease will be thought too unfavourable a name for it it will perhaps be styled the love of liberty   a mechanic in order to save his labour makes an improvement in his machinery in this case people will look upon his motive as a good one and finding no name for it that carries a good sense they will be disposed to keep the motive out of sight they will speak rather of his ingenuity than of the motive which was the means of his manifesting that quality yet in all these cases the motive is the same it is neither more nor less than the love of ease  xxix it appears then that there is no such thing as any sort of motive which is a bad one in itself nor consequently any such thing as a sort of motive which in itself is exclusively a good one and as to their effects it appears too that these are sometimes bad at other times either indifferent or good and this appears to be the case with every sort of motive if any sort of motive then is either good or bad on the score of its effects this is the case only on individual occasions and with individual motives and this is the case with one sort of motive as well as with another if any sort of motive then can in consideration of its effects be termed with any propriety a bad one it can only be with reference to the balance of all the effects it may have had of both kinds within a given period that is of its most usual tendency  xxx what then it will be said are not lust cruelty avarice bad motives is there so much as any one individual occasion in which motives like these can be otherwise than bad no certainly and yet the proposition that there is no one sort of motive but what will on many occasions be a good one is nevertheless true the fact is that these are names which if properly applied are never applied but in the cases where the motives they signify happen to be bad the names of those motives considered apart from their effects are sexual desire displeasure and pecuniary interest to sexual desire when the effects of it are looked upon as bad is given the name of lust now lust is always a bad motive why because if the case be such that the effects of the motive are not bad it does not go or at least ought not to go by the name of lust the case is then that when i say lust is a bad motive it is a proposition that merely concerns the import of the word lust and which would be false if transferred to the other word used for the same motive sexual desire hence we see the emptiness of all those rhapsodies of commonplace morality which consist in the taking of such names as lust cruelty and avarice and branding them with marks of reprobation applied to the thing they are false applied to the name they are true indeed but nugatory would you do a real service to mankind show them the cases in which sexual desire merits the name of lust displeasure that of cruelty and pecuniary interest that of avarice  xxxi if it were necessary to apply such denominations as good bad and indifferent to motives they might be classed in the following manner in consideration of the most frequent complexion of their effects in the class of good motives might be placed the articles of   goodwill   love of reputation   desire of amity and   religion in the class of bad motives   displeasure in the class of neutral or indifferent motives   physical desire   pecuniary interest   love of power   selfpreservation as including the fear of the pains of the senses the love of ease and the love of life  xxxii this method of arrangement however cannot but be imperfect and the nomenclature belonging to it is in danger of being fallacious for by what method of investigation can a man be assured that with regard to the motives ranked under the name of good the good effects they have had from the beginning of the world have in each of the four species comprised under this name been superior to the bad still more difficulty would a man find in assuring himself that with regard to those which are ranked under the name of neutral or indifferent the effects they have had have exactly balanced each other the value of the good being neither greater nor less than that of the bad it is to be considered that the interests of the person himself can no more be left out of the estimate than those of the rest of the community for what would become of the species if it were not for the motives of hunger and thirst sexual desire the fear of pain and the love of life nor in the actual constitution of human nature is the motive of displeasure less necessary perhaps than any of the others although a system in which the business of life might be carried on without it might possibly be conceived it seems therefore that they could scarcely without great danger of mistakes be distinguished in this manner even with reference to each other  xxxiii the only way it should seem in which a motive can with safety and propriety be styled good or bad is with reference to its effects in each individual instance and principally from the intention it gives birth to from which arise as will be shown hereafter the most material part of its effects a motive is good when the intention it gives birth to is a good one bad when the intention is a bad one and an intention is good or bad according to the material consequences that are the objects of it so far is it from the goodness of the intentions being to be known only from the species of the motive but from one and the same motive as we have seen may result intentions of every sort of complexion whatsoever this circumstance therefore can afford no clue for the arrangement of the several sorts of motives  xxxiv a more commodious method therefore it should seem would be to distribute them according to the influence which they appear to have on the interests of the other members of the community laying those of the party himself out of the question to wit according to the tendency which they appear to have to unite or disunite his interests and theirs on this plan they may be distinguished into social dissocial and selfregarding in the social class may be reckoned   goodwill   love of reputation   desire of amity   religion in the dissocial may be placed   displeasure in the selfregarding class   physical desire   pecuniary interest   love of power   selfpreservation as including the fear of the pains of the senses the love of ease and the love of life  xxxv with respect to the motives that have been termed social if any farther distinction should be of use to that of goodwill alone may be applied the epithet of purelysocial while the love of reputation the desire of amity and the motive of religion may together be comprised under the division of semisocial the social tendency being much more constant and unequivocal in the former than in any of the three latter indeed these last social as they may be termed are selfregarding at the same time    sect   order of preeminence among motives xxxvi of all these sorts of motives goodwill is that of which the dictates 0 taken in a general view are surest of coinciding with those of the principle of utility for the dictates of utility are neither more nor less than the dictates of the most extensive   and enlightened that is welladvised   benevolence the dictates of the other motives may be conformable to those of utility or repugnant as it may happen  xxxvii in this however it is taken for granted that in the case in question the dictates of benevolence are not contradicted by those of a more extensive that is enlarged benevolence now when the dictates of benevolence as respecting the interests of a certain set of persons are repugnant to the dictates of the same motive as respecting the more important   interests of another set of persons the former dictates it is evident are repealed as it were by the latter and a man were he to be governed by the former could scarcely with propriety be said to be governed by the dictates of benevolence on this account were the motives on both sides sure to be alike present to a mans mind the case of such a repugnancy would hardly be worth distinguishing since the partial benevolence might be considered as swallowed up in the more extensive if the former prevailed and governed the action it must be considered as not owing its birth to benevolence but to some other motive if the latter prevailed the former might be considered as having no effect but the case is that a partial benevolence may govern the action without entering into any direct competition with the more extensive benevolence which would forbid it because the interests of the less numerous assemblage of persons may be present to a mans mind at a time when those of the more numerous are either not present or if present make no impression it is in this way that the dictates of this motive may be repugnant to utility yet still be the dictates of benevolence what makes those of private benevolence conformable upon the whole to the principle of utility is that in general they stand unopposed by those of public if they are repugnant to them it is only by accident what makes them the more conformable is that in a civilized society in most of the cases in which they would of themselves be apt to run counter to those of public benevolence they find themselves opposed by stronger motives of the selfregarding class which are played off against them by the laws and that it is only in cases where they stand unopposed by the other more salutary dictates that they are left free an act of injustice or cruelty committed by a man for the sake of his father or his son is punished and with reason as much as if it were committed for his own  xxxviii after goodwill the motive of which the dictates seem to have the next best chance for coinciding with those of utility is that of the love of reputation there is but one circumstance which prevents the dictates of this motive from coinciding in all cases with those of the former this is that men in their likings and dislikings in the dispositions they manifest to annex to any mode of conduct their approbation or their disapprobation and in consequence to the person who appears to practice it their good or their ill will do not govern themselves exclusively by the principle of utility sometimes it is the principle of asceticism they are guided by sometimes the principle of sympathy and antipathy there is another circumstance which diminishes not their conformity to the principle of utility but only their efficacy in comparison with the dictates of the motive of benevolence the dictates of this motive will operate as strongly in secret as in public whether it appears likely that the conduct which they recommend will be known or not those of the love of reputation will coincide with those of benevolence only in proportion as a mans conduct seems likely to be known this circumstance however does not make so much difference as at first sight might appear acts in proportion as they are material are apt to become known   and in point of reputation the slightest suspicion often serves for proof besides if an act be a disreputable one it is not any assurance a man can have of the secrecy of the particular act in question that will of course surmount the objections he may have against engaging in it though the act in question should remain secret it will go towards forming a habit which may give birth to other acts that may not meet with the same good fortune there is no human being perhaps who is at years of discretion on whom considerations of this sort have not some weight and they have the more weight upon a man in proportion to the strength of his intellectual powers and the firmness of his mind   add to this the influence which habit itself when once formed has in restraining a man from acts towards which from the view of the disrepute annexed to them as well as from any other cause he has contracted an aversion the influence of habit in such cases is a matter of fact which though not readily accounted for is acknowledged and indubitable    xxxix after the dictates of the love of reputation come as it should seem those of the desire of amity the former are disposed to coincide with those of utility inasmuch as they are disposed to coincide with those of benevolence now those of the desire of amity are apt also to coincide in a certain sort with those of benevolence but the sort of benevolence with the dictates of which the love of reputation coincides is the more extensive that with which those of the desire of amity coincide the less extensive those of the love of amity have still however the advantage of those of the selfregarding motives the former at one period or other of his life dispose a man to contribute to the happiness of a considerable number of persons the latter from the beginning of life to the end of it confine themselves to the care of that single individual the dictates of the desire of amity it is plain will approach nearer to a coincidence with those of the love of reputation and thence with those of utility in proportion cæteris paribus to the number of the persons whose amity a man has occasion to desire and hence it is for example that an english member of parliament with all his own weaknesses and all the follies of the people whose amity he has to cultivate is probably in general a better character than the secretary of a visier at constantinople or of a naïb in indostan  xl the dictates of religion are under the infinite diversity of religions so extremely variable that it is difficult to know what general account to give of them or in what rank to place the motive they belong to upon the mention of religion peoples first thoughts turn naturally to the religion they themselves profess this is a great source of miscalculation and has a tendency to place this sort of motive in a higher rank than it deserves the dictates of religion would coincide in all cases with those of utility were the being who is the object of religion universally supposed to be as benevolent as he is supposed to be wise and powerful and were the notions entertained of his benevolence at the same time as correct as those which are entertained of his wisdom and his power unhappily however neither of these is the case he is universally supposed to be allpowerful for by the deity what else does any man mean than the being whatever he be by whom every thing is done and as to knowledge by the same rule that he should know one thing he should know another these notions seem to be as correct for all material purposes as they are universal but among the votaries of religion of which number the multifarious fraternity of christians is but a small part there seem to be but few i will not say how few who are real believers in his benevolence they call him benevolent in words but they do not mean that he is so in reality they do not mean that he is benevolent as man is conceived to be benevolent they do not mean that he is benevolent in the only sense in which benevolence has a meaning for if they did they would recognize that the dictates of religion could be neither more nor less than the dictates of utility not a tittle different not a tittle less or more but the case is that on a thousand occasions they turn their backs on the principle of utility they go astray after the strange principles its antagonists sometimes it is the principle of asceticism sometimes the principle of sympathy and antipathy   accordingly the idea they bear in their minds on such occasions is but too often the idea of malevolence to which idea stripping it of its own proper name they bestow the specious appellation of the social motive   the dictates of religion in short are no other than the dictates of that principle which has been already mentioned under the name of the theological principle   these as has been observed are just as it may happen according to the biases of the person in question copies of the dictates of one or other of the three original principles sometimes indeed of the dictates of utility but frequently of those of asceticism or those of sympathy and antipathy in this respect they are only on a par with the dictates of the love of reputation in another they are below it the dictates of religion are in all places intermixed more or less with dictates unconformable to those of utility deduced from tests well or ill interpreted of the writings held for sacred by each sect unconformable by imposing practices sometimes inconvenient to a mans self sometimes pernicious to the rest of the community the sufferings of uncalled martyrs the calamities of holy wars and religious persecutions the mischiefs of intolerant laws objects which can here only be glanced at not detailed are so many additional mischiefs over and above the number of those which were ever brought into the world by the love of reputation on the other hand it is manifest that with respect to the power of operating in secret the dictates of religion have the same advantage over those of the love of reputation and the desire of amity as is possessed by the dictates of benevolence  xli happily the dictates of religion seem to approach nearer and nearer to a coincidence with those of utility every day but why because the dictates of the moral sanction do so and those coincide with or are influenced by these men of the worst religions influenced by the voice and practice of the surrounding world borrow continually a new and a new leaf out of the book of utility and with these in order not to break with their religion they endeavour sometimes with violence enough to patch together and adorn the repositories of their faith  xlii as to the selfregarding and dissocial motives the order that takes place among these and the preceding one in point of extraregarding influence is too evident to need insisting on as to the order that takes place among the motives of the selfregarding class considered in comparison with one another there seems to be no difference which on this occasion would be worth mentioning with respect to the dissocial motive it makes a difference with regard to its extraregarding effects from which of two sources it originates whether from selfregarding or from social considerations the displeasure you conceive against a man may be founded either on some act which offends you in the first instance or on an act which offends you no otherwise than because you look upon it as being prejudicial to some other party on whose behalf you interest yourself which other party may be of course either a determinate individual or any assemblage of individuals determinate or indeterminate 0 it is obvious enough that a motive though in itself dissocial may by issuing from a social origin possess a social tendency and that its tendency in this case is likely to be the more social the more enlarged the description is of the persons whose interests you espouse displeasure venting itself against a man on account of a mischief supposed to be done by him to the public may be more social in its effects than any goodwill the exertions of which are confined to an individual    sect   conflict among motives xliii when a man has it in contemplation to engage in any action he is frequently acted upon at the same time by the force of divers motives one motive or set of motives acting in one direction another motive or set of motives acting as it were in an opposite direction the motives on one side disposing him to engage in the action those on the other disposing him not to engage in it now any motive the influence of which tends to dispose him to engage in the action in question may be termed an impelling motive any motive the influence of which tends to dispose him not to engage in it a restraining motive but these appellations may of course be interchanged according as the act is of the positive kind or the negative    xliv it has been shown that there is no sort of motive but may give birth to any sort of action it follows therefore that there are no two motives but may come to be opposed to one another where the tendency of the act is bad the most common case is for it to have been dictated by a motive either of the selfregarding or of the dissocial class in such case the motive of benevolence has commonly been acting though ineffectually in the character of a restraining motive  xlv an example may be of use to show the variety of contending motives by which a man may be acted upon at the same time crillon a catholic at a time when it was generally thought meritorious among catholics to extirpate protestants was ordered by his king charles ix of france to fall privately upon coligny a protestant and assassinate him his answer was excuse me sire but ill fight him with all my heart   here then were all the three forces above mentioned including that of the political sanction acting upon him at once by the political sanction or at least so much of the force of it as such a mandate from such a sovereign issued on such an occasion might be supposed to carry with it he was enjoined to put coligny to death in the way of assassination by the religious sanction that is by the dictates of religious zeal he was enjoined to put him to death in any way by the moral sanction or in other words by the dictates of honour that is of the love of reputation he was permitted which permission when coupled with the mandates of his sovereign operated he conceived as an injunction to fight the adversary upon equal terms by the dictates of enlarged benevolence supposing the mandate to be unjustifiable he was enjoined not to attempt his life in any way but to remain at peace with him supposing the mandate to be unjustifiable by the dictates of private benevolence he was enjoined not to meddle with him at any rate among this confusion of repugnant dictates crillon it seems gave the preference in the first place to those of honour in the next place to those of benevolence he would have fought had his offer been accepted as it was not he remained at peace  here a multitude of questions might arise supposing the dictates of the political sanction to follow the mandate of the sovereign of what kind were the motives which they afforded him for compliance the answer is of the selfregarding kind at any rate inasmuch as by the supposition it was in the power of the sovereign to punish him for noncompliance or reward him for compliance did they afford him the motive of religion i mean independently of the circumstance of heresy above mentioned the answer is yes if his notion was that it was gods pleasure he should comply with them no if it was not did they afford him the motive of the love of reputation yes if it was his notion that the world would expect and require that he should comply with them no if it was not did they afford him that of benevolence yes if it was his notion that the community would upon the whole be the better for his complying with them no if it was not but did the dictates of the political sanction in the case in question actually follow the mandates of the sovereign in other words was such a mandate legal this we see is a mere question of local jurisprudence altogether foreign to the present purpose  xlvi what is here said about the goodness and badness of motives is far from being a mere matter of words there will be occasion to make use of it hereafter for various important purposes i shall have need of it for the sake of dissipating various prejudices which are of disservice to the community sometimes by cherishing the flame of civil dissensions   at other times by obstructing the course of justice it will be shown that in the case of many offences   the consideration of the motive is a most material one for that in the first place it makes a very material difference in the magnitude of the mischief   in the next place that it is easy to be ascertained and thence may be made a ground for a difference in the demand for punishment but that in other cases it is altogether incapable of being ascertained and that were it capable of being ever so well ascertained good or bad it could make no difference in the demand for punishment that in all cases the motive that may happen to govern a prosecutor is a consideration totally immaterial whence may be seen the mischievousness of the prejudice that is so apt to be entertained against informers and the consequence it is of that the judge in particular should be proof against the influence of such delusions  lastly the subject of motives is one with which it is necessary to be acquainted in order to pass a judgment on any means that may be proposed for combating offenses in their source    but before the theoretical foundation for these practical observations can be completely laid it is necessary we should say something on the subject of disposition which accordingly will furnish matter for the ensuing chapter  chapter xi of human dispositions in general i in the foregoing chapter it has been shown at large that goodness or badness cannot with any propriety be predicated of motives is there nothing then about a man that may properly be termed good or bad when on such or such an occasion he suffers himself to be governed by such or such a motive yes certainly his disposition now disposition is a kind of fictitious entity feigned for the convenience of discourse in order to express what there is supposed to be permanent in a mans frame of mind where on such or such an occasion he has been influenced by such or such a motive to engage in an act which as it appeared to him was of such or such a tendency  ii it is with disposition as with every thing else it will be good or bad according to its effects according to the effects it has in augmenting or diminishing the happiness of the community a mans disposition may accordingly be considered in two points of view according to the influence it has either   on his own happiness or   on the happiness of others viewed in both these lights together or in either of them indiscriminately it may be termed on the one hand good on the other bad or in flagrant cases depraved   viewed in the former of these lights it has scarcely any peculiar name which has as yet been appropriated to it it might be termed though but inexpressively frail or infirm on the one hand sound or firm on the other viewed in the other light it might be termed beneficent or meritorious on the one hand pernicious or mischievous on the other now of that branch of a mans disposition the effects of which regard in the first instance only himself there needs not much to be said here to reform it when bad is the business rather of the moralist than the legislator nor is it susceptible of those various modifications which make so material difference in the effects of the other again with respect to that part of it the effects whereof regard others in the first instance it is only in as far as it is of a mischievous nature that the penal branch of law has any immediate concern with it in as far as it may be of a beneficent nature it belongs to a hitherto but little cultivated and as yet unnamed branch of law which might be styled the remuneratory  iii a man then is said to be of a mischievous disposition when by the influence of no matter what motives he is presumed to be more apt to engage or form intentions of engaging in acts which are apparently of a pernicious tendency than in such as are apparently of a beneficial tendency of a meritorious or beneficent disposition in the opposite case  iv i say presumed for by the supposition all that appears is one single action attended with one single train of circumstances but from that degree of consistency and uniformity which experience has shown to be observable in the different actions of the same person the probable existence past or future of a number of acts of a similar nature is naturally and justly inferred from the observation of one single one under such circumstances such as the motive proves to be in one instance such is the disposition to be presumed to be in others  v i say apparently mischievous that is apparently with regard to him such as to him appear to possess that tendency for from the mere event independent of what to him it appears beforehand likely to be nothing can be inferred on either side if to him it appears likely to be mischievous in such case though in the upshot it should prove innocent or even beneficial it makes no difference there is not the less reason for presuming his disposition to be a bad one if to him it appears likely to be beneficial or innocent in such case though in the upshot it should prove pernicious there is not the more reason on that account for presuming his disposition to be a good one and here we see the importance of the circumstances of intentionality   consciousness 0 unconsciousness 0 and missupposal 0  vi the truth of these positions depends upon two others both of them sufficiently verified by experience the one is that in the ordinary course of things the consequences of actions commonly turn out conformable to intentions a man who sets up a butchers shop and deals in beef when he intends to knock down an ox commonly does knock down an ox though by some unlucky accident he may chance to miss his blow and knock down a man he who sets up a grocers shop and deals sugar when he intends to sell sugar commonly does sell sugar though by some unlucky accident he may chance to sell arsenic in the room of it  vii the other is that a man who entertains intentions of doing mischief at one time is apt to entertain the like intentions at another    viii there are two circumstances upon which the nature of the disposition as indicated by any act is liable to depend   the apparent tendency of the act   the nature of the motive which gave birth to it this dependency is subject to different rules according to the nature of the motive in stating them i suppose all along the apparent tendency of the act to be as it commonly is the same as the real  ix   where the tendency of the act is good and the motive is of the selfregarding kind in this case the motive affords no inference on either side it affords no indication of a good disposition but neither does it afford any indication of a bad one  a baker sells his bread to a hungry man who asks for it this we see is one of those acts of which in ordinary cases the tendency is unquestionably good the bakers motive is the ordinary commercial motive of pecuniary interest it is plain that there is nothing in the transaction thus stated that can afford the least ground for presuming that the baker is a better or a worse man than any of his neighbours  x   where the tendency of the act is bad and the motive as before is of the selfregarding kind in this case the disposition indicated is a mischievous one  a man steals bread out of a bakers shop this is one of those acts of which the tendency will readily be acknowledged to be bad why and in what respects it is so will be stated farther on   his motive we will say is that of pecuniary interest the desire of getting the value of the bread for nothing his disposition accordingly appears to be a bad one for every one will allow a thievish disposition to be a bad one  xi   where the tendency of the act is good and the motive is the purely social one of goodwill in this case the disposition indicated is a beneficent one  a baker gives a poor man a loaf of bread his motive is compassion a name given to the motive of benevolence in particular cases of its operation the disposition indicated by the baker in this case is such as every man will be ready enough to acknowledge to be a good one  xii   where the tendency of the act is bad and the motive is the purely social one of goodwill even in this case the disposition which the motive indicates is dubious it may be a mischievous or a meritorious one as it happens according as the mischievousness of the act is more or less apparent  xiii it may be thought that a case of this sort cannot exist and that to suppose it is a contradiction in terms for the act is one which by the supposition the agent knows to be a mischievous one how then can it be that goodwill that is the desire of doing good could have been the motive that led him into it to reconcile this we must advert to the distinction between enlarged benevolence and confined   the motive that led him into it was that of confined benevolence had he followed the dictates of enlarged benevolence he would not have done what he did now although he followed the dictates of that branch of benevolence which in any single instance of its exertion is mischievous when opposed to the other yet as the cases which call for the exertion of the former are beyond comparison more numerous than those which call for the exertion of the latter the disposition indicated by him in following the impulse of the former will often be such as in a man of the common run of men may be allowed to be a good one upon the whole  xiv a man with a numerous family of children on the point of starving goes into a bakers shop steals a loaf divides it all among the children reserving none of it for himself it will be hard to infer that that mans disposition is a mischievous one upon the whole alter the case give him but one child and that hungry perhaps but in no imminent danger of starving and now let the man set fire to a house full of people for the sake of stealing money out of it to buy the bread with the disposition here indicated will hardly be looked upon as a good one  xv another case will appear more difficult to decide than either ravaillac assassinated one of the best and wisest of sovereigns at a time when a good and wise sovereign a blessing at all times so valuable to a state was particularly precious and that to the inhabitants of a populous and extensive empire he is taken and doomed to the most excruciating tortures his son well persuaded of his being a sincere penitent and that mankind in case of his being at large would have nothing more to fear from him effectuates his escape is this then a sign of a good disposition in the son or of a bad one perhaps some will answer of a bad one for besides the interest which the nation has in the sufferings of such a criminal on the score of the example the future good behaviour of such a criminal is more than any one can have sufficient ground to be persuaded of  xvi well then let ravaillac the son not facilitate his fathers escape but content himself with conveying poison to him that at the price of an easier death he may escape his torments the decision will now perhaps be more difficult the act is a wrong one let it be allowed and such as ought by all means to be punished but is the disposition manifested by it a bad one because the young man breaks the laws in this one instance is it probable that if let alone he would break the laws in ordinary instances for the satisfaction of any inordinate desires of his own the answer of most men would probably be in the negative  xvii   where the tendency of the act is good and the motive is a semisocial one the love of reputation in this case the disposition indicated is a good one  in a time of scarcity a baker for the sake of gaining the esteem of the neighbourhood distributes bread gratis among the industrious poor let this be taken for granted and let it be allowed to be a matter of uncertainty whether he had any real feeling for the sufferings of those whom he has relieved or no his disposition for all that cannot with any pretence of reason be termed otherwise than a good and beneficent one it can only be in consequence of some very idle prejudice if it receives a different name    xviii   where the tendency of the act is bad and the motive as before is a semisocial one the love of reputation in this case the disposition which it indicates is more or less good or bad in the first place according as the tendency of the act is more or less mischievous in the next place according as the dictates of the moral sanction in the society in question approach more or less to a coincidence with those of utility it does not seem probable that in any nation which is in a state of tolerable civilization in short in any nation in which such rules as these can come to be consulted the dictates of the moral sanction will so far recede from a coincidence with those of utility that is of enlightened benevolence that the disposition indicated in this case can be otherwise than a good one upon the whole  xix an indian receives an injury real or imaginary from an indian of another tribe he revenges it upon the person of his antagonist with the most excruciating torments the case being that cruelties inflicted on such an occasion gain him reputation in his own tribe the disposition manifested in such a case can never be deemed a good one among a people ever so few degrees advanced in point of civilization above the indians  xx a nobleman to come back to europe contracts a debt with a poor tradesman the same nobleman presently afterwards contracts a debt to the same amount to another nobleman at play he is unable to pay both he pays the whole debt to the companion of his amusements and no part of it to the tradesman the disposition manifested in this case can scarcely be termed otherwise than a bad one it is certainly however not so bad as if he had paid neither the principle of love of reputation or as it is called in the case of this partial application of it honour is here opposed to the worthier principle of benevolence and gets the better of it but it gets the better also of the selfregarding principle of pecuniary interest the disposition therefore which it indicates although not so good a one as that in which the principle of benevolence predominates is better than one in which the principle of selfinterest predominates he would be the better for having more benevolence but would he be the better for having no honour this seems to admit of great dispute    xxi   where the tendency of the act is good and the motive is the semisocial one of religion in this case the disposition indicated by it considered with respect to the influence of it on the mans conduct towards others is manifestly a beneficent and meritorious one  a baker distributes bread gratis among the industrious poor it is not that he feels for their distresses nor is it for the sake of gaining reputation among his neighbours it is for the sake of gaining the favour of the deity to whom he takes for granted such conduct will be acceptable the disposition manifested by such conduct is plainly what every man would call a good one  xxii   where the tendency of the act is bad and the motive is that of religion as before in this case the disposition is dubious it is good or bad and more or less good or bad in the first place as the tendency of the act is more or less mischievous in the next place according as the religious tenets of the person in question approach more or less to a coincidence with the dictates of utility  xxiii it should seem from history that even in nations in a tolerable state of civilization in other respects the dictates of religion have been found so far to recede from a coincidence with those of utility in other words from those of enlightened benevolence that the disposition indicated in this case may even be a bad one upon the whole this however is no objection to the inference which it affords of a good disposition in those countries such as perhaps are most of the countries of europe at present in which its dictates respecting the conduct of a man towards other men approach very nearly to a coincidence with those of utility the dictates of religion in their application to the conduct of a man in what concerns himself alone seem in most european nations to savour a good deal of the ascetic principle but the obedience to such mistaken dictates indicates not any such disposition as is likely to break out into acts of pernicious tendency with respect to others instances in which the dictates of religion lead a man into acts which are pernicious in this latter view seem at present to be but rare unless it be acts of persecution or impolitic measures on the part of government where the law itself is either the principal actor or an accomplice in the mischief ravaillac instigated by no other motive than this gave his country one of the most fatal stabs that a country ever received from a single hand but happily the ravaillacs are but rare they have been more frequent however in france than in any other country during the same period and it is remarkable that in every instance it is this motive that has produced them when they do appear however nobody i suppose but such as themselves will be for terming a disposition such as they manifest a good one it seems hardly to be denied but that they are just so much the worse for their notions of religion and that had they been left to the sole guidance of benevolence and the love of reputation without any religion at all it would have been but so much the better for mankind one may say nearly the same thing perhaps of those persons who without any particular obligation have taken an active part in the execution of laws made for the punishment of those who have the misfortune to differ with the magistrate in matters of religion much more of the legislator himself who has put it in their power if louis xiv had had no religion france would not have lost  00000 of its most valuable subjects the same thing may be said of the authors of the wars called holy ones whether waged against persons called infidels or persons branded with the still more odious name of heretics in denmark not a great many years ago a sect is said to have arisen who by a strange perversion of reason took it into their heads that by leading to repentance murder or any other horrid crime might be made the road to heaven it should all along however be observed that instances of this latter kind were always rare and that in almost all the countries of europe instances of the former kind though once abundantly frequent have for some time ceased in certain countries however persecution at home or what produces a degree of restraint which is one part of the mischiefs of persecution i mean the disposition to persecute whensoever occasion happens is not yet at an end insomuch that if there is no actual persecution it is only because there are no heretics and if there are no heretics it is only because there are no thinkers    xxiv   where the tendency of the act is good and the motive as before is the dissocial one of illwill in this case the motive seems not to afford any indication on either side it is no indication of a good disposition but neither is it any indication of a bad one  you have detected a baker in selling short weight you prosecute him for the cheat it is not for the sake of gain that you engaged in the prosecution for there is nothing to be got by it it is not from public spirit it is not for the sake of reputation for there is no reputation to be got by it it is not in the view of pleasing the deity it is merely on account of a quarrel you have with the man you prosecute from the transaction as thus stated there does not seem to be any thing to be said either in favour of your disposition or against it the tendency of the act is good but you would not have engaged in it had it not been from a motive which there seems no particular reason to conclude will ever prompt you to engage in an act of the same kind again your motive is of that sort which may with least impropriety be termed a bad one but the act is of that sort which were it engaged in ever so often could never have any evil tendency nor indeed any other tendency than a good one by the supposition the motive it happened to be dictated by was that of illwill but the act itself is of such a nature as to have wanted nothing but sufficient discernment on your part in order to have been dictated by the most enlarged benevolence now from a mans having suffered himself to be induced to gratify his resentment by means of an act of which the tendency is good it by no means follows that he would be ready on another occasion through the influence of the same sort of motive to engage in any act of which the tendency is a bad one the motive that impelled you was a dissocial one but what social motive could there have been to restrain you none but what might have been outweighed by a more enlarged motive of the same kind now because the dissocial motive prevailed when it stood alone it by no means follows that it would prevail when it had a social one to combat it  xxv  0 where the tendency of the act is bad and the motive is the dissocial one of malevolence in this case the disposition it indicates is of course a mischievous one  the man who stole the bread from the baker as before did it with no other view than merely to impoverish and afflict him accordingly when he had got the bread he did not eat or sell it but destroyed it that the disposition evidenced by such a transaction is a bad one is what every body must perceive immediately  xxvi thus much with respect to the circumstances from which the mischievousness or meritoriousness of a mans disposition is to be inferred in the gross we come now to the measure of that mischievousness or meritoriousness as resulting from those circumstances now with meritorious acts and dispositions we have no direct concern in the present work all that penal law is concerned to do is to measure the depravity of the disposition where the act is mischievous to this object therefore we shall here confine ourselves  xxvii it is evident that the nature of a mans disposition must depend upon the nature of the motives he is apt to be influenced by in other words upon the degree of his sensibility to the force of such and such motives for his disposition is as it were the sum of his intentions the disposition he is of during a certain period the sum or result of his intentions during that period if of the acts he has been intending to engage in during the supposed period those which are apparently of a mischievous tendency bear a large proportion to those which appear to him to be of the contrary tendency his disposition will be of the mischievous cast if but a small proportion of the innocent or upright  xxviii now intentions like every thing else are produced by the things that are their causes and the causes of intentions are motives if on any occasion a man forms either a good or a bad intention it must be by the influence of some motive  xxix when the act which a motive prompts a man to engage in is of a mischievous nature it may for distinctions sake be termed a seducing or corrupting motive in which case also any motive which in opposition to the former acts in the character of a restraining motive may be styled a tutelary preservatory or preserving motive  xxx tutelary motives may again be distinguished into standing or constant and occasional by standing tutelary motives i mean such as act with more or less force in all or at least in most cases tending to restrain a man from any mischievous acts he may be prompted to engage in and that with a force which depends upon the general nature of the act rather than upon any accidental circumstance with which any individual act of that sort may happen to be accompanied by occasional tutelary motives i mean such motives as may chance to act in this direction or not according to the nature of the act and of the particular occasion on which the engaging in it is brought into contemplation  xxxi now it has been shown that there is no sort of motive by which a man may not be prompted to engage in acts that are of a mischievous nature that is which may not come to act in the capacity of a seducing motive it has been shown on the other hand that there are some motives which are remarkably less likely to operate in this way than others it has also been shown that the least likely of all is that of benevolence or goodwill the most common tendency of which it has been shown is to act in the character of a tutelary motive it has also been shown that even when by accident it acts in one way in the character of a seducing motive still in another way it acts in the opposite character of a tutelary one the motive of goodwill in as far as it respects the interests of one set of persons may prompt a man to engage in acts which are productive of mischief to another and more extensive set but this is only because his goodwill is imperfect and confined not taking into contemplation the interests of all the persons whose interests are at stake the same motive were the affection it issued from more enlarged would operate effectually in the character of a constraining motive against that very act to which by the supposition it gives birth this same sort of motive may therefore without any real contradiction or deviation from truth be ranked in the number of standing tutelary motives notwithstanding the occasions in which it may act at the same time in the character of a seducing one  xxxii the same observation nearly may be applied to the semisocial motive of love of reputation the force of this like that of the former is liable to be divided against itself as in the case of goodwill the interests of some of the persons who may be the objects of that sentiment are liable to be at variance with those of others so in the case of love of reputation the sentiments of some of the persons whose good opinion is desired may be at variance with the sentiments of other persons of that number now in the case of an act which is really of a mischievous nature it can scarcely happen that there shall be no persons whatever who will look upon it with an eye of disapprobation it can scarcely ever happen therefore that an act really mischievous shall not have some part at least if not the whole of the force of this motive to oppose it nor therefore that this motive should not act with some degree of force in the character of a tutelary motive this therefore may be set down as another article in the catalogue of standing tutelary motives  xxxiii the same observation may be applied to the desire of amity though not in altogether equal measure for notwithstanding the mischievousness of an act it may happen without much difficulty that all the persons for whose amity a man entertains any particular present desire which is accompanied with expectation may concur in regarding it with an eye rather of approbation than the contrary this is but too apt to be the case among such fraternities as those of thieves smugglers and many other denominations of offenders this however is not constantly nor indeed most commonly the case insomuch that the desire of amity may still be regarded upon the whole as a tutelary motive were it only from the closeness of its connexion with the love of reputation and it may be ranked among standing tutelary motives since where it does apply the force with which it acts depends not upon the occasional circumstances of the act which it opposes but upon principles as general as those upon which depend the action of the other semisocial motives  xxxiv the motive of religion is not altogether in the same case with the three former the force of it is not like theirs liable to be divided against itself i mean in the civilized nations of modern times among whom the notion of the unity of the godhead is universal in times of classical antiquity it was otherwise if a man got venus on his side pallas was on the other if æolus was for him neptune was against him æneas with all his piety had but a partial interest at the court of heaven that matter stands upon a different footing nowadays in any given person the force of religion whatever it be is now all of it on one side it may balance indeed on which side it shall declare itself and it may declare itself as we have seen already in but too many instances on the wrong as well as on the right it has been at least till lately perhaps is still accustomed so much to declare itself on the wrong side and that in such material instances that on that account it seemed not proper to place it in point of social tendency on a level altogether with the motive of benevolence where it does act however as it does in by far the greatest number of cases in opposition to the ordinary seducing motives it acts like the motive of benevolence in an uniform manner not depending upon the particular circumstances that may attend the commission of the act but tending to oppose it merely on account of its mischievousness and therefore with equal force in whatsoever circumstances it may be proposed to be committed this therefore may also be added to the catalogue of standing tutelary motives  xxxv as to the motives which may operate occasionally in the character of tutelary motives these it has been already intimated are of various sorts and various degrees of strength in various offenses depending not only upon the nature of the offence but upon the accidental circumstances in which the idea of engaging in it may come in contemplation nor is there any sort of motive which may not come to operate in this character as may be easily conceived a thief for instance may be prevented from engaging in a projected scheme of housebreaking by sitting too long over his bottle   by a visit from his doxy by the occasion he may have to go elsewhere in order to receive his dividend of a former booty   and so on  xxxvi there are some motives however which seem more apt to act in this character than others especially as things are now constituted now that the law has every where opposed to the force of the principal seducing motives artificial tutelary motives of its own creation of the motives here meant it will be necessary to take a general view they seem to be reducible to two heads viz   the love of ease a motive put into action by the prospect of the trouble of the attempt that is the trouble which it may be necessary to bestow in overcoming the physical difficulties that may accompany it   selfpreservation as opposed to the dangers to which a man may be exposed in the prosecution of it  xxxvii these dangers may be either   of a purely physical nature or   dangers resulting from moral agency in other words from the conduct of any such persons to whom the act if known may be expected to prove obnoxious but moral agency supposes knowledge with respect to the circumstances that are to have the effect of external motives in giving birth to it now the obtaining such knowledge with respect to the commission of any obnoxious act on the part of any persons who may be disposed to make the agent suffer for it is called detection and the agent concerning whom such knowledge is obtained is said to be detected the dangers therefore which may threaten an offender from this quarter depend whatever they may be on the event of his detection and may therefore be all of them comprised under the article of the danger of detection  xxxviii the danger depending upon detection may be divided again into two branches   that which may result from any opposition that may be made to the enterprise by persons on the spot that is at the very time the enterprise is carrying on   that which respects the legal punishment or to other suffering that may await at a distance upon the issue of the enterprise  xxxix it may be worth calling to mind on this occasion that among the tutelary motives which have been styled constant ones there are two of which the force depends though not so entirely as the force of the occasional ones which have been or just mentioned yet in a great measure upon the circumstance of detection these it may be remembered are the love of reputation and the desire of amity in proportion therefore as the chance of being detected appears greater these motives will apply with the greater force with the less force as it appears less this is not the case with the two other standing tutelary motives that of benevolence and that of religion  xl we are now in a condition to determine with some degree of precision what is to be understood by the strength of a temptation and what indication it may give of the degree of mischievousness in a mans disposition in the case of any offence when a man is prompted to engage in any mischievous act we will say for shortness in an offense the strength of the temptation depends upon the ratio between the force of the seducing motives on the one hand and such of the occasional tutelary ones as the circumstances of the case call forth into action on the other the temptation then may be said to be strong when the pleasure or advantage to be got from the crime is such as in the eyes of the offender must appear great in comparison of the trouble and danger that appear to him to accompany the enterprise slight or weak when that pleasure or advantage is such as must appear small in comparison of such trouble and such danger it is plain the strength of the temptation depends not upon the force of the impelling that is of the seducing motives altogether for let the opportunity be more favourable that is let the trouble or any branch of the danger be made less than before it will be acknowledged that the temptation is made so much the stronger and on the other hand let the opportunity become less favourable or in other words let the trouble or any branch of the danger be made greater than before the temptation will be so much the weaker  now after taking account of such tutelary motives as have been styled occasional the only tutelary motives that can remain are those which have been termed standing ones but those which have been termed the standing tutelary motives are the same that we have been styling social it follows therefore that the strength of the temptation in any case after deducting the force of the social motives is as the sum of the forces of the seducing to the sum of the forces of the occasional tutelary motives  xli it remains to be inquired what indication concerning the mischievousness or depravity of a mans disposition is afforded by the strength of the temptation in the case where any offense happens to have been committed it appears then that the weaker the temptation is by which a man has been overcome the more depraved and mischievous it shows his disposition to have been for the goodness of his disposition is measured by the degree of his sensibility to the action of the social motives   in other words by the strength of the influence which those motives have over him now the less considerable the force is by which their influence on him has been overcome the more convincing is the proof that has been given of the weakness of that influence  again the degree of a mans sensibility to the force of the social motives being given it is plain that the force with which those motives tend to restrain him from engaging in any mischievous enterprise will be as the apparent mischievousness of such enterprise that is as the degree of mischief with which it appears to him likely to be attended in other words the less mischievous the offence appears to him to be the less averse he will be as far as he is guided by social considerations to engage in it the more mischievous the more averse if then the nature of the offense is such as must appear to him highly mischievous and yet he engages in it notwithstanding it shows that the degree of his sensibility to the force of the social motives is but slight and consequently that his disposition is proportionably depraved moreover the less the strength of the temptation was the more pernicious and depraved does it show his disposition to have been for the less the strength of the temptation was the less was the force which the influence of those motives had to overcome the clearer therefore is the proof that has been given of the weakness of that influence  xlii from what has been said it seems that for judging of the indication that is afforded concerning the depravity of a mans disposition by the strength of the temptation compared with the mischievousness of the enterprise the following rules may be laid down  rule   the strength of the temptation being given the mischievousness of the disposition manifested by the enterprise is as the apparent mischievousness of the act  thus it would show a more depraved disposition to murder a man for a reward of a guinea or falsely to charge him with a robbery for the same reward than to obtain the same sum from him by simple theft the trouble he would have to take and the risk he would have to run being supposed to stand on the same footing in the one case as in the other  rule   the apparent mischievousness of the act being given a mans disposition is the more depraved the slighter the temptation is by which he has been overcome  thus it shows a more depraved and dangerous disposition if a man kill another out of mere sport as the emperor of morocco muley mahomet is said to have done great numbers than out of revenge as sylla and marius did thousands or in the view of selfpreservation as augustus killed many or even for lucre as the same emperor is said to have killed some and the effects of such a depravity on that part of the public which is apprized of it run in the same proportion from augustus some persons only had to fear under some particular circumstances from muley mahomet every man had to fear at all times  rule   the apparent mischievousness of the act being given the evidence which it affords of the depravity of a mans disposition is the less conclusive the stronger the temptation is by which he has been overcome  thus if a poor man who is ready to die with hunger steal a loaf of bread it is a less explicit sign of depravity than if a rich man were to commit a theft to the same amount it will be observed that in this rule all that is said is that the evidence of depravity is in this case the less conclusive it is not said that the depravity is positively the less for in this case it is possible for any thing that appears to the contrary that the theft might have been committed even had the temptation been not so strong in this case the alleviating circumstance is only a matter of presumption in the former the aggravating circumstance is a matter of certainty  rule   where the motive is of the dissocial kind the apparent mischievousness of the act and the strength of the temptation being given the depravity is as the degree of deliberation with which it is accompanied  for in every man be his disposition ever so depraved the social motives are those which wherever the selfregarding ones stand neuter regulate and determine the general tenor of his life if the dissocial motives are put in action it is only in particular circumstances and on particular occasions the gentle but constant force of the social motives being for a while subdued the general and standing bias of every mans nature is therefore towards that side to which the force of the social motives would determine him to adhere this being the case the force of the social motives tends continually to put an end to that of the dissocial ones as in natural bodies the force of friction tends to put an end to that which is generated by impulse time then which wears away the force of the dissocial motives adds to that of the social the longer therefore a man continues on a given occasion under the dominion of the dissocial motives the more convincing is the proof that has been given of his insensibility to the force of the social ones  thus it shows a worse disposition where a man lays a deliberate plan for beating his antagonist and beats him accordingly than if he were to beat him upon the spot in consequence of a sudden quarrel and worse again if after having had him a long while together in his power he beats him at intervals and at his leisure 0  xliii the depravity of disposition indicated by an act is a material consideration in several respects any mark of extraordinary depravity by adding to the terror already inspired by the crime and by holding up the offender as a person from whom there may be more mischief to be apprehended in future adds in that way to the demand for punishment by indicating a general want of sensibility on the part of the offender it may add in another way also to the demand for punishment the article of disposition is of the more importance inasmuch as in measuring out the quantum of punishment the principle of sympathy and antipathy is apt to look at nothing else a man who punishes because he hates and only because he hates such a man when he does not find any thing odious in the disposition is not for punishing at all and when he does he is not for carrying the punishment further than his hatred carries him hence the aversion we find so frequently expressed against the maxim that the punishment must rise with the strength of the temptation a maxim the contrary of which as we shall see would be as cruel to offenders themselves as it would be subversive of the purposes of punishment  chapter xii of the consequences of a mischievous act sect  shapes in which the mischief of an act may show itself i hitherto we have been speaking of the various articles or objects on which the consequences or tendency of an act may depend of the bare act itself of the circumstances it may have been or may have been supposed to be accompanied with of the consciousness a man may have had with respect to any such circumstances of the intentions that may have preceded the act of the motives that may have given birth to those intentions and of the disposition that may have been indicated by the connexion between such intentions and such motives we now come to speak of consequences or tendency an article which forms the concluding link in all this chain of causes and effects involving in it the materiality of the whole now such part of this tendency as is of a mischievous nature is all that we have any direct concern with to that therefore we shall here confine ourselves  ii the tendency of an act is mischievous when the consequences of it are mischievous that is to say either the certain consequences or the probable the consequences how many and whatsoever they may be of an act of which the tendency is mischievous may such of them as are mischievous be conceived to constitute one aggregate body which may be termed the mischief of the act  iii this mischief may frequently be distinguished as it were into two shares or parcels the one containing what may be called the primary mischief the other what may be called the secondary that share may be termed the primary which it sustained by an assignable individual or a multitude of assignable individuals that share may be termed the secondary which taking its origin from the former extends itself either over the whole community or over some other multitude of unassignable individuals  iv the primary mischief of an act may again be distinguished into two branches   the original and   the derivative by the original branch i mean that which alights upon and is confined to any person who is a sufferer in the first instance and on his own account the person for instance who is beaten robbed or murdered by the derivative branch i mean any share of mischief which may befall any other assignable persons in consequence of his being a sufferer and no otherwise these persons must of course be persons who in some way or other are connected with him now the ways in which one person may be connected with another have been already seen they may be connected in the way of interest meaning selfregarding interest or merely in the way of sympathy and again persons connected with a given person in the way of interest may be connected with him either by affording support to him or by deriving it from him    v the secondary mischief again may frequently be seen to consist of two other shares or parcels the first consisting of pain the other of danger the pain which it produces is a pain of apprehension a pain grounded on the apprehension of suffering such mischiefs or inconveniences whatever they may be as it is the nature of the primary mischief to produce it may be styled in one word the alarm the danger is the chance whatever it may be which the multitude it concerns may in consequence of the primary mischief stand exposed to of suffering such mischiefs or inconveniences for danger is nothing but the chance of pain or what comes to the same thing of loss of pleasure  vi an example may serve to make this clear a man attacks you on the road and robs you you suffer a pain on the occasion of losing so much money   you also suffered a pain at the thoughts of the personal illtreatment you apprehended he might give you in case of your not happening to satisfy his demands   these together constitute the original branch of the primary mischief resulting from the act of robbery a creditor of yours who expected you to pay him with part of that money and a son of yours who expected you to have given him another part are in consequence disappointed you are obliged to have recourse to the bounty of your father to make good part of the deficiency these mischiefs together make up the derivative branch the report of this robbery circulates from hand to hand and spreads itself in the neighbourhood it finds its way into the newspapers and is propagated over the whole country various people on this occasion call to mind the danger which they and their friends as it appears from this example stand exposed to in travelling especially such as may have occasion to travel the same road on this occasion they naturally feel a certain degree of pain slighter or heavier according to the degree of illtreatment they may understand you to have received the frequency of the occasion each person may have to travel in that same road or its neighbourhood the vicinity of each person to the spot his personal courage the quantity of money he may have occasion to carry about with him and a variety of other circumstances this constitutes the first part of the secondary mischief resulting from the act of robbery viz the alarm but people of one description or other not only are disposed to conceive themselves to incur a chance of being robbed in consequence of the robbery committed upon you but as will be shown presently they do really incur such a chance and it is this chance which constitutes the remaining part of the secondary mischief of the act of robbery viz the danger  vii let us see what this chance amounts to and whence it comes how is it for instance that one robbery can contribute to produce another in the first place it is certain that it cannot create any direct motive a motive must be the prospect of some pleasure or other advantage to be enjoyed in future but the robbery in question is past nor would it furnish any such prospect were it to come for it is not one robbery that will furnish pleasure to him who may be about to commit another robbery the consideration that is to operate upon a man as a motive or inducement to commit a robbery must be the idea of the pleasure he expects to derive from the fruits of that very robbery but this pleasure exists independently of any other robbery  viii the means then by which one robbery tends as it should seem to produce another robbery are two   by suggesting to a person exposed to the temptation the idea of committing such another robbery accompanied perhaps with the belief of its facility in this case the influence it exerts applies itself in the first place to the understanding   by weakening the force of the tutelary motives which tend to restrain him from such an action and thereby adding to the strength of the temptation   in this case the influence applies itself to the will these forces are   the motive of benevolence which acts as a branch of the physical sanction     the motive of selfpreservation as against the punishment that may stand provided by the political sanction   the fear of shame a motive belonging to the moral sanction   the fear of the divine displeasure a motive belonging to the religious sanction on the first and last of these forces it has perhaps no influence worth insisting on but it has on the other two  ix the way in which a past robbery may weaken the force with which the political sanction tends to prevent a future robbery may be thus conceived the way in which this sanction tends to prevent a robbery is by denouncing some particular kind of punishment against any who shall be guilty of it the real value of which punishment will of course be diminished by the real uncertainty as also if there be any difference the apparent value by the apparent uncertainty now this uncertainty is proportionably increased by every instance in which a man is known to commit the offense without undergoing the punishment this of course will be the case with every offense for a certain time in short until the punishment allotted to it takes place if punishment takes place at last this branch of the mischief of the offense is then at last but not till then put a stop to  x the way in which a past robbery may weaken the force with which the moral sanction tends to prevent a future robbery may be thus conceived the way in which the moral sanction tends to prevent a robbery is by holding forth the indignation of mankind as ready to fall upon him who shall be guilty of it now this indignation will be the more formidable according to the number of those who join in it it will be the less so the fewer they are who join in it but there cannot be a stronger way of showing that a man does not join in whatever indignation may be entertained against a practice than the engaging in it himself it shows not only that he himself feels no indignation against it but that it seems to him there is no sufficient reason for apprehending what indignation may be felt against it by others accordingly where robberies are frequent and unpunished robberies are committed without shame it was thus amongst the grecians formerly   it is thus among the arabs still  xi in whichever way then a past offense tends to pave the way for the commission of a future offence whether by suggesting the idea of committing it or by adding to the strength of the temptation in both cases it may be said to operate by the force or influence of example  xii the two branches of the secondary mischief of an act the alarm and the danger must not be confounded though intimately connected they are perfectly distinct either may subsist without the other the neighbourhood may be alarmed with the report of a robbery when in fact no robbery either has been committed or is in a way to be committed a neighbourhood may be on the point of being disturbed by robberies without knowing any thing of the matter accordingly we shall soon perceive that some acts produce alarm without danger others danger without alarm  xiii as well the danger as the alarm may again be divided each of them into two branches the first consisting of so much of the alarm or danger as may be apt to result from the future behaviour of the same agent the second consisting of so much as may be apt to result from the behaviour of other persons such others to wit as may come to engage in acts of the same sort and tendency    xiv the distinction between the primary and the secondary consequences of an act must be carefully attended to it is so just that the latter may often be of a directly opposite nature to be the former in some cases where the primary consequences of the act are attended with a mischief the secondary consequences be may be beneficial and that to such a degree as even greatly to outweigh the mischief of the primary this is the case for instance with all acts of punishment when properly applied of these the primary mischief being never intended to fall but upon such persons as may happen to have committed some act which it is expedient to prevent the secondary mischief that is the alarm and the danger extends no farther than to such persons as are under temptation to commit it in which case in as far as it tends to restrain them from committing such acts it is of a beneficial nature  xv thus much with regard to acts that produce positive pain and that immediately this case by reason of its simplicity seemed the fittest to take the lead but acts may produce mischief in various other ways which together with those already specified may all be comprised by the following abridged analysis  mischief may admit of a division in any one of three points of view   according to its own nature   according to its cause   according to the person or other party who is the object of it   with regard to its nature it may be either simple or complex   when simple it may either be positive or negative positive consisting of actual pain negative consisting of the loss of pleasure whether simple or complex and whether positive or negative it may be either certain or contingent when it is negative it consists of the loss of some benefit or advantage this benefit may be material in both or either of two ways   by affording actual pleasure or   by averting pain or danger which is the chance of pain that is by affording security in as far then as the benefit which a mischief tends to avert is productive of security the tendency of such mischief is to produce insecurity   with regard to its cause mischief may be produced either by one single action or not without the concurrence of other actions if not without the concurrence of other actions these others may be the actions either of the same person or of other persons in either case they may be either acts of the same kind as that in question or of other kinds   lastly with regard to the party who is the object of the mischief or in other words who is in a way to be affected by it such party may be either an assignable 0 individual or assemblage of individuals or else a multitude of unassignable individuals when the object is an assignable individual this individual may either be the person himself who is the author of the mischief or some other person when the individuals who are the objects of it are an unassignable multitude this multitude may be either the whole political community or state or some subordinate division of it now when the object of the mischief is the author himself it may be styled selfregarding when any other party is the object extraregarding when such other party is an individual it may be styled private when a subordinate branch of the community semipublic when the whole community public here for the present we must stop to pursue the subject through its inferior distinctions will be the business of the chapter which exhibits the division of offenses    the cases which have been already illustrated are those in which the primary mischief is not necessarily otherwise than a simple one and that positive present and therefore certain producible by a single action without any necessity of the concurrence of any other action either on the part of the same agent or of others and having for its object an assignable individual or by accident an assemblage of assignable individuals extraregarding therefore and private this primary mischief is accompanied by a secondary the first branch of which is sometimes contingent and sometimes certain the other never otherwise than contingent both extraregarding and semipublic in other respects pretty much upon a par with the primary mischief except that the first branch viz the alarm though inferior in magnitude to the primary is in point of extent and therefore upon the whole in point of magnitude much superior  xvi two instances more will be sufficient to illustrate the most material of the modifications above exhibited  a man drinks a certain quantity of liquor and intoxicates himself the intoxication in this particular instance does him no sort of harm or what comes to the same thing none that is perceptible but it is probable and indeed next to certain that a given number of acts of the same kind would do him a very considerable degree of harm more or less according to his constitution and other circumstances for this is no more than what experience manifests every day it is also certain that one act of this sort by one means or other tends considerably to increase the disposition a man may be in to practise other acts of the same sort for this also is verified by experience this therefore is one instance where the mischief producible by the act is contingent in other words in which the tendency of the act is no otherwise mischievous than in virtue of its producing a chance of mischief this chance depends upon the concurrence of other acts of the same kind and those such as must be practiced by the same person the object of the mischief is that very person himself who is the author of it and he only unless by accident the mischief is therefore private and selfregarding  as to its secondary mischief alarm it produces none it produces indeed a certain quantity of danger by the influence of example but it is not often that this danger will amount to a quantity worth regarding  xvii again a man omits paying his share to a public tax this we see is an act of the negative kind   is this then to be placed upon the list of mischievous acts yes certainly upon what grounds upon the following to defend the community against its external as well as its internal adversaries are tasks not to mention others of a less indispensable nature which cannot be fulfilled but at a considerable expense but whence is the money for defraying this expense to come it can be obtained in no other manner than by contributions to be collected from individuals in a word by taxes the produce then of these taxes is to be looked upon as a kind of benefit which it is necessary the governing part of the community should receive for the use of the whole this produce before it can be applied to its destination requires that there should be certain persons commissioned to receive and to apply it now if these persons had they received it would have applied it to its proper destination it would have been a benefit the not putting them in a way to receive it is then a mischief but it is possible that if received it might not have been applied to its proper destination or that the services in consideration of which it was bestowed might not have been performed it is possible that the underofficer who collected the produce of the tax might not have paid it over to his principal it is possible that the principal might not have forwarded it on according to its farther destination to the judge for instance who is to protect the community against its clandestine enemies from within or the soldier who is to protect it against its open enemies from without it is possible that the judge or the soldier had they received it would not however have been induced by it to fulfil their respective duties it is possible that the judge would not have sat for the punishment of criminals and the decision of controversies it is possible that the soldier would not have drawn his sword in the defense of the community these together with an infinity of other intermediate acts which for the sake of brevity i pass over form a connected chain of duties the discharge of which is necessary to the preservation of the community they must every one of them be discharged ere the benefit to which they are contributory can be produced if they are all discharged in that case the benefit subsists and any act by tending to intercept that benefit may produce a mischief but if any of them are not the benefit fails it fails of itself it would not have subsisted although the act in question the act of nonpayment had not been committed the benefit is therefore contingent and accordingly upon a certain supposition the act which consists in the averting of it is not a mischievous one but this supposition in any tolerablyordered government will rarely indeed be verified in the very worstordered government that exists the greatest part of the duties that are levied are paid over according to their destination and with regard to any particular sum that is attempted to be levied upon any particular person upon any particular occasion it is therefore manifest that unless it be certain that it will not be so disposed of the act of withholding it is a mischievous one  the act of payment when referable to any particular sum especially if it be a small one might also have failed of proving beneficial on another ground and consequently the act of nonpayment of proving mischievous it is possible that the same services precisely might have been rendered without the money as with it if then speaking of any small limited sum such as the greatest which any one person is called upon to pay at a time a man were to say that the nonpayment of it would be attended with mischievous consequences this would be far from certain but what comes to the same thing as if it were it is perfectly certain when applied to the whole it is certain that if all of a sudden the payment of all taxes was to cease there would no longer be anything effectual done either for the maintenance of justice or for the defence of the community against its foreign adversaries that therefore the weak would presently be oppressed and injured in all manner of ways by the strong at home and both together overwhelmed by oppressors abroad upon the whole therefore it is manifest that in this case though the mischief is remote and contingent though in its first appearance it consists of nothing more than the interception of a benefit and though the individuals in whose favour that benefit would have been reduced into the explicit form of pleasure or security are altogether unassignable yet the mischievous tendency of the act is not on all these accounts the less indisputable the mischief in point of intensity and duration is indeed unknown it is uncertain it is remote but in point of extent it is immense and in point of fecundity pregnant to a degree that baffles calculation  xviii it may now be time to observe that it is only in the case where the mischief is extraregarding and has an assignable person or persons for its object that so much of the secondary branch of it as consists in alarm can have place when the individuals it affects are uncertain and altogether out of sight no alarm can be produced as there is nobody whose sufferings you can see there is nobody whose sufferings you can be alarmed at no alarm for instance is produced by nonpayment to a tax if at any distant and uncertain period of time such offence should chance to be productive of any kind of alarm it would appear to proceed as indeed immediately it would proceed from a very different cause it might be immediately referable for example to the act of a legislator who should deem it necessary to lay on a new tax in order to make up for the deficiency occasioned in the produce of the old one or it might be referable to the act of an enemy who under favour of a deficiency thus created in the fund allotted for defense might invade the country and exact from it much heavier contributions than those which had been thus withholden from the sovereign    as to any alarm which such an offence might raise among the few who might chance to regard the matter with the eyes of statesmen it is of too slight and uncertain a nature to be worth taking into the account  sect   how intentionality c may influence the mischief of an act xix we have seen the nature of the secondary mischief which is apt to be reflected as it were from the primary in the cases where the individuals who are the objects of the mischief are assignable it is now time to examine into the circumstances upon which the production of such secondary mischief depends these circumstances are no others than the four articles which have formed the subjects of the four last preceding chapters viz   the intentionality   the consciousness   the motive   the disposition it is to be observed all along that it is only the danger that is immediately governed by the real state of the mind in respect to those articles it is by the apparent state of it that the alarm is governed it is governed by the real only in as far as the apparent happens as in most cases it may be expected to do to quadrate with the real the different influences of the articles of intentionality and consciousness may be represented in the several cases following  xx case   where the act is so completely unintentional as to be altogether involuntary in this case it is attended with no secondary mischief at all  a bricklayer is at work upon a house a passenger is walking in the street below a fellowworkman comes and gives the bricklayer a violent push in consequence of which he falls upon the passenger and hurts him it is plain there is nothing in this event that can give other people who may happen to be in the street the least reason to apprehend any thing in future on the part of the man who fell whatever there may be with regard to the man who pushed him  xxi case   where the act though not unintentional is unadvised insomuch that the mischievous part of the consequences is unintentional but the unadvisedness is attended with heedlessness in this case the act is attended with some small degree of secondary mischief in proportion to the degree of heedlessness  a groom being on horseback and riding through a frequented street turns a corner at a full pace and rides over a passenger who happens to be going by it is plain by this behaviour of the groom some degree of alarm may be produced less or greater according to the degree of heedlessness betrayed by him according to the quickness of his pace the fullness of the street and so forth he has done mischief it may be said by his carelessness already who knows but that on other occasions the like cause may produce the like effect  xxii case   where the act is misadvised with respect to a circumstance which had it existed would fully have excluded or what comes to the same thing outweighed the primary mischief and there is no rashness in the case in this case the act is attended with no secondary mischief at all  it is needless to multiply examples any farther  xxiii case   where the act is misadvised with respect to a circumstance which would have excluded or counterbalanced the primary mischief in part but not entirely and still there is no rashness in this case the act is attended with some degree of secondary mischief in proportion to that part of the primary which remains unexcluded or uncounterbalanced  xxiv case   where the act is misadvised with respect to a circumstance which had it existed would have excluded or counterbalanced the primary mischief entirely or in part and there is a degree of rashness in the supposal in this case the act is also attended with a farther degree of secondary mischief in proportion to the degree of rashness  xxv case   where the consequences are completely intentional and there is no missupposal in the case in this case the secondary mischief is at the highest  xxvi thus much with regard to intentionality and consciousness we now come to consider in what manner the secondary mischief is affected by the nature of the motive  where an act is pernicious in its primary consequences the secondary mischief is not obliterated by the goodness of the motive though the motive be of the best kind for notwithstanding the goodness of the motive an act of which the primary consequences are pernicious is produced by it in the instance in question by the supposition it may therefore in other instances although this is not so likely to happen from a good motive as from a bad one    xxvii an act which though pernicious in its primary consequences is rendered in other respects beneficial upon the whole by virtue of its secondary consequences is not changed back again and rendered pernicious upon the whole by the badness of the motive although the motive be of the worst kind    xxviii but when not only the primary consequences of an act are pernicious but in other respects the secondary likewise the secondary mischief may be aggravated by the nature of the motive so much of that mischief to wit as respects the future behaviour of the same person  xxix it is not from the worst kind of motive however that the secondary mischief of an act receives its greatest aggravation  xxx the aggravation which the secondary mischief of an act in as far as it respects the future behaviour of the same person receives from the nature of a motive in an individual case is as the tendency of the motive to produce on the part of the same person acts of the like bad tendency with that of the act in question  xxxi the tendency of a motive to produce acts of the like kind on the part of any given person is as the strength and constancy of its influence on that person as applied to the production of such effects  xxxii the tendency of a species of motive to give birth to acts of any kind among persons in general is as the strength constancy and extensiveness   of its influence as applied to the production of such effects  xxxiii now the motives whereof the influence is at once most powerful most constant and most extensive are the motives of physical desire the love of wealth the love of ease the love of life and the fear of pain all of them selfregarding motives the motive of displeasure whatever it may be in point of strength and extensiveness is not near so constant in its influence the case of mere antipathy excepted as any of the other three a pernicious act therefore when committed through vengeance or otherwise through displeasure is not near so mischievous as the same pernicious act when committed by force of any one of those other motives    xxxiv as to the motive of religion whatever it may sometimes prove to be in point of strength and constancy it is not in point of extent so universal especially in its application to acts of a mischievous nature as any of the three preceding motives it may however be as universal in a particular state or in a particular district of a particular state it is liable indeed to be very irregular in its operations it is apt however to be frequently as powerful as the motive of vengeance or indeed any other motive whatsoever it will sometimes even be more powerful than any other motive it is at any rate much more constant   a pernicious act therefore when committed through the motive of religion is more mischievous than when committed through the motive of illwill  xxxv lastly the secondary mischief to wit so much of it as hath respect to the future behaviour of the same person is aggravated or lessened by the apparent depravity or beneficence of his disposition and that in the proportion of such apparent depravity or beneficence  xxxvi the consequences we have hitherto been speaking of are the natural consequences of which the act and the other articles we have been considering are the causes consequences that result from the behaviour of the individual who is the offending agent without the interference of political authority we now come to speak of punishment which in the sense in which it is here considered is an artificial consequence annexed by political authority to an offensive act in one instance in the view of putting a stop to the production of events similar to the obnoxious part of its natural consequences in other instances  chapter xiii cases unmeet for punishment sect   general view of cases unmeet for punishment i the general object which all laws have or ought to have in common is to augment the total happiness of the community and therefore in the first place to exclude as far as may be every thing that tends to subtract from that happiness in other words to exclude mischief  ii but all punishment is mischief all punishment in itself is evil upon the principle of utility if it ought at all to be admitted it ought only to be admitted in as far as it promises to exclude some greater evil    iii it is plain therefore that in the following cases punishment ought not to be inflicted    where it is groundless where there is no mischief for it to prevent the act not being mischievous upon the whole   where it must be inefficacious where it cannot act so as to prevent the mischief   where it is unprofitable or too expensive where the mischief it would produce would be greater than what it prevented   where it is needless where the mischief may be prevented or cease of itself without it that is at a cheaper rate sect   cases in which punishment is groundless these are  iv i where there has never been any mischief where no mischief has been produced to any body by the act in question of this number are those in which the act was such as might on a some occasions be mischievous or disagreeable but the person whose interest it concerns gave his consent to the performance of it this consent provided it be free and fairly obtained 0 is the best proof that can be produced that to the person who gives it no mischief at least no immediate mischief upon the whole is done for no man can be so good a judge as the man himself what it is gives him pleasure or displeasure  v   where the mischief was outweighed although a mischief was produced by that act yet the same act was necessary to the production of a benefit which was of greater value   than the mischief this may be the case with any thing that is done in the way of precaution against instant calamity as also with any thing that is done in the exercise of the several sorts of powers necessary to be established in every community to wit domestic judicial military and supreme    vi   where there is a certainty of an adequate compensation and that in all cases where the offense can be committed this supposes two things   that the offence is such as admits of an adequate compensation   that such a compensation is sure to be forthcoming of these suppositions the latter will be found to be a merely ideal one a supposition that cannot in the universality here given to it be verified by fact it cannot therefore in practice be numbered amongst the grounds of absolute impunity it may however be admitted as a ground for an abatement of that punishment which other considerations standing by themselves would seem to dictate    sect   cases in which punishment must be inefficacious these are  vii   where the penal provision is not established until after the act is done such are the cases   of an expostfacto law where the legislator himself appoints not a punishment till after the act is done   of a sentence beyond the law where the judge of his own authority appoints a punishment which the legislator had not appointed  viii   where the penal provision though established is not conveyed to the notice of the person on whom it seems intended that it should operate such is the case where the law has omitted to employ any of the expedients which are necessary to make sure that every person whatsoever who is within the reach of the law be apprised of all the cases whatsoever in which being in the station of life he is in he can be subjected to the penalties of the law    ix   where the penal provision though it were conveyed to a mans notice could produce no effect on him with respect to the preventing him from engaging in any act of the sort in question such is the case   in extreme infancy where a man has not yet attained that state or disposition of mind in which the prospect of evils so distant as those which are held forth by the law has the effect of influencing his conduct   in insanity where the person if he has attained to that disposition has since been deprived of it through the influence of some permanent though unseen cause   in intoxication where he has been a deprived of it by the transient influence of a visible cause such as the use of wine or opium or other drugs that act in this manner on the nervous system which condition is indeed neither more nor less than a temporary insanity produced by an assignable cause    x   where the penal provision although being conveyed to the partys notice it might very well prevent his engaging in acts of the sort in question provided he knew that it related to those acts could not have this effect with regard to the individual act he is about to engage in to wit because he knows not that it is of the number of those to which the penal provision relates this may happen   in the case of unintentionality where he intends not to engage and thereby knows not that he is about to engage in the act in which eventually he is about to engage     in the case of unconsciousness where although he may know that he is about to engage in the act itself yet from not knowing all the material circumstances attending it he knows not of the tendency it has to produce that mischief in contemplation of which it has been made penal in most instances   in the case of missupposal where although he may know of the tendency the act has to produce that degree of mischief he supposes it though mistakenly to be attended with some circumstance or set of circumstances which if it had been attended with it would either not have been productive of that mischief or have been productive of such a greater degree of good as has determined the legislator in such a case not to make it penal    xi   where though the penal clause might exercise a full and prevailing influence were it to act alone yet by the predominant influence of some opposite cause upon the will it must necessarily be ineffectual because the evil which he sets himself about to undergo in the case of his not engaging in the act is so great that the evil denounced by the penal clause in case of his engaging in it cannot appear greater this may happen   in the case of physical danger where the evil is such as appears likely to be brought about by the unassisted powers of nature   in the case of a threatened mischief where it is such as appears likely to be brought about through the intentional and conscious agency of man    xii   where though the penal clause may exert a full and prevailing influence over the will of the party yet his physical faculties owing to the predominant influence of some physical cause are not in a condition to follow the determination of the will insomuch that the act is absolutely involuntary such is the case of physical compulsion or restraint by whatever means brought about where the mans hand for instance is pushed against some object which his will disposes him not to touch or tied down from touching some object which his will disposes him to touch  sect   cases where punishment is unprofitable these are  xiii   where on the one hand the nature of the offense on the other hand that of the punishment are in the ordinary state of things such that when compared together the evil of the latter will turn out to be greater than that of the former  xiv now the evil of the punishment divides itself into four branches by which so many different sets of persons are affected   the evil of coercion or restraint or the pain which it gives a man not to be able to do the act whatever it be which by the apprehension of the punishment he is deterred from doing this is felt by those by whom the law is observed   the evil of apprehension or the pain which a man who has exposed himself to punishment feels at the thoughts of undergoing it this is felt by those by whom the law has been broken and who feel themselves in danger of its being executed upon them   the evil of sufferance   or the pain which a man feels in virtue of the punishment itself from the time when he begins to undergo it this is felt by those by whom the law is broken and upon whom it comes actually to be executed   the pain of sympathy and the other derivative evils resulting to the persons who are in connection with the several classes of original sufferers just mentioned 0 now of these four lots of evil the first will be greater or less according to the nature of the act from which the party is restrained the second and third according to the nature of the punishment which stands annexed to that offence  xv on the other hand as to the evil of the offense this will also of course be greater or less according to the nature of each offense the proportion between the one evil and the other will therefore be different in the case of each particular offence the cases therefore where punishment is unprofitable on this ground can by no other means be discovered than by an examination of each particular offense which is what will be the business of the body of the work  xvi   where although in the ordinary state of things the evil resulting from the punishment is not greater than the benefit which is likely to result from the force with which it operates during the same space of time towards the excluding the evil of the offenses yet it may have been rendered so by the influence of some occasional circumstances in the number of these circumstances may be   the multitude of delinquents at a particular juncture being such as would increase beyond the ordinary measure the quantum of the second and third lots and thereby also of a part of the fourth lot in the evil of the punishment   the extraordinary value of the services of some one delinquent in the case where the effect of the punishment would be to deprive the community of the benefit of those services   the displeasure of the people that is of an indefinite number of the members of the same community in cases where owing to of the influence of some occasional incident they happen to conceive that the offense or the offender ought not to be punished at all or at least ought not to be punished in the way in question   the displeasure of foreign powers that is of the governing body or a considerable number of the members of some foreign community or communities with which the community in question is connected  sect   cases where punishment is needless these are  xvii   where the purpose of putting an end to the practice may be attained as effectually at a cheaper rate by instruction is for instance as well as by terror by informing the understanding as well as by exercising an immediate influence on the will this seems to be the case with respect to all those offenses which consist in the disseminating pernicious principles in matters of duty of whatever kind the duty be whether political or moral or religious and this whether such principles be disseminated under or even without a sincere persuasion of their being beneficial i say even without for though in such a case it is not instruction that can prevent the writer from endeavouring to inculcate his principles yet it may the readers from adopting them without which his endeavouring to inculcate them will do no harm in such a case the sovereign will commonly have little need to take an active part if it be the interest of one individual to inculcate principles that are pernicious it will as surely be the interest of other individuals to expose them but if the sovereign must needs take a part in the controversy the pen is the proper weapon to combat error with not the sword  chapter xiv of the proportion between punishments and offences i we have seen that the general object of all laws is to prevent mischief that is to say when it is worth while but that where there are no other means of doing this than punishment there are four cases in which it is not worth while  ii when it is worth while there are four subordinate designs or objects which in the course of his endeavours to compass as far as may be that one general object a legislator whose views are governed by the principle of utility comes naturally to propose to himself  iii   his first most extensive and most eligible object is to prevent in as far as it is possible and worth while all sorts of offenses whatsoever   in other words so to manage that no offense whatsoever may be committed  iv   but if a man must needs commit an offense of some kind or other the next object is to induce him to commit an offense less mischievous rather than one more mischievous in other words to choose always the least mischievous of two offenses that will either of them suit his purpose  v   when a man has resolved upon a particular offense the next object is to dispose him to do no more mischief than is necessary to his purpose in other words to do as little mischief as is consistent with the benefit he has in view  vi   the last object is whatever the mischief be which it is proposed to prevent to prevent it at as cheap a rate as possible  vii subservient to these four objects or purposes must be the rules or canons by which the proportion of punishments   to offenses is to be governed  viii rule   the first object it has been seen is to prevent in as far as it is worth while all sorts of offenses therefore  the value of the punishment must not less in any case than what is sufficient to outweigh that of the profit   of the offense    if it be the offence unless some other considerations independent of the punishment should intervene and operate efficaciously in the character of tutelary motives   will be sure to be to committed notwithstanding   the whole lot of punishment will be thrown away it will be altogether inefficacious    ix the above rule has been often objected to on account of its seeming harshness but this can only have happened for want of its being properly understood the strength of the temptation cæteris paribus is as the profit of the offense the quantum of the punishment must rise with the profit of the offense cæteris paribus it must therefore rise with the strength of the temptation this there is no disputing true it is that the stronger the temptation the less conclusive is the indication which the act of delinquency affords of the depravity of the offenders disposition   so far then as the absence of any aggravation arising from extraordinary depravity of disposition may operate or at the utmost so far as the presence of a ground of extenuation resulting from the innocence or beneficence of the offenders disposition can operate the strength of the temptation may operate in abatement of the demand for punishment but it can never operate so far as to indicate the propriety of making the punishment ineffectual which it is sure to be when brought below the level of the apparent profit of the offense  the partial benevolence which should prevail for the reduction of it below this level would counteract as well those purposes which such a motive would actually have in view as those more extensive purposes which benevolence ought to have in view it would be cruelty not only to the public but to the very persons in whose behalf it pleads in its effects i mean however opposite in its intention cruelty to the public that is cruelty to the innocent by suffering them for want of an adequate protection to lie exposed to the mischief of the offense cruelty even to the offender himself by punishing him to no purpose and without the chance of compassing that beneficial end by which alone the introduction of the evil of punishment is to be justified  x rule   but whether a given offence shall be prevented in a given degree by a given quantity of punishment is never any thing better than a chance for the purchasing of which whatever punishment is employed is so much expended into advance however for the sake of giving it the better chance of outweighing the profit of the offence  the greater the mischief of the offense the greater is the expense which it may be worth while to be at in the way of punishment    xi rule   the next object is to induce a man to choose always the least mischievous of two offenses therefore  where two offences come in competition the punishment for the greater offence must be sufficient to induce a man to prefer the less 0  xii rule   when a man has resolved upon a particular offense the next object is to induce him to do no more mischief than what is necessary for his purpose therefore  the punishment should be adjusted in such manner to each particular offence that for every part of the mischief there may be a motive to restrain the offender from giving birth to it    xiii rule   the last object is whatever mischief is guarded against to guard against it at as cheap a rate as possible therefore  the punishment ought in no case to be more than what is necessary to bring it into conformity with the rules here given  xiv rule   it is further to be observed that owing to the different manners and degrees in which persons under different circumstances are affected by the same exciting cause a punishment which is the same in name will not always either really produce or even so much as appear to others to produce in two different persons the same degree of pain therefore  that the quantity actually indicted on each individual offender may correspond to the quantity intended for similar offenders in general the several circumstances influencing sensibility ought always to be taken into account    xv of the above rules of proportion the first four we may perceive serve to mark out limits on the side of diminution the limits below which a punishment ought not to be diminished the fifth the limits on the side of increase the limits above which it ought not to be increased the five first are calculated to serve as guides to the legislator the sixth is calculated in some measure indeed to the same purpose but principally for guiding the judge in his endeavors to conform on both sides to the intentions of the legislator  xvi let us look back a little the first rule in order to render it more conveniently applicable to practice may need perhaps to be a little more particularly unfolded it is to be observed then that for the sake of accuracy it was necessary instead of the word quantity to make use of the less perspicuous term value for the word quantity will not properly include the circumstances either of certainty or proximity circumstances which in estimating the value of a lot of pain or pleasure must always be taken into the account   now on the one hand a lot of punishment is a lot of pain on the other hand the profit of an offense is a lot of pleasure or what is equivalent to it but the profit of the offense is commonly more certain than the punishment or what comes to the same thing appears so at least to the offender it is at any rate commonly more immediate it follows therefore that in order to maintain its superiority over the profit of the offense the punishment must have its value made up in some other way in proportion to that whereby it falls short in the two points of certainty and proximity now there is no other way in which it can receive any addition to its value but by receiving an addition in point of magnitude wherever then the value of the punishment falls short either in point of certainty or of proximity of that of the profit of the offence it must receive a proportionable addition in point of magnitude    xvii yet farther to make sure of giving the value of the punishment the superiority over that of the offence it may be necessary in some cases to take into account the profit not only of the individual offence to which the punishment is to be annexed but also of such other offences of the same sort as the offender is likely to have already committed without detection this random mode of calculation severe as it is it will be impossible to avoid having recourse to in certain cases in such to wit in which the profit is pecuniary the chance of detection very small and the obnoxious act of such a nature as indicates a habit for example in the case of frauds against the coin if it be not recurred to the practice of committing the offence will be sure to be upon the balance of the account a gainful practice that being the case the legislator will be absolutely sure of not being able to suppress it and the whole punishment that is bestowed upon it will be thrown away in a word to keep to the same expressions we set out with that whole quantity of punishment will be inefficacious  xviii rule   these things being considered the three following rules may be laid down by way of supplement and explanation to rule    to enable the value of the punishment to outweigh that of the profit of the offense it must be increased in point of magnitude in proportion as it falls short in point of certainty  xix rule   punishment must be further increased in point of magnitude in proportion as it falls short in point of proximity  xx rule   where the act is conclusively indicative of a habit such an increase must be given to the punishment as may enable it to outweigh the profit not only of the individual offence but of such other like offenses as are likely to have been committed with impunity by the same offender  xxi there may be a few other circumstances or considerations which may influence in some small degree the demand for punishment but as the propriety of these is either not so demonstrable or not so constant or the application of them not so determinate as that of the foregoing it may be doubted whether they be worth putting on a level with the others  xxii rule  0 when a punishment which in point of quality is particularly well calculated to answer its intention cannot exist in less than a certain quantity it may sometimes be of use for the sake of employing it to stretch a little beyond that quantity which on other accounts would be strictly necessary  xxiii rule    in particular this may sometimes be the case where the punishment proposed is of such a nature as to be particularly well calculated to answer the purpose of a moral lesson    xxiv rule    the tendency of the above considerations is to dictate an augmentation in the punishment the following rule operates in the way of diminution there are certain cases it has been seen   in which by the influence of accidental circumstances punishment may be rendered unprofitable in the whole in the same cases it may chance to be rendered unprofitable as to a part only accordingly  in adjusting the quantum of punishment the circumstances by which all punishment may be rendered unprofitable ought to be attended to  xxv rule    it is to be observed that the more various and minute any set of provisions are the greater the chance is that any given article in them will not be borne in mind without which no benefit can ensue from it distinctions which are more complex than what the conceptions of those whose conduct it is designed to influence can take in will even be worse than useless the whole system will present a confused appearance and thus the effect not only of the proportions established by the articles in question but of whatever is connected with them will be destroyed   to draw a precise line of direction in such case seems impossible however by way of memento it may be of some use to subjoin the following rule  among provisions designed to perfect the proportion between punishments and offences if any occur which by their own particular good effects would not make up for the harm they would do by adding to the intricacy of the code they should be omitted    xxvi it may be remembered that the political sanction being that to which the sort of punishment belongs which in this chapter is all along in view is but one of four sanctions which may all of them contribute their share towards producing the same effects it may be expected therefore that in adjusting the quantity of political punishment allowance should be made for the assistance it may meet with from those other controlling powers true it is that from each of these several sources a very powerful assistance may sometimes be derived but the case is that setting aside the moral sanction in the case where the force of it is expressly adopted into and modified by the political   the force of those other powers is never determinate enough to be depended upon it can never be reduced like political punishment into exact lots nor meted out in number quantity and value the legislator is therefore obliged to provide the full complement of punishment as if he were sure of not receiving any assistance whatever from any of those quarters if he does so much the better but lest he should not it is necessary he should at all events make that provision which depends upon himself  xxvii it may be of use in this place to recapitulate the several circumstances which in establishing the proportion betwixt punishments and offenses are to be attended to these seem to be as follows  i on the part of the offence    the profit of the offense   the mischief of the offense   the profit and mischief of other greater or lesser offences of different sorts which the offender may have to choose out of   the profit and mischief of other offenses of the same sort which the same offender may probably have been guilty of already ii on the part of the punishment    the magnitude of the punishment composed of its intensity and duration   the deficiency of the punishment in point of certainty   the deficiency of the punishment in point of proximity   the quality of the punishment   the accidental advantage in point of quality of a punishment not strictly needed in point of quantity  0 the use of a punishment of a particular quality in the character of a moral lesson iii on the part of the offender     the responsibility of the class of persons in a way to offend    the sensibility of each particular offender    the particular merits or useful qualities of any particular offender in case of a punishment which might deprive the community of the benefit of them    the multitude of offenders on any particular occasion iv on the part of the public at any particular conjuncture     the inclinations of the people for or against any quantity or mode of punishment    the inclinations of foreign powers v on the part of the law that is of the public for a continuance     the necessity of making small sacrifices in point of proportionality for the sake of simplicity xxviii there are some perhaps who at first sight may look upon the nicety employed in the adjustment of such rules as so much labour lost for gross ignorance they will say never troubles itself about laws and passion does not calculate but the evil of ignorance admits of cure 00 and as to the proposition that passion does not calculate this like most of these very general and oracular propositions is not true when matters of such importance as pain and pleasure are at stake and these in the highest degree the only matters in short that can be of importance who is there that does not calculate men calculate some with less exactness indeed some with more but all men calculate i would not say that even a madman does not calculate 0  passion calculates more or less in every man in different men according to the warmth or coolness of their dispositions according to the firmness or irritability of their minds according to the nature of the motives by which they are acted upon happily of all passions that is the most given to calculation from the excesses of which by reason of its strength constancy and universality society has most to apprehend 0  i mean that which corresponds to the motive of pecuniary interest so that these niceties if such they are to be called have the best chance of being efficacious where efficacy is of the most importance  chapter xv of the properties to be given to a lot of punishment i it has been shown what the rules are which ought to be observed in adjusting the proportion between the punishments and the offense the properties to be given to a lot of punishment in every instance will of course be such as it stands in need of in order to be capable of being applied in conformity to those rules the quality will be regulated by the quantity  ii the first of those rules we may remember was that the quantity of punishment must not be less in any case than what is sufficient to outweigh the profit of the offence since as often as it is less the whole lot unless by accident the deficiency should be supplied from some of the other sanctions is thrown away it is inefficacious the fifth was that the punishment ought in no case to be more than what is required by the several other rules since if it be all that is above that quantity is needless the fourth was that the punishment should be adjusted in such manner to each individual offence that every part of the mischief of that offence may have a penalty that is a tutelary motive to encounter it otherwise with respect to so much of the offense as has not a penalty to correspond to it it is as if there were no punishment in the case now to none of those rules can a lot of punishment be conformable unless for every variation in point of quantity in the mischief of the species of offense to which it is annexed such lot of punishment admits of a correspondent variation to prove this let the profit of the offence admit of a multitude of degrees suppose it then at any one of these degrees if the punishment be less than what is suitable to that degree it will be inefficacious it will be so much thrown away if it be more as far as the difference extends it will be needless it will therefore be thrown away also in that case  the first property therefore that ought to be given to a lot of punishment is that of being variable in point of quantity in conformity to every variation which can take place in either the profit or mischief of the offense this property might perhaps be termed in a single word variability  iii a second property intimately connected with the former may be styled equability it will avail but little that a mode of punishment proper in all other respects has been established by the legislator and that capable of being screwed up or let down to any degree that can be required if after all whatever degree of it be pitched upon that same degree shall be liable according to circumstances to produce a very heavy degree of pain or a very slight one or even none at all in this case as in the former if circumstances happen one way there will be a great deal of pain produced which will be needless if the other way there will be no pain at all applied or none that will be efficacious a punishment when liable to this irregularity may be styled an unequable one when free from it an equable one the quantity of pain produced by the punishment will it is true depend in a considerable degree upon circumstances distinct from the nature of the punishment itself upon the condition which the offender is in with respect to the circumstances by which a mans sensibility is liable to be influenced but the influence of these very circumstances will in many cases be reciprocally influenced by the nature of the punishment in other words the pain which is produced by any mode of punishment will be the joint effect of the punishment which is applied to him and the circumstances in which he is exposed to it now there are some punishments of which the effect may be liable to undergo a greater alteration by the influence of such foreign circumstances than the effect of other punishments is liable to undergo so far then as this is the case equability or unequability may be regarded as properties belonging to the punishment itself  iv an example of a mode of punishment which is apt to be unequable is that of banishment when the locus a quo or place the party is banished from is some determinate place appointed by the law which perhaps the offender cares not whether he ever see or no this is also the case with pecuniary or quasipecuniary punishment when it respects some particular species of property which the offender may have been possessed of or not as it may happen all these punishments may be split down into parcels and measured out with the utmost nicety being divisible by time at least if by nothing else they are not therefore any of them defective in point of variability and yet in many cases this defect in point of equability may make them as unfit for use as if they were 0   v the third rule of proportion was that where two offenses come in competition the punishment for the greater offenses must be sufficient to induce a man to prefer the less now to be sufficient for this purpose it must be evidently and uniformly greater greater not in the eyes of some men only but of all men who are liable to be in a situation to take their choice between the two offenses that is in effect of all mankind in other words the two punishments must be perfectly commensurable hence arises a third property which may be termed commensurability to wit with reference to other punishments 0   vi but punishments of different kinds are in very few instances uniformly greater one than another especially when the lowest degrees of that which is ordinarily the greater are compared with the highest degrees of that which is ordinarily the less in other words punishments of different kinds are in few instances uniformly commensurable the only certain and universal means of making two lots of punishment perfectly commensurable is by making the lesser an ingredient in the composition of the greater this may be done in either of two ways   by adding to the lesser punishment another quantity of punishment of the same kind   by adding to it another quantity of a different kind the latter mode is not less certain than the former for though one cannot always be absolutely sure that to the same person a given punishment will appear greater than another given punishment yet one may be always absolutely sure that any given punishment so as it does but come into contemplation will appear greater than none at all  vii again punishment cannot act any farther than in as far as the idea of it and of its connection with the offense is present in the mind the idea of it if not present cannot act at all and then the punishment itself must be inefficacious now to be present it must be remembered and to be remembered it must have been learnt but of all punishments that can be imagined there are none of which the connection with the offense is either so easily learnt or so efficaciously remembered as those of which the idea is already in part associated with some part of the idea of the offense which is the case when the one and the other have some circumstance that belongs to them in common when this is the case with a punishment and an offense the punishment is said to bear an analogy to or to be characteristic of the offence 0  characteristicalness is therefore a fourth property which on this account ought to be given whenever it can conveniently be given to a lot of punishment  viii it is obvious that the effect of this contrivance will be the greater as the analogy is the closer the analogy will be the closer the more material 0  that circumstance is which is in common now the most material circumstance that can belong to an offense and a punishment in common is the hurt or damage which they produce the closest analogy therefore that can subsist between an offense and the punishment annexed to it is that which subsists between them when the hurt or damage they produce is of the same nature in other words that which is constituted by the circumstance of identity in point of damage 0  accordingly the mode of punishment which of all others bears the closest analogy to the offense is that which in the proper and exact sense of the word is termed retaliation retaliation therefore in the few cases in which it is practicable and not too expensive will have one great advantage over every other mode of punishment  ix again it is the idea only of the punishment or in other words the apparent punishment that really acts upon the mind the punishment itself the real punishment acts not any farther than as giving rise to that idea it is the apparent punishment therefore that does all the service i mean in the way of example which is the principal object 0  it is the real punishment that does all the mischief 0  now the ordinary and obvious way of increasing the magnitude of the apparent punishment is by increasing the magnitude of the real the apparent magnitude however may to a certain degree be increased by other less expensive means whenever therefore at the same time that these less expensive means would have answered that purpose an additional real punishment is employed this additional real punishment is needless as to these less expensive means they consist   in the choice of a particular mode of punishment a punishment of a particular quality independent of the quantity  0   in a particular set of solemnities distinct from the punishment itself and accompanying the execution of it     x a mode of punishment according as the appearance of it bears a greater proportion to the reality may be said to be the more exemplary now as to what concerns the choice of the punishment itself there is not any means by which a given quantity of punishment can be rendered more exemplary than by choosing it of such a sort as shall bear an analogy to the offense hence another reason for rendering the punishment analogous to or in other words characteristic of the offense  xi punishment it is still to be remembered is in itself an expense it is in itself an evil    accordingly the fifth rule of proportion is not to produce more of it than what is demanded by the other rules but this is the case as often as any particle of pain is produced which contributes nothing to the effect proposed now if any mode of punishment is more apt than another to produce any such superfluous and needless pain it may be styled unfrugal if less it may be styled frugal frugality therefore is a sixth property to be wished for in a mode of punishment  xii the perfection of frugality in a mode of punishment is where not only no superfluous pain is produced on the part of the person punished but even that same operation by which he is subjected to pain is made to answer the purpose of producing pleasure on the part of some other person understand a profit or stock of pleasure of the selfregarding kind for a pleasure of the dissocial kind is produced almost of course on the part of all persons in whose breasts the offence has excited the sentiment of illwill now this is the case with pecuniary punishment as also with such punishments of the quasipecuniary kind as consist in the subtraction of such a species of possession as is transferable from one party to another the pleasure indeed produced by such an operation is not in general equal to the pain    it may however be so in particular circumstances as where he from whom the thing is taken is very rich and he to whom it is given very poor and be it what it will it is always so much more than can be produced by any other mode of punishment  xiii the properties of exemplarity and frugality seem to pursue the same immediate end though by different courses both are occupied in diminishing the ratio of the real suffering to the apparent but exemplarity tends to increase the apparent frugality to reduce the real  xiv thus much concerning the properties to be given to punishments in general to whatsoever offenses they are to be applied those which follow are of less importance either as referring only to certain offenses in particular or depending upon the influence of transitory and local circumstances  in the first place the four distinct ends into which the main and general end of punishment is divisible    may give rise to so many distinct properties according as any particular mode of punishment appear to be more particularly adapted to the compassing of one or of another of those ends to that of example as being the principal one a particular property has already been adapted there remains the three inferior ones of reformation disablement and compensation  xv a seventh property therefore to be wished for in a mode of punishment is that of subserviency to reformation or reforming tendency now any punishment is subservient to reformation in proportion to its quantity since the greater the punishment a man has experienced the stronger is the tendency it has to create in him an aversion towards the offense which was the cause of it and that with respect to all offenses alike but there are certain punishments which with regard to certain offenses have a particular tendency to produce that effect by reason of their quality and where this is the case the punishments in question as applied to the offenses in question will pro tanto have the advantage over all others this influence will depend upon the nature of the motive which is the cause of the offence the punishment most subservient to reformation will be the sort of punishment that is best calculated to invalidate the force of that motive  xvi thus in offenses originating from the motive of illwill    that punishment has the strongest reforming tendency which is best calculated to weaken the force of the irascible affections and more particularly in that sort of offense which consists in an obstinate refusal on the part of the offender to do something which is lawfully required of him    and in which the obstinacy is in great measure kept up by his resentment against those who have an interest in forcing him to compliance the most efficacious punishment seems to be that of confinement to spare diet  xvii thus also in offenses which owe their birth to the joint influence of indolence and pecuniary interest that punishment seems to possess the strongest reforming tendency which is best calculated to weaken the force of the former of those dispositions and more particularly in the cases of theft embezzlement and every species of defraudment the mode of punishment best adapted to this purpose seems in most cases to be that of penal labour  xviii an eighth property to be given to a lot of punishment in certain cases is that of efficacy with respect to disablement or as it might be styled more briefly disabling efficacy this is a property which may be given in perfection to a lot of punishment and that with much greater certainty than the property of subserviency to reformation the inconvenience is that this property is apt in general to run counter to that of frugality there being in most cases no certain way of disabling a man from doing mischief without at the same time disabling him in a great measure from doing good either to himself or others the mischief therefore of the offense must be so great as to demand a very considerable lot of punishment for the purpose of example before it can warrant the application of a punishment equal to that which is necessary for the purpose of disablement  xix the punishment of which the efficacy in this way is the greatest is evidently that of death in this case the efficacy of it is certain this accordingly is the punishment peculiarly adapted to those cases in which the name of the offender so long as he lives may be sufficient to keep a whole nation in a flame this will now and then be the case with competitors for the sovereignty and leaders of the factions in civil wars though when applied to offenses of so questionable a nature in which the question concerning criminality turns more upon success than any thing else an infliction of this sort may seem more to savour of hostility than punishment at the same time this punishment it is evident is in an eminent degree unfrugal which forms one among the many objections there are against the use of it in any but very extraordinary cases     xx in ordinary cases the purpose may be sufficiently answered by one or other of the various kinds of confinement and banishment of which imprisonment is the most strict and efficacious for when an offense is so circumstanced that it cannot be committed but in a certain place as is the case for the most part with offenses against the person all the law has to do in order to disable the offender from committing it is to prevent his being in that place in any of the offenses which consist in the breach or the abuse of any kind of trust the purpose may be compassed at a still cheaper rate merely by forfeiture of the trust and in general in any of those offenses which can only be committed under favour of some relation in which the offender stands with reference to any person or sets of persons merely by forfeiture of that relation that is of the right of continuing to reap the advantages belonging to it this is the case for instance with any of those offences which consist in an abuse of the privileges of marriage or of the liberty of carrying on any lucrative or other occupation  xxi the ninth property is that of subserviency to compensation this property of punishment if it be vindictive compensation that is in view will with little variation be in proportion to the quantity if lucrative it is the peculiar and characteristic property of pecuniary punishment  xxii in the rear of all these properties may be introduced that of popularity a very fleeting and indeterminate kind of property which may belong to a lot of punishment one moment and be lost by it the next by popularity is meant the property of being acceptable or rather not unacceptable to the bulk of the people among whom it is proposed to be established in strictness of speech it should rather be called absence of unpopularity for it cannot be expected in regard to such a matter as punishment that any species or lot of it should be positively acceptable and grateful to the people it is sufficient for the most part if they have no decided aversion to the thoughts of it now the property of characteristicalness above noticed seems to go as far towards conciliating the approbation of the people to a mode of punishment as any insomuch that popularity may be regarded as a kind of secondary quality depending upon that of characteristicalness    the use of inserting this property in the catalogue is chiefly to make it serve by way of memento to the legislator not to introduce without a cogent necessity any mode or lot of punishment towards which he happens to perceive any violent aversion entertained by the body of the people  xxiii the effects of unpopularity in a mode of punishment are analogous to those of unfrugality the unnecessary pain which denominates a punishment unfrugal is most apt to be that which is produced on the part of the offender a portion of superfluous pain is in like manner produced when the punishment is unpopular but in this case it is produced on the part of persons altogether innocent the people at large this is already one mischief and another is the weakness which it is apt to introduce into the law when the people are satisfied with the law they voluntarily lend their assistance in the execution when they are dissatisfied they will naturally withhold that assistance it is well if they do not take a positive part in raising impediments this contributes greatly to the uncertainty of the punishment by which in the first instance the frequency of the offense receives an increase in process of time that deficiency as usual is apt to draw on an increase in magnitude an addition of a certain quantity which otherwise would be needless     xxiv this property it is to be observed necessarily supposes on the part of the people some prejudice or other which it is the business of the legislator to endeavour to correct for if the aversion to the punishment in question were grounded on the principle of utility the punishment would be such as on other accounts ought not to be employed in which case its popularity or unpopularity would never be worth drawing into question it is properly therefore a property not so much of the punishment as of the people a disposition to entertain an unreasonable dislike against an object which merits their approbation it is the sign also of another property to wit indolence or weakness on the part of the legislator in suffering the people for the want of some instruction which ought to be and might be given them to quarrel with their own interest be this as it may so long as any such dissatisfaction subsists it behoves the legislator to have an eye to it as much as if it were ever so well grounded every nation is liable to have its prejudices and its caprices which it is the business of the legislator to look out for to study and to cure  0  xxv the eleventh and last of all the properties that seem to be requisite in a lot of punishment is that of remissibility    the general presumption is that when punishment is applied punishment is needful that it ought to be applied and therefore cannot want to be remitted but in very particular and those always very deplorable cases it may by accident happen otherwise it may happen that punishment shall have been inflicted where according to the intention of the law itself it ought not to have been inflicted that is where the sufferer is innocent of the offense at the time of the sentence passed he appeared guilty but since then accident has brought his innocence to light this being the case so much of the destined punishment as he has suffered already there is no help for the business is then to free him from as much as is yet to come but is there any yet to come there is very little chance of there being any unless it be so much as consists of chronical punishment such as imprisonment banishment penal labour and the like so much as consists of acute punishment to wit where the penal process itself is over presently however permanent the punishment may be in its effects may be considered as irremissible this is the case for example with whipping branding mutilation and capital punishment the most perfectly irremissible of any is capital punishment for though other punishments cannot when they are over be remitted they may be compensated for and although the unfortunate victim cannot be put into the same condition yet possibly means may be found of putting him into as good a condition as he would have been in if he had never suffered this may in general be done very effectually where the punishment has been no other than pecuniary  there is another case in which the property of remissibility may appear to be of use this is where although the offender has been justly punished yet on account of some good behaviour of his displayed at a time subsequent to that of the commencement of the punishment it may seem expedient to remit a part of it but this it can scarcely be if the proportion of the punishment is in other respects what it ought to be the purpose of example is the more important object in comparison of that of reformation    it is not very likely that less punishment should be required for the former purpose than for the latter for it must be rather an extraordinary case if a punishment which is sufficient to deter a man who has only thought of it for a few moments should not be sufficient to deter a man who has been feeling it all the time whatever then is required for the purpose of example must abide at all events it is not any reformation on the part of the offender that can warrant the remitting of any part of it if it could a man would have nothing to do but to reform immediately and so free himself from the greatest part of that punishment which was deemed necessary in order then to warrant the remitting of any part of a punishment upon this ground it must first be supposed that the punishment at first appointed was more than was necessary for the purpose of example and consequently that a part of it was needless upon the whole this indeed is apt enough to be the case under the imperfect systems that are as yet on foot and therefore during the continuance of those systems the property of remissibility may on this second ground likewise as well as on the former be deemed a useful one but this would not be the case in any newconstructed system in which the rules of proportion above laid down should be observed in such a system therefore the utility of this property would rest solely on the former ground  xxvi upon taking a survey of the various possible modes of punishment it will appear evidently that there is not any one of them that possesses all the above properties in perfection to do the best that can be done in the way of punishment it will therefore be necessary upon most occasions to compound them and make them into complex lots each consisting of a number of different modes of punishment put together the nature and proportions of the constituent parts of each lot being different according to the nature of the offence which it is designed to combat  xxvii it may not be amiss to bring together and exhibit in one view the eleven properties above established they are as follows  two of them are concerned in establishing a proper proportion between a single offense and its punishment viz    variability   equability one in establishing a proportion between more offences than one and more punishments than one viz    commensurability a fourth contributes to place the punishment in that situation in which alone it can be efficacious and at the same time to be bestowing on it the two farther properties of exemplarity and popularity viz    characteristicalness two others are concerned in excluding all useless punishment the one indirectly by heightening the efficacy of what is useful the other in a direct way viz    exemplarity   frugality three others contribute severally to the three inferior ends of punishment viz    subserviency to reformation   efficacy in disabling   subserviency to compensation another property tends to exclude a collateral mischief which a particular mode of punishment is liable accidentally to produce viz   0 popularity the remaining property tends to palliate a mischief which all punishment as such is liable accidentally to produce viz     remissibility the properties of commensurability characteristicalness exemplarity subserviency to reformation and efficacy in disabling are more particularly calculated to augment the profit which is to be made by punishment frugality subserviency to compensation popularity and remissibility to diminish the expense variability and equability are alike subservient to both those purposes  xxviii we now come to take a general survey of the system of offences that is of such acts to which on account of the mischievous consequences they have a natural tendency to produce and in the view of putting a stop to those consequences it may be proper to annex a certain artificial consequence consisting of punishment to be inflicted on the authors of such acts according to the principles just established  chapter xvi sections    division of offences  sect  classes of offences i it is necessary at the outset to make a distinction between such acts as are or may be and such as ought to be offences  any act may be an offence which they whom the community are in the habit of obeying shall be pleased to make one that is any act which they shall be pleased to prohibit or to punish but upon the principle of utility such acts alone ought to be made offences as the good of the community requires should be made so  ii the good of the community cannot require that any act should be made an offence which is not liable in some way or other to be detrimental to the community for in the case of such an act all punishment is groundless   iii but if the whole assemblage of any number of individuals be considered as constituting an imaginary compound body a community or political state any act that is detrimental to any one or more of those members is as to so much of its effects detrimental to the state  iv an act cannot be detrimental to a state but by being detrimental to some one or more of the individuals that compose it but these individuals may either be assignable  or unassignable  v when there is any assignable individual to whom an offence is detrimental that person may either be a person other than the offender or the offender himself  vi offences that are detrimental in the first instance to assignable persons other than the offender may be termed by one common name offences against individuals and of these may be composed the  st class of offences to contrast them with offences of the  nd and  th classes it may also sometimes be convenient to style them private offences to contrast them at the same time with offences of the  rd class they may be styled private extraregarding offences  vii when it appears in general that there are persons to whom the act in question may be detrimental but such persons cannot be individually assigned the circle within which it appears that they may be found is either of less extent than that which comprises the whole community or not if of less the persons comprised within this lesser circle may be considered for this purpose as composing a body of themselves comprised within but distinguishable from the greater body of the whole community the circumstance that constitutes the union between the members of this lesser body may be either their residence within a particular place or in short any other less explicit principle of union which may serve to distinguish them from the remaining members of the community in the first case the act may be styled an offence against a neighbourhood in the second an offence against a particular class of persons in the community offenses then against a class or neighbourhood may together constitute the  nd class of offences  to contrast them with private offences on the one hand and public on the other they may also be styled semipublic offences  viii offences which in the first instance are detrimental to the offender himself and to no one else unless it be by their being detrimental to himself may serve to compose a third class to contrast them the better with offences of the first second and fourth classes all which are of a transitive nature they might be styled intransitive  offences but still better selfregarding  ix the fourth class may be composed of such acts as ought to be made offences on account of the distant mischief which they threaten to bring upon an unassignable indefinite multitude of the whole number of individuals of which the community is composed although no particular individual should appear more likely to be a sufferer by them than another these may be called public offences or offences against the state  x a fifth class or appendix may be composed of such acts as according to the circumstances in which they are committed or and more particularly according to the purposes to which they are applied may be detrimental in any one of the ways in which the act of one man can be detrimental to another these may to be termed multiform or heterogeneous  offences offences that are in this case may be reduced to two great heads   offences by falsehood and   offenses against trust  sect   divisions and subdivisions xi let us see by what method these classes may be farther subdivided first then with regard to offences against individuals  in the present period of existence a mans being and wellbeing his happiness and his security in a word his pleasures and his immunity from pains are all dependent more or less in the first place upon his own person in the next place upon the exterior objects that surround him these objects are either things or other persons under one or other of these classes must evidently be comprised every sort of exterior object by means of which his interest can be affected if then by means of any offence a man should on any occasion become a sufferer it must be in one or other of two ways   absolutely to wit immediately in his own person in which case the offence may be said to be an offence against his person or   relatively by reason of some material relation  which the before mentioned exterior objects may happen to bear in the way of causality see ch vii actions par    to his happiness now in as far as a man is in a way to derive either happiness or security from any object which belongs to the class of things such thing is said to be his property or at least he is said to have a property or an interest therein an offence therefore which tends to lessen the facility he might otherwise have of deriving happiness or security from an object which belongs to the class of things may be styled an offence against his property with regard to persons in as far as from objects of this class a man is in a way to derive happiness or security it is in virtue of their services in virtue of some services which by one sort of inducement or another they may be disposed to render him  now then take any man by way of example and the disposition whatever it may be which he may be in to render you service either has no other connection to give birth or support to it than the general one which binds him to the whole species or it has some other connection more particular in the latter case such a connection may be spoken of as constituting in your favour a kind of fictitious or incorporeal object of property which is styled your condition an offence therefore the tendency of which is to lessen the facility you might otherwise have of deriving happiness from the services of a person thus specially connected with you may be styled an offence against your condition in life or simply against your condition conditions in life must evidently be as various as the relations by which they are constituted this will be seen more particularly farther on in the mean time those of husband wife parent child master servant citizen of such or such a city naturalborn subject of such or such a country may answer the purpose of examples  where there is no such particular connection or what comes to the same thing where the disposition whatever it may be which a man is in to render you service is not considered as depending upon such connection but simply upon the goodwill he bears to you in such case in order to express what chance you have of deriving a benefit from his services a kind of fictitious object of property is spoken of as being constituted in your favour and is called your reputation an offence therefore the tendency of which is to lessen the facility you might otherwise have had of deriving happiness or security from the services of persons at large whether connected with you or not by any special tie may be styled an offence against your reputation it appears therefore that if by any offence an individual becomes a sufferer it must be in one or other of the four points above mentioned viz his person his property his condition in life or his reputation these sources of distinction then may serve to form so many subordinate divisions if any offences should be found to affect a person in more than one of these points at the same time such offences may respectively be put under so many separate divisions and such compound divisions may be subjoined to the preceding simple ones the several divisions simple and compound together which are hereinafter established stand as follows   offenses against person   offenses against reputation   offenses against property   offenses against condition   offenses against person and property together   offenses against person and reputation together   xii next with regard to semipublic offences pain considered with reference to the time of the act from which it is liable to issue must it is evident be either present past or future in as far as it is either present or past it cannot be the result of any act which comes under the description of a semipublic offence for if it be present or past the individuals who experience or who have experienced it are assignable 0 there remains that sort of mischief which if it ever come to exist at all is as yet but future mischief thus circumstanced takes the name of danger   now then when by means of the act of any person a whole neighbourhood or other class of persons are exposed to danger this danger must either be intentional on his part or unintentional   if unintentional such danger when it is converted into actual mischief takes the name of a calamity offences productive of such danger may be styled semipublic offences operating through calamity or more briefly offences through calamity if the danger be intentional insomuch that it might be produced and might convert itself into actual mischief without the concurrence of any calamity it may be said to originate in mere delinquency offences then which without the concurrence of any calamity tend to produce such danger as disturbs the security of a local or other subordinate class of persons may be styled semipublic offences operating merely by delinquency or more briefly offences of mere delinquency  xiii with regard to any farther subdivisions offences through calamity will depend upon the nature of the several calamities to which man and the several things that are of use to him stand exposed these will be considered in another place    xiv semipublic offences of mere delinquency will follow the method of division applied to offences against individuals it will easily be conceived that whatever pain or inconvenience any given individual may be made to suffer to the danger of that pain or inconvenience may any number of individuals assignable or not assignable be exposed now there are four points or articles as we have seen in respect to which an individual may be made to suffer pain or inconvenience if then with respect to any one of them the connection of causes and effects is such that to the danger of suffering in that article a number of persons who individually are not assignable may by the delinquency of one person be exposed such article will form a ground of distinction on which a particular subdivision of semipublic offences may be established if with respect to any such article no such effect can take place that ground of distinction will lie for the present unoccupied ready however upon any change of circumstances or in the manner of viewing the subject to receive a correspondent subdivision of offences if ever it should seem necessary that any such offences should be created  xv we come next to selfregarding offences or more properly to acts productive in the first instance of no other than a selfregarding mischief acts which if in any instance it be thought fit to constitute them offences will come under the denomination of offences against ones self this class will not for the present give us much trouble for it is evident that in whatever points a man is vulnerable by the hand of another in the same points may he be conceived to be vulnerable by his own whatever divisions therefore will serve for the first class the same will serve for this as to the questions what acts are productive of a mischief of this stamp and among such as are which it may and which it may not be worth while   to treat upon the footing of offences these are points the latter of which at least is too unsettled and too open to controversy to be laid down with that degree of confidence which is implied in the exhibition of properties which are made use of as the groundwork of an arrangement properties for this purpose ought to be such as show themselves at first glance and appear to belong to the subject beyond dispute  xvi public offences may be distributed under eleven divisions     offences against external security   offences against justice   offences against the preventive branch of the police   offences against the public force   offences against the positive increase of the national felicity   offences against the public wealth   offences against population   offences against the national wealth   offences against the sovereignty  0 offences against religion    offences against the national interest in general the way in which these several sorts of offences connect with one another and with the interest of the public that is of an unassignable multitude of the individuals of which that body is composed may be thus conceived  xvii mischief by which the interest of the public as above defined may be affected must if produced at all be produced either by means of an influence exerted on the operations of government or by other means without the exertion of such influence   to begin with the latter case mischief be it what it will and let it happen to whom it will must be produced either by the unassisted powers of the agent in question or by the instrumentality of some other agents in the latter case these agents will be either persons or things persons again must be either not members of the community in question or members mischief produced by the instrumentality of persons may accordingly be produced by the instrumentality either of external or of internal adversaries now when it is produced by the agents own unassisted powers or by the instrumentality of internal adversaries or only by the instrumentality of things it is seldom that it can show itself in any other shape setting aside any influence it may exert on the operations of government than either that of an offence against assignable individuals or that of an offence against a local or other subordinate class of persons if there should be a way in which mischief can be produced by any of these means to individuals altogether unassignable it will scarcely be found conspicuous or important enough to occupy a title by itself it may accordingly be referred to the miscellaneous head of offences against the national interest in general   the only mischief of any considerable account which can be made to impend indiscriminately over the whole number of members in the community is that complex kind of mischief which results from a state of war and is produced by the instrumentality of external adversaries by their being provoked for instance or invited or encouraged to invasion in this way may a man very well bring down a mischief and that a very heavy one upon the whole community in general and that without taking a part in any of the injuries which came in consequence to be offered to particular individuals  next with regard to the mischief which an offence may bring upon the public by its influence on the operations of the government this it may occasion either   in a more immediate way by its influence on those operations themselves   in a more remote way by its influence on the instruments by or by the help of which those operations should be performed or   in a more remote way still by its influence on the sources from whence such instruments are to be derived first then as to the operations of government the tendency of these in as far as it is conformable to what on the principle of utility it ought to be is in every case either to avert mischief from the community or to make an addition to the sum of positive good   now mischief we have seen must come either from external adversaries from internal adversaries or from calamities with regard to mischief from external adversaries there requires no further division as to mischief from internal adversaries the expedients employed for averting it may be distinguished into such as may be applied before the discovery of any mischievous design in particular and such as cannot be employed but in consequence of the discovery of some such design the former of these are commonly referred to a branch which may be styled the preventive branch of the police the latter to that of justice   secondly as to the instruments which government whether in the averting of evil or in the producing of positive good can have to work with these must be either persons or things those which are destined to the particular function of guarding against mischief from adversaries in general but more particularly from external adversaries 0 may be distinguished from the rest under the collective appellation of the public military force and for conciseness sake the military force the rest may be characterised by the collective appellation of the public wealth thirdly with regard to the sources or funds from whence these instruments howsoever applied must be derived such of them as come under the denomination of persons must be taken out of the whole number of persons that are in the community that is out of the total population of the state so that the greater the population the greater may cæteris paribus be this branch of the public wealth and the less the less in like manner such as come under the denomination of things may be and most of them commonly are taken out of the sum total of those things which are the separate properties of the several members of the community the sum of which properties may be termed the national wealth   so that the greater the national wealth the greater cæteris paribus may be this remaining branch of the public wealth and the less the less it is here to be observed that if the influence exerted on any occasion by any individual over the operations of the government be pernicious it must be in one or other of two ways   by causing or tending to cause operations not to be performed which ought to be performed in other words by impeding the operations of government or   by causing operations to be performed which ought not to be performed in other words by misdirecting them lastly to the total assemblage of the persons by whom the several political operations above mentioned come to be performed we set out with applying the collective appellation of the government among these persons there commonly   is some one person or body of persons whose office it is to assign and distribute to the rest their several departments to determine the conduct to be pursued by each in the performance of the particular set of operations that belongs to him and even upon occasion to exercise his function in his stead where there is any such person or body of persons he or it may according as the turn of the phrase requires be termed the sovereign or the sovereignty now it is evident that to impede or misdirect the operations of the sovereign as here described may be to impede or misdirect the operations of the several departments of government as described above  from this analysis by which the connection between the several abovementioned heads of offences is exhibited we may now collect a definition for each article by offences against external security we may understand such offences whereof the tendency is to bring upon the public a mischief resulting from the hostilities of foreign adversaries by offences against justice such offences whereof the tendency is to impede or misdirect the operations of that power which is employed in the business of guarding the public against the mischiefs resulting from the delinquency of internal adversaries as far as it is to be done by expedients which do not come to be applied in any case till after the discovery of some particular design of the sort of those which they are calculated to prevent by offences against the preventive branch of the police such offences whereof the tendency is to impede or misdirect the operations of that power which is employed in guarding against mischiefs resulting from the delinquency of internal adversaries by expedients that come to be applied beforehand or of that which is employed in guarding against the mischiefs that might be occasioned by physical calamities by offences against the public force such offences whereof the tendency is to impede or misdirect the operations of that power which is destined to guard the public from the mischiefs which may result from the hostility of foreign adversaries and in case of necessity in the capacity of ministers of justice from mischiefs of the number of those which result from the delinquency of internal adversaries  by offences against the increase of the national felicity such offences whereof the tendency is to impede or misapply the operations of those powers that are employed in the conducting of various establishments which are calculated to make in so many different ways a positive addition to the stock of public happiness by offences against the public wealth such offences whereof the tendency is to diminish the amount or misdirect the application of the money and other articles of wealth which the government reserves as a fund out of which the stock of instruments employed in the service above mentioned may be kept up by offences against population such offences whereof the tendency is to diminish the numbers or impair the political value of the sum total of the members of the community by offences against the national wealth such offences whereof the tendency is to diminish the quantity or impair the value of the things which compose the separate properties or estates of the several members of the community  xviii in this deduction it may be asked what place is left for religion this we shall see presently for combating the various kinds of offences above enumerated that is for combating all the offences those not excepted which we are now about considering which it is in mans nature to commit the state has two great engines punishment and reward punishment to be applied to all and upon all ordinary occasions reward to be applied to a few for particular purposes and upon extraordinary occasions but whether or no a man has done the act which renders him an object meet for punishment or reward the eyes of those whosoever they be to whom the management of these engines is entrusted cannot always see nor where it is punishment that is to be administered can their hands be always sure to reach him to supply these deficiencies in point of power it is thought necessary or at least useful without which the truth of the doctrine would be nothing to the purpose to inculcate into the minds of the people the belief of the existence of a power applicable to the same purposes and not liable to the same deficiencies the power of a supreme invisible being to whom a disposition of contributing to the same ends to which the several institutions already mentioned are calculated to contribute must for this purpose be ascribed it is of course expected that this power will at one time or other be employed in the promoting of those ends and to keep up and strengthen this expectation among men is spoken of as being the employment of a kind of allegorical personage feigned as before   for convenience of discourse and styled religion to diminish then or misapply the influence of religion is pro tanto to diminish or misapply what power the state has of combating with effect any of the beforeenumerated kinds of offences that is all kinds of offences whatsoever acts that appear to have this tendency may be styled offences against religion of these then may be composed the tenth division of the class of offences against the state    xix if there be any acts which appear liable to affect the state in any one or more of the above ways by operating in prejudice of the external security of the state or of its internal security of the public force of the increase of the national felicity of the public wealth of the national population of the national wealth of the sovereignty or of religion at the same time that it is not clear in which of all these ways they will affect it most nor but that according to contingencies they may affect it in one of these ways only or in another such acts may be collected together under a miscellaneous division by themselves and styled offences against the national interest in general of these then may be composed the eleventh and last division of the class of offences against the state  xx we come now to class the fifth consisting of multiform offences these as has been already intimated are either offences by falsehood or offences concerning trust under the head of offences by falsehood may be comprehended   simple falsehoods   forgery   personation   perjury   let us observe in what particulars these four kinds of falsehood agree and in what they differ  xxi offences by falsehood however diversified in other particulars have this in common that they consist in some abuse of the faculty of discourse or rather as we shall see hereafter of the faculty of influencing the sentiment of belief in other men   whether by discourse or otherwise the use of discourse is to influence belief and that in such manner as to give other men to understand that things are as they are really falsehoods of whatever kind they be agree in this that they give men to understand that things are otherwise than as in reality they are  xxii personation forgery and perjury are each of them distinguished from other modes of uttering falsehood by certain special circumstances when a falsehood is not accompanied by any of those circumstanees it may be styled simple falsehood these circumstances are   the form in which the falsehood is uttered   the circumstance of its relating or not to the identity of the person of him who utters it   the solemnity of the occasion on which it is uttered   the particular application of these distinctive characters may more commodiously be reserved for another place    xxiii we come now to the subdivisions of offences by falsehood these will bring us back into the regular track of analysis pursued without deviation through the four preceding classes  by whatever means a mischief is brought about whether falsehood be or be not of the number the individuals liable to be affected by it must either be assignable or unassignable if assignable there are but four material articles in respect to which they can be affected to wit their persons their properties their reputations and their conditions in life the case is the same if though unassignable they are comprisable in any class subordinate to that which is composed of the whole number of members of the state if the falsehood tend to the detriment of the whole state it can only be by operating in one or other of the characters which every act that is an offence against the state must assume viz that of an offence against external security against justice against the preventive branch of the police against the public force against the increase of the national felicity against the public wealth against the national population against the national wealth against the sovereignty of the state or against its religion  xxiv it is the common property then of the offences that belong to this division to run over the same ground that is occupied by those of the preceding classes but some of them as we shall see are apt on various occasions to drop or change the names which bring them under this division this is chiefly the case with regard to simple falsehoods others retain their names unchanged and even thereby supersede the names which would otherwise belong to the offences which they denominate this is chiefly the case with regard to personation forgery and perjury when this circumstance then the circumstance of falsehood intervenes in some cases the name which takes the lead is that which indicates the offence by its effect in other cases it is that which indicates the expedient or instrument as it were by the help of which the offence is committed falsehood take it by itself consider it as not being accompanied by any other material circumstances nor therefore productive of any material effects can never upon the principle of utility constitute any offence at all combined with other circumstances there is scarce any sort of pernicious effect which it may not be instrumental in producing it is therefore rather in compliance with the laws of language than in consideration of the nature of the things themselves that falsehoods are made separate mention of under the name and in the character of distinct offences all this would appear plain enough if it were now a time for entering into particulars but that is what cannot be done consistently with any principle of order or convenience until the inferior divisions of those other classes shall have been previously exhibited  xxv we come now to offences against trust a trust is where there is any particular act which one party in the exercise of some power or some right   which is conferred on him is bound to perform for the benefit of another or more fully thus a party is said to be invested with a trust when being invested with a power or with a right there is a certain behaviour which in the exercise of that power or of that right he is bound to maintain for the benefit of some other party in such case the party first mentioned is styled a trustee for the other party no name has ever yet been found for want of a name there seems to be no other resource than to give a new and more extensive sense to the word beneficiary or to say at length the party to be benefited 0  the trustee is also said to have a trust conferred or imposed upon him to be invested with a trust to have had a trust given him to execute to perform to discharge or to fulfil the party to be benefited is said to have a trust established or created in his favour and so on through a variety of other phrases  xxvi now it may occur that a trust is oftentimes spoken of as a species of condition   that a trust is also spoken of as a species of property and that a condition itself is also spoken of same light it may be thought therefore that in the first class the division of offences against condition should have been included under that of the offences against property and that at any rate so much of the fifth class now before us as contains offences against trust should have been included under one or other of those two divisions of the first class but upon examination it will appear that no one of these divisions could with convenience nor even perhaps with propriety have been included under either of the other two it will appear at the same time that there is an intimate connection subsisting amongst them all insomuch that of the lists of the offences to which they are respectively exposed any one may serve in great measure as a model for any other there are certain offences to which all trusts as such are exposed to all these offences every sort of condition will be found exposed at the same time that particular species of the offences against trust will upon their application to particular conditions receive different particular denominations it will appear also that of the two groups of offences into which the list of those against trust will be found naturally to divide itself there is one and but one to which property taken in its proper and more confined sense stands exposed and that these in their application to the subject of property will be found susceptible of distinct modifications to which the usage of language and the occasion there is for distinguishing them in point of treatment make it necessary to find names  in the first place as there are or at least may be as we shall see conditions which are not trusts   so there are trusts of which the idea would not be readily and naturally understood to be included under the word condition add to which that of those conditions which do include a trust the greater number include other ingredients along with it so that the idea of a condition if on the one hand it stretches beyond the idea of a trust does on the other hand fall short of it of the several sorts of trusts by far the most important are those in which it is the public that stands in the relation of beneficiary now these trusts it should seem would hardly present themselves at first view upon the mention of the word condition at any rate what is more material the most important of the offences against these kinds of trust would not seem to be included under the denomination of offences against condition the offences which by this latter appellation would be brought to view would be such only as seemed to affect the interests of an individual of him for example who is considered as being invested with that condition but in offences against public trust it is the influence they have on the interests of the public that constitutes by much the most material part of their pernicious tendency the influence they have on the interests of any individual the only part of their influence which would be readily brought to view by the appellation of offences against condition is comparatively as nothing the word trust directs the attention at once to the interests of that party for whom the person in question is trustee which party upon the addition of the epithet public is immediately understood to be the body composed of the whole assemblage or an indefinite portion of the whole assemblage of the members of the state the idea presented by the words public trust is clear and unambiguous it is but an obscure and ambiguous garb that that idea could be expressed in by the words public condition it appears therefore that the principal part of the offences included under the denomination of offences against trust could not commodiously at least have been included under the head of offences against condition  it is evident enough that for the same reasons neither could they have been included under the head of offences against property it would have appeared preposterous and would have argued a total inattention to the leading principle of the whole work the principle of utility to have taken the most mischievous and alarming part of the offences to which the public stands exposed and forced them into the list of offences against the property of an individual of that individual to wit who in that case would be considered as having in him the property of that public trust which by the offences in question is affected  nor would it have been less improper to have included conditions all of them under the head of property and thereby the whole catalogue of offences against condition under the catalogue of offences against property true it is that there are offences against condition which perhaps with equal propriety and without any change in their nature might be considered in the light of offences against property so extensive and so vague are the ideas that are wont to be annexed to both these objects but there are other offences which though with unquestionable propriety they might be referred to the head of offences against condition could not without the utmost violence done to language be forced under the appellation of offences against property property considered with respect to the proprietor implies invariably a benefit and nothing else whatever obligations or burthens may by accident stand annexed to it yet in itself it can never be otherwise than beneficial on the part of the proprietor it is created not by any commands that are laid on him but by his being left free to do with such or such an article as he likes the obligations it is created by are in every instance laid upon other people on the other hand as to conditions there are several which are of a mixed nature importing as well a burthen to him who stands invested with them as a benefit which indeed is the case with those conditions which we hear most of under that name and which make the greatest figure  there are even conditions which import nothing but burthen without any spark of benefit accordingly when between two parties there is such a relation that one of them stands in the place of an object of property with respect to the other the word property is applied only on one side but the word condition is applied alike to both it is but one of them that is said on that account to be possessed of property but both of them are alike spoken of as being possessed of or being invested with a condition it is the master alone that is considered as possessing a property of which the servant in virtue of the services he is bound to render is the object but the servant not less than the master is spoken of as possessing or being invested with a condition  the case is that if a mans condition is ever spoken of as constituting an article of his property it is in the same loose and indefinite sense of the word in which almost every other offence that could be imagined might be reckoned into the list of offences against property if the language indeed were in every instance in which it made use of the phrase object of property perspicuous enough to point out under that appellation the material and really existent body the person or the thing in which those acts terminate by the performance of which the property is said to be enjoyed if in short in the import given to the phrase object of property it made no other use of it than the putting it to signify what is now called a corporeal object this difficulty and this confusion would not have occurred but the import of the phrase object of property and in consequence the import of the word property has been made to take a much wider range in almost every case in which the law does any thing for a mans benefit or advantage men are apt to speak of it on some occasion or other as conferring on him a sort of property at the same time for one reason or other it has in several cases been not practicable or not agreeable to bring to view under the appellation of the object of his property the thing in which the acts by the performance of which the property is said to be enjoyed have their termination or the person in whom they have their commencement yet something which could be spoken of under that appellation was absolutely requisite   the expedient then has been to create as it were on every occasion an ideal being and to assign to a man this ideal being for the object of his property and these are the sort of objects to which men of science in taking a view of the operations of the law in this behalf came in process of time to give the name of incorporeal now of these incorporeal objects of property the variety is prodigious fictitious entities of this kind have been fabricated almost out of every thing not conditions only that of a trustee included but even reputation have been of the number even liberty has been considered in this same point of view and though on so many occasions it is contrasted with property yet on other occasions being reckoned into the catalogue of possessions it seems to have been considered as a branch of property some of these applications of the words property object of property the last for instance are looked upon indeed as more figurative and less proper than the rest but since the truth is that where the immediate object is incorporeal they are all of them improper it is scarce practicable any where to draw the line  notwithstanding all this latitude yet among the relations in virtue of which you are said to be possessed of a condition there is one at least which can scarcely by the most forced construction be said to render any other man or any other thing the object of your property this is the right of persevering in a certain course of action for instance in the exercising of a certain trade now to confer on you this right in a certain degree at least the law has nothing more to do than barely to abstain from forbidding you to exercise it were it to go farther and for the sake of enabling you to exercise your trade to the greater advantage prohibit others from exercising the like then indeed persons might be found who in a certain sense and by a construction rather forced than otherwise might be spoken of as being the objects of your property viz by being made to render you that sort of negative service which consists in the forbearing to do those acts which would lessen the profits of your trade but the ordinary right of exercising any such trade or profession as is not the object of a monopoly imports no such thing and yet by possessing this right a man is said to possess a condition and by forfeiting it to forfeit his condition  after all it will be seen that there must be cases in which according to the usage of language the same offence may with more or less appearance of propriety be referred to the head of offences against condition or that of offences against property indifferently in such cases the following rule may serve for drawing the line wherever in virtue of your possessing a property or being the object of a property possessed by another you are characterised according to the usage of language by a particular name such as master servant husband wife steward agent attorney or the like there the word condition may be employed in exclusion of the word property and an offence in which in virtue of your bearing such relation you are concerned either in the capacity of an offender or in that of a party injured may be referred to the head of offences against condition and not to that of offences against property to give an example being bound in the capacity of land steward to a certain person to oversee the repairing of a certain bridge you forbear to do so in this case as the services you are bound to render are of the number of those which give occasion to the party from whom they are due to be spoken of under a certain generical name viz that of land steward the offence of withholding them may be referred to the class of offences against condition but suppose that without being engaged in that general and miscellaneous course of service which with reference to a particular person would denominate you his land steward you were bound whether by usage or by contract to render him that single sort of service which consists in the providing by yourself or by others for the repairing of that bridge in this case as there is not any such current denomination to which in virtue of your being bound to render this service you stand aggregated for that of architect mason or the like is not here in question the offence you commit by withholding such service cannot with propriety be referred to the class of offences against condition it can only therefore be referred to the class of offences against property  by way of further distinction it may be remarked that where a man in virtue of his being bound to render or of others being bound to render him certain services is spoken of as possessing a condition the assemblage of services is generally so considerable in point of duration as to constitute a course of considerable length so as on a variety of occasions to come to be varied and repeated and in most cases when the condition is not of a domestic nature sometimes for the benefit of one person sometimes for that of another services which come to be rendered to a particular person on a particular occasion especially if they be of short duration have seldom the effect of occasioning either party to be spoken of as being invested with a condition the particular occasional services which one man may come by contract or otherwise to be bound to render to another are innumerably various but the number of conditions which have names may be counted and are comparatively but few  if after all notwithstanding the rule here given for separating conditions from articles of property any object should present itself which should appear to be referable with equal propriety to either head the inconvenience would not be material since in such cases as will be seen a little farther on whichever appellation were adopted the list of the offences to which the object stands exposed would be substantially the same  these difficulties being cleared up we now proceed to exhibit an analytical view of the several possible offences against trust  xxvii offences against trust may be distinguished in the first place into such as concern the existence of the trust in the hands of such or such a person and such as concern the exercise of the functions that belong to it   first then with regard to such as relate to its existence an offence of this description like one of any other description if an offence it ought to be must to some person or other import a prejudice this prejudice may be distinguished into two branches   that which may fall on such persons as are or should be invested with the trust   that which may fall on the persons for whose sake it is or should be instituted or on other persons at large to begin with the former of these branches let any trust be conceived the consequences which it is in the nature of it to be productive of to the possessor must in as far as they are material   be either of an advantageous or of a disadvantageous nature in as far as they are advantageous the trust may be considered as a benefit or privilege in as far as they are disadvantageous it may be considered as a burthen   to consider it then upon the footing of a benefit the trust either is of the number of those which ought by law to subsist   that is which the legislator meant should be established or is not if it is the possession which at any time you may be deprived of with respect to it must at that time be either present or to come if to come in which case it may be regarded either as certain or as contingent the investitive event or event from whence your possession of it should have taken its commencement was either an event in the production of which the will of the offender should have been instrumental or any other event at large in the former case the offence may be termed wrongful noninvestment of trust in the latter case wrongful interception of trust   if at the time of the offence whereby you are deprived of it you were already in possession of it the offence may be styled wrongful divestment of trust in any of these cases the effect of the offence is either to put somebody else into the trust or not if not it is wrongful divestment wrongful interception or wrongful divestment and nothing more if it be the person put in possession is either the wrongdoer himself in which case it may be styled usurpation of trust or some other person in which case it may be styled wrongful investment or attribution of trust if the trust in question is not of the number of those which ought to subsist it depends upon the manner in which one man deprives another of it whether such deprivation shall or shall not be an offence and accordingly whether noninvestment interception or divestment shall or shall not be wrongful but the putting any body into it must at any rate be an offence and this offence may be either usurpation or wrongful investment as before  in the next place to consider it upon the footing of a burthen in this point of view if no other interest than that of the persons liable to be invested with it were considered it is what ought not upon the principle of utility to subsist if it ought it can only be for the sake of the persons in whose favour it is established if then it ought not on any account to subsist neither noninvestment interception nor divestment can be wrongful with relation to the persons first mentioned whatever they may be on any other account in respect of the manner in which they happen to be performed for usurpation though not likely to be committed there is the same room as before so likewise is there for wrongful investment which in as far as the trust is considered as a burthen may be styled wrongful imposition of trust if the trust being still of the burthensome kind is of the number of those which ought to subsist any offence that can be committed with relation to the existence of it must consist either in causing a person to be in possession of it who ought not to be or in causing a person not to be in possession of it who ought to be in the former case it must be either usurpation or wrongful divestment as before in the latter case the person who is caused to be not in possession is either the wrongdoer himself or some other if the wrongdoer himself either at the time of the offence he was in possession of it or he was not if he was it may be termed wrongful abdication of trust if not wrongful detrectation   or nonassumption if the person whom the offence causes not to be in the trust is any other person the offence must be either wrongful divestment wrongful noninvestment or wrongful interception as before in any of which cases to consider the trust in the light of a burthen it might also be styled wrongful exemption from trust  lastly with regard to the prejudice which the persons for whose benefit the trust is instituted or any other persons whose interests may come to be affected by its existing or not existing in such or such hands are liable to sustain upon examination it will appear that by every sort of offence whereby the persons who are or should be in possession of it are liable in that respect to sustain a prejudice the persons now in question are also liable to sustain a prejudice the prejudice in this case is evidently of a very different nature from what it was of in the other but the same general names will be applicable in this case as in that if the beneficiaries or persons whose interests are at stake upon the exercise of the trust or any of them are liable to sustain a prejudice resulting from the quality of the person by whom it may be filled such prejudice must result from the one or the other of two causes   from a persons having the possession of it who ought not to have it or   from a persons not having it who ought whether it be a benefit or burthen to the possessor is a circumstance that to this purpose makes no difference in the first of these cases the offences from which the prejudice takes its rise are those of usurpation of trust wrongful attribution of trust and wrongful imposition of trust in the latter wrongful noninvestment of trust wrongful interception of trust wrongful divestment of trust wrongful abdication of trust and wrongful detrectation of trust  so much for the offences which concern the existence or possession of a trust those which concern the exercise of the functions that belong to it may be thus conceived you are in possession of a trust the time then for your acting in it must on any given occasion neglecting for simplicitys sake the then present instant be either past or yet to come if past your conduct on that occasion must have been either conformable to the purposes for which the trust was instituted or unconformable if conformable there has been no mischief in the case if unconformable the fault has been either in yourself alone or in some other person or in both in as far as it has lain in yourself it has consisted either in your not doing something which you ought to do in which case it may be styled negative breach of trust or in your doing something which you ought not to do if in the doing something which you ought not to do the party to whom the prejudice has accrued is either the same for whose benefit the trust was instituted or some other party at large in the former of these cases the offence may be styled positive breach of trust in the other abuse of trust 0 in as far as the fault lies in another person the offence on his part may be styled disturbance of trust supposing the time for your acting in the trust to be yet to come the effect of any act which tends to render your conduct unconformable to the purposes of the trust may be either to render it actually and eventually unconformable or to produce a chance of its being so in the former of these cases it can do no otherwise than take one or other of the shapes that have just been mentioned in the latter case the blame must lie either in yourself alone or in some other person or in both together as before if in another person the acts whereby he may tend to render your conduct unconformable must be exercised either on yourself or on other objects at large if exercised on yourself the influence they possess must either be such as operates immediately on your body or such as operates immediately on your mind in the latter case again the tendency of them must be to deprive you either of the knowledge or of the power or of the inclination   which would be necessary to your maintaining such a conduct as shall be conformable to the purposes in question if they be such of which the tendency is to deprive you of the inclination in question it must be by applying to your will the force of some seducing motive   lastly this motive must be either of the coercive or of the alluring kind in other words it must present itself either in the shape of a mischief or of an advantage now in none of all the cases that have been mentioned except the last does the offence receive any new denomination according to the event it is either a disturbance of trust or an abortive attempt to be guilty of that offence in this last it is termed bribery and it is that particular species of it which may be termed active bribery or bribegiving in this case to consider the matter on your part either you accept of the bribe or you do not if not and you do not afterwards commit or go about to commit either a breach or an abuse of trust there is no offence on your part in the case if you do accept it whether you eventually do or do not commit the breach or the abuse which it is the bribegivers intention you should commit you at any rate commit an offence which is also termed bribery and which for distinction sake may be termed passive bribery or bribetaking   as to any farther distinctions they will depend upon the nature of the particular sort of trust in question and therefore belong not to the present place and thus we have thirteen subdivisions of offences against trust viz   wrongful noninvestment of trust   wrongful interception of trust   wrongful divestment of trust   usurpation of trust   wrongful investment or attribution of trust   wrongful abdication of trust   wrongful detrectation of trust   wrongful imposition of trust   negative breach of trust  0 positive breach of trust    abuse of trust    disturbance of trust    bribery  xxviii from what has been said it appears that there cannot be any other offences on the part of a trustee by which a beneficiary can receive on any particular occasion any assignable specific prejudice one sort of acts however there are by which a trustee may be put in some danger of receiving a prejudice although neither the nature of the prejudice nor the occasion on which he is in danger of receiving it should be assignable these can be no other than such acts whatever they may be as dispose the trustee to be acted upon by a given bribe with greater effect than any with which he could otherwise be acted upon or in other words which place him in such circumstances as have a tendency to increase the quantum of his sensibility to the action of any motive of the sort in question   of these acts there seem to be no others that will admit of a description applicable to all places and times alike than acts of prodigality on the part of the trustee but in acts of this nature the prejudice to the beneficiary is contingent only and unliquidated while the prejudice to the trustee himself is certain and liquidated if therefore on any occasion it should be found advisable to treat it on the footing of an offence it will find its place more naturally in the class of selfregarding ones  xxix as to the subdivisions of offences against trust these are perfectly analogous to those of offences by falsehood the trust may be private semipublic or public it may concern property person reputation or condition or any two or more of those articles at a time as will be more particularly explained in another place here too the offence in running over the ground occupied by the three prior classes will in some instances change its name while in others it will not  xxx lastly if it be asked what sort of relation there subsists between falsehoods on one hand and offences concerning trust on the other hand the answer is they are altogether disparate falsehood is a circumstance that may enter into the composition of any sort of offence those concerning trust as well as any other in some as an accidental in others as an essential instrument breach or abuse of trust are circumstances which in the character of accidental concomitants may enter into the composition of any other offences those against falsehood included besides those to which they respectively give name continue reading chapter xvi part    chapter xvi sections    division of offences  continued sect   genera of class i xxxi returning now to class the first let us pursue the distribution a step farther and branch out the several divisions of that class as above exhibited into their respective genera that is into such minuter divisions as are capable of being characterised by denominations of which a great part are already current among the people   in this place the analysis must stop to apply it in the same regular form to any of the other classes seems scarcely practicable to semipublic as also to public offences on account of the interference of local circumstances to selfregarding ones on account of the necessity it would create of deciding prematurely upon points which may appear liable to controversy to offences by falsehood and offences against trust on account of the dependence there is between this class and the three former what remains to be done in this way with reference to these four classes will require discussion and will therefore be introduced with more propriety in the body of the work than in a preliminary part of which the business is only to draw outlines  xxxii an act by which the happiness of an individual is disturbed is either simple in its effects or complex it may be styled simple in its effects when it affects him in one only of the articles or points in which his interest as we have seen is liable to be affected complex when it affects him in several of those points at once such as are simple in their effects must of course be first considered  xxxiii in a simple way that is in one way at a time a mans happiness is liable to be disturbed either   by actions referring to his own person itself or   by actions referring to such external objects on which his happiness is more or less dependent as to his own person it is composed of two different parts or reputed parts his body and his mind acts which exert a pernicious influence on his person whether it be on the corporeal or on the mental part of it will operate thereon either immediately and without affecting his will or mediately through the intervention of that faculty viz by means of the influence which they cause his will to exercise over his body if with the intervention of his will it must be by mental coercion that is by causing him to will to maintain and thence actually to maintain a certain conduct which it is disagreeable or in any other way pernicious to him to maintain this conduct may either be positive or negative   when positive the coercion is styled compulsion or constraint when negative restraint now the way in which the coercion is disagreeable to him may be by producing either pain of body or only pain of mind if pain of body is produced by it the offence will come as well under this as under other denominations which we shall come to presently moreover the conduct which a man by means of the coercion is forced to maintain will be determined either specifically and originally by the determination of the particular acts themselves which he is forced to perform or to abstain from or generally and incidentally by means of his being forced to be or not to be in such or such a place but if he is prevented from being in one place he is confined thereby to another for the whole surface of the earth like the surface of any greater or lesser body may be conceived to be divided into two as well as into any other number of parts or spots if the spot then which he is confined to be smaller than the spot which he is excluded from his condition may be called confinement if larger banishment   whether an act the effect of which is to exert a pernicious influence on the person of him who suffers by it operates with or without the intervention of an act of his will the mischief it produces will either be mortal or not mortal if not mortal it will either be reparable that is temporary or irreparable that is perpetual if reparable the mischievous act may be termed a simple corporal injury if irreparable an irreparable corporal injury lastly a pain that a man experiences in his mind will either be a pain of actual sufferance or a pain of apprehension if a pain of apprehension either the offender himself is represented as intending to bear a part in the production of it or he is not in the former case the offence may be styled menacement in the latter case as also where the pain is a pain of actual sufferance a simple mental injury and thus we have nine genera or kinds of personal injuries which when ranged in the order most commodious for examination will stand as follows viz   simple corporal injuries   irreparable corporal injuries   simple injurious restrainment   simple injurious compulsion     wrongful confinement   wrongful banishment   wrongful homicide   wrongful menacement     simple mental injuries 0  xxxiv we come now to offences against reputation merely these require but few distinctions in point of reputation there is but one way of suffering which is by losing a portion of the goodwill of others now in respect of the goodwill which others bear you you may be a loser in either of two ways   by the manner in which you are thought to behave yourself and   by the manner in which others behave or are thought to behave towards you to cause people to think that you yourself have so behaved as to have been guilty of any of those acts which cause a man to possess less than he did before of the goodwill of the community is what may be styled defamation but such is the constitution of human nature and such the force of prejudice that a man merely by manifesting his own want of goodwill towards you though ever so unjust in itself and ever so unlawfully expressed may in a manner force others to withdraw from you a part of theirs when he does this by words or by such actions as have no other effect than in as far as they stand in the place of words the offence may be styled vilification when it is done by such actions as besides their having this effect are injuries to the person the offence may be styled a personal insult if it has got the length of reaching the body a corporal insult if it stopped short before it reached that length it may be styled insulting menacement and thus we have two genera or kinds of offences against reputation merely to wit   defamation and   vilification or revilement   as to corporal insults and insulting menacement they belong to the compound title of offences against person and reputation both together  xxxv if the property of one man suffers by the delinquency of another such property either was in trust with the offender or it was not if it was in trust the offence is a breach of trust and of whatever nature it may be in other respects may be styled dissipation in breach of trust or dissipation of property in trust this is a particular case the opposite one is the more common in such case the several ways in which property may by possibility become the object of an offence may be thus conceived offences against property of whatever kind it be may be distinguished as hath been already intimated   into such as concern the legal possession of it or right to it and such as concern only the enjoyment of it or what is the same thing the exercise of that right under the former of these heads come as hath been already intimated   the several offences of wrongful noninvestment wrongful interception wrongful divestment usurpation and wrongful attribution when in the commission of any of these offences a falsehood has served as an instrument and that as it is commonly called a wilful or as it might more properly be termed an advised   one the epithet fraudulent may be prefixed to the name of the offence or substituted in the room of the word wrongful the circumstance of fraudulency then may serve to characterise a particular species comprisable under each of those generic heads in like manner the circumstance of force of which more a little farther on may serve to characterize another with respect to wrongful interception in particular the investitive event by which the title to the thing in question should have accrued to you and for want of which such title is through the delinquency of the offender as it were intercepted is either an act of his own expressing it as his will that you should be considered by the law as the person who is legally in possession of it or it is any other event at large in the former case if the thing of which you should have been put into possession is a sum of money to a certain amount the offence is that which has received the name of insolvency which branch of delinquency in consideration of the importance and extent of it may be treated on the footing of a distinct genus of itself    next with regard to such of the offences against property as concern only the enjoyment of the object in question this object must be either a service or set of services   which should have been rendered by some person or else an article belonging to the class of things in the former ease the offence may be styled wrongful withholding of services   in the latter case it may admit of farther modifications which may be thus conceived when any object which you have had the physical occupation or enjoyment of ceases in any degree in consequence of the act of another man and without any change made in so much of that power as depends upon the intrinsic physical condition of your person to be subject to that power this cessation is either owing to change in the intrinsic condition of the thing itself or in its exterior situation with respect to you that is to its being situated out of your reach in the former case the nature of the change is either such as to put it out of your power to make any use of it at all in which case the thing is said to be destroyed and the offence whereby it is so treated may be termed wrongful destruction or such only as to render the uses it is capable of being put to of less value than before in which case it is said to be damaged or to have sustained damage and the offence may be termed wrongful endamagement moreover in as far as the value which a thing is of to you is considered as being liable to be in some degree impaired by any act on the part of any other person exercised upon that thing although on a given occasion no perceptible damage should ensue the exercise of any such act is commonly treated on the footing of an offence which may be termed wrongful using or occupation  if the cause of the things failing in its capacity of being of use to you lies in the exterior situation of it with relation to you the offence may be styled wrongful detainment   wrongful detainment or detention during any given period of time may either be accompanied with the intention of detaining the thing for ever that is for an indefinite time or not if it be and if it be accompanied at the same time with the intention of not being amenable to law for what is done it seems to answer to the idea commonly annexed to the word embezzlement an offence which is commonly accompanied with breach of trust   in the case of wrongful occupation the physical faculty of occupying may have been obtained with or without the assistance or consent of the proprietor or other person appearing to have a right to afford such assistance or consent if without such assistance or consent and the occupation be accompanied with the intention of detaining the thing for ever together with the intention of not being amenable to law for what is done the offence seems to answer to the idea commonly annexed to the word theft or stealing if in the same circumstances a force is put upon the body of any person who uses or appears to be disposed to use any endeavours to prevent the act this seems to be one of the cases in which the offence is generally understood to come under the name of robbery  if the physical faculty in question was obtained with the assistance or consent of a proprietor or other person above spoken of and still the occupation of the thing is an offence it may have been either because the assistance or consent was not fairly or because it was not freely obtained if not fairly obtained it was obtained by falsehood which if advised is in such a case termed fraud and the offence if accompanied with the intention of not being amenable to law may be termed fraudulent obtainment or defraudment 0 if not freely obtained it was obtained by force to wit either by a force put upon the body which has been already mentioned or by a force put upon the mind if by a force put upon the mind or in other words by the application of coercive motives   it must be by producing the apprehension of some evil which evil if the act is an offence must be some evil to which on the occasion in question the one person has no right to expose the other this is one case in which if the offence be accompanied with the intention of detaining the thing for ever whether it be or be not accompanied with the intention of not being amenable to law it seems to agree with the idea of what is commonly meant by extortion now the part a man takes in exposing another to the evil in question must be either a positive or a negative part in the former case again the evil must either be present or distant in the case then where the assistance or consent is obtained by a force put upon the body or where if by a force put upon the mind the part taken in the exposing a man to the apprehension of the evil is positive the evil present and the object of it his person and if at any rate the extortion thus applied be accompanied with the intention of not being amenable to law it seems to agree with the remaining case of what goes under the name of robbery  as to dissipation in breach of trust this when productive of a pecuniary profit to the trustee seems to be one species of what is commonly meant by peculation another and the only remaining one seems to consist in acts of occupation exercised by the trustee upon the things which are the objects of the fiduciary property for his own benefit and to the damage of the beneficiary as to robbery this offence by the manner in which the assistance or consent is obtained becomes an offence against property and person at the same time dissipation in breach of trust and peculation may perhaps be more commodiously treated of under the head of offences against trust   after these exceptions we have thirteen genera or principal kinds of offences against property which when ranged in the order most commodious for examination may stand as follows viz   wrongful noninvestment of property   wrongful interception of property   wrongful divestment of property   usurpation of property   wrongful investment of property   wrongful withholding of services   wrongful destruction or endamagement   wrongful occupation   wrongful detainment  0 embezzlement    theft    defraudment    extortion    we proceed now to consider offences which are complex in their effects regularly indeed we should come to offences against condition but it will be more convenient to speak first of offences by which a mans interest is affected in two of the preceding points at once  xxxvi first then with regard to offences which affect person and reputation together when any man by a mode of treatment which affects the person injures the reputation of another his end and purpose must have been either his own immediate pleasure or that sort of reflected pleasure which in certain circumstances may be reaped from the suffering of another now the only immediate pleasure worth regarding which any one can reap from the person of another and which at the same time is capable of affecting the reputation of the latter is the pleasure of the sexual appetite   this pleasure then if reaped at all must have been reaped either against the consent of the party or with consent if with consent the consent must have been obtained either freely and fairly both or freely but not fairly or else not even freely in which case the fairness is out of the question if the consent be altogether wanting the offence is called rape if not fairly obtained seduction simply if not freely it may be called forcible seduction in any case either the offence has gone the length of consummation or has stopped short of that period if it has gone that length it takes one or other of the names just mentioned if not it may be included alike in all cases under the denomination of a simple lascivious injury lastly to take the case where a man injuring you in your reputation by proceedings that regard your person does it for the sake of that sort of pleasure which will sometimes result from the contemplation of anothers pain under these circumstances either the offence has actually gone the length of a corporal injury or it has rested in menacement in the first case it may be styled a corporal insult in the other it may come under the name of insulting menacement and thus we have six genera or kind of offences against person and reputation together which when ranged in the order most commodious for consideration will stand thus   corporal insults   insulting menacement   seduction   rape   forcible seduction   simple lascivious injuries    xxxvii secondly with respect to those which affect person and property together that a force put upon the person of a man may be among the means by which the title to property may be unlawfully taken away or acquired has been already stated   a force of this sort then is a circumstance which may accompany the offences of wrongful interception wrongful divestment usurpation and wrongful investment but in these cases the intervention of this circumstance does not happen to have given any new denomination to the offence   in all or any of these cases however by prefixing the epithet forcible we may have so many names of offences which may either be considered as constituting so many species of the genera belonging to the division of offences against property or as so many genera belonging to the division now before us among the offences that concern the enjoyment of the thing the case is the same with wrongful destruction and wrongful endamagement as also with wrongful occupation and wrongful detainment as to the offence of wrongful occupation it is only in the case where the thing occupied belongs to the class of immovables that when accompanied by the kind of force in question has obtained a particular name which is in common use in this case it is called forcible entry forcible detainment as applied also to immovables but only to immovables has obtained among lawyers at least the name of forcible detainer   and thus we may distinguish ten genera or kinds of offences against person and property together which omitting for conciseness sake the epithet wrongful will stand thus   forcible interception of property   forcible divestment of property   forcible usurpation   forcible investment   forcible destruction or endamagement   forcible occupation of movables   forcible entry   forcible detainment of movables   forcible detainment of immovables  0 robbery    xxxviii we come now to offences against condition a mans condition or station in life is constituted by the legal relation he bears to the persons who are about him that is as we have already had occasion to show 0 by duties which by being imposed on one side give birth to rights or powers on the other these relations it is evident may be almost infinitely diversified some means however may be found of circumscribing the field within which the varieties of them are displayed in the first place they must either be such as are capable of displaying themselves within the circle of a private family or such as require a larger space the conditions constituted by the former sort of relations may be styled domestic those constituted by the latter civil  xxxix as to domestic conditions the legal relations by which they are constituted may be distinguished into   such as are superadded to relations purely natural and   such as without any such natural basis subsist purely by institution by relations purely natural i mean those which may be said to subsist between certain persons in virtue of the concern which they themselves or certain other persons have had in the process which is necessary to the continuance of the species these relations may be distinguished in the first place into contiguous and uncontiguous the uncontiguous subsist through the intervention of such as are contiguous the contiguous may be distinguished in the first place into connubial and postconnubial   those which may be termed connubial are two   that which the male bears towards the female   that which the female bears to the male   the postconnubial are either productive or derivative the productive is that which the male and female abovementioned bear each of them towards the children who are the immediate fruit of their union this is termed the relation of parentality now as the parents must be so the children may be of different sexes accordingly the relation of parentality may be distinguished into four species   that which a father bears to his son this is termed paternity   that which a father bears to his daughter this also is termed paternity   that which a mother bears to her son this is called maternity   that which a mother bears to her daughter this also is termed maternity uncontiguous natural relations may be distinguished into immediate and remote such as are immediate are what one person bears to another in consequence of their bearing each of them one simple relation to some third person thus the paternal grandfather is related to the paternal grandson by means of the two different kinds which together they bear to the father the brother on the fathers side to the brother by means of the two relations of the same kind which together they bear to the father in the same manner we might proceed to find places in the system for the infinitely diversified relations which result from the combinations that may be formed by mixing together the several sorts of relationships by ascent relationships by descent collateral relationships and relationships by affinity which latter when the union between the two parties through whom the affinity takes place is sanctioned by matrimonial solemnities are termed relationships by marriage but this as it would be a most intricate and tedious task so happily is it for the present purpose an unnecessary one the only natural relations to which it will be necessary to pay any particular attention are those which when sanctioned by law give birth to the conditions of husband and wife the two relations comprised under the head of parentality and the corresponding relations comprised under the head of filiality or filiation  what then are the relations of a legal kind which can be superinduced upon the abovementioned natural relations they must be such as it is the nature of law to give birth to and establish but the relations which subsist purely by institution exhaust as we shall see the whole stock of relationships which it is in the nature of the law to give birth to and establish the relations then which can be superinduced upon those which are purely natural cannot be in themselves any other than what are of the number of those which subsist purely by institution so that all the difference there can be between a legal relation of the one sort and a legal relation of the other sort is that in the former case the circumstance which gave birth to the natural relation serves as a mark to indicate where the legal relation is to fix in the latter case the place where the legal relation is to attach is determined not by that circumstance but by some other from these considerations it will appear manifestly enough that for treating of the several sorts of conditions as well natural as purely conventional in the most commodious order it will be necessary to give the precedence to the latter proceeding throughout upon the same principle we shall all along give the priority not to those which are first by nature but to those which are most simple in point of description there is no other way of avoiding perpetual anticipations and repetitions  xl we come now to consider the domestic or family relations which are purely of legal institution it is to these in effect that both kinds of domestic conditions considered as the work of law are indebted for their origin when the law no matter for what purpose takes upon itself to operate in a matter in which it has not operated before it can only be by imposing obligation   now when a legal obligation is imposed on any man there are but two ways in which it can in the first instance be enforced the one is by giving the power of enforcing it to the party in whose favour it is imposed the other is by reserving that power to certain third persons who in virtue of their possessing it are styled ministers of justice in the first case the party favoured is said to possess not only a right as against the party obliged but also a power over him in the second case a right only uncorroborated by power in the first case the party favoured may be styled a superior and as they are both members of the same family a domestic superior with reference to the party obliged who in the same case may be styled a domestic inferior with reference to the party favoured now in point of possibility it is evident that domestic conditions or a kind of fictitious possession analogous to domestic conditions might have been looked upon as constituted as well by rights alone without powers on either side as by powers but in point of utility   it does not seem expedient and in point of fact probably owing to the invariable perception which men must have had of the inexpediency no such conditions seem ever to have been constituted by such feeble bands of the legal relationships then which are capable of being made to subsist within the circle of a family there remain those only in which the obligation is enforced by power now then wherever any such power is conferred the end or purpose for which it was conferred unless the legislator can be supposed to act without a motive must have been the producing of a benefit to somebody in other words it must have been conferred for the sake of somebody the person then for whose sake it is conferred must either be one of the two parties just mentioned or a third party if one of these two it must be either the superior or the inferior if the superior such superior is commonly called a master and the inferior is termed his servant and the power may be termed a beneficial one if it be for the sake of the inferior that the power is established the superior is termed a guardian and the inferior his ward and the power being thereby coupled with a trust may be termed a fiduciary one if for the sake of a third party the superior may be termed a superintendent and the inferior his subordinate this third party will either be an assignable individual or set of individuals or a set of unassignable individuals in this latter case the trust is either a public or a semipublic one and the condition which it constitutes is not of the domestic but of the civil kind in the former case this third party or principal as he may be termed either has a beneficial power over the superintendent or he has not if he has the superintendent is his servant and consequently so also is the subordinate if not the superintendent is the master of the subordinate and all the advantage which the principal has over his superintendent it that of possessing a set of rights uncorroborated by power and therefore as we have seen   not fit to constitute a condition of the domestic kind but be the condition what it may which is constituted by these rights of what nature can the obligations be to which the superintendent is capable of being subjected by means of them they are neither more nor less than those which a man is capable of being subjected to by powers it follows therefore that the functions of a principal and his superintendent coincide with those of a master and his servant and consequently that the offences relative to the two former conditions will coincide with the offences relative to the two latter  xli offences to which the condition of a master like any other kind of condition is exposed may as hath been already intimated   be distinguished into such as concern the existence of the condition itself and such as concern the performance of the functions of it while subsisting first then with regard to such as affect its existence it is obvious enough that the services of one man may be a benefit to another the condition of a master may therefore be a beneficial one it stands exposed therefore to the offences of wrongful noninvestment wrongful interception usurpation wrongful investment and wrongful divestment but how should it stand exposed to the offences of wrongful abdication wrongful detrectation and wrongful imposition certainly it cannot of itself for services when a man has the power of exacting them or not as he thinks fit can never be a burthen but if to the powers by which the condition of a master is constituted the law thinks fit to annex any obligation on the part of the master for instance that of affording maintenance or giving wages to the servant or paying money to anybody else it is evident that in virtue of such obligation the condition may become a burthen in this case however the condition possessed by the master will not properly speaking be the pure and simple condition of a master it will be a kind of complex object resolvable into the beneficial condition of a master and the burthensome obligation which is annexed to it still however if the nature of the obligation lies within a narrow compass and does not in the manner of that which constitutes a trust interfere with the exercise of those powers by which the condition of the superior is constituted the latter notwithstanding this foreign mixture will still retain the name of mastership   in this case therefore but not otherwise the condition of a master may stand exposed to the offences of wrongful abdication wrongful detrectation and wrongful imposition next as to the behaviour of persons with reference to this condition while considered as subsisting in virtue of its being a benefit it is exposed to disturbance this disturbance will either be the offence of a stranger or the offence of the servant himself where it is the offence of a stranger and is committed by taking the person of the servant in circumstances in which the taking of an object belonging to the class of things would be an act of theft or what is scarcely worth distinguishing from theft an act of embezzlement it may be termed servantstealing where it is the offence of the servant himself it is styled breach of duty now the most flagrant species of breach of duty and that which includes indeed every other is that which consists in the servants withdrawing himself from the place in which the duty should be performed this species of breach of duty is termed elopement again in virtue of the power belonging to this condition it is liable on the part of the master to abuse but this power is not coupled with a trust the condition of a master is therefore not exposed to any offence which is analogous to breach of trust lastly on account of its being exposed to abuse it may be conceived to stand in point of possibility exposed to bribery but considering how few and how insignificant the persons are who are liable to be subject to the power here in question this is an offence which on account of the want of temptation there will seldom be any example of in practice we may therefore reckon thirteen sorts of offences to which the condition of a master is exposed viz   wrongful noninvestment of mastership   wrongful interception of mastership   wrongful divestment of mastership   usurpation of mastership   wrongful investment of mastership   wrongful abdication of mastership   wrongful detrectation of mastership   wrongful imposition of mastership   abuse of mastership  0 disturbance of mastership    breach of duty in servants    elopement of servants    servantstealing  xlii as to the power by which the condition of a master is constituted this may be either limited or unlimited when it is altogether unlimited the condition of the servant is styled pure slavery but as the rules of language are as far as can be conceived from being steady on this head the term slavery is commonly made use of wherever the limitations prescribed to the power of the master are looked upon as inconsiderable whenever any such limitation is prescribed a kind of fictitious entity is thereby created and in quality of an incorporeal object of possession is bestowed upon the servant this object is of the class of those which are called rights and in the present case is termed in a more particular manner a liberty and sometimes a privilege an immunity or an exemption now those limitations on the one hand and these liberties on the other may it is evident be as various as the acts positive or negative which the master may or may not have the power of obliging the servant to submit to or to perform correspondent then to the infinitude of these liberties is the infinitude of the modifications which the condition of mastership or as it is more common to say in such a case that of servitude admits of these modifications it is evident may in different countries be infinitely diversified in different countries therefore the offences characterised by the above names will if specifically considered admit of very different descriptions if there be a spot upon the earth so wretched as to exhibit the spectacle of pure and absolutely unlimited slavery on that spot there will be no such thing as any abuse of mastership which means neither more nor less than that no abuse of mastership will there be treated on the footing of an offence as to the question whether any and what modes of servitude ought to be established or kept on foot this is a question the solution of which belongs to the civil branch of the art of legislation  xliii next with regard to the offences that may concern the condition of a servant it might seem at first sight that a condition of this kind could not have a spark of benefit belonging to it that it could not be attended with any other consequences than such as rendered it a mere burthen but a burthen itself may be a benefit in comparison of a greater burthen conceive a mans situation then to be such that he must at any rate be in a state of pure slavery still may it be material to him and highly material who the person is whom he has for his master a state of slavery then under one master may be a beneficial state to him in comparison with a state of slavery under another master the condition of a servant then is exposed to the several offences to which a condition in virtue of its being a beneficial one is exposed   more than this where the power of the master is limited and the limitations annexed to it and thence the liberties of the servant are considerable the servitude may even be positively eligible for amongst those limitations may be such as are sufficient to enable the servant to possess property of his own being capable then of possessing property of his own he may be capable of receiving it from his master in short he may receive wages or other emoluments from his master and the benefit resulting from these wages may be so considerable as to outweigh the burthen of the servitude and by that means render that condition more beneficial upon the whole and more eligible than that of one who is not in any respect under the control of any such person as a master accordingly by these means the condition of the servant may be so eligible that his entrance into it and his continuance in it may have been altogether the result of his own choice that the nature of the two conditions may be the more clearly understood it may be of use to show the sort of correspondency there is between the offences which affect the existence of the one and those which affect the existence of the other that this correspondency cannot but be very intimate is obvious at first sight it is not however that a given offence in the former catalogue coincides with an offence of the same name in the latter catalogue usurpation of servantship with usurpation of mastership for example but the case is that an offence of one denomination in the one catalogue coincides with an offence of a different denomination in the other catalogue nor is the coincidence constant and certain but liable to contingencies as we shall see first then wrongful noninvestment of the condition of a servant if it be the offence of one who should have been the master coincides with wrongful detrectation of mastership if it be the offence of a third person it involves in it noninvestment of mastership which provided the mastership be in the eyes of him who should have been master a beneficial thing but not otherwise is wrongful   wrongful interception of the condition of a servant if it be the offence of him who should have been master coincides with wrongful detrectation of mastership if it be the offence of a third person and the mastership be a beneficial thing it involves in it wrongful interception of mastership   wrongful divestment of servantship if it be the offence of the master but not otherwise coincides with wrongful abdication of mastership if it be the offence of a stranger it involves in it divestment of mastership which in as far as the mastership is a beneficial thing is wrongful   usurpation of servantship coincides necessarily with wrongful imposition of mastership it will be apt to involve in it wrongful divestment of mastership but this only in the case where the usurper previously to the usurpation was in a state of servitude under some other master   wrongful investment of servantship the servantship being considered as a beneficial thing coincides with imposition of mastership which if in the eyes of the pretended master the mastership should chance to be a burthen will be wrongful   wrongful abdication of servantship coincides with wrongful divestment of mastership   wrongful detrectation of servantship with wrongful noninvestment of mastership   wrongful imposition of servantship if it be the offence of the pretended master coincides with usurpation of mastership if it be the offence of a stranger it involves in it imposition of mastership which if in the eyes of the pretended master the mastership should be a burthen will be wrongful as to abuse of mastership disturbance of mastership breach of duty in servants elopement of servants and servantstealing these are offences which without any change of denomination bear equal relation to both conditions and thus we may reckon thirteen sorts of offences to which the condition of a servant stands exposed viz   wrongful noninvestment of servantship   wrongful interception of servantship   wrongful divestment of servantship   usurpation of servantship   wrongful investment of servantship   wrongful abdication of servantship   wrongful detrectation of servantship   wrongful imposition of servantship   abuse of mastership  0 disturbance of mastership    breach of duty in servants    elopement of servants    servantstealing  xliv we now come to the offences to which the condition of a guardian is exposed a guardian is one who is invested with power over another living within the compass of the same family and called a ward the power being to be exercised for the benefit of the ward now then what are the cases in which it can be for the benefit of one man that another living within the compass of the same family should exercise power over him consider either of the parties by himself and suppose him in point of understanding to be on a level with the other it seems evident enough that no such cases can ever exist   to the production of happiness on the part of any given person in like manner as to the production of any other effect which is the result of human agency three things it is necessary should concur knowledge inclination and physical power now as there is no man who is so sure of being inclined on all occasions to promote your happiness as you yourself are so neither is there any man who upon the whole can have had so good opportunities as you must have had of knowing what is most conducive to that purpose for who should know so well as you do what it is that gives you pain or pleasure 0 moreover as to power it is manifest that no superiority in this respect on the part of a stranger could for a constancy make up for so great a deficiency as he must lie under in respect of two such material points as knowledge and inclination if then there be a case where it can be for the advantage of one man to be under the power of another it must be on account of some palpable and very considerable deficiency on the part of the former in point of intellects or which is the same thing in other words in point of knowledge or understanding now there are two cases in which such palpable deficiency is known to take place these are   where a mans intellect is not yet arrived at that state in which it is capable of directing his own inclination in the pursuit of happiness this is the case of infancy     where by some particular known or unknown circumstance his intellect has either never arrived at that state or having arrived at it has fallen from it which is the case of insanity  by what means then is it to be ascertained whether a mans intellect is in that state or no for exhibiting the quantity of sensible heat in a human body we have a very tolerable sort of instrument the thermometer but for exhibiting the quantity of intelligence we have no such instrument it is evident therefore that the line which separates the quantity of intelligence which is sufficient for the purposes of selfgovernment from that which is not sufficient must be in a great measure arbitrary where the insufficiency is the result of want of age the sufficient quantity of intelligence be it what it may does not accrue to all at the same period of their lives it becomes therefore necessary for legislators to cut the gordian knot and fix upon a particular period at which and not before truly or not every person whatever shall be deemed as far as depends upon age to be in possession of this sufficient quantity   in this case then a line is drawn which may be the same for every man and in the description of which such as it is whatever persons are concerned may be certain of agreeing the circumstance of time affording a mark by which the line in question may be traced with the utmost degree of nicety on the other hand where the insufficiency is the result of insanity there is not even this resource so that here the legislator has no other expedient than to appoint some particular person or persons to give a particular determination of the question in every instance in which it occurs according to his or their particular and arbitrary discretion arbitrary enough it must be at any rate since the only way in which it can be exercised is by considering whether the share of intelligence possessed by the individual in question does or does not come up to the loose and indeterminate idea which persons so appointed may chance to entertain with respect to the quantity which is deemed sufficient  xlv the line then being drawn or supposed to be so it is expedient to a man who cannot with safety to himself be left in his own power that he should be placed in the power of another how long then should he remain so just so long as his inability is supposed to continue that is in the case of infancy till he arrives at that period at which the law deems him to be of full age in the case of insanity till he be of sound mind and understanding now it is evident that this period in the case of infancy may not arrive for a considerable time and in the case of insanity perhaps never the duration of the power belonging to this trust must therefore in the one case be very considerable in the other case indefinite  xlvi the next point to consider is what may be the extent of it for as to what ought to be that is a matter to be settled not in a general analytical sketch but in a particular and circumstantial dissertation by possibility then this power may possess any extent that can be imagined it may extend to any acts which physically speaking it may be in the power of the ward to perform himself or be the object of if exercised by the guardian conceive the power for a moment to stand upon this footing the condition of the ward stands now exactly upon a footing with pure slavery add the obligation by which the power is turned into a trust the limits of the power are now very considerably narrowed what then is the purport of this obligation of what nature is the course of conduct it prescribes it is such a course of conduct as shall be best calculated for procuring to the ward the greatest quantity of happiness which his faculties and the circumstances he is in will admit of saving always in the first place the regard which the guardian is permitted to show to his own happiness and in the second place that which he is obliged as well as permitted to show to that of other men this is in fact no other than that course of conduct which the ward did he but know how ought in point of prudence to maintain of himself so that the business of the former is to govern the latter precisely in the manner in which this latter ought to govern himself now to instruct each individual in what manner to govern his own conduct in the details of life is the particular business of private ethics to instruct individuals in what manner to govern the conduct of those whose happiness during nonage is committed to their charge is the business of the art of private education the details therefore of the rules to be given for that purpose any more than the acts which are capable of being committed in violation of those rules belong not to the art of legislation since as will be seen more particularly hereafter   such details could not with any chance of advantage be provided for by the legislator some general outlines might indeed be drawn by his authority and in point of fact some are in every civilized state but such regulations it is evident must be liable to great variation in the first place according to the infinite diversity of civil conditions which a man may stand invested with in any given state in the next place according to the diversity of local circumstances that may influence the nature of the conditions which may chance to be established in different states on this account the offences which would be constituted by such regulations could not be comprised under any concise and settled denominations capable of a permanent and extensive application no place therefore can be allotted to them here  xlvii by what has been said we are the better prepared for taking an account of the offences to which the condition in question stands exposed guardianship being a private trust is of course exposed to those offences and no others by which a private trust is liable to be affected some of them however on account of the special quality of the trust will admit of some further particularity of description in the first place breach of this species of trust may be termed mismanagement of guardianship in the second place of whatever nature the duties are which are capable of being annexed to this condition it must often happen that in order to fulfil them it is necessary the guardian should be at a certain particular place mismanagement of guardianship when it consists in the not being on the occasion in question at the place in question may be termed desertion of guardianship thirdly it is manifest enough that the object which the guardian ought to propose to himself in the exercise of the powers to which those duties are annexed is to procure for the ward the greatest quantity of happiness which can be procured for him consistently with the regard which is due to the other interests that have been mentioned for this is the object which the ward would have proposed to himself and might and ought to have been allowed to propose to himself had he been capable of governing his own conduct now in order to procure this happiness it is necessary that he should possess a certain power over the objects on the use of which such happiness depends these objects are either the person of the ward himself or other objects that are extraneous to him these other objects are either things or persons as to things then objects of this class insofar as a mans happiness depends upon the use of them are styled his property the case is the same with the services of any persons over whom he may happen to possess a beneficial power or to whose services he may happen to possess a beneficial right now when property of any kind which is in trust suffers by the delinquency of him with whom it is in trust such offence of whatever nature it is in other respects may be styled dissipation in breach of trust and if it be attended with a profit to the trustee it may be styled peculation   fourthly for one person to exercise a power of any kind over another it is necessary that the latter should either perform certain acts upon being commanded so to do by the former or at least should suffer certain acts to be exercised upon himself in this respect a ward must stand upon the footing of a servant and the condition of a ward must in this respect stand exposed to the same offences to which that of a servant stands exposed that is on the part of a stranger to disturbance which in particular circumstances will amount to theft on the part of the ward to breach of duty which in particular circumstances may be effected by elopement fifthly there does not seem to be any offence concerning guardianship that corresponds to abuse of trust i mean in the sense to which the lastmentioned denomination has been here confined   the reason is that guardianship being a trust of a private nature does not as such confer upon the trustee any power either over the persons or over the property of any party other than the beneficiary himself if by accident it confers on the trustee a power over any persons whose services constitute a part of the property of the beneficiary the trustee becomes thereby in certain respects the master of such servants   sixthly bribery also is a sort of offence to which in this case there is not commonly much temptation it is an offence however which by possibility is capable of taking this direction and must therefore be aggregated to the number of the offences to which the condition of a guardian stands exposed and thus we have in all seventeen of these offences viz   wrongful noninvestment of guardianship   wrongful interception of guardianship   wrongful divestment of guardianship   usurpation of guardianship   wrongful investment of guardianship   wrongful abdication of guardianship   detrectation of guardianship   wrongful imposition of guardianship   mismanagement of guardianship  0 desertion of guardianship    dissipation in prejudice of wardship    peculation in prejudice of wardship    disturbance of guardianship    breach of duty to guardians    elopement from guardians    wardstealing    bribery in prejudice of wardship  xlviii next with regard to offences to which the condition of wardship is exposed those which first affect the existence of the condition itself are as follows   wrongful noninvestment of the condition of a ward this if it be the offence of one who should have been guardian coincides with wrongful detrectation of guardianship if it be the offence of a third person it involves in it noninvestment of guardianship which provided the guardianship is in the eyes of him who should have been guardian a desirable thing is wrongful   wrongful interception of wardship this if it be the offence of him who should have been guardian coincides with wrongful detrectation of guardianship if it be the offence of a third person it involves in it interception of guardianship which provided the guardianship is in the eyes of him who should have been guardian a desirable thing is wrongful   wrongful divestment of wardship this if it be the offence of the guardian but not otherwise coincides with wrongful abdication of guardianship if it be the offence of a third person it involves in it divestment of guardianship which if the guardianship is in the eyes of the guardian a desirable thing is wrongful   usurpation of the condition of a ward an offence not very likely to be committed this coincides at any rate with wrongful imposition of guardianship and if the usurper were already under the guardianship of another guardian it will involve in it wrongful divestment of such guardianship     wrongful investment of wardship the wardship being considered as a beneficial thing this coincides with imposition of guardianship which if in the eyes of the pretended guardian the guardianship should be a burthen will be wrongful   wrongful abdication of wardship this coincides with wrongful divestment of guardianship   wrongful detrectation of wardship this coincides with wrongful interception of guardianship   wrongful imposition of wardship this if the offender be the pretended guardian coincides with usurpation of guardianship if a stranger it involves in it wrongful imposition of guardianship as to such of the offences relative to this condition as concern the consequences of it while subsisting they are of such a nature that without any change of denomination they belong equally to the condition of a guardian and that of a ward we may therefore reckon seventeen sorts of offences relative to the condition of a ward   wrongful noninvestment of wardship   wrongful interception of wardship   wrongful divestment of wardship   usurpation of wardship   wrongful investment of wardship   wrongful abdication of wardship   wrongful detrectation of wardship   wrongful imposition of wardship   mismanagement of guardianship  0 desertion of guardianship    dissipation in prejudice of wardship    peculation in prejudice of wardship    disturbance of guardianship    breach of duty to guardians    elopement from guardians    wardstealing    bribery in prejudice of wardship  xlix we come now to the offences to which the condition of a parent stands exposed and first with regard to those by which the very existence of the condition is affected on this occasion in order to see the more clearly into the subject it will be necessary to distinguish between the natural relationship and the legal relationship which is superinduced as it were upon the natural one the natural one being constituted by a particular event which either on account of its being already past or on some other account is equally out of the power of the law neither is nor can be made the subject of an offence is a man your father it is not any offence of mine that can make you not his son is he not your father it is not any offence of mine that can render him so but although he does in fact bear that relation to you i by an offence of mine may perhaps so manage matters that he shall not be thought to bear it which with respect to any legal advantages which either he or you could derive from such relationship will be the same thing as if he did not in the capacity of a witness i may cause the judges to believe that he is not your father and to decree accordingly or in the capacity of a judge i may myself decree him not to be your father leaving then the purely natural relationship as an object equally out of the reach of justice and injustice the legal condition it is evident will stand exposed to the same offences neither more nor less as every other condition that is capable of being either beneficial or burthensome stands exposed to next with regard to the exercise of the functions belonging to this condition considered as still subsisting in parentality there must be two persons concerned the father and the mother the condition of a parent includes therefore two conditions that of a father and that of a mother with respect to such or such a child now it is evident that between these two parties whatever beneficiary powers and other rights as also whatever obligations are annexed to the condition of a parent may be shared in any proportions that can be imagined but if in these several objects of legal creation each of these two parties have severally a share and if the interests of all these parties are in any degree provided for it is evident that each of the parents will stand with relation to the child in two several capacities that of a master and that of a guardian the condition of a parent then in as far as it is the work of law may be considered as a complex condition compounded of that of a guardian and that of a master to the parent then in quality of guardian results a set of duties involving as necessary to the discharge of them certain powers to the child in the character of a ward a set of rights corresponding to the parents duties and a set of duties corresponding to his powers to the parent again in quality of master a set of beneficiary powers without any other necessary limitation so long as they last than what is annexed to them by the duties incumbent on him in quality of a guardian to the child in the character of a servant a set of duties corresponding to the parents beneficiary powers and without any other necessary limitation so long as they last than what is annexed to them by the rights which belong to the child in his capacity of ward the condition of a parent will therefore be exposed to all the offences to which either that of a guardian or that of a master are exposed and as each of the parents will partake more or less of both those characters the offences to which the two conditions are exposed may be nominally as they will be substantially the same taking them then all together the offences to which the condition of a parent is exposed will stand as follows   wrongful noninvestment of parentality     wrongful interception of parentality   wrongful divestment of parentality   usurpation of parentality   wrongful investment of parentality   wrongful abdication of parentality   wrongful detrectation of parentality   wrongful imposition of parentality   mismanagement of parental guardianship  0 desertion of parental guardianship    dissipation in prejudice of filial wardship    peculation in prejudice of filial wardship    abuse of parental powers    disturbance of parental guardianship    breach of duty to parents    elopement from parents    childstealing    bribery in prejudice of filial wardship  l next with regard to the offences to which the filial condition   the condition of a son or daughter stands exposed the principles to be pursued in the investigation of offences of this description have already been sufficiently developed it will be sufficient therefore to enumerate them without further discussion the only peculiarities by which offences relative to the condition in question stand distinguished from the offences relative to all the preceding conditions depend upon this one circumstance viz that it is certain every one must have had a father and a mother at the same time that it is not certain that every one must have had a master a servant a guardian or a ward it will be observed all along that where a person from whom if alive the benefit would be taken or on whom the burthen would be imposed be dead so much of the mischief is extinct along with the object of the offence there still however remains so much of the mischief as depends upon the advantage or disadvantage which might accrue to persons related or supposed to be related in the several remoter degrees to him in question the catalogue then of these offences stands as follows   wrongful noninvestment of filiation this if it be the offence of him or her who should have been recognized as the parent coincides with wrongful detrectation of parentality if it be the offence of a third person it involves in it noninvestment of parentality which provided the parentality is in the eyes of him or her who should have been recognised as the parent a desirable thing is wrongful   wrongful interception of filiation this if it be the offence of him or her who should have been recognised as the parent coincides with wrongful detrectation of parentality if it be the offence of a third person it involves in it interception of parentality which provided the parentality is in the eyes of him or her who should have been recognized as parent a desirable thing is wrongful   wrongful divestment of filiation this if it be the offence of him or her who should be recognized as parent coincides with wrongful abdication of parentality if it be the offence of a third person it involves in it divestment of parentality to wit of paternity or of maternity or of both which if the parentality is in the eyes of him or her who should be recognized as parent a desirable thing are respectively wrongful   usurpation of filiation this coincides with wrongful imposition of parentality to wit either of paternity or of maternity or of both and necessarily involves in it divestment of parentality which if the parentality thus divested were in the eyes of him or her who are thus divested of it a desirable thing is wrongful   wrongful investment of filiation the filiation being considered as a beneficial thing this coincides with imposition of parentality which if in the eyes of the pretended father or mother the parentality should be an undesirable thing will be wrongful   wrongful abdication of filiation this necessarily coincides with wrongful divestment of parentality it also is apt to involve in it wrongful imposition of parentality though not necessarily either to the advantage or to the prejudice of any certain person for if a man supposed at first to be your son appears afterwards not to be yours it is certain indeed that he is the son of some other man but it may not appear who that other man is   wrongful detrectation of filiation this coincides with wrongful noninvestment or wrongful interception of parentality   wrongful imposition of filiation this if it be the offence of the pretended parent coincides necessarily with usurpation of parentality if it be the offence of a third person it necessarily involves imposition of parentality as also divestment of parentality either or both of which according to the circumstance above mentioned may or may not be wrongful   mismanagement of parental guardianship  0 desertion of parental guardianship    dissipation in prejudice of filial wardship    peculation in prejudice of filial wardship    abuse of parental power    disturbance of parental guardianship    breach of duty to parents    elopement from parents    childstealing    bribery in prejudice of parental guardianship  li we shall now be able to apply ourselves with some advantage to the examination of the several offences to which the marital condition or condition of a husband stands exposed a husband is a man between whom and a certain woman who in this case is called his wife there subsists a legal obligation for the purpose of their living together and in particular for the purpose of a sexual intercourse to be carried on between them this obligation will naturally be considered in four points of view   in respect of its commencement   in respect of the placing of it   in respect of the nature of it   in respect of its duration first then it is evident that in point of possibility one method of commencement is as conceivable as another the time of its commencement might have been marked by one sort of event by one sort of signal as it may here be called as well as by another but in practice the signal has usually been as in point of utility it ought constantly to be a contract entered into by the parties that is a set of signs pitched upon by the law as expressive of their mutual consent to take upon them this condition secondly and thirdly with regard to the placing of the obligations which are the result of the contract it is evident that they must rest either solely on one side or mutually on both on the first supposition the condition is not to be distinguished from pure slavery in this case either the wife must be the slave of the husband or the husband of the wife the first of these suppositions has perhaps never been exemplified the opposing influence of physical causes being too universal to have ever been surmounted the latter seems to have been exemplified but too often perhaps among the first romans at any rate in many barbarous nations thirdly with regard to the nature of the obligations if they are not suffered to rest all on one side certain rights are thereby given to the other there must therefore be rights on both sides now where there are mutual rights possessed by two persons as against each other either there are powers annexed to those rights or not but the persons in question are by the supposition to live together in which case we have shown 0 that it is not only expedient but in a manner necessary that on one side there should be powers now it is only on one side that powers can be for suppose them on both sides and they destroy one another the question is then in which of the parties these powers shall be lodged we have shown that on the principle of utility they ought to be lodged in the husband the powers then which subsist being lodged in the husband the next question is shall the interest of one party only or of both be consulted in the exercise of them it is evident that on the principle of utility the interests of both ought alike to be consulted since in two persons taken together more happiness is producible than in one this being the case it is manifest that the legal relation which the husband will bear to the wife will be a complex one compounded of that of master and that of guardian  lii the offences then to which the condition of a husband of will be exposed will be the sum of those to which the two conditions of master and guardian are exposed thus far the condition of a husband with respect to the general outlines of it stands upon the same footing as that of a parent but there are certain reciprocal services which being the main subject of the matrimonial contract constitute the essence of the two matrimonial relations and which neither a master nor guardian as such nor a parent at any rate have usually been permitted to receive these must of course have been distinguished from the indiscriminate train of services at large which the husband in his character of master is empowered to exact and of those which in his character of guardian he is bound to render being thus distinguished the offences relative to the two conditions have in many instances in as far as they have reference to these peculiar services acquired particular denominations in the first place with regard to the contract from the celebration of which the legal condition dates its existence it is obvious that in point of possibility this contract might on the part of either sex subsist with respect to several persons of the other sex at the same time the husband might have any number of wives the wife might have any number of husbands the husband might enter into the contract with a number of wives at the same time or if with only one at a time he might reserve to himself a right of engaging in a similar contract with any number or with only such or such a number of other women afterwards during the continuance of each former contract this latter accordingly is the footing upon which as is well known marriage is and has been established in many extensive countries particularly in all those which profess the mahometan religion in point of possibility it is evident that the like liberty might be reserved on the part of the wife though in point of practice no examples of such an arrangement seem ever to have occurred which of all these arrangements is in point of utility the most expedient is a question which would require too much discussion to answer in the course of an analytical process like the present and which belongs indeed to the civil branch of legislation rather than to the penal   in christian countries the solemnization of any such contract is made to exclude the solemnization of any subsequent one during the continuance of a former and the solemnization of any such subsequent contract is accordingly treated as an offence under the name of polygamy polygamy then is at any rate on the part of the man a particular modification of that offence which may be styled usurpation of the condition of a husband as to its other effects they will be different according as it was the man only or the woman only or both that were in a state of matrimony at the time of the commission of the offence if the man only then his offence involves in it pro tanto that of wrongful divestment of the condition of a wife in prejudice of his prior wife   if the woman only then it involves in it pro tanto that of wrongful divestment of the condition of a husband in prejudice of her prior husband if both were already married it of course involves both the wrongful divestments which have just been mentioned and on the other hand also the converse of all this may be observed with regard to polygamy on the part of the woman secondly as the engaging not to enter into any subsequent engagement of the like kind during the continuance of the first is one of the conditions on which the law lends its sanction to the first so another is the inserting as one of the articles of this engagement an undertaking not to render to or accept from any other person the services which form the characteristic object of it the rendering or acceptance of any such services is accordingly treated as an offence under the name of adultery under which name is also comprised the offence of the stranger who in the commission of the above offence is the necessary accomplice thirdly disturbing either of the parties to this engagement in the possession of these characteristic services may in like manner be distinguished from the offence of disturbing them in the enjoyment of the miscellaneous advantages derivable from the same condition and on whichever side the blame rests whether that of the party or that of a third person may be termed wrongful withholding of connubial services and thus we have oneandtwenty sorts of offences to which as the law stands at present in christian countries the condition of a husband stands exposed viz   wrongful noninvestment of the condition of a husband   wrongful interception of the condition of a husband   wrongful divestment of the condition of a husband   usurpation of the condition of a husband   polygamy   wrongful investment of the condition of a husband   wrongful abdication of the condition of a husband   wrongful detrectation of the condition of a husband   wrongful imposition of the condition of a husband  0 mismanagement of marital guardianship    desertion of marital guardianship    dissipation in prejudice of matrimonial wardship    peculation in prejudice of matrimonial wardship    abuse of marital power    disturbance of marital guardianship    wrongful withholding of connubial services    adultery    breach of duty to husbands    elopement from husbands  0 wifestealing    bribery in prejudice of marital guardianship    liii next with regard to the offences to which the condition of a wife stands exposed from the patterns that have been exhibited already the coincidences and associations that take place between the offences that concern the existence of this condition and those which concern the existence of the condition of a husband may easily enough be apprehended without farther repetitions the catalogue of those now under consideration will be precisely the same in every article as the catalogue last exhibited  liv thus much for the several sorts of offences relative to the several sorts of domestic conditions those which are constituted by such natural relations as are contiguous being included there remain those which are uncontiguous of which after so much as has been said of the others it will naturally be expected that some notice should be taken these however do not afford any of that matter which is necessary to constitute a condition in point of fact no power seems ever to be annexed to any of them a grandfather perhaps may be called by the law to take upon him the guardianship of his orphan grandson but then the power he has belongs to him not as grandfather but as guardian in point of possibility indeed power might be annexed to these relations just as it might to any other but still no new sort of domestic condition would result from it since it has been shown that there can be no others that being constituted by power shall be distinct from those which have been already mentioned such as they are however they have this in common with the beforementioned relations that they are capable of importing either benefit or burthen they therefore stand exposed to the several offences whereby those or any other relations are liable to be affected in point of existence it might be expected therefore that in virtue of these offences they should be added to the list of the relations which are liable to be objects of delinquency but the fact is that they already stand included in it and although not expressly named yet as effectually as if they were on the one hand it is only by affecting such or such a contiguous relation that any offence affecting uncontiguous relations can take place on the other hand neither can any offence affecting the existence of the contiguous relations be committed without affecting the existence of an indefinite multitude of such as are uncontiguous a false witness comes and causes it to be believed that you are the son of a woman who in truth is not your mother what follows an endless tribe of other false persuasions—that you are the grandson of the father and of the mother of this supposed mother that you are the son of some husband of hers or at least of some man with whom she has cohabited the grandson of his father and his mother and so on the brother of their other children if they have any the brotherinlaw of the husbands and wives of those children if married the uncle of the children of those children and so on—on the other hand that you are not the son of your real mother nor of your real father that you are not the grandson of either of your real grandfathers or grandmothers and so on without end all which persuasions result from and are included in the one original false persuasion of your being the son of this your pretended mother  it should seem therefore at first sight that none of the offences against these uncontiguous relations could ever come expressly into question for by the same rule that one ought so it might seem ought a thousand others the offences against the uncontiguous being merged as it were in those which affect the contiguous relations so far however is this from being the case that in speaking of an offence of this stamp it is not uncommon to hear a great deal said of this or that uncontiguous relationship which it affects at the same time that no notice at all shall be taken of any of those which are contiguous how happens this because to the uncontiguous relation are annexed perhaps certain remarkable advantages or disadvantages while to all the intermediate relations none shall be annexed which are in comparison worth noticing suppose antony or lepidus to have contested the relationship of octavius afterwards augustus to caius julius cæsar how could it have been done it could only have been by contesting either octaviuss being the son of atia or atias being the daughter of julia or julias being the daughter of lucius julius cæsar or lucius julius cæsars being the father of caius but to have been the son of atia or the grandson of julia or the great grandson of lucius julius cæsar was in comparison of small importance those intervening relationships were comparatively speaking of no other use to him than in virtue of their being so many necessary links in the genealogical chain which connected him with the sovereign of the empire  as to the advantages and disadvantages which may happen to be annexed to any of those uncontiguous relationships we have seen already that no powers over the correlative person nor any corresponding obligations are of the number of what nature then can they be they are in truth no other than what are the result either of local and accidental institutions or of some spontaneous bias that has been taken by the moral sanction it would therefore be to little purpose to attempt tracing them out a priori by any exhaustive process all that can be done is to pick up and lay together some of the principal articles in each catalogue by way of specimen the advantages which a given relationship is apt to impart seem to be referable chiefly to the following heads   chance of succession to the property or a part of the property of the correlative person   chance of pecuniary support to be yielded by the correlative person either by appointment of law or by spontaneous donation   accession of legal rank including any legal privileges which may happen to be annexed to it such as capacity of holding such and such beneficial offices exemption from such and such burthensome obligations for instance paying taxes serving burthensome offices c c   accession of rank by courtesy including the sort of reputation which is customarily and spontaneously annexed to distinguished birth and family alliance whereon may depend the chance of advancement in the way of marriage or in a thousand other ways less obvious the disadvantages which a given relation is liable to impart seem to be referable chiefly to the following heads   chance of being obliged either by law or by force of the moral sanction to yield pecuniary support to the correlative party   loss of legal rank including the legal disabilities as well as the burthensome obligations which the law is apt to annex sometimes with injustice enough to the lower stations   loss of rank by courtesy including the loss of the advantages annexed by custom to such rank   incapacity of contracting matrimony with the correlative person where the supposed consanguinity or affinity lies within the prohibited degrees    lv we come now to civil conditions these it may well be imagined may be infinitely various as various as the acts which a man may be either commanded or allowed whether for his own benefit or that of others to abstain from or to perform as many different denominations as there are of persons distinguished with a view to such commands and allowances those denominations only excepted which relate to the conditions above spoken of under the name of domestic ones so many civil conditions one might enumerate means however more or less explicit may be found out of circumscribing their infinitude  what the materials are if so they may be called of which conditions or any other kind of legal possession can be made up we have already seen beneficial powers fiduciary powers beneficial rights fiduciary rights relative duties absolute duties but as many conditions as import a power or right of the fiduciary kind as possessed by the person whose condition is in question belong to the head of trusts the catalogue of the offences to which these conditions are exposed coincides therefore exactly with the catalogue of offences against trust under which head they have been considered in a general point of view under the head of offences against trust and such of them as are of a domestic nature in a more particular manner in the character of offences against the several domestic conditions conditions constituted by such duties of the relative kind as have for their counterparts trusts constituted by fiduciary powers as well as rights on the side of the correlative party and those of a private nature have also been already discussed under the appellation of domestic conditions the same observation may be applied to the conditions constituted by such powers of the beneficial kind over persons as are of a private nature as also to the subordinate correlative conditions constituted by the duties corresponding to those rights and powers as to absolute duties there is no instance of a condition thus created of which the institution is upon the principle of utility to be justified unless the several religious conditions of the monastic kind should be allowed of as examples there remain as the only materials out of which the conditions which yet remain to be considered can be composed conditions constituted by beneficial powers over things conditions constituted by beneficial rights to things that is rights to powers over things or by rights to those rights and so on conditions constituted by rights to services and conditions constituted by the duties corresponding to those respective rights out of these are to be taken those of which the materials are the ingredients of the several modifications of property the several conditions of proprietorship these are the conditions if such for a moment they may be styled which having but here and there any specific names are not commonly considered on the footing of conditions so that the acts which if such conditions were recognised might be considered as offences against those conditions are not wont to be considered in any other light than that of offences against property  now the case is as hath been already intimated   that of these civil conditions those which are wont to be considered under that name are not distinguished by any uniform and explicit line from those of which the materials are wont to be carried to the head of property a set of rights shall in one instance be considered as constituting an article of property rather than a condition while in another instance a set of rights of the same stamp is considered as constituting rather a condition than an article of property this will probably be found to be the case in all languages and the usage is different again in one language from what it is in another from these causes it seems to be impracticable to subject the class of civil conditions to any exhaustive method so that for making a complete collection of them there seems to be no other expedient than that of searching the language through for them and taking them as they come to exemplify this observation it may be of use to lay open the structure as it were of two or three of the principal sorts or classes of conditions comparing them with two or three articles of property which appear to be nearly of the same complexion by this means the nature and generation if one may so call it of both these classes of ideal objects may be the more clearly understood  the several sorts of civil conditions that are not fiduciary may all or at least the greater part of them be comprehended under the head of rank or that of profession the latter word being taken in its most extensive sense so as to include not only what are called the liberal professions but those also which are exercised by the several sorts of traders artists manufacturers and other persons of whatsoever station who are in the way of making a profit by their labour among ranks then as well as professions let us for the sake of perspicuity take for examples such articles as stand the clearest from any mixture of either fiduciary or beneficial power the rank of knighthood is constituted how by prohibiting all other persons from performing certain acts the performance of which is the symbol of the order at the same time that the knight in question and his companions are permitted for instance to wear a ribbon of a certain colour in a certain manner to call himself by a certain title to use an armorial seal with a certain mark on it by laying all persons but the knight under this prohibition the law subjects them to a set of duties and since from the discharge of these duties a benefit results to the person in whose favour they are created to wit the benefit of enjoying such a share of extraordinary reputation and respect as men are wont to yield to a person thus distinguished to discharge them is to render him a service and the duty being a duty of the negative class a duty consisting in the performance of certain acts of the negative kind   the service is what may be called a service of forbearance it appears then that to generate this condition there must be two sorts of services that which is the immediate cause of it a service of the negative kind to be rendered by the community at large that which is the cause again of this service a service of the positive kind to be rendered by the law  the condition of a professional man stands upon a narrower footing to constitute this condition there needs nothing more than a permission given him on the part of the legislator to perform those acts in the performance of which consists the exercise of his profession to give or sell his advice or assistance in matters of law or physic to give or sell his services as employed in the executing or overseeing of a manufacture or piece of work of such or such a kind to sell a commodity of such or such a sort here then we see there is but one sort of service requisite a service which may be merely of the negative kind to be rendered by the law the service of permitting him to exercise his profession a service which if there has been no prohibition laid on before is rendered by simply forbearing to prohibit him  now the ideal objects which in the cases above specified are said to be conferred upon a man by the services that are respectively in question are in both cases not articles of property but conditions by such a behaviour on the part of the law as shall be the reverse of that whereby they were respectively produced a man may be made to forfeit them and what he is then said to forfeit is in neither case his property but in one case his rank or dignity in the other case his trade or his profession and in both cases his condition  other cases there are again in which the law by a process of the same sort with that by which it constituted the former of the two abovementioned conditions confers on him an ideal object which the laws of language have placed under the head of property the law permits a man to sell books that is all sorts of books in general thus far all that it has done is to invest him with a condition and this condition he would equally possess although everybody else in the world were to sell books likewise let the law now take an active part in his favour and prohibit all other persons from selling books of a certain description he remaining at liberty to sell them as before it therefore confers on him a sort of exclusive privilege or monopoly which is called a copyright but by investing him with this right it is not said to invest him with any new sort of condition what it invests him with is spoken of as an article of property to wit of that sort of property which is termed incorporeal   and so on in the case of an engraving a mechanical engine a medicine or in short of a saleable article of any other sort yet when it gave him an exclusive right of wearing a particular sort of ribbon the object which it was then considered as conferring on him was not an article of property but a condition  by forbearing to subject you to certain disadvantages to which it subjects an alien the law confers on you the condition of a naturalborn subject by subjecting him to them it imposes on him the condition of an alien by conferring on you certain privileges or rights which it denies to a roturier the law confers on you the condition of a gentilhomme by forbearing to confer on him those privileges it imposes on him the condition of a roturier   the rights out of which the two advantageous conditions here exemplified are both of them as it were composed have for their counterpart a sort of services of forbearance rendered as we have seen not by private individuals but by the law itself as to the duties which it creates in rendering you these services they are to be considered as duties imposed by the legislator on the ministers of justice  it may be observed with regard to the greater part of the conditions here comprised under the general appellation of civil that the relations corresponding to those by which they are respectively constituted are not provided with appellatives the relation which has a name is that which is borne by the party favoured to the party bound that which is borne by the party bound to the party favoured has not any this is a circumstance that may help to distinguish them from those conditions which we have termed domestic in the domestic conditions if on the one side the party to whom the power is given is called a master on the other side the party over whom that power is given the party who is the object of that power is termed a servant in the civil conditions this is not the case on the one side a man in virtue of certain services of forbearance which the rest of the community are bound to render him is denominated a knight of such or such an order but on the other side these services do not bestow any particular denomination on the persons from whom such services are due another man in virtue of the legislators rendering that sort of negative service which consists in the not prohibiting him from exercising a trade invests him at his option with the condition of a trader it accordingly denominates him a farmer a baker a weaver and so on but the ministers of the law do not in virtue of their rendering the man this sort of negative service acquire for themselves any particular name suppose even that the trade you have the right of exercising happens to be the object of a monopoly and that the legislator besides rendering you himself those services which you derive from the permission he bestows on you obliges other persons to render you those farther services which you receive from their forbearing to follow the same trade yet neither do they in virtue of their being thus bound acquire any particular name  after what has been said of the nature of the several sorts of civil conditions that have names the offences to which they are exposed may without much difficulty be imagined taken by itself every condition which is thus constituted by a permission granted to the possessor is of course of a beneficial nature it is therefore exposed to all those offences to which the possession of a benefit is exposed but either on account of a mans being obliged to persevere when once engaged in it or on account of such other obligations as may stand annexed to the possession of it or on account of the comparative degree of disrepute which may stand annexed to it by the moral sanction it may by accident be a burthen it is on this account liable to stand exposed to the offences to which as hath been seen every thing that partakes of the nature of a burthen stands exposed as to any offences which may concern the exercise of the functions belonging to it if it happens to have any duties annexed to it such as those for instance which are constituted by regulations touching the exercise of a trade it will stand exposed to so many breaches of duty and lastly whatsoever are the functions belonging to it it will stand exposed at any rate to disturbance  in the forming however of the catalogue of these offences exactness is of the less consequence inasmuch as an act if it should happen not to be comprised in this catalogue and yet is in any respect of a pernicious nature will be sure to be found in some other division of the system of offences if a baker sells bad bread for the price of good it is a kind of fraud upon the buyer and perhaps an injury of the simple corporal kind done to the health of an individual or a neighbourhood if a clothier sells bad cloth for good at home it is a fraud if to foreigners abroad it may over and above the fraud put upon the foreign purchaser have pernicious effects perhaps in the prosperity of the trade at home and become thereby an offence against the national wealth so again with regard to disturbance if a man be disturbed in the exercise of his trade the offence will probably be a wrongful interception of the profit he might be presumed to have been in a way to make by it and were it even to appear in any case that a man exercised a trade or what is less unlikely a liberal profession without having profit in his view the offence will still be reducible to the head of simple injurious restrainment or simple injurious compulsion  sect   advantages of the present method lvi a few words for the purpose of giving a general view of the method of division here pursued and of the advantages which it possesses may have their use the whole system of offences we may observe is branched out into five classes in the three first the subordinate divisions are taken from the same source viz from the consideration of the different points in respect whereof the interest of an individual is exposed to suffer by this uniformity a considerable degree of light seems to be thrown upon the whole system particularly upon the offences that come under the third class objects which have never hitherto been brought into any sort of order with regard to the fourth class in settling the precedence between its several subordinate divisions it seemed most natural and satisfactory to place those first the connection whereof with the welfare of individuals seemed most obvious and immediate the mischievous effects of those offences which tend in an immediate way to deprive individuals of the protection provided for them against the attacks of one another and of those which tend to bring down upon them the attacks of foreign assailants seem alike obvious and palpable the mischievous quality of such as tend to weaken the force that is provided to combat those attacks but particularly the latter though evident enough is one link farther off in the chain of causes and effects the ill effects of such offences as are of disservice only by diminishing the particular fund from whence that force is to be extracted such effects i say though indisputable are still more distant and out of sight the same thing may be observed with regard to such as are mischievous only by affecting the universal fund offences against the sovereignty in general would not be mischievous if offences of the several descriptions preceding were not mischievous nor in a temporal view are offences against religion mischievous except in as far as by removing or weakening or misapplying one of the three great incentives to virtue and checks to vice they tend to open the door to the several mischiefs which it is the nature of all those other offences to produce as to the fifth class this as hath already been observed exhibits at first view an irregularity which however seems to be unavoidable but this irregularity is presently corrected when the analysis returns back as it does after a step or two into the path from which the tyranny of language had forced it a while to deviate  it was necessary that it should have two purposes in view the one to exhibit upon a scale more or less minute a systematical enumeration of the several possible modifications of delinquency denominated or undenominated the other to find places in the list for such names of offences as were in current use for the first purpose nature was to set the law for the other custom had the nature of the things themselves been the only guide every such difference in the manner of perpetration and such only should have served as a ground for a different denomination as was attended with a difference in point of effect this however of itself would never have been sufficient for as on one hand the new language which it would have been necessary to invent would have been uncouth and in a manner unintelligible so on the other hand the names which were before in current use and which in spite of all systems good or bad must have remained in current use would have continued unexplained to have adhered exclusively to the current language would have been as bad on the other side for in that case the catalogue of offences when compared to that of the mischiefs that are capable of being produced would have been altogether broken and uncomplete  to reconcile these two objects in as far as they seemed to be reconcilable the following course has therefore been pursued the logical whole constituted by the sum total of possible offences has been bisected in as many different directions as were necessary and the process in each direction carried down to that stage at which the particular ideas thus divided found names in current use in readiness to receive them at that period i have stopped leaving any minuter distinctions to be enumerated in the body of the work as so many species of the genus characterised by such or such a name if in the course of any such process i came to a mode of conduct which though it required to be taken notice of and perhaps had actually been taken notice of under all laws in the character of an offence had hitherto been expressed under different laws by different circumlocutions without ever having received any name capable of occupying the place of a substantive in a sentence i have frequently ventured so far as to fabricate a new name for it such an one as the idiom of the language and the acquaintance i happened to have with it would admit of these names consisting in most instances and that unavoidably of two or three words brought together in a language too which admits not like the german and the greek of their being melted into one can never be upon a par in point of commodiousness with those univocal appellatives which make part of the established stock  in the choice of names in current use care has been taken to avoid all such as have been grounded on local distinctions ill founded perhaps in the nation in which they received their birth and at any rate not applicable to the circumstances of other countries  the analysis as far as it goes is as applicable to the legal concerns of one country as of another and where if it had descended into further details it would have ceased to be so there i have taken care always to stop and thence it is that it has come to be so much more particular in the class of offences against individuals than in any of the other classes one use then of this arrangement if it should be found to have been properly conducted will be its serving to point out in what it is that the legal interests of all countries agree and in what it is that they are liable to differ how far a rule that is proper for one will serve and how far it will not serve for another that the legal interests of different ages and countries have nothing in common and that they have every thing are suppositions equally distant from the truth    lvii a natural method such as it hath been here attempted to exhibit seems to possess four capital advantages not to mention others of inferior note in the first place it affords such assistance to the apprehension and to the memory as those faculties would in vain look for in any technical arrangement 00 that arrangement of the objects of any science may it should seem be termed a natural one which takes such properties to characterise them by as men in general are by the common constitution of mans nature independently of any accidental impressions they may have received from the influence of any local or other particular causes accustomed to attend to such in a word as naturally that is readily and at first sight engage and firmly fix the attention of any one to whom they have once been pointed out now by what other means should an object engage or fix a mans attention unless by interesting him and what circumstance belonging to any action can be more interesting or rather what other circumstance belonging to it can be at all interesting to him than that of the influence it promises to have on his own happiness and the happiness of those who are about him by what other mark then should he more easily find the place which any offence occupies in the system or by what other clue should he more readily recall it  lviii in the next place it not only gives at first glance a general intimation of the nature of each division of offences in as far as that nature is determined by some one characteristic property but it gives room for a number of general propositions to be formed concerning the particular offences that come under that division in such manner as to exhibit a variety of other properties that may belong to them in common it gives room therefore for the framing of a number of propositions concerning them which though very general because predicated of a great number of articles shall be as generally true 0   lix in the third place it is so contrived that the very place which any offence is made to occupy suggests the reason of its being put there it serves to indicate not only that such and such acts are made offences but why they ought to be by this means while it addresses itself to the understanding it recommends itself in some measure to the affections by the intimation it gives of the nature and tendency of each obnoxious act it accounts for and in some measure vindicates the treatment which it may be thought proper to bestow upon that act in the way of punishment to the subject then it is a kind of perpetual apology showing the necessity of every defalcation which for the security and prosperity of each individual it is requisite to make from the liberty of every other to the legislator it is a kind of perpetual lesson serving at once as a corrective to his prejudices and as a check upon his passions is there a mischief which has escaped him in a natural arrangement if at the same time an exhaustive one he cannot fail to find it is he tempted ever to force innocence within the pale of guilt the difficulty of finding a place for it advertises him of his error such are the uses of a map of universal delinquency laid down upon the principle of utility such the advantages which the legislator as well as the subject may derive from it abide by it and every thing that is arbitrary in legislation vanishes an evilintentioned or prejudiced legislator durst not look it in the face he would proscribe it and with reason it would be a satire on his laws  lx in the fourth place a natural arrangement governed as it is by a principle which is recognised by all men will serve alike for the jurisprudence of all nations in a system of proposed law framed in pursuance of such a method the language will serve as a glossary by which all systems of positive law might be explained while the matter serves as a standard by which they might be tried thus illustrated the practice of every nation might be a lesson to every other and mankind might carry on a mutual interchange of experiences and improvements as easily in this as in every other walk of science if any one of these objects should in any degree be attained the labour of this analysis severe as it has been will not have been thrown away  sect   characters of the five classes lxi it has been mentioned 0  as an advantage possessed by this method and not possessed by any other that the objects comprised under it are cast into groups to which a variety of propositions may be applied in common a collection of these propositions as applied to the several classes may be considered as exhibiting the distinctive characters of each class so many of these propositions as can be applied to the offences belonging to any given class so many properties are they found to have in common so many of these common properties as may respectively be attributed to them so many properties may be set down to serve as characters of the class a collection of these characters it may here be proper to exhibit the more of them we can bring together the more clearly and fully will the nature of the several classes and of the offences they are composed of be understood  lxii characters of class   composed of private offences or offences against assignable individuals    when arrived at their last stage the stage of consummation 0  they produce all of them a primary mischief as well as a secondary 0    the individuals whom they affect in the first instance 0  are constantly assignable this extends to all to attempts and preparations as well as to such as have arrived at the stage of consummation 0    consequently they admit of compensation 0  in which they differ from the offences of all the other classes as such   they admit 0  also of retaliation 0  in which also they differ from the offences of all the other classes   there is always some person who has a natural and peculiar interest to prosecute them in this they differ from selfregarding offences also from semipublic and public ones except in as far as the two latter may chance to involve a private mischief   the mischief they produce is obvious more so than that of semipublic offences and still more so than that of selfregarding ones or even public   they are every where and must ever be obnoxious to the censure of the world more so than semipublic offences as such and still more so than public ones   they are more constantly obnoxious to the censure of the world than selfregarding offences and would be so universally were it not for the influence of the two false principles the principle of asceticism and the principle of antipathy  0   they are less apt than semipublic and public offences to require different descriptions    in different states and countries in which respect they are much upon a par with selfregarding ones  0 by certain circumstances of aggravation they are liable to be transformed into semipublic offences and by certain others into public    there can be no ground for punishing them until they can be proved to have occasioned or to be about to occasion some particular mischief to some particular individual in this they differ from semipublic offences and from public    in slight cases compensation given to the individual affected by them may be a sufficient ground for remitting punishment for if the primary mischief has not been sufficient to produce any alarm the whole of the mischief may be cured by compensation in this also they differ from semipublic offences and from public ones lxiii characters of class   composed of semipublic offences or offences affecting a whole subordinate class of persons    as such they produce no primary mischief the mischief they produce consists of one or other or both branches of the secondary mischief produced by offences against individuals without the primary   in as far as they are to be considered as belonging to this class the persons whom they affect in the first instance are not individually assignable   they are apt however to involve or terminate in some primary mischief of the first order which when they do they advance into the first class and become private offences   they admit not as such of compensation   nor of retaliation   as such there is never any one particular individual whose exclusive interest it is to prosecute them a circle of persons may however always be marked out within which may be found some who have a greater interest to prosecute than any who are out of that circle have   the mischief they produce is in general pretty obvious not so much so indeed as that of private offences but more so upon the whole than that of selfregarding and public ones   they are rather less obnoxious to the censure of the world than private offences but they are more so than public ones they would also be more so than selfregarding ones were it not for the influence of the two false principles the principle of sympathy and antipathy and that of asceticism   they are more apt than private and selfregarding offences to require different descriptions in different countries but less so than public ones  0 there may be ground for punishing them before they have been proved to have occasioned or to be about to occasion mischief to any particular individual which is not the case with private offences    in no cases can satisfaction given to any particular individual affected by them be a sufficient ground for remitting punishment for by such satisfaction it is but a part of the mischief of them that is cured in this they differ from private offences but agree with public lxiv characters of class   consisting of selfregarding offences offences against ones self    in individual instances it will often be questionable whether they are productive of any primary    mischief at all secondary they produce none   they affect not any other individuals assignable or not assignable except in as far as they affect the offender himself unless by possibility in particular cases and in a very slight and distant manner the whole state   they admit not therefore of compensation   nor of retaliation   no person has naturally any peculiar interest to prosecute them except in as far as in virtue of some connection he may have with the offender either in point of sympathy or of interest    a mischief of the derivative kind    may happen to devolve upon him      the mischief they produce is apt to be unobvious and in general more questionable than that of any of the other classes      they are however apt many of them to be more obnoxious to the censure of the world than public offences owing to the influence of the two false principles the principle of asceticism and the principle of antipathy some of them more even than semipublic or even than private offence   they are less apt than offences of any other class to require different descriptions in different states and countries      among the inducements    to punish them antipathy against the offender is apt to have a greater share than sympathy for the public  0 the best plea for punishing them is founded on a faint probability there may be of their being productive of a mischief which if real will place them in the class of public ones chiefly in those divisions of it which are composed of offences against population and offences against the national wealth lxv characters of class   consisting of public offences or offences against the state in general    as such they produce not any primary mischief and the secondary mischief they produce which consists frequently of danger without alarm though great in value is in specie very indeterminate   the individuals whom they affect in the first instance are constantly unassignable except in as far as by accident they happen to involve or terminate in such or such offences against individuals   consequently they admit not of compensation   nor of retaliation   nor is there any person who has naturally any particular interest to prosecute them except in as far as they appear to affect the power or in any other manner the private interest of some person in authority   the mischief they produce as such is comparatively unobvious much more so than that of private offences and more so likewise than that of semipublic ones   they are as such much less obnoxious to the censure of the world than private offences less even than semipublic or even than selfregarding offences unless in particular cases through sympathy to certain persons in authority whose private interests they may appear to affect   they are more apt than any of the other classes to admit of different descriptions in different states and countries   they are constituted in many cases by some circumstances of aggravation superadded to a private offence and therefore in these cases involve the mischief and exhibit the other characters belonging to both classes they are however even in such cases properly enough ranked in the  th class inasmuch as the mischief they produce in virtue of the properties which aggregate them to that class eclipses and swallows up that which they produce in virtue of those properties which aggregate them to the  st  0 there may be sufficient ground for punishing them without their being proved to have occasioned or to be about to occasion any particular mischief to any particular individual in this they differ from private offences but agree with semipublic ones here as in semipublic offences the extent of the mischief makes up for the uncertainty of it    in no case can satisfaction given to any particular individual affected by them be a sufficient ground for remitting punishment in this they differ from private offences but agree with semipublic lxvi characters of class   or appendix composed of multiform or anomalous offences and containing offences by falsehood and offences concerning trust    taken collectively in the parcels marked out by their popular appellations they are incapable of being aggregated to any systematical method of distribution grounded upon the mischief of the offence   they may however be thrown into subdivisions which may be aggregated to such a method of distribution   these subdivisions will naturally and readily rank under the divisions of the several preceding classes of this system   each of the two great divisions of this class spreads itself in that manner over all the preceding classes   in some acts of this class the distinguishing circumstance which constitutes the essential character of the offence will in some instances enter necessarily in the character of a criminative circumstance into the constitution of the offence insomuch that without the intervention of this circumstance no offence at all of that denomination can be committed    in other instances the offence may subsist without it and where it interferes it comes in as an accidental independent circumstance capable of constituting a ground of aggravation  0 chapter xvii of the limits of the penal branch of jurisprudence sect   limits between private ethics and the art of legislation i so much for the division of offenses in general now an offense is an act prohibited or what comes to the same thing an act of which the contrary is commanded by the law and what is it that the law can be employed in doing besides prohibiting and commanding it should seem then according to this view of the matter that were we to have settled what may be proper to be done with relation to offences we should thereby have settled every thing that may be proper to be done in the way of law yet that branch which concerns the method of dealing with offences and which is termed sometimes the criminal sometimes the penal branch is universally understood to be but one out of two branches which compose the whole subject of the art of legislation that which is termed the civil being the other    between these two branches then it is evident enough there cannot but be a very intimate connection so intimate is it indeed that the limits between them are by no means easy to mark out the case is the same in some degree between the whole business of legislation civil and penal branches taken together and that of private ethics of these several limits however it will be in a manner necessary to exhibit some idea lest on the one hand we should seem to leave any part of the subject that does belong to as untouched or on the other hand to deviate on any side into a track which does not belong to us  in the course of this enquiry that part of it i mean which concerns the limits between the civil and the penal branch of law it will be necessary to settle a number of points of which the connection with the main question might not at first sight be suspected to ascertain what sort of a thing a law is what the parts are that are to be found in it what it must contain in order to be complete what the connection is between that part of a body of laws which belongs to the subject of procedure and the rest of the law at large—all these it will be seen are so many problems which must be solved before any satisfactory answer can be given to the main question above mentioned  nor is this their only use for it is evident enough that the notion of a complete law must first be fixed before the legislator can in any case know what it is he has to do or when his work is done  ii ethics at large may be defined the art of directing mens actions to the production of the greatest possible quantity of happiness on the part of those whose interest is in view  iii what then are the actions which it can be in a mans power to direct they must be either his own actions or those of other agents ethics in as far as it is the art of directing a mans own actions may be styled the art of selfgovernment or private ethics  iv what other agents then are there which at the same time that they are under the influence of mans direction are susceptible of happiness they are of two sorts   other human beings who are styled persons   other animals which on account of their interests having been neglected by the insensibility of the ancient jurists stand degraded into the class of things    as to other human beings the art of directing their actions to the above end is what we mean or at least the only thing which upon the principle of utility we ought to mean by the art of government which in as far as the measures it displays itself in are of a permanent nature is generally distinguished by the name of legislation as it is by that of administration when they are of a temporary nature determined by the occurrences of the day  v now human creatures considered with respect to the maturity of their faculties are either in an adult or in a nonadult state the art of government in as far as it concerns the direction of the actions of persons in a nonadult state may be termed the art of education in as far as this business is entrusted with those who in virtue of some private relationship are in the main the best disposed to take upon them and the best able to discharge this office it may be termed the art of private education in as far as it is exercised by those whose province it is to superintend the conduct of the whole community it may be termed the art of public education  vi as to ethics in general a mans happiness will depend in the first place upon such parts of his behaviour as none but himself are interested in in the next place upon such parts of it as may affect the happiness of those about him in as far as his happiness depends upon the firstmentioned part of his behaviour it is said to depend upon his duty to himself ethics then in as far as it is the art of directing a mans actions in this respect may be termed the art of discharging ones duty to ones self and the quality which a man manifests by the discharge of this branch of duty if duty it is to be called is that of prudence in as far as his happiness and that of any other person or persons whose interests are considered depends upon such parts of his behaviour as may affect the interests of those about him it may be said to depend upon his duty to others or to use a phrase now somewhat antiquated his duty to his neighbour ethics then in as far as it is the art of directing a mans actions in this respect may be termed the art of discharging ones duty to ones neighbour now the happiness of ones neighbour may be consulted in two ways   in a negative way by forbearing to diminish it   in a positive way by studying to increase it a mans duty to his neighbour is accordingly partly negative and partly positive to discharge the negative branch of it is probity to discharge the positive branch beneficence  vii it may here be asked how it is that upon the principle of private ethics legislation and religion out of the question a mans happiness depends upon such parts of his conduct as affect immediately at least the happiness of no one but himself this is as much as to ask what motives independent of such as legislation and religion may chance to furnish can one man have to consult the happiness of another by what motives or which comes to the same thing by what obligations can he be bound to obey the dictates of probity and beneficence in answer to this it cannot but be admitted that the only interests which a man at all times and upon all occasions is sure to find adequate motives for consulting are his own notwithstanding this there are no occasions in which a man has not some motives for consulting the happiness of other men in the first place he has on all occasions the purely social motive of sympathy or benevolence in the next place he has on most occasions the semisocial motives of love of amity and love of reputation the motive of sympathy will act upon him with more or less effect according to the bias of his sensibility    the two other motives according to a variety of circumstances principally according to the strength of his intellectual powers the firmness and steadiness of his mind the quantum of his moral sensibility and the characters of the people he has to deal with  viii now private ethics has happiness for its end and legislation can have no other private ethics concerns every member that is the happiness and the actions of every member of any community that can be proposed and legislation can concern no more thus far then private ethics and the art of legislation go hand in hand the end they have or ought to have in view is of the same nature the persons whose happiness they ought to have in view as also the persons whose conduct they ought to be occupied in directing are precisely the same the very acts they ought to be conversant about are even in a great measure the same where then lies the difference in that the acts which they ought to be conversant about though in a great measure are not perfectly and throughout the same there is no case in which a private man ought not to direct his own conduct to the production of his own happiness and of that of his fellowcreatures but there are cases in which the legislator ought not in a direct way at least and by means of punishment applied immediately to particular individual acts to attempt to direct the conduct of the several other members of the community every act which promises to be beneficial upon the whole to the community himself included each individual ought to perform of himself but it is not every such act that the legislator ought to compel him to perform every act which promises to be pernicious upon the whole to the community himself included each individual ought to abstain from of him but it is not every such act that the legislator ought to compel him to abstain from  ix where then is the line to be drawn—we shall not have far to seek for it the business is to give an idea of the cases in which ethics ought and in which legislation ought not in a direct manner at least to interfere if legislation interferes in a direct manner it must be by punishment    now the cases in which punishment meaning the punishment of the political sanction ought not to be inflicted have been already stated    if then there be any of these cases in which although legislation ought not private ethics does or ought to interfere these cases will serve to point out the limits between the two arts or branches of science these cases it may be remembered are of four sorts   where punishment would be groundless   where it would be inefficacious   where it would be unprofitable   where it would be needless let us look over all these cases and see whether in any of them there is room for the interference of private ethics at the same time that there is none for the direct interference of legislation  x   first then as to the cases where punishment would be groundless in these cases it is evident that the restrictive interference of ethics would be groundless too it is because upon the whole there is no evil in the act that legislation ought not to endeavour to prevent it no more for the same reason ought private ethics  xi   as to the cases in which punishment would be inefficacious these we may observe may be divided into two sets or classes the first do not depend at all upon the nature of the act they turn only upon a defect in the timing of the punishment the punishment in question is no more than what for any thing that appears ought to have been applied to the act in question it ought however to have been applied at a different time viz not till after it had been properly denounced these are the cases of an expostfacto law of a judicial sentence beyond the law and of a law not sufficiently promulgated the acts here in question then might for anything that appears come properly under the department even of coercive legislation of course do they under that of private ethics as to the other set of cases in which punishment would be inefficacious neither do these depend upon the nature of the act that is of the sort of act they turn only upon some extraneous circumstances with which an act of any sort may chance to be accompanied these however are of such a nature as not only to exclude the application of legal punishment but in general to leave little room for the influence of private ethics these are the cases where the will could not be deterred from any act even by the extraordinary force of artificial punishment as in the cases of extreme infancy insanity and perfect intoxication of course therefore it could not by such slender and precarious force as could be applied by private ethics the case is in this respect the same under the circumstances of unintentionality with respect to the event of the action unconsciousness with regard to the circumstances and missupposal with regard to the existence of circumstances which have not existed as also where the force even of extraordinary punishment is rendered inoperative by the superior force of a physical danger or threatened mischief it is evident that in these cases if the thunders of the law prove impotent the whispers of simple morality can have but little influence  xii   as to the cases where punishment would be unprofitable these are the cases which constitute the great field for the exclusive interference of private ethics when a punishment is unprofitable or in other words too expensive it is because the evil of the punishment exceeds that of the offence now the evil of the punishment we may remember    is distinguishable into four branches   the evil of coercion including constraint or restraint according as the act commanded is of the positive kind or the negative   the evil of apprehension   the evil of sufferance   the derivative evils resulting to persons in connection with those by whom the three abovementioned original evils are sustained now with respect to those original evils the persons who lie exposed to them may be two very different sets of persons in the first place persons who may have actually committed or been prompted to commit the acts really meant to be prohibited in the next place persons who may have performed or been prompted to perform such other acts as they fear may be in danger of being involved in the punishment designed only for the former but of these two sets of acts it is the former only that are pernicious it is therefore the former only that it can be the business of private ethics to endeavour to prevent the latter being by the supposition not mischievous to prevent them is what it can no more be the business of ethics to endeavour at than of legislation it remains to show how it may happen that there should be acts really pernicious which although they may very properly come under the censure of private ethics may yet be no fit objects for the legislator to control  xiii punishment then as applied to delinquency may be unprofitable in both or either of two ways   by the expense it would amount to even supposing the application of it to be confined altogether to delinquency   by the danger there may be of its involving the innocent in the fate designed only for the guilty first then with regard to the cases in which the expense of the punishment as applied to the guilty would outweigh the profit to be made by it these cases it is evident depend upon a certain proportion between the evil of the punishment and the evil of the offence now were the offence of such a nature that a punishment which in point of magnitude should but just exceed the profit of it would be sufficient to prevent it it might be rather difficult perhaps to find an instance in which such punishment would clearly appear to be unprofitable but the fact is there are many cases in which a punishment in order to have any chance of being efficacious must in point of magnitude be raised a great deal above that level thus it is wherever the danger of detection is or what comes to the same thing is likely to appear to be so small as to make the punishment appear in a high degree uncertain in this case it is necessary as has been shown    if punishment be at all applied to raise it in point of magnitude as much as it falls short in point of certainty it is evident however that all this can be but guesswork and that the effect of such a proportion will be rendered precarious by a variety of circumstances by the want of sufficient promulgation on the part of the law    by the particular circumstances of the temptation    and by the circumstances influencing the sensibility of the several individuals who are exposed to it  0 let the seducing motives be strong the offence then will at any rate be frequently committed now and then indeed owing to a coincidence of circumstances more or less extraordinary it will be detected and by that means punished but for the purpose of example which is the principal one an act of punishment considered in itself is of no use what use it can be of depends altogether upon the expectation it raises of similar punishment in future cases of similar delinquency but this future punishment it is evident must always depend upon detection if then the want of detection is such as must in general especially to eyes fascinated by the force of the seducing motives appear too improbable to be reckoned upon the punishment though it should be inflicted may come to be of no use here then will be two opposite evils running on at the same time yet neither of them reducing the quantum of the other the evil of the disease and the evil of the painful and inefficacious remedy it seems to be partly owing to some such considerations that fornication for example or the illicit commerce between the sexes has commonly either gone altogether unpunished or been punished in a degree inferior to that in which on other accounts legislators might have been disposed to punish it  xiv secondly with regard to the cases in which political punishment as applied to delinquency may be unprofitable in virtue of the danger there may be of its involving the innocent in the fate designed only for the guilty whence should this danger then arise from the difficulty there may be of fixing the idea of the guilty action that is of subjecting it to such a definition as shall be clear and precise enough to guard effectively against misapplication this difficulty may arise from either of two sources the one permanent to wit the nature of the actions themselves the other occasional i mean the qualities of the men who may have to deal with those actions in the way of government in as far as it arises from the latter of these sources it may depend partly upon the use which the legislator may be able to make of language partly upon the use which according to the apprehension of the legislators the judge may be disposed to make of it as far as legislation is concerned it will depend upon the degree of perfection to which the arts of language may have been carried in the first place in the nation in general in the next place by the legislator in particular it is to a sense of this difficulty as it should seem that we may attribute the caution with which most legislators have abstained from subjecting to censure on the part of the law such actions as come under the notion of rudeness for example or treachery or ingratitude the attempt to bring acts of so vague and questionable a nature under the control of law will argue either a very immature age in which the difficulties which give birth to that danger are not descried or a very enlightened age in which they are overcome     xv for the sake of obtaining the clearer idea of the limits between the art of legislation and private ethics it may now be time to call to mind the distinctions above established with regard to ethics in general the degree in which private ethics stands in need of the assistance of legislation is different in the three branches of duty above distinguished of the rules of moral duty those which seem to stand least in need of the assistance of legislation are the rules of prudence it can only be through some defect on the part of the understanding if a man be ever deficient in point of duty to himself if he does wrong there is nothing else that it can be owing to but either some inadvertence or some missupposal    with regard to the circumstances on which his happiness depends it is a standing topic of complaint that a man knows too little of himself be it so but is it so certain that the legislator must know more    it is plain that of individuals the legislator can know nothing concerning those points of conduct which depend upon the particular circumstances of each individual it is plain therefore that he can determine nothing to advantage it is only with respect to those broad lines of conduct in which all persons or very large and permanent descriptions of persons may be in a way to engage that he can have any pretense for interfering and even here the propriety of his interference will in most instances lie very open to dispute at any rate he must never expect to produce a perfect compliance by the mere force of the sanction of which he is himself the author all he can hope to do is to increase the efficacy of private ethics by giving strength and direction to the influence of the moral sanction with what chance of success for example would a legislator go about to extirpate drunkenness and fornication by dint of legal punishment not all the tortures which ingenuity could invent would compass it and before he had made any progress worth regarding such a mass of evil would be produced by the punishment as would exceed a thousandfold the utmost possible mischief of the offence the great difficulty would be in the procuring evidence an object which could not be attempted with any probability of success without spreading dismay through every family    tearing the bonds of sympathy asunder    and rooting out the influence of all the social motives all that he can do then against offences of this nature with any prospect of advantage in the way of direct legislation is to subject them in cases of notoriety to a slight censure so as thereby to cover them with a slight shade of artificial disrepute  xvi it may be observed that with regard to this branch of duty legislators have in general been disposed to carry their interference full as far as is expedient the great difficulty here is to persuade them to confine themselves within bounds a thousand little passions and prejudices have led them to narrow the liberty of the subject in this line in cases in which the punishment is either attended with no profit at all or with none that will make up for the expense  xvii the mischief of this sort of interference is more particularly conspicuous in the article of religion the reasoning in this case is of the following stamp there are certain errors in matters of belief to which all mankind are prone and for these errors in judgment it is the determination of a being of infinite benevolence to punish them with an infinity of torments but from these errors the legislator himself is necessarily free for the men who happen to be at hand for him to consult with being men perfectly enlightened unfettered and unbiased have such advantages over all the rest of the world that when they sit down to enquire out the truth relative to points so plain and so familiar as those in question they cannot fail to find it this being the case when the sovereign sees his people ready to plunge headlong into an abyss of fire shall he not stretch out a hand to save them such for example seems to have been the train of reasoning and such the motives which led lewis the xivth into those coercive measures which he took for the conversion of heretics and the confirmation of true believers the groundwork pure sympathy and lovingkindness the superstructure all the miseries which the most determined malevolence could have devised    but of this more fully in another place     xviii the rules of probity are those which in point of expediency stand most in need of assistance on the part of the legislator and in which in point of fact his interference has been most extensive there are few cases in which it would be expedient to punish a man for hurting himself but there are few cases if any in which it would not be expedient to punish a man for injuring his neighbour with regard to that branch of probity which is opposed to offences against property private ethics depends in a manner for its very existence upon legislation legislation must first determine what things are to be regarded as each mans property before the general rules of ethics on this head can have any particular application the case is the same with regard to offences against the state without legislation there would be no such thing as a state no particular persons invested with powers to be exercised for the benefit of the rest it is plain therefore that in this branch the interference of the legislator cannot any where be dispensed with we must first know what are the dictates of legislation before we can know what are the dictates of private ethics     xix as to the rules of beneficence these as far as concerns matters of detail must necessarily be abandoned in great measure to the jurisdiction of private ethics in many cases the beneficial quality of the act depends essentially upon the disposition of the agent that is upon the motive by which he appears to have been prompted to perform it upon their belonging to the head of sympathy love of amity or love of reputation and not to any head of selfregarding motives brought into play by the force of political constraint in a word upon their being such as denominate his conduct free and voluntary according to one of the many senses given to those ambiguous expressions    the limits of the law on this head seem however to be capable of being extended a good deal farther than they seem ever to have been extended hitherto in particular in cases where the person is in danger why should it not be made the duty of every man to save another from mischief when it can be done without prejudicing himself as well as to abstain from bringing it on him this accordingly is the idea pursued in the body of the work  0  xx to conclude this section let us recapitulate and bring to a point the difference between private ethics considered as an art or science on the one hand and that branch of jurisprudence which contains the art or science of legislation on the other private ethics teaches how each man may dispose himself to pursue the course most conducive to his own happiness by means of such motives as offer of themselves the art of legislation which may be considered as one branch of the science of jurisprudence teaches how a multitude of men composing a community may be disposed to pursue that course which upon the whole is the most conducive to the happiness of the whole community by means of motives to be applied by the legislator  we come now to exhibit the limits between penal and civil jurisprudence for this purpose it may be of use to give a distinct though summary view of the principal branches into which jurisprudence considered in its utmost extent is wont to be divided  sect   jurisprudence its branches xxi jurisprudence is a fictitious entity nor can any meaning be found for the word but by placing it in company with some word that shall be significative of a real entity to know what is meant by jurisprudence we must know for example what is meant by a book of jurisprudence a book of jurisprudence can have but one or the other of two objects   to ascertain what the law    is   to ascertain what it ought to be in the former case it may be styled a book of expositoryjurisprudence in the latter a book of censorialjurisprudence or in other words a book on the art of legislation  xxii a book of expository jurisprudence is either authoritative or unauthoritative it is styled authoritative when it is composed by him who by representing the state of the law to be so and so causeth it so to be that is of the legislator himself unauthoritative when it is the work of any other person at large  xxiii now law or the law taken indefinitely is an abstract and collective term which when it means any thing can mean neither more nor less than the sum total of a number of individual laws taken together    it follows that of whatever other modifications the subject of a book of jurisprudence is susceptible they must all of them be taken from some circumstance or other of which such individual laws or the assemblages into which they may be sorted are susceptible the circumstances that have given rise to the principal branches of jurisprudence we are wont to hear of seem to be as follows   the extent of the laws in question in point of dominion   the political quality of the persons whose conduct they undertake to regulate   the time of their being in force   the manner in which they are expressed   the concern which they have with the article of punishment  xxiv in the first place in point of extent what is delivered concerning the laws in question may have reference either to the laws of such or such a nation or nations in particular or to the laws of all nations whatsoever in the first case the book may be said to relate to local in the other to universal jurisprudence  now of the infinite variety of nations there are upon the earth there are no two which agree exactly in their laws certainly not in the whole perhaps not even in any single article and let them agree today they would disagree tomorrow this is evident enough with regard to the substance of the laws and it would be still more extraordinary if they agreed in point of form that is if they were conceived in precisely the same strings of words what is more as the languages of nations are commonly different as well as their laws it is seldom that strictly speaking they have so much as a single word in common however among the words that are appropriated to the subject of law there are some that in all languages are pretty exactly correspondent to one another which comes to the same thing nearly as if they were the same of this stamp for example are those which correspond to the words power right obligation liberty and many others  it follows that if there are any books which can properly speaking be styled books of universal jurisprudence they must be looked for within very narrow limits among such as are expository there can be none that are authoritative nor even as far as the substance of the laws is concerned any that are unauthoritative to be susceptible of an universal application all that a book of the expository kind can have to treat of is the import of words to be strictly speaking universal it must confine itself to terminology accordingly the definitions which there has been occasion here and there to intersperse in the course of the present work and particularly the definition hereafter given of the word law may be considered as matter belonging to the head of universal jurisprudence thus far in strictness of speech though in point of usage where a man in laying down what he apprehends to be the law extends his views to a few of the nations with which his own is most connected it is common enough to consider what he writes as relating to universal jurisprudence  it is in the censorial line that there is the greatest room for disquisitions that apply to the circumstances of all nations alike and in this line what regards the substance of the laws in question is as susceptible of an universal application as what regards the words that the laws of all nations or even of any two nations should coincide in all points would be as ineligible as it is impossible some leading points however there seem to be in respect of which the laws of all civilized nations might without inconvenience be the same to mark out some of these points will as far as it goes be the business of the body of this work  xxv in the second place with regard to the political quality of the persons whose conduct is the object of the law these may on any given occasion be considered either as members of the same state or as members of different states in the first ease the law may be referred to the head of internal in the second case to that of international    jurisprudence  now as to any transactions which may take place between individuals who are subjects of different states these are regulated by the internal laws and decided upon by the internal tribunals of the one or the other of those states the case is the same where the sovereign of the one has any immediate transactions with a private member of the other the sovereign reducing himself pro re natâ to the condition of a private person as often as he submits his cause to either tribunal whether by claiming a benefit or defending himself against a burthen there remain then the mutual transactions between sovereigns as such for the subject of that branch of jurisprudence which may be properly and exclusively termed international     with what degree of propriety rules for the conduct of persons of this description can come under the appellation of laws is a question that must rest till the nature of the thing called a law shall have been more particularly unfolded  it is evident enough that international jurisprudence may as well as internal be censorial as well as expository unauthoritative as well as authoritative  xxvi internal jurisprudence again may either concern all the members of a state indiscriminately or such of them only as are connected in the way of residence or otherwise with a particular district jurisprudence is accordingly sometimes distinguished into national and provincial but as the epithet provincial is hardly applicable to districts so small as many of those which have laws of their own are wont to be such as towns parishes and manors the term local where universal jurisprudence is plainly out of the question or the term particular though this latter is not very characteristic might either of them be more commodious     xxvii thirdly with respect to time in a work of the expository kind the laws that are in question may either be such as are still in force at the time when the book is writing or such as have ceased to be in force in the latter case the subject of it might be termed ancient in the former present or living jurisprudence that is if the substantive jurisprudence and no other must at any rate be employed and that with an epithet in both cases but the truth is that a book of the former kind is rather a book of history than a book of jurisprudence and if the word jurisprudence be expressive of the subject it is only with some such words as history or antiquities prefixed and as the laws which are any where in question are supposed if nothing appears to the contrary to be those which are in force no such epithet as that of present or living commonly appears  where a book is so circumstanced that the laws which form the subject of it though in force at the time of its being written are in force no longer that book is neither a book of living jurisprudence nor a book on the history of jurisprudence it is no longer the former and it never was the latter it is evident that owing to the changes which from time to time must take place in a greater or less degree in every body of laws every book of jurisprudence which is of an expository nature must in the course of a few years come to partake more or less of this condition  the most common and most useful object of a history of jurisprudence is to exhibit the circumstances that have attended the establishment of laws actually in force but the exposition of the dead laws which have been superseded is inseparably interwoven with that of the living ones which have superseded them the great use of both these branches of science is to furnish examples for the art of legislation     xxviii fourthly in point of expression the laws in question may subsist either in the form of statute or in that of customary law  as to the difference between these two branches which respects only the article of form or expression it cannot properly be made appear till some progress has been made in the definition of a law  xxix lastly the most intricate distinction of all and that which comes most frequently on the carpet is that which is made between the civil branch of jurisprudence and the penal which latter is wont in certain circumstances to receive the name of criminal  what is a penal code of laws what a civil code of what nature are their contents is it that there are two sorts of laws the one penal the other civil so that the laws in a penal code are all penal laws while the laws in a civil code are all civil laws or is it that in every law there is some matter which is of a penal nature and which therefore belongs to the penal code and at the same time other matter which is of a civil nature and which therefore belongs to the civil code or is it that some laws belong to one code or the other exclusively while others are divided between the two to answer these questions in any manner that shall be tolerably satisfactory it will be necessary to ascertain what a law is meaning one entire but single law and what are the parts into which a law as such is capable of being distinguished or in other words to ascertain what the properties are that are to be found in every object which can with propriety receive the appellation of a law this then will be the business of the third and fourth sections what concerns the import of the word criminal as applied to law will be discussed separately in the fifth  here ends the original work in the state into which it was brought in   november    0 what follows is now added in january       the third fourth and fifth sections intended as expressed in the text to have been added to this chapter will not here nor now be given because to give them in a manner tolerably complete and satisfactory might require a considerable volume this volume will form a work of itself closing the series of works mentioned in the preface  what follows here may serve to give a slight intimation of the nature of the task which such a work will have to achieve it will at the same time furnish not any thing like a satisfactory answer to the questions mentioned in the text but a slight and general indication of the course to be taken for giving them such an answer  what is a law what the parts of a law the subject of these questions it is to be observed is the logical the ideal the intellectual whole not the physical one the law and not the statute an enquiry directed to the latter sort of object could neither admit of difficulty nor afford instruction in this sense whatever is given for law by the person or persons recognized as possessing the power of making laws is law the metamorphoses of ovid if thus given would be law so much as was embraced by one and the same act of authentication so much as received the touch of the sceptre at one stroke is one law a whole law and nothing more a statute of george ii made to substitute an or instead of an and in a former statute is a complete law a statute containing an entire body of laws perfect in all its parts would not be more so by the word law then as often as it occurs in the succeeding pages is meant that ideal object of which the part the whole or the multiple or an assemblage of parts wholes and multiples mixed together is exhibited by a statute not the statute which exhibits them  every law when complete is either of a coercive or an uncoercive nature  a coercive law is a command  an uncoercive or rather a discoercive law is the revocation in whole or in part of a coercive law  what has been termed a declaratory law sofar as it stands distinguished from either a coercive or a discoercive law is not properly speaking a law it is not the expression of an act of the will exercised at the time it is a mere notification of the existence of a law either of the coercive or the discoercive kind as already subsisting of the existence of some document expressive of some act of the will exercised not at the time but at some former period if it does any thing more than give information of this fact viz of the prior existence of a law of either the coercive or the discoercive kind it ceases pro tanto to be what is meant by a declaratory law and assuming either the coercive or the discoercive quality  every coercive law creates an offence that is converts an act of some sort or other into an offence it is only by so doing that it can impose obligation that it can produce coercion  a law confining itself to the creation of an offence and a law commanding a punishment to be administered in case of the commission of such an offence are two distinct laws not parts as they seem to have been generally accounted hitherto of one and the same law the acts they command are altogether different the persons they are addressed to are altogether different instance let no man steal and let the judge cause whoever is convicted of stealing to be hanged  they might be styled the former a simply imperative law the other a punitory but the punitory if it commands the punishment to be inflicted and does not merely permit it is as truly imperative as the other only it is punitory besides which the other is not  a law of the discoercive kind considered in itself can have no punitory law belonging to it to receive the assistance and support of a punitory in law it must flrst receive that of a simply imperative or coercive law and it is to this latter that the punitory law will attach itself and not to the discoercive one example discoercive law the sheriff has power to hang all such as the judge proceeding in due course of law shall order him to hang example of a coercive law made in support of the above discoereive one let no man hinder the sheriff from hanging such as the judge proceeding in due course of law shall order him to hang example of a punitory law made in support of the above coercive one let the judge cause to be imprisoned whosoever attempts to hinder the sheriff from hanging one whom the judge proceeding in due course of law has ordered him to hang  but though a simply imperative law and the punitory law attached to it are so far distinct laws that the former contains nothing of the latter and the latter in its direct tenor contains nothing of the former yet by implication and that a necessary one the punitory does involve and include the import of the simply imperative law to which it is appended to say to the judge cause to be hanged whoever in due form of law is convicted of stealing is though not a direct yet as intelligible a way of intimating to men in general that they must not steal as to say to them directly do not steal and one sees how much more likely to be efficacious  it should seem then that wherever a simply imperative law is to have a punitory one appended to it the former might be spared altogether in which case saving the exception which naturally should seem not likely to be a frequent one of a law capable of answering its purpose without such an appendage there should be no occasion in the whole body of the law for any other than punitory or in other words than penal laws and this perhaps would be the case were it not for the necessity of a large quantity of matter of the expository kind of which we come now to speak  it will happen in the instance of many probably of most possibly of all commands endued with the force of a public law that in the expression given to such a command it shall be necessary to have recourse to terms too complex in their signification to exhibit the requisite ideas without the assistance of a greater or less quantity of matter of an expository nature such terms like the symbols used in algebraical notation are rather substitutes and indexes to the terms capable of themselves of exhibiting the ideas in question than the real and immediate representatives of those ideas  take for instance the law thou shalt not steal such a command were it to rest there could never sufficiently answer the purpose of a law a word of so vague and unexplicit a meaning cannot otherwise perform this office than by giving a general intimation of a variety of propositions each requiring to convey it to the apprehension a more particular and ample assemblage of terms stealing for example according to a definition not accurate enough for use but sufficiently so for the present purpose is the taking of a thing which is anothers by one who has no title so to do and is conscious of his having none even after this exposition supposing it a correct one can the law be regarded as completely expressed certainly not for what is meant by a mans having a title to take a thing to be complete the law must have exhibited amongst a multitude of other things two catalogues the one of events to which it has given the quality of conferring title in such a case the other of the events to which it has given the quality of taking it away what follows that for a man to have stolen for a man to have had no title to what he took either no one of the articles contained in the first of those lists must have happened in his favour or if there has some one of the number of those contained in the second must have happened to his prejudice  such then is the nature of a general law that while the imperative part of it the punctum saliens as it may be termed of this artificial body shall not take up above two or three words its expository appendage without which that imperative part could not rightly perform its office may occupy a considerable volume  but this may equally be the case with a private order given in a family take for instance one from a bookseller to his foreman remove from this shop to my new one my whole stock according to this printed catalogue—remove from this shop to my new one my whole stock is the imperative matter of this order the catalogue referred to contains the expository appendage  the same mass of expository matter may serve in common for may appertain in common to many commands many masses of imperative matter thus amongst other things the catalogue of collative and ablative events with respect to titles above spoken of see no ix of this note will belong in common to all or most of the laws constitutive of the various offences against property thus in mathematical diagrams one and the same base shall serve for a whole cluster of triangles  such expository matter being of a complexion so different from the imperative it would be no wonder if the connection of the former with the latter should escape the observation which indeed is perhaps pretty generally the case and so long as any mass of legislative matter presents itself which is not itself imperative or the contrary or of which the connection with matter of one of those two descriptions is not apprehended so long and so far the truth of the proposition that every law is a command or its opposite may remain unsuspected or appear questionable so long also may the incompleteness of the greater part of those masses of legislative matter which wear the complexion of complete laws upon the face of them also the method to be taken for rendering them really complete remain undiscovered  a circumstance that will naturally contribute to increase the difficulty of the discovery is the great variety of ways in which the operation of a law may be conveyed—the great variety of forms which the imperative part of a law may indiscriminately assume some more directly some less directly expressive of the imperative quality thou shalt not steal let no man steal whoso stealeth shall be punished so and so if any man steal he shall be punished so and so stealing is where a man does so and so the punishment for stealing is so and so to judges so and so named and so and so constituted belong the cognizance of such and such offences viz stealing—and so on these are but part of a multitude of forms of words in any of which the command by which stealing is prohibited might equally be couched and it is manifest to what a degree in some of them the imperative quality is clouded and concealed from ordinary apprehension  after this explanation a general proposition or two that may be laid down may help to afford some little insight into the structure and contents of a complete body of laws—so many different sorts of offences created so many different laws of the coercive kind so many exceptions taken out of the descriptions of those offences so many laws of the discoercive kind  to class offences as hath been attempted to be done in the preceding chapter is therefore to class laws to exhibit a complete catalogue of all the offences created by law including the whole mass of expository matter necessary for fixing and exhibiting the import of the terms contained in the several laws by which those offences are respectively created would be to exhibit a complete collection of the laws in force in a word a complete body of law a pannomion if so it might be termed  from the obscurity in which the limits of a law and the distinction betwixt a law of the civil or simply imperative kind and a punitory law are naturally involved results the obscurity of the limits betwixt a civil and a penal code betwixt a civil branch of the law and the penal  the question what parts of the total mass of legislative matter belong to the civil branch and what to the penal supposes that divers political states or at least that some one such state are to be found having as well a civil code as a penal code each of them complete in its kind and marked out by certain limits but no one such state has ever yet existed  to put a question to which a true answer can be given we must substitute to the foregoing question some such a one as that which follows  suppose two masses of legislative matter to be drawn up at this time of day the one under the name of a civil code the other of a penal code each meant to be complete in its kind—in what general way is it natural to suppose that the different sorts of matter as above distinguished would be distributed between them  to this question the following answer seems likely to come as near as any other to the truth  the civil code would not consist of a collection of civil laws each complete in itself as well as clear of all penal ones  neither would the penal code since we have seen that it could not consist of a collection of punitive laws each not only complete in itself but clear of all civil ones but  the civil code would consist chiefly of mere masses of expository matter the imperative matter to which those masses of expository matter respectively appertained would be found—not in that same code—not in the civil code—nor in a pure state free from all admixture of punitory laws but in the penal code—in a state of combination—involved in manner as above explained in so many correspondent punitory laws  the penal code then would consist principally of punitive laws involving the imperative matter of the whole number of civil laws along with which would probably also be found various masses of expository matter appertaining not to the civil but to the punitory laws the body of penal law enacted by the empressqueen maria theresa agrees pretty well with this account  the mass of legislative matter published in french as well as german under the auspices of frederic ii of prussia by the name of code frederic but never established with force of law    appears for example to be almost wholly composed of masses of expository matter the relation of which to any imperative matter appears to have been but very imperfectly apprehended  in that enormous mass of confusion and inconsistency the ancient roman or as it is termed by way of eminence the civil law the imperative matter and even all traces of the imperative character seem at last to have been smothered in the expository esto had been the language of primæval simplicity esto had been the language of the twelve tables by the time of justinian so thick was the darkness raised by clouds of commentators the penal law had been crammed into an odd corner of the civil—the whole catalogue of offences and even of crimes lay buried under a heap of obligations—will was hid in opinion—and the original esto had transformed itself into videtur in the mouths even of the most despotic sovereigns  among the barbarous nations that grew up out of the ruins of the roman empire law emerging from under the mountain of expository rubbish reassumed for a while the language of command and then she had simplicity at least if nothing else to recommend her  besides the civil and the penal every complete body of law must contain a third branch the constitutional  the constitutional branch is chiefly employed in conferring on particular classes of persons powers to be exercised for the good of the whole society or of considerable parts of it and prescribing duties to the persons invested with those powers  the powers are principally constituted in the first instance by discoercive or permissive laws operating as exceptions to certain laws of the coercive or imperative kind instance a taxgatherer as such may on such and such an occasion take such and such things without any other title  the duties are created by imperative laws addressed to the persons on whom the powers are conferred instance on such and such an occasion such and such a taxgatherer shall take such and such things such and such a judge shall in such and such a case cause persons so and so offending to be hanged  the parts which perform the function of indicating who the individuals are who in every case shall be considered as belonging to those classes have neither a permissive complexion nor an imperative  they are so many masses of expository matter appertaining in common to all laws into the texture of which the names of those classes of persons have occasion to be inserted instance imperative matter—let the judge cause whoever in due course of law is convicted of stealing to be hanged nature of the expository matter—who is the person meant by the word judge he who has been invested with that office in such a manner and in respect of whom no event has happened of the number of those to which the effect is given of reducing him to the condition of one divested of that office  thus it is that one and the same law one and the same command will have its matter divided not only between two great codes or main branches of the whole body of the laws the civil and the penal but amongst three such branches the civil the penal and the constitutional  in countries where a great part of the law exists in no other shape than that of which in england is called common law but might be more expressively termed judiciary there must be a great multitude of laws the import of which cannot be sufficiently made out for practice without referring to this common law for more or less of the expository matter belonging to them thus in england the exposition of the word title that basis of the of whole fabric of the laws of property is nowhere else to be found and as uncertainty is of the very essence of every particle of law so denominated for the instant it is clothed in a certain authoritative form of words it changes its nature and passes over to the other denomination hence it is that a great part of the laws in being in such countries remain uncertain and incomplete what are those countries to this hour every one on the surface of the globe  had the science of architecture no fixed nomenclature belonging to it—were there no settled names for distinguishing the different sorts of buildings nor the different parts of the same building from each other—what would it be it would be what the science of legislation considered with respect to its form remains at present  were there no architects who could distinguish a dwellinghouse from a barn or a sidewall from a ceiling what would architects be they would be what all legislators are at present  from this very slight and imperfect sketch may be collected not an answer to the questions in the text but an intimation and that but an imperfect one of the course to be taken for giving such an answer and at any rate some idea of the difficulty as well as of the necessity of the task  if it were thought necessary to recur to experience for proofs of this difficulty and this necessity they need not be long wanting  take for instance so many wellmeant endeavours on the part of popular bodies and so many wellmeant recommendations in ingenious books to restrain supreme representative assemblies from making laws in such and such cases or to such and such an effect such laws to answer the intended purpose require a perfect mastery in the science of law considered in respect of its form—in the sort of anatomy spoken of in the preface to this work but a perfect or even a moderate insight into that science would prevent their being couched in those loose and inadequate terms in which they may be observed so frequently to be conceived as a perfect acquaintance with the dictates of utility on that head would in many if not in most of those instances discounsel the attempt keep to the letter and in attempting to prevent the making of bad laws you will find them prohibiting the making of the most necessary laws perhaps even of all laws quit the letter and they express no more than if each man were to say your laws shall become ipso facto void as often as they contain any thing which is not to my mind  of such unhappy attempts examples may be met with in the legislation of many nations but in none more frequently than in that newlycreated nation one of the most enlightened if not the most enlightened at this day on the globe  take for instance the declaration of rights enacted by the state of north carolina in convention in or about the month of september      and said to be copied with a small exception from one in like manner enacted by the state of virginia     the following to go no farther is the first and fundamental article  that there are certain natural rights of which men when they form a social compact cannot deprive or divest their posterity among which are the enjoyment of life and liberty with the means of acquiring possessing and protecting property and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety  not to dwell on the oversight of confining to posterity the benefit of the rights thus declared what follows that—as against those whom the protection thus meant to be afforded includes—every law or other order divesting a man of the enjoyment of life or liberty is void  therefore this is the case amongst others with every coercive law  therefore as against the persons thus protected every order for example to pay money on the score of taxation or of debt from individual to individual or otherwise is void for the effect of it if complied with is to deprive and divest him pro tanto of the enjoyment of liberty viz the liberty of paying or not paying as he thinks proper not to mention the species opposed to imprisonment in the event of such a mode of coercions being resorted to likewise of property which is itself a means of acquiring possessing and protecting property and of pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety  therefore also as against such persons every order to attack an armed enemy in time of war is also void for the necessary effect of such an order is to deprive some of them of the enjoyment of life  the abovementioned consequences may suffice for examples amongst an endless train of similar ones     leaning on his elbow in an attitude of profound and solemn meditation what a multitude of things there are exclaimed the dancingmaster marcel in a minuet—may we now add—and in a law    for example—it is worse to lose than simply not to gain—a loss falls the lighter by being divided—the suffering of a person hurt in gratification of enmity is greater than the gratification produced lay the same cause—these and a few others which he will have occasion to exhibit at the head of another publication have the same claim to the appellation of axioms as those given by mathematicians under that name since referring to universal experience as their immediate basis they are incapable of demonstration and require only to be developed and illustrated in order to be recognized as incontestable    the first edition was published in      in quarto    a fragment on government c reprinted in         such as obligation right power possession title exemption immunity franchise privilege nullity validity and the like    to the aggregate of them a common denomination has since been allotted—the rationale    note by the author july       to this denomination has of late been added or substituted the greatest happiness or greatest felicity principle this for shortness instead of saying at length that principle which states the greatest happiness of all those whose interest is in question as being the right and proper and only right and proper and universally desirable end of human action of human action in every situation and in particular in that of a functionary or set of functionaries exercising the powers of government the word utility does not so clearly point to the ideas of pleasure and pain as the words happiness and felicity do nor does it lead us to the consideration of the number of the interests affected to the number as being the circumstance which contributes in the largest proportion to the formation of the standard here in question the standard of right and wrong by which alone the propriety of human conduct in every situation can with propriety be tried this want of a sufficiently manifest connexion between the ideas of happiness and pleasure on the one hand and the idea of utility on the other i have every now and then found operating and with but too much efficiency as a bar to the acceptance that might otherwise have been given to this principle    the word principle is derived from the latin principium which seems to be compounded of the two words primus first or chief and cipium a termination which seems to be derived from capio to take as in mancipium municipium to which are analogous auceps forceps and others it is a term of very vague and very extensive signification it is applied to any thing which is conceived to serve as a foundation or beginning to any series of operations in some cases of physical operations but of mental operations in the present case  the principle here in question may be taken for an act of the mind a sentiment a sentiment of approbation a sentiment which when applied to an action approves of its utility as that quality of it by which the measure of approbation or disapprobation bestowed upon it ought to be governed    interest is one of those words which not having any superior genus cannot in the ordinary way be defined    the principle of utility i have heard it said is a dangerous principle it is dangerous on certain occasions to consult it this is as much as to say what that it is not consonant to utility to consult utility in short that it is not consulting it to consult it  addition by the author july       not long after the publication of the fragment on government anno      in which in the character of allcomprehensive and allcommanding principle the principle of utility was brought to view one person by whom observation to the above effect was made was alexander wedderburn at that time attorney or solicitor general afterwards successively chief justice of the common pleas and chancellor of england under the successive titles of lord loughborough and earl of rosslyn it was made—not indeed in my hearing but in the hearing of a person by whom it was almost immediately communicated to me so far from being selfcontradictory it was a shrewd and perfectly true one by that distinguished functionary the state of the government was thoroughly understood by the obscure individual at that time not so much as supposed to be so his disquisitions had not been as yet applied with any thing like a comprehensive view to the field of constitutional law nor therefore to those features of the english government by which the greatest happiness of the ruling one with or without that of a favoured few are now so plainly seen to be the only ends to which the course of it has at any time been directed the principle of utility was an appellative at that time employed by me as it had been by others to designate that which in a more perspicuous and instructive manner may as above be designated by the name of the greatest happiness principle this principle said wedderburn is a dangerous one saying so he said that which to a certain extent is strictly true a principle which lays down as the only right and justifiable end of government the greatest happiness of the greatest number—how can it be denied to be a dangerous one dangerous it unquestionably is to every government which has for its actual end or object the greatest happiness of a certain one with or without the addition of some comparatively small number of others whom it is matter of pleasure or accommodation to him to admit each of them to a share in the concern on the footing of so many junior partners dangerous it therefore really was to the interest—the sinister interest—of all those functionaries himself included whose interest it was to maximize delay vexation and expense in judicial and other modes of procedure for the sake of the profit extractible out of the expense in a government which had for its end in view the greatest happiness of the greatest number alexander wedderburn might have been attorney general and then chancellor but he would not have been attorney general with £  000 a year nor chancellor with a peerage with a veto upon all justice with £  000 a year and with  00 sinecures at his disposal under the name of ecclesiastical benefices besides et cæteras   0 ascetic is a term that has been sometimes applied to monks it comes from a greek word which signifies exercise the practices by which monks sought to distinguish themselves from other men were called their exercises these exercises consisted in so many contrivances they had for tormenting themselves by this they thought to ingratiate themselves with the deity for the deity said they is a being of infinite benevolence now a being of the most ordinary benevolence is pleased to see others make themselves as happy as they can therefore to make ourselves as unhappy as we can is the way to please the deity if any body asked them what motive they could find for doing all this oh said they you are not to imagine that we are punishing ourselves for nothing we know very well what we are about you are to know that for every grain of pain it costs us now we are to have a hundred grains of pleasure by and by the case is that god loves to see us torment ourselves at present indeed he has as good as told us so but this is done only to try us in order just to see how we should behave which it is plain he could not know without making the experiment now then from the satisfaction it gives him to see us make ourselves as unhappy as we can make ourselves in this present life we have a sure proof of the satisfaction it will give him to see us as happy as he can make us in a life to come     the following note was first printed in january       it ought rather to have been styled more extensively the principle of caprice where it applies to the choice of actions to be marked out for injunction or prohibition for reward or punishment to stand in a word as subjects for obligations to be imposed it may indeed with propriety be termed as in the text the principle of sympathy and antipathy but this appellative does not so well apply to it when occupied in the choice of the events which are to serve as sources of title with respect to rights where the actions prohibited and allowed the obligations and rights being already fixed the only question is under what circumstances a man is to be invested with the one or subjected to the other from what incidents occasion is to be taken to invest a man or to refuse to invest him with the one or to subject him to the other in this latter case it may more appositely be characterized by the name of the phantastic principle sympathy and antipathy are affections of the sensible faculty but the choice of titles with respect to rights especially with respect to proprietary rights upon grounds unconnected with utility has been in many instances the work not of the affections but of the imagination  when in justification of an article of english common law calling uncles to succeed in certain cases in preference to fathers lord coke produced a sort of ponderosity he had discovered in rights disqualifying them from ascending in a straight line it was not that he loved uncles particularly or hated fathers but because the analogy such as it was was what his imagination presented him with instead of a reason and because to a judgment unobservant of the standard of utility or unacquainted with the art of consulting it where affection is out of the way imagination is the only guide  when i know not what ingenious grammarian invented the proposition delegatus non potest delegare to serve as a rule of law it was not surely that he had any antipathy to delegates of the second order or that it was any pleasure to him to think of the ruin which for want of a manager at home may befall the affairs of a traveller whom an unforeseen accident has deprived of the object of his choice it was that the incongruity of giving the same law to objects so contrasted as active and passive are was not to be surmounted and that atus chimes as well as it contrasts with are  when that inexorable maxim of which the dominion is no more to be defined than the date of its birth or the name of its father is to be found was imported from england for the government of bengal and the whole fabric of judicature was crushed by the thunders of ex post facto justice it was not surely that the prospect of a blameless magistracy perishing in prison afforded any enjoyment to the unoffended authors of their misery but that the music of the maxim absorbing the whole imagination had drowned the cries of humanity along with the dictates of common sense fiat justitia ruat cœlum says another maxim as full of extravagance as it is of harmony go heaven to wreck—so justice be but done—and what is the ruin of kingdoms in comparison of the wreck of heaven  so again when the prussian chancellor inspired with the wisdom of i know not what roman sage proclaimed in good latin for the edification of german ears servitus servitutis non datur cod fred tom ii par   liv   tit x sect   p  0  it was not that he had conceived any aversion to the lifeholder who during the continuance of his term should wish to gratify a neighbour with a right of way or water or to the neighbour who should wish to accept of the indulgence but that to a jurisprudential ear tus tutis sound little less melodious than atus are whether the melody of the maxim was the real reason of the rule is not left open to dispute for it is ushered in by the conjunction quia reasons appointed harbinger quia servitus servitutis non datur  neither would equal melody have been produced nor indeed could similar melody have

apprehension and the memory as in comparison of their energetic negatives they are insipid to the ear  were the inquiry diligently made it would be found that the goddess of harmony has exercised more influence however latent over the dispensations of themis than her most diligent historiographers or even her most passionate panegyrists seem to have been aware of every one knows how by the ministry of orpheus it was she who first collected the sons of men beneath the shadow of the sceptre yet in the midst of continual experience men seem yet to learn with what successful diligence she has laboured to guide it in its course every one knows that measured numbers were the language of the infancy of law none seem to have observed with what imperious sway they have governed her maturer age in english jurisprudence in particular the connexion betwixt law and music however less perceived than in spartan legislation is not perhaps less real nor less close the music of the office though not of the same kind is not less musical in its kind than the music of the theatre that which hardens the heart than that which softens it—sostenutos as long cadences as sonorous and those governed by rules though not yet promulgated not less determinate search indictments pleadings proceedings in chancery conveyances whatever trespasses you may find against truth or common sense you will find none against the laws of harmony the english liturgy justly as this quality has been extolled in that sacred office possesses not a greater measure of it than is commonly to be found in an english act of parliament dignity simplicity brevity precision intelligibility possibility of being retained or so much as apprehended every thing yields to harmony volumes might be filled shelves loaded with the sacrifices that are made to this insatiate power expletives her ministers in grecian poetry are not less busy though in different shape and bulk in english legislation in the former they are monosyllables in the latter they are whole lines  to return to the principle of sympathy and antipathy a term preferred at first on account of its impartiality to the principle of caprice the choice of an appellative in the above respects too narrow was owing to my not having at that time extended my views over the civil branch of law any otherwise than as i had found it inseparably involved in the penal but when we come to the former branch we shall see the phantastic principle making at least as great a figure there as the principle of sympathy and antipathy in the latter  in the days of lord coke the light of utility can scarcely be said to have as yet shone upon the face of common law if a faint ray of it under the name of the argumentum ab inconvenienti is to be found in a list of about twenty topics exhibited by that great lawyer as the coordinate leaders of that allperfect system the admission so circumstanced is as sure a proof of neglect as to the statues of brutus and cassius exclusion was a cause of notice it stands neither in the front nor in the rear nor in any post of honour but huddled in towards the middle without the smallest mark of preference coke littleton ii a nor is this latin inconvenience by any means the same thing with the english one it stands distinguished from mischief and because by the vulgar it is taken for something less bad it is given by the learned as something worse the law prefers a mischief to an inconvenience says an admired maxim and the more admired because as nothing is expressed by it the more is supposed to be understood  not that there is any avowed much less a constant opposition between the prescriptions of utility and the operations of the common law such constancy we have seen to be too much even for ascetic fervor from time to time instinct would unavoidably betray them into the paths of reason instinct which however it may be cramped can never be killed by education the cobwebs spun out of the materials brought together by the competition of opposite analogies can never have ceased being warped by the silent attraction of the rational principle though it should have been as the needle is by the magnet without the privity of conscience   additional note by the author july       add and that the bad system of mahometan and other native law was to be put down at all events to make way for the inapplicable and still more mischievous system of english judgemade law and by the hand of his accomplice hastings was to be put into the pocket of impey—importer of this instrument of subversion £ 000 ayear contrary to law in addition to the £ 000 ayear lavished upon him with the customary profusion by the hand of law—see the account of the transaction in mills british india  to this governor a statue is erecting by a vote of east india directors and proprietors on it should be inscribed—let it but put money into our pockets no tyranny too flagitious to be worshipped by us  to this statue of the archmalefactor should be added for a companion that of the longrobed accomplice the one lodging the bribe in the hand of the other the hundred millions of plundered and oppressed hindoos and mahometans pay for the one a westminster hall subscription might pay for the other  what they have done for ireland with her seven millions of souls the authorized deniers and perverters of justice have done for hindostan with her hundred millions in this there is nothing wonderful the wonder is—that under such institutions men though in ever such small number should be found whom the view of the injustices which by english judgemade law they are compelled to commit and the miseries they are thus compelled to produce deprive of health and rest witness the letter of an english hindostan

inventions men have hit upon and the variety of phrases they have brought forward in order to conceal from the world and if possible from themselves this very general and therefore very pardonable selfsufficiency     one man says he has a thing made on purpose to tell him what is right and what is wrong and that it is called a moral sense and then he goes to work at his ease and says such a thing is right and such a thing is wrong—why because my moral sense tells me it is     another man comes and alters the phrase leaving out moral and putting in common in the room of it he then tells you that his common sense teaches him what is right and wrong as surely as the others moral sense did meaning by common sense a sense of some kind or other which he says is possessed by all mankind the sense of those whose sense is not the same as the authors being struck out of the account as not worth taking this contrivance does better than the other for a moral sense being a new thing a man may feel about him a good while without being able to find it out but common sense is as old as the creation and there is no man but would be ashamed to be thought not to have as much of it as his neighbours it has another great advantage by appearing to share power it lessens envy for when a man gets up upon this ground in order to anathematize those who differ from him it is not by a sic volo sic jubeo but by a velitis jubeatis     another man comes and says that as to a moral sense indeed he cannot find that he has any such thing that however he has an understanding which will do quite as well this understanding he says is the standard of right and wrong it tells him so and so all good and wise men understand as he does if other mens understandings differ in any point from his so much the worse for them it is a sure sign they are either defective or corrupt     another man says that there is an eternal and immutable rule of right that that rule of right dictates so and so and then he begins giving you his sentiments upon any thing that comes uppermost and these sentiments you are to take for granted are so many branches of the eternal rule of right     another man or perhaps the same man its no matter says that there are certain practices conformable and others repugnant to the fitness of things and then he tells you at his leisure what practices are conformable and what repugnant just as he happens to like a practice or dislike it     a great multitude of people are continually talking of the law of nature and then they go on giving you their sentiments about what is right and what is wrong and these sentiments you are to understand are so many chapters and sections of the law of nature     instead of the phrase law of nature you have sometimes law of reason right reason natural justice natural equity good order any of them will do equally well this latter is most used in politics the three last are much more tolerable than the others because they do not very explicitly claim to be any thing more than phrases they insist but feebly upon the being looked upon as so many positive standards of themselves and seem content to be taken upon occasion for phrases expressive of the conformity of the thing in question to the proper standard whatever that may be on most occasions however it will be better to say utility utility is clearer as referring more explicitly to pain and pleasure     we have one philosopher who says there is no harm in any thing in the world but in telling a lie and that if for example you were to murder your own father this would only be a particular way of saying he was not your father of course when this philosopher sees any thing that he does not like he says it is a particular way of telling a lie it is saying that the act ought to be done or may be done when in truth it ought not to be done     the fairest and openest of them all is that sort of man who speaks out and says i am of the number of the elect now god himself takes care to inform the elect what is right and that with so good effect and let them strive ever so they cannot help not only knowing it but practicing it if therefore a man wants to know what is right and what is wrong he has nothing to do but to come to me     it is upon the principle of antipathy that such and such acts are often reprobated on the score of their being unnatural the practice of exposing children established among the greeks and romans was an unnatural practice unnatural when it means any thing means unfrequent and there it means something although nothing to the present purpose but here it means no such thing for the frequency of such acts is perhaps the great complaint it therefore means nothing nothing i mean which there is in the act itself all it can serve to express is the disposition of the person who is talking of it the disposition he is in to be angry at the thoughts of it does it merit his anger very likely it may but whether it does or no is a question which to be answered rightly can only be answered upon the principle of utility  unnatural is as good a word as moral sense or common sense and would be as good a foundation for a system such an act is unnatural that is repugnant to nature for i do not like to practice it and consequently do not practise it it is therefore repugnant to what ought to be the nature of every body else  the mischief common to all these ways of thinking and arguing which in truth as we have seen are but one and the same method couched in different forms of words is then serving as a cloke and pretense and aliment to despotism if not a despotism in practice a despotism however in disposition which is but too apt when pretense and power offer to show itself in practice the consequence is that with intentions very commonly of the purest kind a man becomes a torment either to himself or his fellowcreatures if he be of the melancholy cast he sits in silent grief bewailing their blindness and depravity if of the irascible he declaims with fury and virulence against all who differ from him blowing up the coals of fanaticism and branding with the charge of corruption and insincerity every man who does not think or profess to think as he does  if such a man happens to possess the advantages of style his book may do a considerable deal of mischief before the nothingness of it is understood  these principles if such they can be called it is more frequent to see applied to morals than to politics but their influence extends itself to both in politics as well as morals a man will be at least equally glad of a pretense for deciding any question in the manner that best pleases him without the trouble of inquiry if a man is an infallible judge of what is right and wrong in the actions of private individuals why not in the measures to be observed by public men in the direction of those actions accordingly not to mention other chimeras i have more than once known the pretended law of nature set up in legislative debates in opposition to arguments derived from the principle of utility  but is it never then from any other considerations than those of utility that we derive our notions of right and wrong i do not know i do not care whether a moral sentiment can be originally conceived from any other source than a view of utility is one question whether upon examination and reflection it can in point of fact be actually persisted in and justified on any other ground by a person reflecting within himself is another whether in point of right it can properly be justified on any other ground by a person addressing himself to the community is a third the two first are questions of speculation it matters not comparatively speaking how they are decided the last is a question of practice the decision of it is of as much importance as that of any can be  i feel in myself say you a disposition to approve of such or such an action in a moral view but this is not owing to any notions i have of its being a useful one to the community i do not pretend to know whether it be an useful one or not it may be for aught i know a mischievous one but is it then say i a mischievous one examine and if you can make yourself sensible that it is so then if duty means any thing that is moral duty is your duty at least to abstain from it and more than that if it is what lies in your power and can be done without too great a sacrifice to endeavour to prevent it it is not your cherishing the notion of it in your bosom and giving it the name of virtue that will excuse you  i feel in myself say you again a disposition to detest such or such an action in a moral view but this is not owing to any notions i have of its being a mischievous one to the community i do not pretend to know whether it be a mischievous one or not it may be not a mischievous one it may be for aught i know an useful one—may it indeed say i an useful one but let me tell you then that unless duty and right and wrong be just what you please to make them if it really be not a mischievous one and any body has a mind to do it it is no duty of yours but on the contrary it would be very wrong in you to take upon you to prevent him detest it within yourself as much as you please that may be a very good reason unless it be also a useful one for your not doing it yourself but if you go about by word or deed to do any thing to hinder him or make him suffer for it it is you and not he that have done wrong it is not your setting yourself to blame his conduct or branding it with the name of vice that will make him culpable or you blameless therefore if you can make yourself content that he shall be of one mind and you of another about that matter and so continue it is well but if nothing will serve you but that you and he must needs be of the same mind ill tell you what you have to do it is for you to get the better of your antipathy not for him to truckle to it     king james the first of england had conceived a violent antipathy against arians two of whom he burnt this gratification he procured himself without much difficulty the notions of the times were favourable to it he wrote a furious book against vorstius for being what was called an arminian for vorstius was at a distance he also wrote a furious book called a counterblast to tobacco against the use of that drug which sir walter raleigh had then lately introduced had the notions of the times cooperated with him he would have burnt the anabaptist and the smoker of tobacco in the same fire however he had the satisfaction of putting raleigh to death afterwards though for another crime  disputes concerning the comparative excellence of french and italian music have occasioned very serious bickerings at paris one of the parties would not have been sorry says mr dalembert to have brought government into the quarrel pretences were sought after and urged long before that a dispute of like nature and of at least equal warmth had been kindled at london upon the comparative merits of two composers at london where riots between the approvers and disapprovers of a new play are at this day not unfrequent the ground of quarrel between the bigendians and the littleendians in the fable was not more frivolous than many an one which has laid empires desolate in russia it is said there was a time when some thousands of persons lost their lives in a quarrel in which the government had taken part about the number of fingers to be used in making the sign of the cross this was in days of yore the ministers of catherine ii are better instructed than to take any other part in such disputes than that of preventing the parties concerned from doing one another a mischief   humes hist vol    melanges essai

pleasure of god is and must necessarily be revelation apart neither more nor less than the good pleasure of the person whoever he be who is pronouncing what he believes or pretends to be gods pleasure how know you it to be gods pleasure that such or such an act should be abstained from whence come you even to suppose as much because the engaging in it would i imagine be prejudicial upon the whole

the partizan of the principle of asceticism because i detest the thoughts of it and i cannot neither ought i to be called upon to tell why says he who proceeds upon the principle of antipathy in the words of one or other of these must that person necessarily answer revelation apart who professes to take for his standard the will of god     sanctio in latin was used to signify the act of binding and by a common grammatical transition any thing which serves to bind a man to wit to the observance of such or such a mode of conduct according to a latin grammarian the import of the word is derived by rather a farfetched process such as those commonly are and in a great measure indeed must be by which intellectual ideas are derived from sensible ones from the word sanguis blood because among the romans with a view to inculcate into the people a persuasion that such or such a mode of conduct would be rendered obligatory upon a man by the force of what i call the religious sanction that is that he would be made to suffer by the extraordinary interposition of some superior being if he failed to observe the mode of conduct in question certain ceremonies were contrived by the priests in the course of which ceremonies the blood of victims was made use of  a sanction then is a source of obligatory powers or motives that is of pains and pleasures which according as they are connected with such or such modes of conduct operate and are indeed the only things which can operate as motives see chap x motives   servius see ainsworths dict ad verbum sanctio     better termed popular as more directly indicative of its constituent cause as likewise of its relation to the more common phrase public opinion in french opinion publique the name there given to that tutelary power of which of late so much is said and by which so much is done the latter appellation is however unhappy and inexpressive since if opinion is material it is only in virtue of the influence it exercises over action through the medium of the affections and the will     a suffering conceived to befall a man by the immediate act of god as above is often for shortness sake called a judgment instead of saying a suffering inflicted on him in consequence of a special judgment formed and resolution thereupon taken by the deity     see ch xiii cases unmeet par   note   0 these circumstances have since been denominated elements or dimensions of value in a pleasure or a pain  not long after the publication of the first edition the following memoriter verses were framed in the view of lodging more effectually in the memory these points on which the whole fabric of morals and legislation may be seen to rest  intense long certain speedy fruitful pure— such marks in pleasures and in pains endure such pleasures seek if private be thy end if it be public wide let them extend such pains avoid whichever be thy view if pains must come let them extend to few    the catalogue here given is what seemed to be a complete list of the several simple pleasures and pains of which human nature is susceptible insomuch that if upon any occasion whatsoever a man feels pleasure or pain it is either referable at once to some one or other of these kinds or resolvable into such as are it might perhaps have been a satisfaction to the reader to have seen an analytical view of the subject taken upon an exhaustive plan for the purpose of demonstrating the catalogue to be what it purports to be a complete one the catalogue is in fact the result of such an analysis which however i thought it better to discard at present as being of too metaphysical a cast and not strictly within the limits of this design see ch xiii cases unmeet par   note     there are also pleasures of novelty excited by the appearance of new ideas these are pleasures of the imagination see infra xiii     for instance the pleasure of being able to gratify the sense of hearing by singing or performing upon any musical instrument the pleasure thus obtained is a thing superadded to and perfectly distiguishable from that which a man enjoys from hearing another person perform in the same manner     see ch iii sanctions     see ch iii sanctions     in contradistinction to these all other pleasures may be termed pleasures of enjoyment     the pleasure of the sexual sense seems to have no positive pain to correspond to it it has only a pain of privation or pain of the mental class the pain of unsatisfied desire if any positive pain of body result from the want of such indulgence it belongs to the head of pains of disease     the pleasures of novelty have no positive pains corresponding to them the pain which a man experiences when he is in the condition of not knowing what to do with himself that pain which in french is expressed by a single word ennui is a pain of privation a pain resulting from the absence not only of all the pleasures of novelty but of all kinds of pleasure whatsoever  the pleasures of wealth have also no positive pains corresponding to them the only pains opposed to them are pains of privation if any positive pains result from the want of wealth they are referable to some other class of positive pains principally to those of the senses from the want of food for instance result the pains of hunger from the want of clothing the pains of cold and so forth     it may be a question perhaps whether this be a positive pain of itself or whether it be nothing more than a pain of privation resulting from the consciousness of a want of skill it is however but a question of words nor does it matter which way it be determined   0 in as far as a mans fellowcreatures are supposed to be determined by any event not to regard him with any degree of esteem or good will or to regard him with a less degree of esteem or good will than they would otherwise not to do him any sorts of good offices or not to do him so many good offices as they would otherwise the pain resulting from such consideration may be reckoned a pain of privation as far as they are supposed to regard him with such a degree of aversion or disesteem as to be disposed to do him positive ill offices it may be reckoned a positive pain the pain of privation and the positive pain in this case run one into another indistinguishably     there seem to be no positive pains to correspond to the pleasures of power the pains that a man may feel from the want or the loss of power in as far as power is distinguished from all other sources of pleasure seem to be nothing more than pains of privation     the positive pains of piety and the pains of privation opposed to the pleasures of piety run one into another in the same manner as the positive pains of enmity or of an ill name do with respect to the pains of privation opposed to the pleasures of amity and those of a good name if what is apprehended at the hands of god is barely the not receiving pleasure the pain is of the privative class if moreover actual pain be apprehended it is of the class of positive pains     in contradistinction to these all other pains may be termed pains of sufferance     see chap x motives     by this means the pleasures and pains of amity may be the more clearly distinguished from those of benevolence and on the other hand those of enmity from those of malevolence the pleasures and pains of amity and enmity are of the selfregarding cast those of benevolence and malevolence of the extraregarding     it would be a matter not only of curiosity but of some use to exhibit a catalogue of the several complex pleasures and pains analyzing them at the same time into the several simple ones of which they are respectively composed but such a disquisition would take up too much room to be admitted here a short specimen however for the purpose of illustration can hardly be dispensed with  the pleasures taken in at the eye and ear are generally very complex the pleasures of a country scene for instance consist commonly amongst others of the following pleasures  i pleasures of the senses     the simple pleasures of sight excited by the perception of agreeable colours and figures green fields waving foliage glistening water and the like    the simple pleasures of the ear excited by the perceptions of the chirping of birds the murmuring of waters the rustling of the wind among the trees    the pleasures of the smell excited by the perceptions of the fragrance of flowers of newmown hay or other vegetable substances in the first stages of fermentation    the agreeable inward sensation produced by a brisk circulation of the blood and the ventilation of it in the lungs by a pure air such as that in the country frequently is in comparison of that which is breathed in towns  ii pleasures of the imagination produced by association     the idea of the plenty resulting from the possession of the objects that are in view and of the happiness arising from it    the idea of the innocence and happiness of the birds sheep cattle dogs and other gentle or domestic animals    the idea of the constant flow of health supposed to be enjoyed by all these creatures a notion which is apt to result from the occasional flow of health enjoyed by the supposed spectator    the idea of gratitude excited by the contemplation of the allpowerful and beneficent being who is looked up to as the author of these blessings  these four last are all of them in some measure at least pleasures of sympathy  the depriving a man of this group of pleasures is one of the evils apt to result from imprisonment whether produced by illegal violence or in the way of punishment by appointment of the laws     the exciting cause the pleasure or pain produced by it and the intention produced by such pleasure or pain in the character of a motive are objects so intimately connected that in what follows i fear i have not on every occasion been able to keep them sufficiently distinct i thought it necessary to give the reader this warning after which should there be found any such mistakes it is to be hoped they will not be productive of much confusion     thus in physical bodies the momentum of a ball put in motion by impulse will be influenced by the circumstance of gravity being in some directions increased in others diminished by it so in a ship put in motion by the wind the momentum and direction will be influenced not only by the attraction of gravity but by the motion and resistance of the water and several other circumstances     an analytical view of all these circumstances will be given at the conclusion of the chapter to which place it was necessary to refer it as it could not well have been understood till some of them had been previously explained  to search out the vast variety of exciting or moderating causes by which the degree or bias of a mans sensibility may be influenced to define the boundaries of each to extricate them from the entanglements in which they are involved to lay the effect of each article distinctly before the readers eye is perhaps if not absolutely the most difficult task at least one of the most difficult tasks within the compass of moral physiology disquisitions on this head can never be completely satisfactory without examples to provide a sufficient collection of such examples would be a work of great labour as well as nicety history and biography would need to be ransacked a vast course of reading would need to be travelled through on purpose by such a process the present work would doubtless have been rendered more amusing but in point of bulk so enormous that this single chapter would have been swelled into a considerable volume feigned cases although they may upon occasion serve to render the general matter tolerably intelligible can never be sufficient to render it palatable on this therefore as on so many other occasions i must confine myself to dry and general instruction discarding illustration although sensible that without it instruction cannot manifest half its efficacy the subject however is so difficult and so new that i shall think i have not ill succeeded if without pretending to exhaust it i shall have been able to mark out the principal points of view and to put the matter in such amethod as may facilitate the researches of happier inquirers  the great difficulty lies in the nature of the words which are not like pain and pleasure names of homogeneous real entities but names of various fictitious entities for which no common genus is to be found and which therefore without a vast and roundabout chain of investigation can never be brought under any exhaustive plan of arrangement but must be picked up here and there as they happen to occur   0 it may be thought that in a certain degree of health this negative account of the matter hardly comes up to the case in a certain degree health there is often such a kind of feeling diffused over the whole frame such a comfortable feel or flow of spirits as it is called as may with propriety come under the head of positive pleasure but without experiencing any such pleasurable feeling if a man experience no painful one he may be well enough said to be in health     the most accurate measure that can be given of a mans strength seems to be that which is taken from the weight or number of pounds and ounces he can lift with his hands in a given attitude this indeed relates immediately only to his arms but these are the organs of strength which are most employed of which the strength corresponds with most exactness to the general state of the body with regard to strength and in which the quantum of strength is easiest measured strength may accordingly be distinguished into general and particular  weakness is a negative term and imports the absence of strength it is besides a relative term and accordingly imports the absence of such a quantity of strength as makes the share possessed by the person in question less than that of some person he is compared to weakness when it is at such a degree as to make it painful for a man to perform the motions necessary to the going through the ordinary functions of life such as to get up to walk to dress ones self and so forth brings the circumstance of health into question and puts a man into that sort of condition in which he is said to be in ill health     see b i tit irrep corp injuries     see chap iv value     when for instance having been determined by the prospect of some inconvenience not to disclose a fact although he should be put to the rack he perseveres in such resolution after the rack is brought into his presence and even applied to him     the facility with which children grow tired of their playthings and throw them away is an instance of unsteadiness the perseverance with which a merchant applies himself to his traffic or an author to his book may be taken for an instance of the contrary it is difficult to judge of the quantity of pleasure or pain in these cases but from the effects which it produces in the character of a motive and even then it is difficult to pronounce whether the change of conduct happens by the extinction of the old pleasure or pain or by the intervention of a new one     see chapter v pleasures and pains     see chapter v pleasures and pains     this is one reason why legislators in general like better to have married people to deal with than single and people that have children than such as are childless it is manifest that the stronger and more numerous a mans connexions in the way of sympathy are the stronger is the hold which the law has upon him a wife and children are so many pledges a man gives to the world for his good behaviour     the characteristic circumstances whereby one mans frame of body or mind considered at any given period stands distinguished from that of another have been comprised by metaphysicians and physiologists under the name idiosyncrasy from benthamgreek gif peculiar and benthamgreek gif composition   0 those who maintain that the mind and the body are one substance may here object that upon that supposition the distinction between frame of mind and frame of body is but nominal and that accordingly there is no such thing as a frame of mind distinct from the frame of body but granting for argumentsake the antecedent we may dispute the consequence for if the mind be but a part of the body it is at any rate of a nature very different from the other parts of the body  a mans frame of body cannot in any part of it undergo any considerable alteration without its being immediately indicated by phenomena discernible by the senses a mans frame of mind may undergo very considerable alterations his frame of body remaining the same to all appearance that is for any thing that is indicated to the contrary by phenomena cognizable to the senses meaning those of other men     humes hist     the quantity of the sort of pain which is called grief is indeed hardly to be measured by any external indications it is neither to be measured for instance by the quantity of the tears nor by the number of moments spent in crying indications rather less equivocal may perhaps be afforded by the pulse a man has not the motions of his heart at command as he has those of the muscles of his face but the particular significancy of these indications is still very uncertain all they can express is that the man is affected they cannot express in what manner nor from what cause to an affection resulting in reality from such or such a cause he may give an artificial colouring and attribute it to such or such another cause to an affection directed in reality to such or such a person as its object he may give an artificial bias and represent it as if directed to such or such another object tears of rage he may attribute to contrition the concern he feels at the thoughts of a punishment that awaits him he may impute to a sympathetic concern for the mischief produced by his offense  a very tolerable judgment however may commonly be formed by a discerning mind upon laying all the external indications exhibited by a man together and at the same time comparing them with his actions  a remarkable instance of the power of the will over the external indications of sensibility is to be found in tacituss story of the roman soldier who raised a mutiny in the camp pretending to have lost a brother by the lawless cruelty of the general the truth was he never had had a brother     the ways in which a religion may lessen a mans means or augment his wants are various sometimes it will prevent him from making a profit of his money sometimes from setting his hand to labour sometimes it will oblige him to buy dearer food instead of cheaper sometimes to purchase useless labour sometimes to pay men for not labouring sometimes to purchase trinkets on which imagination alone has set a value sometimes to purchase exemptions from punishment or titles to felicity in the world to come     this is far from being a visionary proposal not reducible to practice i speak from experience having actually drawn up such an estimate though upon the least commodious of the two plans and before the several circumstances in question had been reduced to the precise number and order in which they are here enumerated this is a part of the matter destined for another work see ch xiii cases unmeet par   note there are some of these circumstances that bestow particular denominations on the persons they relate to thus from the circumstance of bodily imperfections persons are denominated deaf dumb blind and so forth from the circumstance of insanity idiots and maniacs from the circumstance of age infants for all which classes of persons particular provision is made in the code see b i tit exemptions persons thus distinguished will form so many articles in the catalogus personarum privilegiatarum see appendix tit composition     as to a mans pecuniary circumstances the causes on which those circumstances depend do not come all of them under the same class the absolute quantum of a mans property does indeed come under the same class with his pecuniary circumstances in general so does the profit he makes from the occupation which furnishes him with the means of livelihood but the occupation itself concerns his own person and comes under the same head as his habitual amusements as likewise his habits of expense his connexions in the ways of profit and of burthen under the same head as his connexions in the way of sympathy and the circumstances of his present demand for money and strength of expectation come under the head of those circumstances relative to his person which regard his affections     or of importance     in certain cases the consequences of an act may be material by serving as evidences indicating the existence of some other material fact which is even antecedent to the act of which they are the consequences but even here they are material only because in virtue of such their evidentiary quality they have an influence at a subsequent period of time in the production of pain and pleasure for example by serving as grounds for conviction and thence for punishment see tit simple falsehoods verbo material     what follows relative to the subject of punishment ought regularly to be preceded by a distinct chapter on the ends of punishment but having little to say on that particular branch of the subject which has not been said before it seemed better in a work which will at any rate be but too voluminous to omit this title reserving it for another hereafter to be published intituled the theory of punishment to the same work i must refer the analysis of the several possible modes of punishment a particular and minute examination of the nature of each and of its advantages and disadvantages and various other disquisitions which did not seem absolutely necessary to be inserted here a very few words however concerning the ends of punishment can scarcely be dispensed with  the immediate principal end of punishment is to control action this action is either that of the offender or of others that of the offender it controls by its influence either on his will in which case it is said to operate in the way of reformation or on his physical power in which case it is said to operate by disablement that of others it can influence otherwise than by its influence over their wills in which case it is said to operate in the way of example a kind of collateral end which it has a natural tendency to answer is that of affording a pleasure or satisfaction to the party injured where there is one and in general to parties whose illwill whether on a selfregarding account or on the account of sympathy or antipathy has been excited by the offense this purpose as far as it can be answered gratis is a beneficial one but no punishment ought to be allotted merely to this purpose because setting aside its effects in the way of control no such pleasure is ever produced by punishment as can be equivalent to the pain the punishment however which is allotted to the other purpose ought as far as it can be done without expense to be accommodated to this satisfaction thus administered to a party injured in the shape of a dissocial pleasure may be styled a vindictive satisfaction or compensation as a compensation administered in the shape of selfregarding profit or stock of pleasure may be styled a lucrative one see b i tit vi compensation example is the most important end of all in proportion as the number of the persons under temptation to offend is to one   this is the work which from the authors papers has since been published by mr dumont in french in company with the theory of reward added to it for the purpose of mutual illustration it is in contemplation to publish them both in english from the authors manuscripts with the benefit of any amendments that have been made by mr dumont note to the edition of        see ch x motives   0 see b

offenders as stand upon a footing of responsibility shown not directly indeed to the persons themselves but to such offenses as none but responsible persons are likely to have the opportunity of engaging in in particular this seems to be the reason why embezzlement in certain cases has not commonly been punished upon the footing of theft nor mercantile frauds upon that of common sharping   see tit simple merc defraudment     see b ii appendix tit iii promulgation     notwithstanding what is here said the cases of infancy and intoxication as we shall see hereafter cannot be looked upon in practice as affording sufficient grounds for absolute impunity but this exception in point of practice is no objection to the propriety of the rule in point of theory the ground of the exception is neither more nor less than the difficulty there is of ascertaining the matter of fact viz whether at the requisite point of time the party was actually in the state in question that is whether a given case comes really under the rule suppose the matter of fact capable of being perfectly ascertained without danger or mistake the impropriety of punishment would be as indubitable in these cases as in any other  the reason that is commonly assigned for the establishing an exemption from punishment in favour of infants insane persons and persons under intoxication is either false in fact or confusedly expressed the phrase is that the will of these persons concurs not with the act that they have no vicious will or that they have not the free use of their will but suppose all this to be true what is it to the purpose nothing except in as far as it implies the reason given in the text   see b i tit iv exemptions and tit vii extenuations     see ch viii intentionality     see ch ix consciousness     the influences of the moral and religious sanctions or in other words of the motives of love of reputation and religion are other causes the force of which may upon particular occasions come to be greater than that of any punishment which the legislator is able or at least which he will think proper to apply these therefore it will be proper for him to have his eye upon but the force of these influences is variable and different in different times and places the force of the foregoing influences is constant and the same at all times and every where these therefore it can never be proper to look upon as safe grounds for establishing absolute impunity owing as in the abovementioned cases of infancy and intoxication to the impracticability of ascertaining the matter of fact     see ch v pleasures and pains   0 see ch xii consequences     by offences i mean at present acts which appear to him to have a tendency to produce mischief     the same rules it is to be observed may be applied with little variation to rewards as well as punishment in short to motives in general which according as they are of the pleasurable or painful kind are of the nature of reward

be understood not merely the pecuniary profit but the pleasure or advantage of whatever kind it be which as a man reaps or expects to reap from the gratification of the desire which prompted him to engage in the offense  it is the profit that is the expectation of the profit of the offence that constitutes the impelling motive or where there are several the sum of the impelling motives by which a man is prompted to engage in the offense it is the punishment that is the expectation of the punishment that constitutes the restraining motive which either by itself or in conjunction with others

though in a very different sense was strictly verified by some of the anglosaxon laws by which a fixed price was set not upon a mans virtue indeed but upon his life that of the sovereign himself among the rest for  00 shillings you might have killed a peasant for six times as much a nobleman for sixandthirty times as much you might have killed the king a king in those days was worth exactly   00 shillings if then the heir to the throne for example grew weary of waiting for it he had a secure and legal way of gratifying his impatience he had but to kill the king with one hand and pay himself with the other and all was right an earl godwin or a duke streon could have bought the lives of a whole dynasty it is plain that if ever a king in those days died in his bed he must have had something else besides this law to thank for it this being the production of a remote and barbarous age the absurdity of it is presently recognised but upon examination it would be found that the freshest laws of the most civilised nations are continually falling into the same error this in short is the ease wheresoever the punishment is fixed while the profit of delinquency is indefinite or to speak more precisely where the punishment is limited to such a mark that the profit of delinquency may reach beyond it   wilkins leg anglosax p       see hume vol   app   p       see in particular the english

    for example if it can ever be worth while to be at the expense of so horrible a punishment as that of burning alive it will be more so in the view of preventing such a crime as that of murder or

this let him conceive the offence to be divided into as many separate offenses as there are distinguishable parcels of mischief that result from it let it consist for example in a mans giving you ten blows or stealing from you ten shillings if then for giving you ten blows he is punished no more than for giving you five the giving you five of these ten blows is an offense for which there is no punishment at all which being understood as often as a man gives you five blows he will be sure to give you five more since he may have the pleasure of giving you these five for nothing in like manner if for stealing from you ten shillings he is punished no more than for stealing five the stealing of the remaining five of those ten shillings is an offense for which there is no punishment at all this rule is violated in almost every page of every body of laws i have ever seen  the profit it is to be observed though frequently is not constantly proportioned to the mischief for example where a

for this reason for example that simple compensation is never looked upon as sufficient punishment for theft or robbery     a punishment may be said to be calculated to answer the purpose of a moral

offense appears to be connected and thereby to inculcate the opposite beneficial habits and dispositions  it is this for example if any thing that must justify the application of so severe a punishment as the infamy of a public exhibition hereinafter proposed for him who lifts up his hand against a woman or against his father see b i tit simp corporal injuries  it is partly on this

  see ch xiii cases unmeet ii note    this chapter is an attempt to put our ideas of offences into an exact method the particular uses of method are various but the general one is to enable men to understand the things that are the subjects of it to understand a thing is to be acquainted with its qualities or properties of these properties some are common to it with other things the rest peculiar but the qualities which are peculiar to any one sort of thing are few indeed in comparison with those which are common to it with other things to make it known in respect of its difference would therefore be doing little unless it were made known also by its genus to understand it perfectly a man must therefore be informed of the points in which it agrees as well as of those in which it disagrees with all other things when a number of objects composing a logical whole are to be considered together all of these possessing with respect to one another a certain congruency or agreement denoted by a certain name there is but one way of giving a perfect knowledge of their nature and that is by distributing them into a system of parcels each of them a part either of some other parcel or at any rate of the common whole this can only be done in the way of bipartition dividing each superior branch into two and but two immediately subordinate ones beginning with the logical whole dividing that into two parts then each of those parts into two others and so on these firstdistinguished parts agree in respect of those properties which belong to the whole they differ in respect of those properties which are peculiar to each to divide the whole into more than two parcels at once for example into three would not answer the purpose for in fact it is but two objects that the mind can compare together exactly at the same time thus then let us endeavour to deal with offences or rather strictly speaking with acts which possess such properties as seem to indicate them fit to be constituted offences the task is arduous and as yet at least perhaps for ever above our force there is no speaking of objects but by their names but the business of giving them names has always been prior to the true and perfect knowledge of their natures objects the most dissimilar have been spoken of and treated as if their properties were the same objects the most similar have been spoken of and treated as if they had scarce anything in common whatever discoveries may be made concerning them how different soever their congruencies and disagreements may be found to be from those which are indicated by their names it is not without the utmost difficulty that any means can be found out of expressing those discoveries by a conformable set of names change the import of the old names and you are in perpetual danger of being misunderstood introduce an entire new set of names and you are sure not to be understood at all complete success then is as yet at least unattainable but an attempt though imperfect may have its use and at the worst it may accelerate the arrival of that perfect system the possession of which will be the happiness of some maturer age gross ignorance descries no difficulties imperfect knowledge finds them out and struggles with them it must be perfect knowledge that overcomes them    see ch xiii cases unmeet sect ii      that is either by name or at least by description in such manner as to be sufficiently distinguished from all others for instance by the circumstance of being the owner or occupier of such and such goods see b i tit personation supra ch xii consequences xv    with regard to offences against a class or neighbourhood it is evident that the fewer the individuals are of which such class is composed and the narrower that neighbourhood is the more likely are the persons to whom the offense is detrimental to become assignable insomuch that in some cases it may be difficult to determine concerning a given offense whether it be an offense against individuals or against a class or neighbourhood it is evident also that the larger the class or neighbourhood is the more it approaches to a coincidence with the great body of the state the three classes therefore are liable to a certain degree to run into one another and be confounded but this is no more than what is the case more or less with all those ideal compartments under which men are wont to distribute objects for the convenience of discourse    see ch vii actions xiii      offences by falsehood   offenses against trust see also par xx to xxx and par lxvi maturer views have suggested the feasibility and the means of ridding the system of this anomalous excrescence instead of considering these as so many divisions of offences divided into genera a correspondent and collateral to the several genera distinguished by other appellations they may be considered as so many specific differences respectively applicable to those genera thus in the case of a simple personal injury in the operation of which a plan of falsehood has been employed it seems more simple and more natural to consider the offense thus committed as a particular species or modification of the genus of offence termed a simple personal injury than to consider the simple personal injury when effected by such means as a modification of the division of offences entitled offences through falsehood by this means the circumstances of the intervention of falsehood as an instrument and of the existence of a particular obligation of the nature of a trust will be reduced to a par with various other classes of circumstances capable of affording grounds of modification commonly of aggravation or extenuation to various genera of offences instance premeditation and conspiracy on the one hand provocation received and intoxication on the other this class will appear but too plainly as a kind of botch in comparison of the rest but such is the fate of science and more particularly of the moral branch the distribution of things must in a great measure be dependent on their names arrangement the work of mature rejection must be ruled by nomenclature the work of popular caprice  in the book of the laws offences must therefore be treated of as much as possible under their accustomed names generical terms which are in continual use and which express ideas for which there are no other terms in use cannot safely be discarded when any such occur which cannot be brought to quadrate with such a plan of classification as appears to be most convenient upon the whole what then is to be done there seems to be but one thing which is to retain them and annex them to the regular part of the system in the form of an appendix though they cannot when entire be made to rank under any of the classes established in the rest of the system the divisions to which they give title may be broken down into lesser divisions which may not be alike intractable by this means how discordant soever with the rest of the system they may appear to be at first sight on a closer inspection they may be found conformable  this must inevitably be the case with the names of offences which are so various and universal in their nature as to be capable each of them of doing whatever mischief can be done by any other kind or kinds of offences whatsoever offences of this description may well be called anomalous  such offences it is plain cannot but show themselves equally intractable under every kind of system upon whatever principle the system be constructed they cannot any of them with any degree of propriety be confined to any one division if therefore they constitute a blemish in the present system it is such a blemish as could not be avoided but at the expense of a greater the class they are here thrown into will traverse in its subordinate ramifications the other classes and divisions of the present system true but so would they of any other an irregularity and that but a superficial one is a less evil than continual error and contradiction but even this slight deviation which the fashion of language seemed to render unavoidable at the outset we shall soon find occasion to correct as we advance for though the first great parcels into which the offences of this class are divided are not referable any of them to any of the former classes yet the subsequent lesser subdivisions are    see ch vii actions iii and xxiii  if by reason of the word relation this part of the division should appear obscure the unknown term may be got rid of in the following manner our ideas are derived all of them from the senses pleasurable and painful ones therefore among the rest consequently from the operation of sensible objects upon our senses a mans happiness then may be said to depend more or less upon the relation he bears to any sensible object when such object is in a way that stands a chance greater or less of producing to him or averting from him pain or pleasure now this if at all it must do in one or other of two ways   in an active way properly so called viz by motion or   in a passive or quiescent way by being moved to or acted upon and in either case either   in an immediate way by acting upon or being acted on by the organs of sense without the intervention of any other external object or   in a more or less remote way by acting upon or being acted on by some other external object which with the intervention of a greater or less number of such objects and at the end of more or less considerable intervals of time will come at length to act upon or be acted upon by those organs and this is equally true whether the external objects in question be things or persons it is also equally true of pains and pleasures of the mind as of those of the body all the difference is that in the production of these the pleasure or pain may result immediately from the perception which it accompanies in the production of those of the mind it cannot result from the action of an object of sense any otherwise than by association to wit by means of some connection which the perception has contracted with certain prior ones lodged already in the memory   see ch v pleasures and pains xv xxxi ch x motives xxxviii note    see ch x motives    subsequent consideration has here suggested several alterations the necessity of adding to property power in the character of a distinguishable as well as valuable object or subjectmatter of possession has presented itself to view and in regard to the fictitious entity here termed condition for shortness instead of saying condition in life it has been observed to be a sort of composite object compounded of property reputation power and right to services for this composite object the more proper place was therefore at the tail of the several simple ones—note by the editor july        0 supra iv note     see ch xii consequences     see ch viii

guarding against such danger     see ch xiii cases unmeet sect iv     in this part of the analysis i have found it necessary to deviate in some degree from the rigid rules of the exhaustive method i set out with by me or by some one else this method may perhaps be more strictly pursued at some maturer period of the science at present the benefit that might result from the unrelaxed observance of it seemed so precarious that i could not help doubting whether it would pay for the delay and trouble doubtless such a method is eminently instructive but the fatigue of following it out is so great not only to the author but probably also to the reader that carried to its utmost length at the first attempt it might perhaps do more disservice in the way of disgust than service in the way of information for knowledge like physic how salutary soever in itself becomes no longer of any use when made too unpalatable to be swallowed mean time it cannot but be a mortifying circumstance to a writer who is sensible of the importance of his subject and anxious to do it justice to find himself obliged to exhibit what he perceives to be faulty with any view how indistinct soever of something more perfect before his eyes if there be any thing new and original in this work it is to the exhaustive method so often aimed at that i am indebted for it it will therefore be no great wonder if i should not be able to quit it without reluctance on the other hand the marks of stiffness which will doubtless be perceived in a multitude of places are chiefly owing to a solicitous and not perfectly successful pursuit of this same method new instruments are seldom handled at first with perfect ease     the idea of government it may be observed is introduced here without any preparation the fact of its being established i assume as notorious and the necessity of it as alike obvious and incontestable observations indicating that necessity if any such should be thought worth looking at in this view may be found by turning to a passage in a former chapter where they were incidentally adduced for the purpose of illustration see ch xii consequences sect xvii     see infra liv note even this head ample as it is and vague as it may seem to be will not when examined by the principle of utility serve any more than another to secrete any offence which has no title to be placed there to show the pain or loss of pleasure which is likely to ensue is a problem which before a legislator can justify himself in adding the act to the catalogue of offences he may in this case as in every other be called upon to solve     for examples see infra liv note this branch of the business of government a sort of work of supererogation as it may be called in the calendar of political duty is comparatively but of recent date it is not for this that the untutored many could have originally submitted themselves to the dominion of the few it was the dread of evil not the hope of good that first cemented societies together necessaries come always before luxuries the state of language marks the progress of ideas time out of mind the military department has had a name so has that of justice the power which occupies itself in preventing mischief not till lately and that but a loose one the police for the power which takes for its object the introduction of positive good no peculiar name however inadequate seems yet to have been devised     the functions of justice and those of the police must be apt in many points to run one into another especially as the business would be very badly managed if the same persons whose more particular duty it is to act as officers of the police were not upon occasion to act in the capacity of officers of justice the ideas however of the two functions may still be kept distinct and i see not where the line of separation can be drawn unless it be as above  as to the word police though of greek extraction it seems to be of french growth it is from france at least that it has been imported into great britain where it still retains its foreign garb in germany if it did not originate there it has at least been naturalized taken all together the idea belonging to it seems to be too multifarious to be susceptible of any single definition want of words obliged me to reduce the two branches here specified into one who would have endured in this place to have seen two such words as the phthanoparanomic or crimepreventing and the phthanosymphoric or calamitypreventing branches of the police the inconveniences of uniting the two branches under the same denomination are however the less inasmuch as the operations requisite to be performed for the two purposes will in many cases be the same other functions commonly referred to the head of police may be referred either to the head of that power which occupies itself in promoting in a positive way the increase of the national felicity or of that which employs itself in the management of the public wealth see infra liv note   0 it is from abroad that those pernicious enterprises are most apt to originate which come backed with a greater quantity of physical force than the persons who are in a more particular sense the officers of justice are wont to have at their command mischief the perpetration of which is ensured by a force of such magnitude may therefore be looked upon in general as the work of external adversaries accordingly when the persons by whom it is perpetrated are in such force as to bid defiance to the ordinary efforts of justice they loosen themselves from their original denomination in proportion as they increase in force till at length they are looked upon as being no longer members of the state but as standing altogether upon a footing with external adversaries give force enough to robbery and it swells into rebellion give permanence enough to rebellion and it settles into hostility     it must be confessed that in common speech the distinction here established between the public wealth and the national wealth is but indifferently settled nor is this to be wondered at the ideas themselves though here necessary to be distinguished being so frequently convertible but i am mistaken if the language will furnish any other two words that would express the distinction better those in question will i imagine be allowed to be thus far well chosen that if they were made to change their places the import given to them would not appear to be quite so proper as that which is given to them as they stand at present     i should have been afraid to have said necessarily in the united provinces in the helvetic or even in the germanic body where is that one assembly in which an absolute power over the whole resides where was there in the roman commonwealth i would not undertake for certain to find an answer to all these questions     see par xvii with regard to justice     it may be observed that upon this occasion i consider religion in no other light than in respect of the influence it may have on the happiness of the present life as to the effects it may have in assuring us of and preparing us for a better life to come this is a matter which comes not within the cognizanoe of the legislator see tit offences against religion  i say offences against religion the fictitious entity not offences against god the real being for what sort of pain should the act of a feeble mortal occasion to a being unsusceptible of pain how should an offence affect him should it be an offence against his person his property his reputation or his condition  it has commonly been the way to put offences against religion foremost the idea of precedence is naturally enough connected with that of reverence benthamgreek agif but for expressing reverence there are other methods enough that are less equivocal and in point of method and perspicuity it is evident that with regard to offences against religion neither the nature of the mischief which it is their tendency to produce nor the reason there may be for punishing them can be understood but from the consideration of the several mischiefs which result from the several other sorts of offences in a political view it is only because those others are mischievous that offences against religion are so too     this division of falsehoods it is to be observed is not regularly drawn out that being what the nature of the case will not here admit of falsehood may be infinitely diversified in other ways than these in a particular case for instance simple falsehood when uttered by writing is distinguished from the same falsehood when uttered by word of mouth and has had a particular name given to it accordingly i mean where it strikes against reputation in which case the instrument it has been uttered by has been called a libel now it is obvious that in the same manner it might have received a distinct name in all other cases where it is uttered by writing but there has not happened to be any thing in particular that has disposed mankind in those cases to give it such a name the case is that among the infinity of circumstances by which it might have been diversified those which constitute it a libel happen to have engaged a peculiar share of attention on the part of the institutors of language either in virtue of the influence which these circumstances have on the tendency of the act or in virtue of any particular degree of force with which on any other account they may have disposed it to strike upon the imagination     see b i tit falsehoods     there are two other circumstances still more material viz   the parties whose interest is affected by the falsehood   the point or article in which that interest is affected these circumstances however enter not into the composition of the generical character their use is as we shall see to characterize the several species of each genus see b i tit falsehoods     ibid     powers though not a species of rights for the two sorts of fictitious entities termed a power and a right are altogether disparate are yet so far included under rights that wherever the word power may be employed the word right may also be employed the reason is that wherever you may speak of a person as having a power you may also speak of him as having a right to such power but the converse of this proposition does not hold good there are cases in which though you may speak of a man as having a right you cannot speak of him as having a power or in any other way make any mention of that word on various occasions you have a right for instance to the services of the magistrate but if you are a private person you have no power over him all the power is on his side this being the case as the word right was employed the word power might perhaps without any deficiency in the sense have been omitted on the present occasion however as in speaking of trusts this word is commonly made more use of than the word right it seemed most eligible for the sake of perspicuity to insert them both  it may be expected that since the word trust has been here expounded the words power and right upon the meaning of which the exposition of the word trust is made to depend should be expounded also and certain it is that no two words can stand more in need of it than these do such exposition i accordingly set about to give and indeed have actually drawn up but the details into which i found it necessary to enter for this purpose were of such length as to take up more room than could consistently be allotted to them in this place with respect to these words therefore and a number of others such as possession title and the like which in point of import are inseparably connected with them instead of exhibiting the exposition itself i must content myself with giving a general idea of the plan which i have pursued in framing it and as to every thing else i must leave the import of them to rest upon whatever footing it may happen to stand upon in the apprehension of each reader power and right and the whole tribe of fictitious entities of this stamp are all of them in the sense which belongs to them in a book of jurisprudence the results of some manifestation or other of the legislators will with respect to such or such an act now every such manifestation is either a prohibition a command or their respective negations viz a permission and the declaration which the legislator makes of his will when on any occasion he leaves an act uncommanded now to render the expression of the rule more concise the commanding of a positive act may be represented by the prohibition of the negative act which is opposed to it to know then how to expound a right carry your eye to the act which in the circumstances in question would be a violation of that right the law creates the right by prohibiting that act power whether over a mans own person or over other persons or over things is constituted in the first instance by permission but in as far as the law takes an active part in corroborating it it is created by prohibition and by command by prohibition of such acts on the part of other persons as are judged incompatible with the exercise of it and upon occasion by command of such acts as are judged to be necessary for the removal of such or such obstacles of the number of those which may occur to impede the exercise of it for every right which the law confers on one party whether that party be an individual a subordinate class of individuals or the public it thereby imposes on some other party a duty or obligation but there may be laws which command or prohibit acts that is impose duties without any other view than the benefit of the agent these generate no rights duties therefore may be either extraregarding or selfregarding extraregarding have rights to correspond to them selfregarding none  that the exposition of the words power and right must in order to be correct enter into a great variety of details may be presently made appear one branch of the system of rights and powers and but one are those of which property is composed to be correct then it must among other things be applicable to the whole tribe of modifications of which property is susceptible but the commands and prohibitions by which the powers and rights that compose those several modifications are created are so many different forms to comprise the exposition in question within the compass of a single paragraph would therefore be impossible to take as many paragraphs for it as would be necessary in order to exhibit these different forms would be to engage in a detail so ample that the analysis of the several possible species of property would compose only a part of it this labour uninviting as it was i have accordingly undergone but the result of it as may well be imagined seemed too voluminous and minute to be exhibited in an outline like the present happily it is not necessary except only for the scientific purpose of arrangement to the understanding of any thing that need be said on the penal branch of the art of legislation in a work which should treat of the civil branch of that art it would find its proper place and in such a work if conducted upon the plan of the present one it would be indispensable of the limits which seem to separate the one of these branches from the other a pretty ample description will be found in the next chapter from which some further lights respecting the course to be taken for developing the notions to be annexed to the words right and power may incidentally be collected see in particular sect   and   see also par lv of the present chapter  i might have cut this matter very short by proceeding in the usual strain and saying that a power was a faculty and that a right was a privilege and so on following the beaten track of definition but the inanity of such a method in cases like the present has been already pointed out a power is not a—any thing neither is a right a—any thing the case is they have neither of them any superior genus these together with duty obligation and a multitude of others of the same stamp being of the number of those fictitious entities of which the import can by no other means be illustrated than by showing the relation which they bear to real ones   see fragment of government ch v sect   note   0 the first of these parties is styled in the law language as well as in common speech by the name here given to him the other is styled in the technical language of the english law a cestuy que trust in common speech as we have observed there is unfortunately no name for him as to the law phrase it is antiquated french and though complex it is still elliptical and to the highest degree obscure the phrase in full length would run in some such manner as this cestuy al use de qui le trust est créé he to whose use the trust or benefit is created in a particular case a cestuy que trust is called by the roman law fideicommissarius in imitation of this i have seen him somewhere or other called in english a fidecommittee this term however seems not very expressive a fidecommittee or as it should have been fideicommittee seems literally speaking to mean one who is committed to the good faith of another good faith seems to consist in the keeping of a promise but a trust may be created without any promise in the case it is indeed common enough to exact a promise in order the more effectually to oblige a man to do that which he is made to promise he will do but this is merely an accidental circumstance a trust may be created without any such thing what is it that constitutes a legal obligation in any case a command express or virtual together with punishment appointed for the breach of it by the same means may an obligation be constituted in this case as well as any other instead of the word beneficiary which i found it necessary to adopt the sense would be better expressed by some such word as beneficiendary a word analogous in its formation to referendary were it such an one as the ear could bring itself to endure this would put it more effectually out of doubt that the party meant was the party who ought to receive the benefit whether he actually receives it or no whereas the word beneficiary might be understood to intimate that the benefit was actually received while in offences against trust the mischief commonly is that such benefit is reaped not by the person it was designed for but by some other for instance the trustee     it is for shortness sake that the proposition is stated as it stands in the text if critically examined it might be found perhaps to be scarcely justifiable by the laws of language for the fictitious entities characterised by the two abstract terms trust and condition are not subalternate but disparate to speak with perfect precision we should say that he who is invested with a trust is on that account spoken of as being invested with a condition viz the condition of a trustee we speak of the condition of a trustee as we speak of the condition of a husband or a father     infra lv     it is to be observed that in common speech in the phrase the object of a mans property the words the object of are commonly left out and by an ellipsis which violent as it is is now become more familiar than the phrase at length they have made that part of it which consists of the words a mans property perform the office of the whole in some cases then it was only on a part of the object that the acts in question might be performed and to say on this account that the object was a mans property was as much as to intimate that they might be performed on any part in other cases it was only certain particular acts that might be exercised on the object and to say of the object that it was his property was as much as to intimate that any acts whatever might be exercised on it sometimes the acts in question were not to be exercised but at a future time nor then perhaps but in the case of the happening of a particular event of which the happening was uncertain and to say of an object that it was his property was as much as to intimate that the acts in question might be exercised on it at any time sometimes the object on which the acts in question were to have their termination or their commencement was a human creature and to speak of one human creature as being the property of another is what would shock the ear every where but where slavery is established and even there when applied to persons in any other condition than that of slaves among the first romans indeed the wife herself was the property of her husband the child of his father the servant of his master in the civilised nations of modern times the two first kinds of property are altogether at an end and the last unhappily not yet at an end but however verging it is to be hoped towards extinction the husbands property is now the company of his wife the fathers the guardianship and service of his child the masters the service of his servant   the consortium says the english law     we shall have occasion a little farther on to speak of the person in whose hands the trust exists under the description of the person who possesses or is in possession of it and thence of the possession of the trust abstracted from the consideration of the possessor however different the expression the import is in both cases the same so irregular and imperfect is the structure of language on this head that no one phrase can be made to suit the idea on all the occasions on which it is requisite it should be brought to view the phrase must be continually shifted or new modified so likewise in regard to conditions and in regard to property the being invested with or possessing a condition the being in possession of an article of property that is if the object of the property be corporeal the having a legal title defeasible or indefeasible to the physical possession of it answers to the being in possession of a trust or the being the person in whose hands a trust exists in like manner to the exercise of the functions belonging to a trust or to a condition corresponds the enjoyment of an article of property that is if the object of it be corporeal the occupation these verbal discussions are equally tedious and indispensable striving to cut a new road through the wilds of jurisprudence i find myself continually distressed for want of tools that are fit to work with to frame a complete set of new ones is impossible all that can be done is to make here and there a new one in cases of absolute necessity and for the rest to patch up from time to time the imperfections of the old  as to the bipartition which this paragraph sets out with it must be acknowledged not to be of the nature of those which to a first glance afford a sort of intuitive proof of their being exhaustive there is not that marked connection and opposition between the terms of it which subsists between contradictory terms and between terms that have the same common genus i imagine however that upon examination it would be found to be exhaustive notwithstanding and that it might even be demonstrated so to be but the demonstration would lead us too far out of the ordinary track of language     see ch vii actions iii     if advantageous it will naturally be on account of the powers or rights that are annexed to the trust if disadvantageous on account of the duties     it may seem a sort of anachronism to speak on the present occasion of a trust condition or other possession as one of which it may happen that a man ought or ought not to have had possession given him by the law for the plan here set out upon is to give such a view all along of the laws that are proposed as shall be taken from the reasons which there are for making them the reason then it would seem should subsist before the law not the law before the reason nor is this to be denied for unquestionably upon the principle of utility it may be said with equal truth of those operations by which a trust or any other article of property is instituted as of any other operations of the law that it never can be expedient they should be performed unless some reason for performing them deduced from that principle can be assigned to give property to one man you must impose obligation on another you must oblige him to do something which he may have a mind not to do or to abstain from doing something which he may have a mind to do in a word you must in some way or other expose him to inconvenience every such law therefore must at any rate be mischievous in the first instance and if no good effects can be produced to set against the bad it must be mischievous upon the whole some reasons therefore in this case as in every other there ought to be the truth is that in the case before us the reasons are of too various and complicated a nature to be brought to view in an analytical outline like the present where the offence is of the number of those by which person or reputation are affected the reasons for prohibiting it lie on the surface and apply to every man alike but property before it can be offended against must be created and at the instant of its creation distributed as it were into parcels of different sorts and sizes which require to be assigned some to one man and some to another for reasons of which many lie a little out of sight and which being different in different cases would take up more room than could consistently be allotted to them here for the present purpose it is sufficient if it appear that for the carrying on of the several purposes of life there are trusts and conditions and other articles of property which must be possessed by somebody and that it is not every article that can nor every article that ought to be possessed by every body what articles ought to be created and to what persons and in what cases they ought to be respectively assigned are questions which cannot be settled here nor is there any reason for wishing that they could since the settling them one way or another is what would make no difference in the nature of any offence whereby any party may be exposed on the occasion of any such institution to sustain a detriment     in the former case it may be observed the act is of the negative kind in the latter it will commonly be of the positive kind  as to the expression noninvestment of trust i am sensible that it is not perfectly consonant to the idiom of the language the usage is to speak of a person as being invested that is clothed with a trust not of a trust as of a thing that is itself invested or put on the phrase at length would be the noninvestment of a person with a trust but this phrase is by much too longwinded to answer the purpose of an appellative i saw therefore no other resource than to venture upon the ellipsis here employed the ancient lawyers in the construction of their appellatives have indulged themselves in much harsher ellipses without scruple see above xxv note it is already the usage to speak of a trust as a thing that vests and as a thing that may be divested     i do not find that this word has yet been received into the english language in the latin however it is very expressive and is used in a sense exactly suitable to the sense here given to it militiam detrectare to endeavour to avoid serving in the army is a phrase not unfrequently met with in the roman writers   0 what is here meant by abuse of trust is the exercise of a power usurped over strangers under favour of the powers properly belonging to the trust the distinction between what is here meant by breach of trust and what is here meant by abuse of trust is not very steadily observed in common speech and in regard to public trusts it will even in many cases be imperceptible the two offences are however in themselves perfectly distinct since the persons by whom the prejudice is suffered are in many cases altogether different it may be observed perhaps that with regard to abuse of trust there is but one species here mentioned viz that which corresponds to positive breach of trust none being mentioned as corresponding to negative breach of trust the reason of this distinction will presently appear in favour of the parties for whose benefit the trust was created the trustee is bound to act and therefore merely by his doing nothing they may receive a prejudice but in favour of other persons at large he is not bound to act and therefore it is only from some positive act on his part that any prejudice can ensue to them     see infra liv note and ch xviii indirect legislation     see ch xi dispositions xxix     to bribe a trustee as such is in fact neither more nor less than to suborn him to be guilty of a breach or an abuse of trust now subornation is of the number of those accessory offences which every principal offence one as well as another is liable to be attended with see infra xxxi note and b i tit accessory offences this particular species of subornation however being one that besides its having a specific name framed to express it is apt to engage a peculiar share of attention and to present itself to view in company with other offences against trust it would have seemed an omission not to have included it in that catalogue     see ch vi sensibility ii    this chapter is an attempt to put our ideas of offences into an exact method the particular uses of method are various but the general one is to enable men to understand the things that are the subjects of it to understand a thing is to be acquainted with its qualities or properties of these properties some are common to it with other things the rest peculiar but the qualities which are peculiar to any one sort of thing are few indeed in comparison with those which are common to it with other things to make it known in respect of its difference would therefore be doing little unless it were made known also by its genus to understand it perfectly a man must therefore be informed of the points in which it agrees as well as of those in which it disagrees with all other things when a number of objects composing a logical whole are to be considered together all of these possessing with respect to one another a certain congruency or agreement denoted by a certain name there is but one way of giving a perfect knowledge of their nature and that is by distributing them into a system of parcels each of them a part either of some other parcel or at any rate of the common whole this can only be done in the way of bipartition dividing each superior branch into two and but two immediately subordinate ones beginning with the logical whole dividing that into two parts then each of those parts into two others and so on these firstdistinguished parts agree in respect of those properties which belong to the whole they differ in respect of those properties which are peculiar to each to divide the whole into more than two parcels at once for example into three would not answer the purpose for in fact it is but two objects that the mind can compare together exactly at the same time thus then let us endeavour to deal with offences or rather strictly speaking with acts which possess such properties as seem to indicate them fit to be constituted offences the task is arduous and as yet at least perhaps for ever above our force there is no speaking of objects but by their names but the business of giving them names has always been prior to the true and perfect knowledge of their natures objects the most dissimilar have been spoken of and treated as if their properties were the same objects the most similar have been spoken of and treated as if they had scarce anything in common whatever discoveries may be made concerning them how different soever their congruencies and disagreements may be found to be from those which are indicated by their names it is not without the utmost difficulty that any means can be found out of expressing those discoveries by a conformable set of names change the import of the old names and you are in perpetual danger of being misunderstood introduce an entire new set of names and you are sure not to be understood at all complete success then is as yet at least unattainable but an attempt though imperfect may have its use and at the worst it may accelerate the arrival of that perfect system the possession of which will be the happiness of some maturer age gross ignorance descries no difficulties imperfect knowledge finds them out and struggles with them it must be perfect knowledge that overcomes them     in the enumeration of these genera it is all along to be observed that offences of an accessory nature are not mentioned unless it be here and there where they have obtained current names which seemed too much in vogue to be omitted accessory offences are those which without being the very acts from which the mischief in question takes its immediate rise are in the way of causality connected with those acts see ch vii actions xxiv and b i tit accessory offences     ch vii actions viii     of these and the several other leading expressions which there is occasion to bring to view in the remaining part of this analysis ample definitions will be found in the body of the work conceived in terminis legis to give particular references to these definitions would be encumbering the page to little purpose     injurious restrainment at large and injurious compulsion at large are here styled simple in order to distinguish them from confinement banishment robbery and extortion all which are in many cases but so many modifications of one or other of the two firstmentioned offences  to constitute an offence an act of simple injurious restrainment or simple injurious compulsion it is sufficient if the influence it exerts be in the first place pernicious in the next place exerted on the person by the medium of the will it is not necessary that that part of the person on which it is exerted be the part to which it is pernicious it is not even necessary that it should immediately be pernicious to either of these parts though to one or other of them it must be pernicious in the longrun if it be pernicious at all an act in which the body for example is concerned may be very disagreeable and thereby pernicious to him who performs it though neither disagreeable nor pernicious to his body for instance to stand or sit in public with a label on his back or under any other circumstances of ignominy     it may be observed that wrongful menacement is included as well in simple injurious restrainment as in simple injurious compulsion except in the rare case where the motives by which one man is prevented by another from doing a thing that would have been materially to his advantage or induced to do a thing that is materially to his prejudice are of the alluring kind   0 although for reasons that have been already given supra xxxi no complete catalogue nor therefore any exhaustive view of either semipublic or selfregarding offences can be exhibited in this chapter it may be a satisfaction however to the reader to see some sort of list of them if it were only for the sake of having examples before his eyes such lists cannot any where be placed to more advantage than under the heads of the several divisions of private extraregarding offences to which the semipublic and selfregarding offences in question respectively correspond concerning the two latter however and the last more particularly it must be understood that all i mean by inserting them here is to exhibit the mischief if any which it is of the nature of them respectively to produce without deciding upon the question whether it would be worth while see ch xiii cases unmeet in every instance for the sake of combating that mischief to introduce the evil of punishment in the course of this detail it will be observed that there are several heads of extraregarding private offences to which the correspondent heads either of semipublic or selfregarding offences or of both are wanting the reasons of these deficiencies will probably in most instances be evident enough upon the face of them lest they should not they are however specified in the body of the work they would take up too much room were they to be inserted here  i semipublic offences through calamity calamities by which the persons or properties of men or both are liable to be affected seem to be as follows   pestilence or contagion   famine and other kinds of scarcity   mischiefs producible by persons deficient in point of understanding such as infants idiots and maniacs for want of their being properly taken care of   mischief producible by the ravages of noxious animals such as beasts of prey locusts c c   collapsion or fall of large masses of solid matter such as decayed buildings or rocks or masses of snow   inundation or submersion   tempest   blight   conflagration  0 explosion in as far as a man may contribute by any imprudent act of his to give birth to any of the above calamities such act may be an offence in as far as a man may fail to do what is incumbent on him to do towards preventing them such failure may be an offence  ii semipublic offences of mere delinquency a whole neighbourhood may be made to suffer   simple corporal injuries in other words they may be made to suffer in point of health by offensive or dangerous trades or manufactures by selling or falsely puffing off unwholesome medicines or provisions by poisoning or drying up of springs destroying of aqueducts destroying woods walls or other fences against wind and rain by any kinds of artificial scarcity or by any other calamities intentionally produced   and   simple injurious restrainment and simple injurious compulsion for instance by obliging a whole neighbourhood by dint of threatening handbills or threatening discourses publicly delivered to join or forbear to join in illuminations acclamations outcries invectives subscriptions undertakings processions or any other mode of expressing joy or grief displeasure or approbation or in short in any other course of conduct whatsoever   and   confinement and banishment by the spoiling of roads bridges or ferryboats by destroying or unwarrantably preoccupying public carriages or houses of accommodation   by menacement as by incendiary letters and tumultuous assemblies by newspapers or handbills denouncing vengeance against persons of particular denominations for example against jews catholics protestants scotchmen gascons catalonians c   simple mental injuries as by distressful terrifying obscene or irreligious exhibitions such as exposure of sores by beggars exposure of dead bodies exhibitions or reports of counterfeit witchcrafts or apparitions exhibition of obscene or blasphemous prints obscene or blasphemous discourses held in public spreading false news of public defeats in battle or of other misfortunes  iii selfregarding offences against person   fasting abstinence from venery selfflagellation selfmutilation and other selfdenying and selftormenting practices   gluttony drunkenness excessive venery and other species of intemperance   suicide     i semipublic offences   calumniation and vilification of particular denominations of persons such as jews catholics c  ii selfregarding offences   incontinence in females   incest     supra xxvii     ib     see ch ix consciousness ii     the light in which the offense of insolvency is here exhibited may perhaps at first consideration be apt to appear not only novel but improper it may naturally enough appear that when a man owes you a sum of money for instance the right to the money is yours already and that what he withholds from you by not paying you is not the legal title to it possession of it or power over it but the physical possession of it or power over it only but upon a more accurate examination this will be found not to be the case what is meant by payment is always an act of investitive power as above explained an expression of an act of the will and not a physical act it is an act exercised with relation indeed to the thing said to be paid but not in a physical sense exercised upon it a man who owes you ten pounds takes up a handful of silver to that amount and lays it down on a table at which you are sitting if then by words or gestures or any means whatever addressing himself to you he intimates it to be his will that you should take up the money and do with it as you please he is said to have paid you but if the case was that he laid it down not for that purpose but for some other for instance to count it and examine it meaning to take it up again himself or leave it for somebody else he has not paid you yet the physical acts exercised upon the pieces of money in question are in both cases the same till he does express a will to that purport what you have is not properly speaking the legal possession of the money or a right to the money but only a right to have him or in his default perhaps a minister of justice compelled to render you that sort of service by the rendering of which he is said to pay you that is to express such will as abovementioned with regard to some corporeal article or other of a certain species and of value equal to the amount of what he owes you or in other words to exercise in your favour an act of investitive power with relation to some such article  true it is that in certain cases a man may perhaps not be deemed according to common acceptation to have paid you without rendering you a further set of services and those of another sort a set of services which are rendered by the exercising of certain acts of a physical nature upon the very thing with which he is said to pay you to wit by transferring the thing to a certain place where you may be sure to find it and where it may be convenient for you to receive it but these services although the obligation of rendering them should be annexed by law to the obligation of rendering those other services in the performance of which the operation of payment properly consists are plainly acts of a distinct nature nor are they essential to the operation by themselves they do not constitute it and it may be performed without them it must be performed without them wherever the thing to be transferred happens to be already as much within the reach physically speaking of the creditor as by any act of the debtor it can be made to be  this matter would have appeared in a clearer light had it been practicable to enter here into a full examination of the nature of property and the several modifications of which it is susceptible but every thing cannot be done at once     supra xxvi     under wrongful withholding of services is included breach of contract for the obligation to render services may be grounded either on contract or upon other titles in other words the event of a mans engaging in a contract is one out of many other investitive events from which the right of receiving them may take its commencement see ch xvii limits sect iv  were the word services to be taken in its utmost latitude negative included as well as positive this one head would cover the whole law to this place then are to be referred such services only the withholding of which does not coincide with any of the other offenses for which separate denominations have been provided     in the english law detinue and detainer detinue applied chiefly to movables detainer to immovables under detinue and detainer cases are also comprised in which the offense consists in forbearing to transfer the legal possession of the thing such oases may be considered as coming under the head of wrongful noninvestment the distinction between mere physical possession and legal possession where the latter is shortlived and defeasible seems scarcely hitherto to have been attended to in a multitude of instances they are confounded under the same expressions the cause is that probably under all laws and frequently for very good reasons the legal possession with whatever certainty defeasible upon the event of a trial is down to the time of that event in many cases annexed to the appearance of the physical     in attempting to exhibit the import belonging to this and other names of offenses in common use i must be understood to speak all along with the utmost diffidence the truth is the import given to them is commonly neither determinate nor uniform so that in the nature of things no definition that can be given of them by a private person can be altogether an exact one to fix the sense of them belongs only to the legislator   0 the remaining cases come under the head of usurpation or wrongful investment of property the distinction seems hardly hitherto to have been attended to it turns like another mentioned above upon the distinction between legal possession and physical the same observation may be applied to the case of extortion hereafter following     vide supra xxvii     usury which if it must be an offense is an offense committed with consent that is with the consent of the party supposed to be injured cannot merit a place in the catalogue of offenses unless the consent were either unfairly obtained or unfreely in the first case it coincides with defraudment in the other with extortion     i semipublic offences   wrongful divestment interception usurpation c of valuables which are the property of a corporate body or which are in the indiscriminate occupation of a neighbourhood such as parish churches altars relics and other articles appropriated to the purposes of religion or things which are in the indiscriminate occupation of the public at large such as milestones markethouses exchanges public gardens and cathedrals   setting on foot what have been called bubbles or fraudulent partnership or gaming adventures propagating false news to raise or sink the value of stocks or of any other denomination of property  ii selfregarding offences   idleness   gaming   other species of prodigality     see ch v pleasures and pains     i semipublic offences—none  ii selfregarding offences   sacrifice of virginity   indecencies not public     supra     in the technical language of the english law property so acquired is said to be acquired by duress     applied to movables the circumstance of force has never at least by the technical part of the language been taken into account no such combination of terms as forcible occupation is in current use the word detinue is applied to movables only and in the language of the law the word forcible has never been combined with it the word applied to immovables is detainer this is combined with the word forcible and what is singular it is scarcely in use without that word it was impossible to steer altogether clear of this technical nomenclature on account of the influence which it has on the body of the language     i semipublic offences   incendiarism   criminal inundation  ii selfregarding offenses—none   0 supra xxv note     by the terms connubial and postconnubial all i mean at present to bring to view is the mere physical union apart from the ceremonies and legal engagements that will afterwards be considered as accompanying it     the vague and undetermined nature of the fictitious entity called a relation is on occasions like the present apt to be productive of a good deal of confusion a relation is either said to be borne by one of the objects which are parties to it to the other or to subsist between them the latter mode of phraseology is perhaps rather the more common in such case the idea seems to be that from the consideration of the two objects there results but one relation which belongs as it were in common to them both in some cases this perhaps may answer the purpose very well it will not however in the present case for the present purpose it will be necessary we should conceive two relations as resulting from the two objects and borne since such is the phrase by the one of them to or towards the other one relation borne by the first object to the second another relation borne by the second object to the first this is necessary on two accounts   because for the relations themselves there are in many instances separate names for example the relations of guardianship and wardship in which case the speaking of them as if they were but one may be productive of much confusion   because the two different relationships give birth to so many conditions which conditions are so far different that what is predicated and will hold good of the one will in various particulars as we shall see not hold good of the other     see ch xvii limits sect iii     two persons who by any means stand engaged to live together can never live together long but one of them will choose that some act or other should be done which the other will choose should not be done when this is the case how is the competition to be decided laying aside generosity and goodbreeding which are the tardy and uncertain fruits of longestablished laws it is evident that there can be no certain means of deciding it but physical power which indeed is the very means by which family as well as other competitions must have been decided long before any such office as that of legislator had existence this then being the order of things which the legislator finds established by nature how should he do better than to acquiesce in it the persons who by the influence of causes that prevail every where stand engaged to live together are   parent and child during the infancy of the latter   man and wife   children of the same parents parent and child by necessity since if the child did not live with the parent or with somebody standing in the place of the parent it could not live at all husband and wife by a choice approaching to necessity children of the same parents by the necessity of their living each of them with the parents as between parent and child the necessity there is of a power on the part of the parent for the preservation of the child supersedes all farther reasoning as between man and wife that necessity does not subsist the only reason that applies to this case is the necessity of putting an end to competition the man would have the meat roasted the woman boiled shall they both fast till the judge comes in to dress it for them the woman would have the child dressed in green the man in blue shall the child be naked till the judge comes in to clothe it this affords a reason for giving a power to one or other of the parties but it affords none for giving the power to the one rather than to the other how then shall the legislator determine supposing it equally easy to give it to either let him look ever so long for a reason why he should give it to the one rather than to the other and he may look in vain but how does the matter stand already for there were men and wives or what comes to the same thing male and female living together as man and wife before there were legislators looking round him then he finds almost every where the male the stronger of the two and therefore possessing already by purely physical means that power which he is thinking of bestowing on one of them by means of law how then can he do so well as by placing the legal power in the same hands which are beyond comparison the more likely to be in possession of the physical in this way few transgressions and few calls for punishment in the other way perpetual transgressions and perpetual calls for punishment solon is said to have transferred the same idea to the distribution of state powers here then was generalization here was the work of genius but in the disposal of domestic power every legislator without any effort of genius has been a solon so much for reasons add to which in point of motives that legislators seem all to have been of the male sex down to the days of catherine i speak here of those who frame laws not of those who touch them with a sceptre   social motives sympathy for the public love of reputation c   selfregarding motives or social motives which are social in a less extent sympathy for persons of a particular description persons of the same sex     supra note page         vide supra xxvii     in most civilized nations there is a sort of domestic condition in which the superior is termed a master while the inferior is termed sometimes indeed a servant but more particularly and more frequently an apprentice in this case though the superior is in point of usage known by no other name than that of a master the relationship is in point of fact a mixed one compounded of that of master and that of guardian     it may seem at first that a person who is in the condition of a slave could not have it in his power to engage in such course of proceeding as would be necessary in order to give him an apparent title to be reckoned among the slaves of another master but though a slave in point of right it may happen that he has eloped for instance and is not a slave in point of fact or suppose him a slave in point of fact and ever so vigilantly guarded still a person connected with him by the ties of sympathy might do that for him which though willing and assenting he might not be able to do for himself might forge a deed of donation for example from the one master to the other     consider them together indeed take the sum of the two interests and the case as we have seen supra xl is then the reverse that case it is to be remembered proceeds only upon the supposition that the two parties are obliged to live together for suppose it to be at their option to part the necessity of establishing the power ceases   0 ch xvii limits sect i     ch xiii cases unmeet sect iii     in certain nations women whether married or not have been placed in a state of perpetual wardship this has been evidently founded on the notion of a decided inferiority in point of intellects on the part of the female sex analogous to that which is the result of infancy or insanity on the part of the male this is not the only instance in which tyranny has taken advantage of its own wrong alleging as a reason for the domination it exercises an imbecility which as far as it has been real has been produced by the abuse of that very power which it is brought to justify aristotle fascinated by the prejudice of the times divides mankind into two distinct species that of freemen and that of slaves certain men were born to be slaves and ought to be slaves—why because they are so     see ch xvii limits sect i     supra xxxv     vide supra xxv     vide supra xl     this effect it may be thought will not necessarily take place since a ward may have two guardians one man then is guardian by right another man comes and makes himself so by usurpation this may very well be and yet the former may continue guardian notwithstanding how then it may be asked is he divested of his guardianship—the answer is—certainly not of the whole of it but however of a part of it of such part as is occupied if one may so say that is of such part of the powers and rights belonging to it as are exercised by the usurper     at first view it may seem a solecism to speak of the condition of parentality as one which a man can have need to be invested with the reason is that it is not common for any ceremony to be required as necessary to mans being deemed in law the father of such or such a child but the institution of such ceremony whether advisable or not is at least perfectly conceivable nor are there wanting cases in which it has actually been exemplified by an article in the roman law adopted by many modern nations an illegitimate child is rendered legitimate by the subsequent marriage of his parents if then a priest or other person whose office it was were to refuse to join a man and woman in matrimony such refusal besides being a wrongful noninvestment with respect to the two matrimonial conditions would be a wrongful noninvestment of parentality and filiation to the prejudice of any children who should have been legitimated     in english we have no word that will serve to express with propriety the person who bears the relation opposed to that of parent the word child is ambiguous being employed in another sense perhaps more frequently than in this more frequently in opposition to a person of full age an adult than in correlation to a parent for the condition itself we have no other word than filiation an illcontrived term not analogous to paternity and maternity the proper term would have been filiality the word filiation is as frequently perhaps and more consistently put for the act of establishing a person in the possession of the condition of filiality   0 supra xl note     see ch xvii limits sect iv     in this case also if the woman knew not of the prior marriage it is besides a species of seduction and in as far as it affects her belongs to another division of the offences of this class vide supra xxxvi     i semipublic offenses—falsehoods contesting or offenses against justice destroying the validity of the marriages of people of certain descriptions such as jews quakers hugonots c c  ii selfregarding offenses—improvident marriage on the part of minors     in pursuance of the plan adopted with relation to semipublic and selfregarding offences it may here be proper to exhibit such a catalogue as the nature of the design will admit of the several genera or inferior divisions of public offences  i offences against the external security of the state   treason in favour of foreign enemies it may be positive or negative negative consisting for example in the not opposing the commission of positive   espionage in favour of foreign rivals not yet enemies   injuries to foreigners at large including piracy   injuries to privileged foreigners such as ambassadors  ii offences against justice offences against judicial trust viz wrongful noninvestment of judicial trust wrongful interception of judicial trust wrongful divestment of judicial trust usurpation of judicial trust wrongful investment of judicial trust wrongful abdication of judicial trust wrongful detrectation of judicial trust wrongful imposition of judicial trust breach of judicial trust abuse of judicial trust disturbance of judicial trust and bribery in prejudice of judicial trust  breach and abuse of judicial trust may be either intentional or unintentional intentional is culpable at any rate unintentional will proceed either from inadvertence or from missupposal if the inadvertence be coupled with heedlessness or the missupposal with rashness it is culpable if not blameless for the particular acts by which the exercise of judicial trust may be disturbed see b i tit offences against justice they are too multifarious and too ill provided with names to be exhibited here  if a man fails in fulfilling the duties of this trust and thereby comes either to break or to abuse it it must be through some deficiency in the three requisite and only requisite endowments of knowledge inclination and power see supra xxvii a deficiency in any of those points if any person be in fault may proceed either from his own fault or from the fault of those who should act with or under him if persons who are in fault are persons invested with judicial trust the offence comes under the head of breach or abuse of trust if other persons under that of disturbance of trust  the ill effects of any breach abuse or disturbance of judicial trust will consist in the production of some

power or right of investiture with regard to the power in question in like manner may any person also possess a divestitive power the powers above enumerated such as judicial power military power and so forth may therefore be exercisable by a man either directly propriâ manu or indirectly manu alienâ power to be exercised manu alienâ is investitive which may or may not be accompanied by divestitive of sovereign power whether autocratic legislative or executive the several public trusts above mentioned form so many subordinate branches any of these powers may be placed either   in an

that branch notwithstanding its importance and its capacity of being lodged separately from the other matter had at that time scarcely presented itself to my view in the character of a distinct one the thread of my enquiries had not as yet reached it but in the concluding note of this same chapter in paragraphs xxii to the end the omission may be seen in some measure supplied      under the gentoo and mahometan religions the interests of the rest of the animal creation seem to have met with some attention why have they not universally with as much as those of human creatures allowance made for the difference in point of sensibility because the laws that are have been the work of mutual fear a sentiment which the less rational animals have not had the same means as man has of turning to account why ought they not no reason can be given if the being eaten were all there is very good reason why we should be suffered to eat such of them as we like to eat we are the better for it and they are never the worse they have none of those longprotracted anticipations of future misery which we have the death they suffer in our hands commonly is and always may be a speedier and by that means a less painful one than that which would await them in the inevitable course of nature if the being killed were all there is very good reason why we should be suffered to kill such as molest us we should be the worse for their living and they are never the worse for being dead but is there any reason why we should be suffered to torment them not any that i can see are there any why we should not be suffered to torment them yes several see b i tit cruelty to animals the day has been i grieve to say in many places it is not yet past in which the greater part of the species under the denomination of slaves have been treated by the law exactly upon the same footing as in england for example the inferior races of animals are still the day may come when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been withholden from them but by the hand of tyranny the french have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor it may come one day to be recognized that the number of the legs the villosity of the skin or the termination of the os sacrum are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate what else is it that should trace the insuperable line is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse but a fullgrown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational as well as a more conversable animal than an infant of a day or a week or even a month old but suppose the case were

upon the apprehension they may think it prudent to entertain of a defect in point of ability or integrity on the part of the legislator partly upon a similar apprehension of a defect in point of

the european languages there are two different words for distinguishing the abstract and the concrete senses of the word law which words are so wide asunder as not even to have any etymological affinity in latin for example there is lex for the concrete sense jus for the abstract in italian legge and diritto in french loi and droit in spanish ley and derecho in german gesetz and recht the english is at present destitute of this advantage  in the anglosaxon besides lage and several other words for the concrete sense there was the word right answering to the german recht for the abstract as may be seen in the compound folcright and in other instances but the word right having long ago lost this sense the modern english no longer possesses this advantage      the word international it must be acknowledged is a new one though it is hoped sufficiently analogous and intelligible it is calculated to express in a more significant way the branch of law which goes commonly under the name of the law of nations an appellation so uncharacteristic that were it not for the force of custom it would seem rather to refer to internal jurisprudence the chancellor daguesseau has already made i

defendant philip wherever it was to be found within their bailiwick as to the sheriffs philip we may believe was in no great fear of them but what answered the same purpose he happened on his part to have demands upon some other merchants whom so long as the outlawry remained in force there was one proceeding against gondemar paid the money this was internal jurisprudence if the dispute had been
