preface which i intended wherein i proposed by way of essay a discourse on tragedy the subject being too copious to treat of in this short time i defer it either to publish it single or to join it with some other work  but my gratitude prompts me to declare the obligations i have to my best and dearest friend mr aaron hill for his many judicious corrections in this tragedy on that worthy gentleman whose mind is enriched with every noble science and in whose breast all the virtues of humanity are comprised it will be my pride to offer my sentiments in a more distinguishing manner hereafter  i think it my duty also to return thanks to the town for their favorable reception of this play and for the applause their indulgence bestowed on the performance of the young actors particularly for my own success in a double capacity as actor and author i shall ever publicly confess their generosity as it will ever prove my secret satisfaction  notwithstanding the disadvantage this play may have received in the representation i cannot omit acknowledging a debt of gratitude to mr theophilus cibber who was very careful in the management of the rehearsals and endeavored to instruct every one concerned in the play a mechanism which my inexperience as an actor made me incapable of  though an author knows the meaning of his scenes he may be unacquainted with a theatrical method of setting em in the most advantageous appearance example enforces precept and therefore mr cibber junior took the noblest method to improve others by doing justice to his own character and though he labors under the present disadvantage of small stature i cannot help concurring with the opinion of many others that in action and elocution he is certainly a prodigy  prologue written by

same for men they are not as they were of old  often their professions are the arts of interest you will find the friendship of the world is show mere outward show it is like the harlots tears the statesmans promise or false patriots zeal full of fair seeming but delusion all  some not so  then might i think you not my friend shall i because i live in faithless times distrust a virtuous man or should i slight a faithful fairone cause her sex are false if these are maxims ties can bind no more all that is humane is for ever lost and brutes are even as we are  nor come my lord this overbury

their erring infants firm to his prince and faithful to his country a braver subject england never boasted nor man a nobler friend than overbury  nor can he be justly called your noblest friend yet sacrifice your bliss to private malice let not a show of friendship make you wretched nor break the bands which heaven and love have made  some know you my lord so little then of somerset that you can wrong him with so poor a thought my wife to tell you but how much i love her twoud like eternity admit no end  nor i have done  your safe discretion be your guide exit some a wife a friend oh they include all joys and love and friendship are so near akin they should like poetry and music join each formed to grace the other  why then in me why in my breast should friendship jar with love  enter

hasted even to outstrip time left the dull hours behind me as i flew and reached the goal of all my wishes here  some friends who thus meet possess so soft a bliss that none but those who taste can guess our joy  over may ours live to the last verge of being nay even in death for then if thought remains should mine but meet a soul in worlds to come whose generous flame sublimed it from the rest i should be apt to call it  somerset but tell me  for my mind has dwelt upon thee has thy fond heart regained its liberty does the late essex yet appear herself or art thou still bewitched with her enchantment  some alas thou know not what a lover feels  over have i a soul for friendship not for love there is one who knows my softness but too well knows how her beauty fires her virtue charms me  essex i see still hangs her witchcraft round thee  some would thou but view her with impartial eyes  over why i confess she is fair and when she talks enchanting softness melts upon her tongue and flows in seas of mischief  she has beauty which spreads and blooms like a freshopening flower but poisonous adders lurk beneath its shade and from such briars shoots this lovely rose it wounds the touch which it invites to crop it  some but let me beg thee if thou love thy somerset if friendship makes my peace of mind thy care no more to shock me on this tender point  over twere flattery all not friendship to comply the wound can never be cured that shuns the probing kind is the hand that wipes the dust from virtue and counsel is a friends peculiar office  some trust me my friend that counsel comes too late  over hear me  for as i love thee i will speak what though her outward charms attract the eye virtue the gem within is long since faded her fame like flesh that blackens in the sky is blown and bloated by the breath of thousands now as a man weigh well ever you resolve for when a womans reputations gone all that repenting virtue can inspire can never fix it in its state again  some cruel report i know has wronged her worth envy still feeds upon the fairest fruit and spreads its poison on the wings of virtue it blinds even overbury to accuse her  over my lord my lord i am no stranger to her her trial with her late wronged husband essex her loose pretensions for that wished divorce i know it all  and by my soul i think dear as i love thee could thou stoop so low as to receive that wanton to thy arms t would shake my friendship so  i could not scorn thee  but ever i would see thy shame  i would range the world and leave thee to the ruin you are so fond of should thou alas  what mean those starting tears big drops of sweat  dead paleness  trembling limbs signs of some strong confusion  some o my friend i must not  cannot hide a thought from thee she from whose charms your friendship would dissuade me is now my wife  over your wife  some my much loved wife  over oh what are men who love  my lord i have done one sigh to friendship only  and no more all those convulsive starts that shock thy frame were the prophetic warners of my fall  some said thou thy fall fall first a thousand somersets  over that i still love thee  witness this embrace witness these tears  but from this fatal hour joined as you are to her  we part for ever  some o stop  repent  recall those hasty words what part for ever  over for ever our alliance not our love  some i fear i have no friend  but overbury  over you have a wife and friendship is her office it stings my soul to see thee thus betrayed and my foreboding heart even bleeds with pity all that is left me now is to avoid thee and not to see what but to hear will kill me farewell my lord  may ceaseless blessings wait you exit somerset alone some sorrow eternal sorrow claims me now all happy fortune flies for ever from me whateers worth wishing for on earth i have lost life is a dream disturbed by constant cares and he who is not loved finds death a blessing friendships dear ties for generous souls were made

companion of her hours  cleo of me no more now let your overbury fill your thoughts and every accent swell with sounds of love  isa oh my cleora he will never be mine a dreadful dream last night has warned my soul love had methought ordained our nuptial rites but sudden while before the priest we stood a lowering cloud hung over the temples roof and with slow horror spread a fleecy darkness from its black center burst a rattling shower the laboring air groaned big with rolling thunder red through the gathered gloom flashed lightning broke and the rent veillet in a dreadful glare which with portentous quiverings gleamd upon us the altar tottered  and the lights grew dim  a hollow wind sighed cold  and from their graves pale ghosts stalked shadowy and screamd hideous round me but oh  around my love fierce brightness glittered a fire triumphant curled about his form and winding upward snatched him from my sight  cleo yet he is not lost  see where he smiling comes let me not stay to interrupt your joys exit enter overbury over o take me take me to thy heavenly bosom here let me pour out all my hoarded thoughts here tower my joys my cares be here dispersed  isa i have a thousand tender things to say a thousand doubts at once to be resolved three tedious months have heavily rolled on and not one thought perhaps has chid thy stay but while thy voice so sweetly strikes my ear my joys revive and melt away my sadness  over let my soul bless the music of those words my heart breaks rapturous at the softning sound i feast my famished eyes upon thy smiles i touch thee  and am lost in ecstasy a tide of thrilling joy flows through my veins i part with pleasure and i burn with love  isa i cannot if i would disguise my thoughts tho it is perhaps a fault to look thus kindly but oh beware  for thou have dangerous foes beware northampton who pretends to love me beware the woman who deludes thy friend watchful i strive to counterplot their mischief and guard thy virtue from impending danger  over oh thou rich source of everlasting pleasure virtues rise mixed and sparkle in thy soul one glittering charm pursues anothers shine as while i cut those seas which brought me near thee sweet sunreflecting waves rolled glassy on and this no sooner kissed the shore and died but a new follower rose and swelled as lovely  enter northampton nor why start you madam  at a lovers presence unveil your clouded beauty  since this morning a smiling sun looks gay on our friends nuptials  isa my lord i want the courtier  nor not the woman i see a too successful rival near you  sir i should speak you welcome  you are happy  but madam since your charms may be neglected for boys unskilled find gems whose worth they know not when such your fortune proves think of northampton and smile tho late on one who lives to love you  over my lord this injury but provokes my scorn the next may move my anger  nor am i threatened a way  thou buzzing insect of the court  over reproaches are too mean for brave mens anger or i could sting thy arrogance with talking be wise nor urge my sword against thy meanness worn for a nobler quarrel  nor sir it is well when we meet next what now remains to say may be debated  over at your speediest leisure leads off isab northampton solus nor well overbury  thou do right to spurn me if plots have power if oaths have force to crush thee if there is a magic spell beneath the moon or poison can be drawn from baneful plants then horror from my fury light upon thee  enter countess of somerset count my lord i know not if i am yet betrayed my foe shot by me with a gloomy brow nor bowed his head in passing  nor saw you your lord  count i did and strangely moved the usual sweetness of his natures lost with folded arms he traverses the room now red  now pale big on his watery eyes prompt tears stand trembling  speak to him and he sighs or shakes his head  and groans an hollow answer then on a sudden starts  and flies observance  nor now is the time to fire him to our purpose their friendship broke i have a further plot  ever night this overbury sees the tower  count woolsey nor burleigh ever projected better  nor haste we to execute resolves of weight an active fire should quicken vast conceptions for when delays cold influence chills our schemes some adverse fate comes like a furious blast and kills em ever they ripen into action  count o i can match thee with an equal flame not even the soldiers fury raised in war the rage of tyrants when defiance stings em the pride of priests so bloody when in power are half so dreadful as a womans vengeance  nor it is a warm thought and fires the mounting soul revenge dares strike at every thing  rivers of blood mark out the smiling way and kingdoms flame to give her triumphs luster welcome dread vengeance as i weigh my wrongs i swell like aetna when her sulfurous rage bursts over the earth and rolls in floods of fire  count let the priestridden vulgar worship virtue thou virtuous overbury sleep and dream dream of philosophy and puzzling honor of heavenly visions and immortal shadows till slow revenge leaps suddenly upon thee then start  behold who strikes and so expire  nor soft the earl comes  be on the nicest guard prove thy success but vast as are thy wishes thy name shall swell on fames immortal voice a wonder among women  ex count he comes  now aid me all my sexs falsehood  enter somerset musing some men say our thoughts distinguish us from brutes would i had never thought  i had then been happy reflection rivets woe upon the wretched thought teaches me to feel a friends lost worth when we have friends to them we trust our griefs our care lies lightened and the mind sleeps calm to me that comfort s lost  i have no friend oh i could pine away this wretched life lean like a willow trembling over a brook sigh with the winds and murmur with the stream  count his heart seems pressed with care aside my gentle lord why leave you thus the gaiety of friends and why has grinding grief usurped your soul  some i found myself disordered and i left you  often am i thus  leave me i will soon return  count oh my dear lord i am not soon deceived those carebent brows suit not a bridegrooms face are folded arms the gestures of delight or these sad groans the voice of inward joy no no  consider i am now your wife it is mine to ease your cares and bring you comfort if you have sorrows i must claim my part i sink not soon beneath a weight of woe  if you deny me this you love me not  some not love thee say thou oh thou soul of somerset could those bright eyes be turned into my breast there would you see how your suspicion wrongs me let me look nigh  let me gaze here with wonder where is friendship now why reason yields to beauty what though the crimes of which her foes accuse her glard broad as daylight on my startled soul angels play smiling in her wanton eyes and lend an awe to lightness  love reigns round her and when she speaks  the softest sweetest music melts in her voice and charms away my grief  count oh with what art you sooth my fainting spirits then i am still your dear your muchloved wife  why do i ask those eyes confess i am but tell me  for you should impart your cares why are you thus  some oh  count nay again youre cruel still when i strive to search the cause your voice sinks from the point and answers with a groan  some what cause  i told thee i had been disordered  thy fears are the wild coinage of thy fancy a subtle selftormentor  count it is well my lord i guess to whom i owe my loss of power you have a friend can tell you tales of honor and teach you how to triumph over a wife who has indeed had faults  but whose chief crime is loving you perhaps with too much fondness  some what do thou mean  what friend  count why overbury i know your tutor chides your faulty conduct go then and make your peace  be meekly penitent promise to err no more  and he will forgive you  some hear me sweet tyrant  by my life i swear you are dear to me as crowns to the ambitious dear as these eyes which tremble on thy charms or as this heart which aches with joy and anguish  count then i must tell you sir your friends a villain  some have a care let not thy rage transport thee to detraction  count oh were i but to speak his base attempt  some what base attempt  count no matter what it is i sure may be allowed some secrets too  some nay this is wrong  to brand him first with villain then in a dusky phrase elude the charge truth seldom lies concealed in mystery clearly to reason she reveals her light and errors vanish like a mist before her  count why  what if he designed against my honor  some your honor it is impossible   count form all that treacherous guilt would dare to act and sum it up in this pretended friend  some i prithee do not make me mad  speak plainly  count knowing your passion he durst urge his own  he told me you were false  designing  jealous  tried every art of treachery to supplant you and when he found his wiles were unsuccessful attempted force and threatened me with slander  some force  slander  thou have warmed me  think once more he could not be so base  count he was  some impossible  ever yet my fury mounts into a blaze ever i upbraid him with these black designs i charge thee do not tax him wrongfully for thou may open such a scene of horror twill shake thee to behold it dare you confirm it with an oath  count i will  some nay but weigh well what you presume to swear oaths are of dreadful weight  and if they are false draw down damnation  those who murder fame kill more than lifedestroyers  think again for at that day when each must stand arraigned their lots will fall in the severest fires  count by all my hopes what i have said   some no more  i must believe you  believe you said i  what must i believe if you prove false  if you traduce my friend and wrong my faith may sorrow blast thy beauties may conscience rise in all her dreadful triumph scare every sense and strike thee with distraction yet sure you are true those eyes which shine so sweetly can wear no dusky stain of barbarous falsehood  what then must overbury be reflection sickens with doubt and dies in dark confusion  count my lord   some thou needst not speak  i said i would believe thee thou art my life the fountain of my joy yet let me think  force  slander  yes it is so he is false he is false  curse on all treacherous friends  count nay but i meant not thus to fire your anger forget a friends first falsehood  some never never no  tho this day was vowed to peace and love though crowds of noble guests have graced my joys nay though our king should add his sacred presence my fury brooks no stay  my fame my honor both are concerned and rouse my soul to vengeance  enter northampton nor why are the bride and bridegroom thus retired crowds of all ranks press in to join your pleasures and every instrument of music vies to sound sweet notes and swell the hours of love  some alas my lord even harmony grows harsh thought s out of tune discord has struck my ear and my soul jars within me  nor what is the cause  some it is a vile world northampton the oaths of friendship like those made to girls are meant but to betray and broke of course  nor this i knew well before  but who has wronged you  some the darkest of all villains  a false friend but as i am a man i will revenge it  oh what a change has my poor heart sustained but a few moments since this mans loved memory sat soft as brooding halcyons on my soul now my roused rage could hunt him in full scent till his last dust were scattered in the air and driven like chaff before the angry wind  nor my lord this seems the extravagance of passion when anger rushes unrestrained to action like a hot steed it stumbles in its way the man of thought wounds deepest and strikes safely premeditation makes his vengeance sure and levels it directly to the mark  some i cannot like a courtier kill with smiles my fury scorns to glow concealed in embers no it shall blaze abroad with flaming luster if i must fall why i was born to die and fall as a man should  if i revenge me i right my injured honor as i ought  nor my lord this stream must have another course this overbury   some said thou overbury now by my soul there is magic in the name and my charmed rage grows still as midnight silence why would thou speak it  let me not dwell upon him talk of false friendship of abandoned honor of hate revenge  distraction  but spare that name  at which my fury melts or guilt will smile like sweeteyd innocence  count my lord i wish you could surmount your anger it is nobler to forgive than to revenge  some do thou plead too  why  he has wronged thy fame even to my ear has wronged it  generous charmer  nor your frowns will blast what sprung but by your smiles  some i will think a while  your counsel shall direct me thou injured friendship my grieved soul inspire with awful justice and vindictive fire let my revenge to match the ungenrous wrong be swift as eagles and as lions strong dreadful as flames by furious whirlwinds driven or thunder bursting from offended heaven exeunt act iii northampton and countess of somerset nor the king come here in private  then all is right and in good time we have stirred your husbands anger  count the courtiers are in overburys interest  nor no matter  they will desert him in his fall like persians they adore the rising sun but when the great mans glories shrink away shrubs which grew under him shoot up ungrateful and brave him in declension  none assist him no kind hand lifts him from engulphing ruin but all join strength to press him lower still  you have not heard perhaps that overbury courts friendship with your essex  count how with essex  nor what if he should betray your letters to him  count the villain dares not   nor if he does youre lost  what know you of his love to isabella  count oh name it not  it cannot be  i have feared but would not find it  nor would twere a secret then  but see this packet these are his letters to that isabella their superscriptions wanting  happy that to tell how i acquired em would be tedious let it suffice these undirected papers shall bear the force of proofs to somerset most fatal to his friend sir gervas ellways who bears a weighty part in this design is coming toward us  please to leave him with me i am an exile from the royal presence but you the king expects should bless his eyes exit countess of somerset that he sees essex i am well informed and blew that spark to raise her to a flame enter sir g elloways let me congratulate my faithful elloways the towerlieutenancy will now be yours for somerset has said it  ell my kind lord  nor nay i have news that more will please you if you love northampton the man i hate will soon be in my power all the proud steps by which he climbed to greatness sink from his feet and let him fall to ruin  ell can somerset forsake him  nor he detests him   ell prodigious change  this news indeed surprises  nor to gain the unbeliever to my wishes i stirred his temper with such cautious art that ever his judgment could exert its phlegm his blood took ferment from a warmth of passion then while his fiery spirit flamed with rage in its full heat i stamped it with revenge  ell the depth of wisdom flows in all your actions like a strong current which opposed by piles works gently through and saps the mound unseen till gathering force it pours resistless in and the bank floats before it  end you there  nor no  overburys death must crown my conduct  ell there is danger there   nor not so  i have weighed it well thassassinating spanish ways unsafe suspicion were its followers  and suspicion would like a bloodhound haunt our steps too near what think you of the close italians means sure silent poison  dare you be a friend  ell i dare the worst  nor know then that somerset has
