loves frailties a comedy in five acts as performed at the theater royal covent garden  by thomas holcroft  london printed for shepperson and reynolds no     oxford street        advertisement those passages that are printed in italics not including the french were omitted on the first representation one excepted page    of which the words that then gave offense are distinguished by capitals they are thus pointed out that the reader who in the heat of political zeal has not quite lost his understanding may examine what there is in them injurious to truth or the good of mankind and find it if he can in different times and under different feelings it will appear astonishing that any one of these passages were suppressed from any apprehension of political resentment but such was the fact that the one unwarily retained should excite the anger which was testified is still more astonishing a sentence so true as to have been repeated in a thousand different modes for all strong moral truths are subject to such repetition a sentence that under a variety of forms and phraseology is proverbial in all nations it ought however to be remembered that the persons offended though violent were few their intention doubtless was good the same cannot be affirmed of their intellect  those who are acquainted with german literature and who have read the drama entitled der deutsche hausvater by the baron von gemmingen will immediately perceive that the author has availed himself of various incidents and thoughts in that piece though his fable characters and denouement are exceedingly different others who wish to satisfy their curiosity but who cannot read german may find a french translation of that piece in volume vi of a work entitled nouveau theater allemand by m m friedel and de bonneville  newmanstreet february         the reasons which have occasioned the alteration of price in the present comedy ought to be stated to the public the previous knowledge of men and manners and the extraordinary efforts of study time and talents which are necessary to produce a play that has but a chance of being sanctioned by the town are sufficiently obvious the labourer is worthy of his hire in the beginning of the present century the price of an octavo play was eighteen pence since that period the price of paper has been doubled the expense of printing is advanced in nearly the same ratio and advertising which now amounts to a considerable sum was then a burden unknown it has long been the complaint of the trade that the purchase of the copyright added to the above costs occasioned plays to be a dangerous speculation the new tax on paper in addition to all these has made it impossible at the former price to reward authors and afford the bookseller a reasonable hope of profit these considerations have induced an advance of price at which it is presumed no just reasoner will take offense  prologue spoken by mr bernard prologues have long been placed like little a before that great noun substantive a play not formed of winged words but wanting wings of common gender halfnomeaning things like ragfair robes made up with little skill to suit farce tragedy or what you will mere tasteless breadcrumbs only fit for stuffing a cringing crew and vilely prone to puffing beggars well satisfied at any rate to feed on offals at the public gate or running footmen sent with whoop and hollo types of the vapid things that are to follow grace before meat which while the dinner cools is twangd by knaves and listened to by fools but let us take nor waste our little wit a single theme that may our purpose fit prologues are scouts that skulk from post to post and scour the field to watch the adverse host heroes invincible left right front rear embattld ranks ye thrill the soul with fear wadded with critic spleen pit and primd with ire charged to the muzzle ready to give fire to slaughter some inclined and some to sleep lo ruthless veterans ranged entrenched chin deep flanking this fearful center in a ring boxes gay knights and amazons form either wing corpse of reserve gallery drawn up in dread array on yonder heights await the coming fray but as youre strong be just in this fierce battle ye godlike men of might and maids of mettle here let us pause for ah it is but too true cassandra like in black prophetic view i see the massacres that may ensue wit humor character are put to rout the prompter breathless and the actors out quibbles and claptraps in confusion run slain is a sentiment down drops a pun nay plot himself that leader far renowned oh shame dare scarcely stand another round how shall our general dare such danger meet were it not better think you sirs to treat war honors grant then as he files away so may he live and fight another day for the subject of this prologue and the lines marked with inverted commas the author is indebted to a literary friend  epilogue spoken by mrs esten as some poor wanderer who with eager flight is homeward hurried by the approach of night comes to the deep abyss over which is thrown trunk of old oak or wedge of unhewn stone tremendous bridge which he must venture over braving the horrid gulf and cataract roar slippery abrupt no hold no stay no trust the first false step is death yet cross he must safely on the other side looks shivering back and palpitating views the dreadful track so

absurdities of folly disguised by the ridiculous trappings of fashion where shall the sincere the simple the affectionate heart be found i enter the tumultuous assemblies of the idle and all is vanity all affectation all incoherency this hubbub of incongruous and despicable passions but maddens my mind and by the contrast irradiates the abode of peace and paulina   lady l ah charles you forget our dependent situation our family   seym our fools and tyrants an elder brother whose rank wealth and power instead of affording us protection have been made the passports of folly and vice and an uncle whose benevolence is self love who has given us shelter only to make us slaves at once a cynic and a sensualist severe to others indulgent to himself arbitrary in principle libidinous in practice   lady l alas too true sir gregory pardons nobodys faults but his own   seym did he not suffer his sister to languish and die in penury in a foreign land and what was her crime marriage with a man of a

mankind for the fulfilling of which you ought not to be disabled by the indulgence of passion   seym i own it and the doubts of what these duties are haunt and perturb my mind incessantly render me undecided cause me every hour to form a thousand contradictory plans and instead of making me active and firm murder resolution and torment me into restless suspense   lady l opinion is the slave of error the world is the slave of opinion and we are the slaves of the world   seym it is your situation louisa that rivets my shackles which else i would break and brave the worlds injustice and an

different beings were our brave ancestors the bold barons   lady l ay uncle how delightful it is to contemplate their venerable figures in old gothic cathedrals   sir greg kneeling in marble with their huge helmets long swords alabaster ruffs grim beards and gruff faces that seem to bid you keep your distance or damme they will rise and knock you down as soon as they have done praying   lady l and yet somehow a little modish politeness and delicacy    sir greg i hate the words they are outlandish contraband and were imported in some damned cargo of fans muffs fringed nightcaps and chicken gloves   lady l i own it would be diverting to see a modern petitmaitre in a coat of mail   sir greg zounds he would melt under it like a man of snow before the sun a coat of mail a coat of pink tiffany a degenerate  ah  i have not patience a robust hearty fellow that speaks what he thinks eats when he is hungry and fights when he is angry is called barbarian horrid brute and the sight of

ought never to be yet there they always are   sir greg no no the disease has attacked the vitals the blood of our nobles is contaminated all rank all order all distinction is lost dukes and jockeys earls and hopdealers peers and pickpockets all mingle indiscriminately and hold their nightly orgies at a hazard table   lady l calculation uncle is the wisdom of the age   sir greg yes he is most learned who best knows the odds and he most renowned who fleeces his fellows with the greatest adroitness  have you seen lady fancourt today to charles   seym it is too early sir   sir greg yesterday   seym no sir   sir greg no sir had not you my commands sir   seym i had   sir greg and how came they to be disobeyed   seym because commanding is less difficult than obedience   sir greg with severity

original touches which a bad light and a college education have obscured   sir greg he has already profited by your lessons sir   musc yes lady fancourt herself made the same remark but yesterday   lady l charles is become a favorite with her ladyship   musc is he   lady l nay dont be jealous   musc jealous ha ha ha that is excellent i jealous am i not an adept in all the delightful follies of

lodged a bullet in his body sent an attested account of the affair to the papers took post for dover and enjoyed a hearty supper my bottle of burgundy a french chanson damour and a sound sleep the next night at calais   sir greg while your father and the man you had wronged lay stretched on their bier   musc um  no as it happened the gentleman mended in spite of me and the doctors the news was sent me we became the best of friends and in six weeks i had the pleasure to wish him joy of his recovery   sir greg after seducing his wife and    musc was it my fault that she was handsome and i irresistible   sir greg ha you may well be a favorite with the ladies   musc oh yes i cannot help it no more can they i have a smile for one a nod for another a wink for a third a hem and a how do you

plum it must be admired not touched if you handle it you destroy its beauty  dont you uncle   musc your character and mine baronet are certainly very opposite   sir greg or i would hang myself you pretend to wit but like booksellers you deal in what you dont understand   musc ha ha ha you are an eight day clock wound up once a week a fixed star that every fool knows where to find an evergreen

married men and the admiration of the whole world while everybody is enquiring whence it comes how long it stays where it goes and when it returns   lady l you affect singularity mr muscadel   musc no

  pau how do thou   seym ill very ill   pau alarmed ill   seym wretched   pau what do thou mean seymour pause why do thou look thus despondingly on me  what is there in thy thoughts  some dreadful secret sure  speak thy silence distracts me   seym man is born for misery guilt perjury   pau with horror seymour   seym i have a sister young affectionate and noble minded as thyself    pau well   seym but desolate ruined devoted to wretchedness unless    pau how can    seym lady fancourt    pau with a sudden cry of anguish stop  forbear falling on her knees and again seizing his hand thou art mine  with wild agony thou art mine  cast thy eyes up to heaven remember what thou have sworn remember who has heard thee with frantic fervor  by that divine that just that avenging essence whose immaculate name thou have made thy pledge i will not survive thy falsehood again with agony thou art mine thou art mine rising why talk of surviving the maddening brain is murdered by the bare suspicion   scene viii reenter craig with the picture whose mind is so occupied through the scene by his picture that he does not attend to the agitation of paulina and seymour craig works addressed to the imagination are unworthy of praise unless they have some moral purpose the subject i have chosen will meet applause from you sir and all whose hearts and principles are equally generous and noble  it is the progress of seduction beginning in perjury ending in suicide   seym sir   craig pleased i knew it must incite terror  this is but one of a series of pictures  here i have imagined    seym perjury here is a portrait of paulina   craig yes  perhaps the partiality of a father led me to suppose the form and countenance of my paulina miraculously adapted to my subject  but observe  the scene is a cave pointing an overhanging rock a gloomy forest in the back ground some broken lights and distances on the left and a deep gulf in front the heroine here here the confidante and here the only guardian they dared to trust a faithful mastiff observe these traits behold her with all her native candor and confidence waiting for her expected lover and imagining all his superior qualities of soul while the godlike picture her fancy forms of him and his high deserts beams in her eyes and illuminates her countenance  how shall i pourtray the agony of a heart so pure and unsuspecting when the fearful moment comes is it not an interesting subject   seym a subject of terror horror madness   craig quitting the picture yes madness is one of its principal features  after depicting the dreadful conflict when she hears the perjured seducer is on the eve of marriage with another after showing her in all the agonies of despair imploring at his feet  perhaps at the feet of his mistress    paulina appears to be suddenly struck at this moment with her fathers thought which she must express in action and run precipitately out of the chamber door that leads to the street that this may be perceptible an interruption must be put to the painters description by the embarrassment of seymour who after his exclamation turns away unable to sustain the anguish of mind he feels craig wholly absorbed by his subject seym oh insupportable   craig ay  insupportable indeed to a mind like yours even though but in imagination  what then will you feel when you shall behold a form so lovely so angelic and innocence so unsuspecting deprived of reason confined in a madhouse surrounded by miserable objects straw bread water and merciless keepers who vainly attempt with chains and scourges to expel frenzy   seym peace   craig mr seymour   seym silence i say  proceed no farther if you would not have me act the scenes you mean to paint   craig alarmed i meant    seym forbear exit

his portrait sir greg then you think the men of former ages were guilty of as great vices as those of the present   craig keep your mouth shut  greater but they did not make a system of vice they were hurried into it by their passions theirs were the crimes of men there is a disgraceful a contemptible meanness in the vices as well as the persons of the present puny race and neither their passions nor their bodies have sufficient prowess to make them commit acts that can entitle them to respect   sir greg rises with animation if they fight a duel it is not in the heat of anger and desire of revenge but it is done with as much ceremony and civility as if they were going to walk a minuet or sip a dish of tea ay and as little danger too for as they manage the matter there is ten times more terror in a crabtree cudgel than in lead and steel   craig why as to the merit or virtue of fighting duels either in the old mode or the new i believe we had better not talk of that   sir greg the vestiges of ancient independence are wearing away it makes my very heart ache to see the poor remains of towers that once defied the fury of tyrants and the war of elements lie mouldering in ruins
