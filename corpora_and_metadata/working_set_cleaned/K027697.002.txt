the life and opinions of tristram shandy gentleman      vol ii  the second edition  london printed for r and j dodsley in pall mall mdcclx  the life and opinions of tristram shandy gent chap i i have begun a new book on purpose that i might have room enough to explain the nature of the perplexities in which my uncle toby was involved from the many discourses and interrogations about the siege of namur where he received his wound  i must remind the reader in case he has read the history of king williams wars  but if he has not  i then inform him that one of the most memorable attacks in that siege was that which was made by the english and dutch upon the point of the advanced counterscarp before the gate of st nicolas which enclosed the great sluice or waterstop where the english were terribly exposed to the shot of the counterguard and demibastion of st roch the issue of which hot dispute in three words was this that the dutch lodged themselves upon the counterguard  and that the english made themselves masters of the covered way before st nicolass gate notwithstanding the gallantry of the french officers who exposed themselves upon the glacis sword in hand  as this was the principal attack of which my uncle toby was an eyewitness at namur  the army of the besiegers being cut off by the confluence of the maes and sambre from seeing much of each others operations  my uncle toby was generally more eloquent and particular in his account of it and the many perplexities he was in arose out of the almost insurmountable difficulties he found in telling his story intelligibly and giving such clear ideas of the differences and distinctions between the scarp and counterscarp  the glacis and covered way  the half moon and ravelin  as to make his company fully comprehend where and what he was about  writers themselves are too apt to confound these terms  so that you will the less wonder if in his endeavors to explain them and in opposition to many misconceptions that my uncle toby did often times puzzle his visiters and sometimes himself too  to speak the truth unless the company my father led up stairs were tolerably clearheaded or my uncle toby was in one of his best explanatory moods twas a difficult thing do what he could to keep the discourse free from obscurity  what rendered the account of this affair the more intricate to my uncle toby was this  that in the attack of the counterscarp before the gate of st nicolas extending itself from the bank of the maes quite up to the great waterstop  the ground was cut and crosscut with such a multitude of dykes drains rivulets and sluices on all sides  and he would get so sadly bewildered and set fast amongst them that frequently he could neither get backwards or forwards to save his life and was often times obliged to give up the attack upon that very account only  these perplexing rebuffs gave my uncle toby shandy more perturbations than you would imagine and as my fathers kindness to him was continually dragging up fresh friends and fresh inquirers  he had but a very uneasy task of it  no doubt my uncle toby had great command of himself  and could guard appearances i believe as well as most men  yet any one may imagine that when he could not retreat out of the ravelin without getting into the half moon or get out of the covered way without falling down the counterscarp nor cross the dyke without danger of slipping into the ditch but that he must have fretted and fumed inwardly  he did so  and these little and hourly vexations which may seem trifling and of no account to the man who has not read hippocrates yet whoever has read hippocrates or dr james mackenzie and has considered well the effects which the passions and affections of the mind have upon the digestion  why not of a wound as well as of a dinner  may easily conceive what sharp paroxisms and exacerbations of his wound my uncle toby must have undergone upon that score only   my uncle toby could not philosophize upon it  twas enough he felt it was so  and having sustained the pain and sorrows of it for three months together he was resolved some way or other to extricate himself  he was one morning lying upon his back in his bed the anguish and nature of the wound upon his groin suffering him to lie in no other position when a thought came into his head that if he could purchase such a thing and have it pasted down upon a board as a large map of the fortifications of the town and citadel of namur with its environs it might be a means of giving him ease  i take notice of his desire to have the environs along with the town and citadel for this reason  because my uncle tobys wound was got in one of the traverses about thirty toises from the returning angle of the trench opposite to the salient angle of the demibastion of st roch  so that he was pretty confident he could stick a pin upon the identical spot of ground where he was standing in when the stone struck him  all this succeeded to his wishes and not only freed him from a world of sad explanations but in the end it proved the happy means as you will read of procuring my uncle toby his hobbyhorse  chap ii there is nothing so foolish when you are at the expense of making an entertainment of this kind as to order things so badly as to let your critics and gentry of refined taste run it down nor is there any thing so likely to make them do it as that of leaving them out of the party or what is full as offensive of bestowing your attention upon the rest of your guests in so particular a way as if there was no such thing as a critic by occupation at table   i guard against both for in the first place i have left half a dozen places purposely open for them  and in the next place i pay them all court  gentlemen i kiss your hands  i protest no company could give me half the pleasure  by my soul i am glad to see you  i beg only you will make no strangers of yourselves but sit down without any ceremony and fall on heartily  i said i had left six places and i was upon the point of carrying my complaisance so far as to have left a seventh open for them  and in this very spot i stand on  but being told by a critic though not by occupation  but by nature that i had acquitted myself well enough i shall fill it up directly hoping in the mean time that i shall be able to make a great deal of more room next year   how in the name of wonder could your uncle toby who it seems was a military man and whom you have represented as no fool  be at the same time such a confused puddingheaded muddleheaded fellow as  go look  so sir critic i could have replied but i scorn it  it is language unurbane  and only befitting the man who cannot give clear and satisfactory accounts of things or dive deep enough into the first causes of human ignorance and confusion it is moreover the reply valiant  and therefore i reject it for though it might have suited my uncle tobys character as a soldier excellently well  and had he not accustomed himself in such attacks to whistle the lillabullero  as he wanted no courage it is the very answer he would have given yet it would by no means have done for me you see as plain as can be that i write as a man of erudition  that even my similies my allusions my illustrations my metaphors are erudite  and that i must sustain my character properly and contrast it properly too  else what would become of me why sir i should be undone  at this very moment that i am going here to fill up one place against a critic  i should have made an opening for a couple   therefore i answer thus  pray sir in all the reading which you have ever read did you ever read such a book as lockes essay upon the human understanding  dont answer me rashly  because many i know quote the book who have not read it  and many have read it who understand it not  if either of these is your case as i write to instruct i will tell you in three words what the book is  it is a history  a history of who what where when dont hurry yourself  it is a historybook sir which may possibly recommend it to the world of what passes in a mans own mind and if you will say so much of the book and no more believe me you will cut no contemptible figure in a metaphysic circle  but this by the way  now if you will venture to go along with me and look down into the bottom of this matter it will be found that the cause of obscurity and confusion in the mind of man is threefold  dull organs dear sir in the first place secondly slight and transient impressions made by objects when the said organs are not dull and thirdly a memory like unto a sieve not able to retain what it has received  call down dolly your chambermaid and i will give you my cap and bell along with it if i make not this matter so plain that dolly herself shall understand it as well as malbranch  when dolly has indicted her epistle to robin and has thrust her arm into the bottom of her pocket hanging by her rightside  take that opportunity to recollect that the organs and faculties of perception can by nothing in this world be so aptly typified and explained as by that one thing which dollys hand is in search of  your organs are not so dull that i should inform you  it is an inch sir of red sealwax  when this is melted and dropped upon the letter if dolly fumbles too long for her thimble till the wax is over hardened it will not receive the mark of her thimble from the usual impulse which was wont to imprint it very well if dollys wax for want of better is beeswax or of a temper too soft  though it may receive  it will not hold the impression how hard soever dolly thrusts against it and last of all supposing the wax good and eke the thimble but applied thereto in careless haste as her mistress rings the bell  in any one of these three cases the print left by the thimble will be as unlike the prototype as a brassjack  now you must understand that not one of these was the true cause of the confusion in my uncle tobys discourse and it is for that very reason i enlarge upon them so long after the manner of great physiologists  to show the world what it did not arise from  what it did arise from i have hinted above and a fertile source of obscurity it is  and ever will be  and that is the unsteady uses of words which have perplexed the clearest and most exalted understandings  it is ten to one at arthurs whether you have ever read the literary histories of past ages  if you have  what terrible battles yclept logomachies have they occasioned and perpetuated with so much gall and inkshed  that a good natured man cannot read the accounts of them without tears in his eyes  gentle critic when thou have weighed all this and considered within thyself how much of thy own knowledge discourse and conversation has been pestered and disordered at one time or other by this and this only  what a pudder and racket in councils about  and  and in the schools of the learned about power and about spirit  about essences and about quintessences  about substances and about space  what confusion in greater theaters from words of little meaning and as indeterminate a sense  when thou considers this thou will not wonder at my uncle tobys perplexities  thou will drop a tear of pity upon his scarp and his counterscarp  his glacis and his coveredway  his ravelin and his half moon twas not by ideas  by heaven his life was put in jeopardy by words  chap iii when my uncle toby got his map of namur to his mind he began immediately to apply himself and with the utmost diligence to the study of it for nothing being of more importance to him than his recovery and his recovery depending as you have read upon the passions and affections of his mind it behoved him to take the nicest care to make himself so far master of his subject as to be able to talk upon it without emotion  in a fortnights close and painful application which by the bye did my uncle tobys wound upon his groin no good  he was enabled by the help of some marginal documents at the feet of the elephant together with gobesiuss military architecture and pyroballogy translated from the flemish to form his discourse with passable perspicuity and before he was two full months gone  he was right eloquent upon it and could make not only the attack of the advanced counterscarp with great order  but having by that time gone much deeper into the art than what his first motive made necessary  my uncle toby was able to cross the maes and sambre make diversions as far as vaubans line the abbey of salsines etc and give his visiters as distinct a history of each of their attacks as of that of the gate of st nicolas where he had the honor to receive his wound  but the desire of knowledge like the thirst of riches increases ever with the acquisition of it the more my uncle toby pored over his map the more he took a liking to it  by the same process and electrical assimilation as i told you through which i ween the souls of connoisseurs themselves by long friction and incumbition have the happiness at length to get all bevirtud  bepicturd  bebutterflied and befiddled  the more my uncle toby drank of this sweet fountain of science the greater was the heat and impatience of his thirst so that before the first year of his confinement had well gone round there was scarce a fortified town in italy or flanders of which by one means or other he had not procured a plan reading over as he got them and carefully collating therewith the histories of their sieges their demolitions their improvements and new works all which he would read with that intense application and delight that he would forget himself his wound his confinement his dinner  in the second year my uncle toby purchased ramelli and cataneo translated from the italian  likewise stevinus marolis the chevalier de ville lorini cochorn sheeter the count de pagan the marshal vauban mons blondel with almost as many more books of military architecture as don quixote was found to have of chivalry when the curate and barber invaded his library  toward the beginning of the third year which was in august ninetynine my uncle toby found it necessary to understand a little of projectiles  and having judged it best to draw his knowledge from the fountainhead he began with n tartaglia who it seems was the first man who detected the imposition of a canonballs doing all that mischief under the notion of a right line  this n tartaglia proved to my uncle toby to be an impossible thing   endless is the search of truth  no sooner was my uncle toby satisfied which road the cannonball did not go but he was insensibly led on and resolved in his mind to enquire and find out which road the ball did go for which purpose he was obliged to set off afresh with old maltus and studied him devoutly  he proceeded next to gallileo and torricellius wherein by certain geometrical rules infallibly laid down he found the precise path to be a parabola  or else an hyperbola  and that the parameter or latus rectum of the conic section of the said path was to the quantity and amplitude in a direct ratio as the whole line to the sine of double the angle of incidence formed by the breech upon an horizontal plane  and that the semiparameter  stop my dear uncle toby  stop  go not one foot further into this thorny and bewildered track  intricate are the steps intricate are the mases of this labyrinth intricate are the troubles which the pursuit of this bewitching phantom knowledge will bring upon thee  o my uncle fly  fly  fly from it as from a serpent  is it fit goodnatured man thou should fit up with the wound upon thy groin whole nights baking thy blood with hectic watchings  alas twill exasperate thy symptoms  check thy perspirations  evaporate thy spirits  waste thy animal strength  dry up thy radical moisture  bring thee into a costive habit of body impair thy health  and hasten all the infirmities of thy old age  o my uncle my uncle toby  chap iv i would not give a groat for that mans knowledge in pencraft who does not understand this  that the best plain narrative in the world tacked very close to the last spirited apostrophe to my uncle toby  would have felt both cold and vapid upon the readers palate  therefore i forthwith put an end to the chapter  though i was in the middle of my story   writers of my stamp have one principle in common with painters  where an exact copying makes our pictures less striking we choose the less evil deeming it even more pardonable to trespass against truth than beauty  this is to be understood cum grano salis but be it as it will  as the parallel is made more for the sake of letting the apostrophe cool than any thing else  it is not very material whether upon any other score the reader approves of it or not  in the latter end of the third year my uncle toby perceiving that the parameter and semiparameter of the conic section angered his wound he left off the study of projectiles in a kind of a huff and betook himself to the practical part of fortification only the pleasure of which like a spring held back returned upon him with redoubled force  it was in this year that my uncle began to break in upon the daily regularity of a clean shirt  to dismiss his barber unshaven  and to allow his surgeon scarce time sufficient to dress his wound concerning himself so little about it as not to ask him once in seven times dressing how it went on when lo  all of a sudden for the change was as quick as lightening he began to sigh heavily for his recovery  complained to my father grew impatient with the surgeon  and one morning as he heard his foot coming up stairs he shut up his books and thrust aside his instruments in order to expostulate with him upon the protraction of his cure which he told him might surely have been accomplished at least by that time  he dwelt long upon the miseries he had undergone and the sorrows of his four years melancholy imprisonment  adding that had it not been for the kind looks and fraternal chearings of the best of brothers  he had long since sunk under his misfortunes  my father was by my uncle tobys eloquence brought tears into his eyes  twas unexpected  my uncle toby by nature was not eloquent  it had the greater effect  the surgeon was confounded  not that there wanted grounds for such or greater marks of impatience  but twas unexpected too in the four years he had attended him he had never seen any thing like it in my uncle tobys carriage  he had never once dropped one fretful or discontented word  he had been all patience  all submission   we ose the right of complaining sometimes by forbearing it  but we oftener treble the force  the surgeon was astonished  but much more so when he heard my uncle toby go on and peremptorily insist upon his healing up the wound directly  or sending for monsieur ronjat the kings serjeantsurgeon to do it for him  the desire of life and health is implanted in mans nature  the love of liberty and enlargement is a sisterpassion to it these my uncle toby had in common with his species  and either of them had been sufficient to account for his earnest desire to get well and out of doors  but i have told you before that nothing wrought with our family after the common way  and from the time and manner in which this eager desire showed itself in the present case the penetrating reader will suspect there was some other cause or crotchet for it in my uncle tobys head  there was so and it is the subject of the next chapter to set forth what that cause and crotchet was i own when that is done twill be time to return back to the parlour fireside where we left my uncle toby in the middle of his sentence  chap v when a man gives himself up to the government of a ruling passion  or in other words when his hobbyhorse grows headstrong  farewell cool reason and fair discretion  my uncle tobys wound was near well and as soon as the surgeon recovered his surprise and could get leave to say as much  he told him twas just beginning to incarnate and that if no fresh exfoliation happened which there was no signs of  it would be dried up in five or six weeks the sound of as many olympiads twelve hours before would have conveyed an idea of shorter duration to my uncle tobys mind  the succession of his ideas was now rapid  he broiled with impatience to put his design in execution  and so without consulting further with any soul living  which by the bye i think is right when you are predetermined to take no one souls advice  he privately ordered trim his man to pack up a bundle of lint and dressings and hire a chariot and four to be at the door exactly by twelve oclock that day when he knew my father would be upon change  so leaving a banknote upon the table for the surgeons care of him and a letter of tender thanks for his brothers  he packed up his maps his books of fortification his instruments etc  and by the help of a crutch on one side and trim on the other  my uncle toby embarked for shandyhall  the reason or rather the rise of this sudden demigration was as follows  the table in my uncle tobys room and at which the night before this change happened he was sitting with his maps etc about him  being somewhat of the smallest for that infinity of great and small instruments of knowledge which usually lay crowded upon it  he had the accident in reaching over for his tobaccobox to throw down his compasses and in stooping to take the compasses up with his sleeve he threw down his case of instruments and snuffers  and as the dice took a run against him in his endeavoring to catch the snuffers in falling  he thrust monsieur blondel off the table and count de pagan otop of him  twas to no purpose for a man lame as my uncle toby was to think of redressing all these evils by himself  he rung his bell for his man trim  trim quoth my uncle toby prithee see what confusion i have here been making  i must have some better contrivance trim  can not thou take my rule and measure the length and breadth of this table and then go and bespeak me one as big again  yes an please your honor replied trim making a bow  but i hope your honor will be soon well enough to get down to your country seat where  as your honor takes so much pleasure in fortification we could manage this matter to a t  i must here inform you that this servant of my uncle tobys who went by the name of trim had been a corporal in my uncles own company  his real name was james butler  but having got the nickname of trim in the regiment my uncle toby unless when he happened to be very angry with him would never call him by any other name  the poor fellow had been disabled for the service by a wound on his left knee by a musketbullet at the battle of landen which was two years before the affair of namur  and as the fellow was well beloved in the regiment and a handy fellow into the bargain my uncle toby took him for his servant and of excellent use was he attending my uncle toby in the camp and in his quarters as valet groom barber cook sempster and nurse and indeed from first to last waited upon him and served him with great fidelity and affection  my uncle toby loved the man in return and what attached him more to him still was the similitude of their knowledge  for corporal trim for so for the future i shall call him by four years occasional attention to his masters discourse upon fortified towns and the advantage of prying and peeping continually into his masters plans etc exclusive and besides what he gained hobbyhorsically as a bodyservant non hobbyhorsical per se  had become no mean proficient in the science and was thought by the cook and chambermaid to know as much of the nature of strongholds as my uncle toby himself  i have but one more stroke to give to finish corporal trims character  and it is the only dark line in it  the fellow loved to advise  or rather to hear himself talk his carriage however was so perfectly respectful twas easy to keep him silent when you had him so but set his tongue agoing  you had no hold of him  he was voluble  the eternal interlardings of your honor with the respectfulness of corporal trims manner interceding so strong in behalf of his elocution  that though you might have been incommoded  you could not well be angry my uncle toby was seldom either the one or the other with him  or at least this fault in trim broke no squares with em my uncle toby as i said loved the man  and besides as he ever looked upon a faithful servant  but as a humble friend  he could not bear to stop his mouth  such was corporal trim  if i durst presume continued trim to give your honor my advice and speak my opinion in this matter  thou art welcome trim quoth my uncle toby  speak  speak what thou think upon the subject man without fear why then replied trim not hanging his ears and scratching his head like a country lout but stroking his hair back from his forehead and standing erect as before his division  i think quoth trim advancing his left which was his lame leg a little forwards  and pointing with his right hand open toward a map of dunkirk which was pinned against the hangings  i think quoth corporal trim with humble submission to your honors better judgment  that these ravelins bastions curtins and hornworks make but a poor contemptible fiddle faddle piece of work of it here upon paper compared to what your honor and i could make of it were we in the country by ourselves and had but a rood or a rood and a half of ground to do what we pleased with as summer is coming on continued trim your honor might sit out of doors and give me the nography  call it ichnography quoth my uncle  of the town or citadel your honor was pleased to sit down before  and i will be shot by your honor upon the glacis of it if i did not fortify it to your honors mind  i dare say thou would trim quoth my uncle  for if your honor continued the corporal could but mark me the polygon with its exact lines and angles  that i could do very well quoth my uncle  i would begin with the fosse and if your honor could tell me the proper depth and breadth  i can to a hairs breadth trim replied my uncle  i would throw out the earth upon this hand toward the town for the scarp  and on that hand toward the campaign for the counterscarp  very right trim quoth my uncle toby  and when i had sloped them to your mind  an please your honor i would face the glacis as the finest fortifications are done in flanders with sods  and as your honor knows they should be  and i would make the walls and parapets with sods too  the best engineers call them gazons trim said my uncle toby  whether they are gazons or sods is not much matter replied trim your honor knows they are ten times beyond a facing either of brick or stone  i know they are trim in some respects  quoth my uncle toby nodding his head  for a cannonball enters into the gazon right onwards without bringing any rubbish down with it which might fill the fosse as was the case at st nicolass gate and facilitate the passage over it  your honor understands these matters replied corporal trim better than any officer in his majestys service  but would your honor please to let the bespeaking of the table alone and let us but go into the country i would work under your honors directions like a horse and make fortifications for you something like a tansy with all their batteries saps ditches and palisadoes that it should be worth all the worlds riding twenty miles to go and see it  my uncle toby blushed as red as scarlet as trim went on  but it was not a blush of guilt  of modesty  or of anger  it was a blush of joy  he was fired with corporal trims project and description  trim said my uncle toby thou have said enough  we might begin the campaign continued trim on the very day that his majesty and the allies take the field and demolish them town by town as fast as  trim quoth my uncle toby say no more  your honor continued trim might sit in your armchair pointing to it this fine weather giving me your orders and i would  say no more trim quoth my uncle toby  besides your honor would get not only pleasure and good pastime  but good air and good exercise and good health  and your honors wound would be well in a month thou have said enough trim  quoth my uncle toby putting his hand into his breechespocket  i like thy project mightily  and if your honor pleases i will this moment go and buy a pioneers spade to take down with us and i will bespeak a shovel and a pickax and a couple of  say no more trim quoth my uncle toby leaping up upon one leg quite overcome with rapture  and thrusting a guinea into trims hand  trim said my uncle toby say no more  but go down trim this moment my lad and bring up my supper this instant  trim ran down and brought up his masters supper  to no purpose  trims plan of operation ran so in my uncle tobys head he could not taste it  trim quoth my uncle toby get me tobed  twas all one  corporal trims description had fired his imagination  my uncle toby could not shut his eyes  the more he considered it the more bewitching the scene appeared to him  so that two full hours before daylight he had come to a final determination and had concerted the whole plan of his and corporal trims decampment  my uncle toby had a little neat country house of his own in the village where my fathers estate lay at shandy which had been left him by an old uncle with a small estate of about one hundred pounds a year behind this house and contiguous to it was a kitchengarden of about half an acre  and at the bottom of the garden and cut off from it by a tall yew hedge was a bowlinggreen containing just about as much ground as corporal trim wished for  so that as trim uttered the words a rood and a half of ground to do what they would with  this identical bowlinggreen instantly presented itself and became curiously painted all at once upon the retina of my uncle tobys fancy  which was the physical cause of making him change color or at least of heightening his blush to that immoderate degree i spoke of  never did lover post down to a beloved mistress with more heat and expectation than my uncle toby did to enjoy this selfsame thing in private  i say in private  for it was sheltered from the house as i told you by a tall yew hedge and was covered on the other three sides from mortal sight by rough holly and thickset flowering shrubs  so that the idea of not being seen did not a little contribute to the idea of pleasure preconceived in my uncle tobys mind  vain thought however thick it was planted about  or private soever it might seem  to think dear uncle toby of enjoying a thing which took up a whole rood and a half of ground  and not have it known  how my uncle toby and corporal trim managed this matter  with the history of their campaigns which were no way barren of events  may make no uninteresting underplot in the epitasis and working up of this drama  at present the scene must drop  and change for the parlour fireside  chap vi  what can they be doing brother said my father  i think replied my uncle toby  taking as i told you his pipe from his mouth and striking the ashes out of it as he began his sentence  i think replied he  it would not be amiss brother if we rung the bell  pray what is all that racket over our heads obadiah  quoth my father  my brother and i can scarce hear ourselves speak  sir answered obadiah making a bow toward his leftshoulder  my mistress is taken very badly  and where is susannah running down the garden there as if they were going to ravish her  sir she is running the shortest cut into the town replied obadiah to fetch the old midwife  then saddle a horse quoth my father and do you go directly for dr slop the manmidwife with all our services  and let him know your mistress is fallen into labor  and that i desire he will return with you with all speed  it is very strange says my father addressing himself to my uncle toby as obadiah shut the door  as there is so expert an operator as dr slop so near  that my wife should persist to the very last in this obstinate humor of hers in trusting the life of my child who has had one misfortune already to the ignorance of an old woman  and not only the life of my child brother  but her own life and with it the lives of all the children i might peradventure have begot out of her hereafter  mayhap brother replied my uncle toby my sister does it to save the expense  a puddings end  replied my father  the doctor must be paid the same for inaction as action  if not better  to keep him in temper   then it can be out of nothing in the whole world quoth my uncle toby in the simplicity of his heart  but modesty  my sister i dare say added he does not care to let a man come so near her     i will not say whether my uncle toby had completed the sentence or not  it is for his advantage to suppose he had  as i think he could have added no one word which would have improved it  if on the contrary my uncle toby had not fully arrived at his periods end  then the world stands indebted to the sudden snapping of my fathers tobaccopipe for one of the neatest examples of that ornamental figure in oratory which rhetoricians style the aposiopesis  just heaven how does the poco piu and the poco meno of the italian artists  the insensible more or less determine the precise line of beauty in the sentence as well as in the statue how do the slight touches of the chifel the pencil the pen the fiddlestick et caetera  give the true swell which give the true pleasure  o my countrymen  be nice  be cautious of your language  and never o never let it be forgotten upon what small particles your eloquence and your fame depend   my sister mayhap quoth my uncle toby does not choose to let a man come so near her     make this dash  it is an aposiopesis  take the dash away and write backside  it is bawdy  scratch backside out and put coverdway in  it is a metaphor  and i dare say as fortification ran so much in my uncle tobys head that if he had been left to have added one word to the sentence  that word was it  but whether that was the case or not the case  or whether the snapping of my fathers tobaccopipe so critically happened through accident or anger  will be seen in due time  chap vii though my father was a good natural philosopher  yet he was something of a moral philosopher too for which reason when his tobaccopipe snappd short in the middle  he had nothing to do  as such  but to have taken hold of the two pieces and thrown them gently upon the back of the fire  he did no such thing  he threw them with all the violence in the world  and to give the action still more emphasis  he started up upon both his legs to do it  this looked something like heat  and the manner of his reply to what my uncle toby was saying proved it was so   not choose quoth my father repeating my uncle tobys words to let a man come so near her  by heaven brother toby you would try the patience of a job  and i think i have the plagues of one already without it  why  where  wherein  wherefore  upon what account replied my uncle toby in the utmost astonishment  to think said my father of a man living to your age brother and knowing so little about women  i know nothing at all about them  replied my uncle toby and i think continued he that the shock i received the year after the demolition of dunkirk in my affair with widow wadman  which shock you know i should not have received but from my total ignorance of the sex  has given me just cause to say that i neither know nor do pretend to know any thing about em or their concerns either  methinks brother replied my father you might at least know so much as the right end of a woman from the wrong  it is said in aristotles masterpiece that when a man does think of any thing which is past  he looks down upon the ground  but that when he thinks of something which is to come he looks up toward the heavens  my uncle toby i suppose thought of neither  for he looked horizontally  right end  quoth my uncle toby muttering the two words low to himself and fixing his two eyes insensibly as he muttered them upon a small crevice formed by a bad joint in the chimneypiece  right end of a woman  i declare quoth my uncle i know no more which it is than the man in the moon  and if i was to think continued my uncle toby keeping his eye still fixed upon the bad joint this month together i am sure i should not be able to find it out  then brother toby replied my father i will tell you  every thing in this world continued my father filling a fresh pipe  every thing in this earthly world my dear brother toby has two handles  not always quoth my uncle toby  at least replied my father every one has two hands  which comes to the same thing  now if a man was to sit down cooly and consider within himself the make the shape the construction comatability and convenience of all the parts which constitute the whole of that animal called woman and compare them analogically  i never understood rightly the meaning of that word  quoth my uncle toby  analogy replied my father is the certain relation and agreement which different  here a devil of a rap at the door snappd my fathers definition like his tobacco pipe in two  and at the same time crushed the head of as notable and curious a dissertation as ever was engendered in the womb of speculation  it was some months before my father could get an opportunity to be safely delivered of it  and at this hour it is a thing full as problematical as the subject of the dissertation itself  considering the confusion and distresses of our domestic misadventures which are now coming thick one upon the back of another whether i shall be able to find a place for it in the third volume or not  chap viii it is about an hour and a halfs tolerable good reading since my uncle toby rung the bell when obadiah was ordered to saddle a horse and go for dr slop the manmidwife  so that no one can say with reason that i have not allowed obadiah time enough poetically speaking and considering the emergency too both to go and come  though morally and truly speaking the man perhaps has scarce had time to get on his boots  if the hypercritic will go upon this and is resolved after all to take a pendulum and measure the true distance betwixt the ringing of the bell and the rap at the door  and after finding it to be no more than two minutes thirteen seconds and three fifths  should take upon him to insult over me for such a breach in the unity or rather probability of time  i would remind him that the idea of duration and of its simple modes is got merely from the train and succession of our ideas  and is the true scholastic pendulum  and by which as a scholar i will be tried in this matter  abjuring and detesting the jurisdiction of all other pendulums whatever  i would therefore desire him to consider that it is but poor eight miles from shandyhall to dr slop the man midwifes house  and that whilst obadiah has been going those said miles and back i have brought my uncle toby from namur quite across all flanders into england  that i have had him ill upon my hands near four years  and have since traveled him and corporal trim in a chariot and four a journey of near two hundred miles down into yorkshire  all which put together must have prepared the readers imagination for the entrance of dr slop upon the stage  as much at least i hope as a dance a song or a concerto between the acts  if my hypercritic is intractable  alleging that two minutes and thirteen seconds are no more than two minutes and thirteen seconds  when i have said all i can about them  and that this plea though it might save me dramatically will damn me biographically rendering my book from this very moment a professed romance which before was a book apocryphal  if i am thus pressed  i then put an end to the whole objection and controversy about it all at once  by acquainting him that obadiah had not got above threescore yards from the stableyard before he met with dr slop  and indeed he gave a dirty proof that he had met with him  and was within an ace of giving a tragical one too  imagine to yourself  but this had better begin a new chapter  chap ix imagine to yourself a little squat uncourtly figure of a doctor slop of about four feet and a half perpendicular height with a breadth of back and a sesquipedality of belly which might have done honor to a sergeant in the horseguards  such were the outlines of dr slops figure which  if you have read hogarths analysis of beauty and if you have not i wish you would  you must know may as certainly be caracaturd and conveyed to the mind by three strokes as three hundred  imagine such a one  for such i say were the outlines of dr slops figure coming slowly along foot by foot waddling through the dirt upon the vertebrae of a little diminutive pony  of a pretty color  but of strength  alack  scarce able to have made an amble of it under such a fardel had the roads been in an ambling condition  they were not  imagine to yourself obadiah mounted upon a strong monster of a coachhorse pricked into a full gallop and making all practicable speed the adverse way  pray sir let me interest you a moment in this description  had dr slop beheld obadiah a mile off posting in a narrow lane directly toward him at that monstrous rate  splashing and plunging like a devil through thick and thin as he approached would not such a phenomenon with such a vortex of mud and water moving along with it round its axis  have been a subject of juster apprehension to dr slop in his situation than the worst of whistons comets  to say nothing of the nucleus that is of obadiah and the coachhorse  in my idea the vortex alone of em was enough to have involved and carried if not the doctor at least the doctors pony quite away with it what then do you think must the terror and hydrophobia of dr slop have been when you read which you are just going to do that he was advancing thus warily along toward shandyhall and had approached to within sixty yards of it and within five yards of a sudden turn made by an acute angle of the garden wall  and in the dirtiest part of a dirty lane  when obadiah and his coachhorse turned the corner rapid furious  pop  full upon him  nothing i think in nature can be supposed more terrible than such a rencounter  so imprompt so ill prepared to stand the shock of it as dr slop was  what could dr slop do  he crossed himself  pugh  but the doctor sir was a papist  no matter he had better have kept hold of the pummel he had so  nay as it happened he had better have done nothing at all  for in crossing himself he let go his whip  and in attempting to save his whip betwixt his knee and his saddles skirt as it slipped he lost his stirrup  in losing which he lost his seat  and in the multitude of all these losses which by the bye shows what little advantage there is in crossing the unfortunate doctor lost his presence of mind so that without waiting for obadiahs onset he left his pony to its destiny tumbling off it diagonally something in the style and manner of a pack of wool and without any other consequence from the fall save that of being left as it would have been with the broadest part of him sunk about twelve inches deep in the mire  obadiah pulled off his cap twice to dr slop  once as he was falling  and then again when he saw him seated  illtimed complaisance  had not the fellow better have stopped his horse and got off and helped him  sir he did all that his situation would allow  but the momentum of the coachhorse was so great that obadiah could not do it all at once  he rode in a circle three times round dr slop before he could fully accomplish it any how  and at the last when he did stop his beast twas done with such an explosion of mud that obadiah had better have been a league off in short never was a dr slop so beluted and so transubstantiated since that affair came into fashion  chap x when dr slop entered the backparlour where my father and my uncle toby were discoursing upon the nature of women  it was hard to determine whether dr slops figure or dr slops presence occasioned more surprise to them for as the accident happened so near the house as not to make it worth while for obadiah to remou him  obadiah had led him in as he was unwiped unappointed unanealed with all his stains and blotches on him  he stood like hamlets ghost motionless and speechless for a full minute and a half at the parlour door  obadiah still holding his hand with all the majesty of mud his hinder parts upon which he had received his fall totally besmeared  and in every other part of him blotched over in such a manner with obadiahs explosion that you would have sworn without mental reservation that every grain of it had taken effect  here was a fair opportunity for my uncle toby to have triumphed over my father in his turn  for no mortal who had beheld dr slop in that pickle could have dissented from so much at least of my uncle tobys opinion that mayhap his sister might not care to let such a dr slop come so near her     but it was the argumentum ad hominem and if my uncle toby was not very expert at it you may think he might not care to use it  no the reason was  twas not his nature to insult  dr slops presence at that time was no less problematical than the mode of it though it is certain one moments reflection in my father might have solved it for he had apprized dr slop but the week before that my mother was at her full reckoning and as the doctor had heard nothing since twas natural and very political too in him to have taken a ride to shandyhall as he did merely to see how matters went on  but my fathers mind took unfortunately a wrong turn in the investigation running like the hypercritics altogether upon the ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door  measuring their distance  and keeping his mind so intent upon the operation as to have power to think of nothing else  commonplace infirmity of the greatest mathematicians working with might and main at the demonstration and so wasting all their strength upon it that they have none left in them to draw the corollary to do good with  the ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door struck likewise strong upon the sensorium of my uncle toby  but it excited a very different train of thoughts  the two irreconcilable pulsations instantly brought stevinus the great engineer along with them into my uncle tobys mind  what business stevinus had in this affair  is the greatest problem of all  it shall be solved  but not in the next chapter  chap xi writing when properly managed as you may be sure i think mine is is but a different name for conversation as no one who knows what he is about in good company would venture to talk all  so no author who understands the just boundaries of decorum and good breeding would presume to think all the truest respect which you can pay to the readers understanding is to halve this matter amicably and leave him something to imagine in his turn as well as yourself  for my own part i am eternally paying him compliments of this kind and do all that lies in my power to keep his imagination as busy as my own  it is his turn now  i have given an ample description of dr slops sad overthrow and of his sad appearance in the back parlour  his imagination must now go on with it for a while  let the reader imagine then that dr slop has told his tale  and in what words and with what aggravations his fancy chooses  let him suppose that obadiah has told his tale also and with such rueful looks of affected concern as he thinks will best contrast the two figures as they stand by each other  let him imagine that my father has stepped up stairs to see my mother  and to conclude this work of imagination  let him imagine the doctor washed  rubbed down  condoled with  felicitated  got into a pair of obadiahs pumps stepping forwards toward the door upon the very point of entering upon action  truce  truce good dr slop  stay thy obstetric hand  return it safe into thy bosom to keep it warm  little do thou know what obstacles  little do thou think what hidden causes retard its operation  have thou dr slop  have thou been entrusted with the secret articles of this solemn treaty which has brought thee into this place  art thou aware that at this instant a daughter of lucina is put obstetrically over thy head alas it is too true  besides great son of pilumnus what can thou do  thou have come forth unarmed  thou have left thy tire tete  thy newinvented forceps  thy crotchet  thy squirt and all thy instruments of salvation and deliverance behind thee  by heaven at this moment they are hanging up in a green bays bag betwixt thy two pistols at thy beds head  ring  call  send obadiah back upon the coachhorse to bring them with all speed   make great haste obadiah quoth my father and i will give thee a crown  and quoth my uncle toby i will give him another  chap xii your sudden and unexpected arrival quoth my uncle toby addressing himself to dr slop all three of them sitting down to the fire together as my uncle toby began to speak  instantly brought the great stevinus into my head who you must know is a favorite author with me  then added my father making use of the argument ad crumenam  i will lay twenty guineas to a single crown piece which will serve to give away to obadiah when he gets back that this same stevinus was some engineer or other  or has wrote something or other either directly or indirectly upon the science of fortification  he has so  replied my uncle toby  i knew it said my father  though for the soul of me i cannot see what kind of connection there can be betwixt dr slops sudden coming and a discourse upon fortification  yet i feared it  talk of what we will brother  or let the occasion be never so foreign or unfit for the subject  you are sure to bring it in i would not brother toby continued my father  i declare i would not have my head so full of curtins and hornworks  that i dare say you would not quoth dr slop interrupting him and laughing most immoderately at his pun  dennis the critic could not detest and abhor a pun or the insinuation of a pun more cordially than my father  he would grow testy upon it at any time  but to be broke in upon by one in a serious discourse was as bad he would say as a fillip upon the nose  he saw no difference  sir quoth my uncle toby addressing himself to dr slop  the curtins my brother shandy mentions here have nothing to do with bedsteads  though i know du cange says that bedcurtains in all probability have taken their name from them  nor have the hornworks he speaks of any thing in the world to do with the hornworks of cuckoldom  but the curtin sir is the word we use in fortification for that part of the wall or rampart which lies between the two bastions and joins them  besiegers seldom offer to carry on their attacks directly against the curtin for this reason because they are so well flanked it is the case of other curtins quoth dr slop laughing however continued my uncle toby to make them sure we generally choose to place ravelins before them taking care only to extend them beyond the fosse or ditch  the common men who know very little of fortification confound the ravelin and the half moon together  though they are very different things  not in their figure or construction for we make them exactly aliks in all points  for they always consist of two faces making a salient angle with the gorges not straight but in form of a crescent  where then lies the difference quoth my father a little testily  in their situations answered my uncle toby  for when a ravelin brother stands before the curtin it is a ravelin and when a ravelin stands before a bastion then the ravelin is not a ravelin  it is a half moon  a half moon likewise is a half moon and no more so long as it stands before its bastion  but was it to change place and get before the curtin  twould be no longer a half moon a half moon in that case is not a half moon  it is no more than a ravelin  i think quoth my father that the noble science of defense has its weak sides  as well as others   as for the hornworks high ho sighed my father which continued my uncle toby my brother was speaking of they are a very considerable part of an outwork  they are called by the french engineers ouvrage a corn and we generally make them to cover such places as we suspect to be weaker than the rest  it is formed by two epaulments or demibastions  they are very pretty and if you will take a walk i will engage to show you one well worth your trouble  i own continued my uncle toby when we crown them  they are much stronger but then they are very expensive and take up a great deal of ground so that in my opinion they are most of use to cover or defend the head of a camp otherwise the double tenaille  by the mother who bore us  brother toby quoth my father not able to hold out any longer  you would provoke a saint  here have you got us i know not how not only souse into the middle of the old subject again  but so full is your head of these confounded works that though my wife is this moment in the pains of labor  and you hear her cry out  yet nothing will serve you but to carry off the manmidwife  accoucheur  if you please quoth dr slop  with all my heart replied my father i dont care what they call you  but i wish the whole science of fortification with all its inventors at the devil  it has been the death of thousands  and it will be mine in the end  i would not i would not brother toby have my brains so full of saps mines blinds gabions palisadoes ravelins halfmoons and such trumpery to be proprietor of namur and of all the towns in flanders with it  my uncle toby was a man patient of injuries  not from want of courage  i have told you in the fifth chapter of this second book that he was a man of courage  and will add here that where just occasions presented or called it forth  i know no man under whose arm i would sooner have taken shelter nor did this arise from any insensibility or obtuseness of his intellectual parts  for he felt this insult of my fathers as feelingly as a man could do  but he was of a peaceful placid nature  no jarring element in it  all was mixed up so kindly within him my uncle toby had scarce a heart to retaliate upon a fly   go  says he one day at dinner to an overgrown one which had buzzed about his nose and tormented him cruelly all dinnertime  and which after infinite attempts he had caught at last as it flew by him  i will not hurt thee says my uncle toby rising from his chair and going across the room with the fly in his hand  i will not hurt a hair of thy head  go says he lifting up the sash and opening his hand as he spoke to let it escape  go poor devil get thee gone why should i hurt thee  this world surely is wide enough to hold both thee and me  i was but ten years old when this happened  but whether it was that the action itself was more in unison to my nerves at that age of pity which instantly set my whole frame into one vibration of most pleasurable sensation  or how far the manner and expression of it might go toward it  or in what degree or by what secret magic  a tone of voice and harmony of movement attuned by mercy might find a passage to my heart i know not  this i know that the lesson of universal good will then taught and imprinted by my uncle toby has never since been worn out of my mind and though i would not depreciate what the study of the literae humaniores at the university have done for me in that respect or discredit the other helps of an expensive education bestowed upon me both at home and abroad since  yet i often think that i owe one half of my philanthropy to that one accidental impression  this is to serve for parents and governors instead of a whole volume upon the subject  i could not give the reader this stroke in my uncle tobys picture by the instrument with which i drew the other parts of it  that taking in no more than the mere hobbyhorsical likeness  this is a part of his moral character my father in this patient endurance of wrongs which i mention was very different as the reader must long ago have noted he had a much more acute and quick sensibility of nature attended with a little soreness of temper though this never transported him to any thing which looked like malignancy  yet in the little rubs and vexations of life twas apt to show itself in a drollish and witty kind of peevishness  he was however frank and generous in his nature  at all times open to conviction and in the little ebullitions of this subacid humor toward others but particularly toward my uncle toby whom he truly loved  he would feel more pain ten times told except in the affair of my aunt dinah or where an hypothesis was concerned than what he ever gave  the characters of the two brothers in this view of them reflected light upon each other and appeared with great advantage in this affair which arose about stevinus  i need not tell the reader if he keeps a hobbyhorse  that a mans hobbyhorse is as tender a part as he has about him and that these unprovoked strokes at my uncle tobys could not be unfelt by him  no  as i said above my uncle toby did feel them and very sensibly too  pray sir what said he  how did he behave  oh sir  it was great for as soon as my father had done insulting his hobbyhorse  he turned his head without the least emotion from dr slop to whom he was addressing his discourse and looked up into my fathers face with a countenance spread over with so much good nature  so placid  so fraternal  so inexpressibly tender toward him  it penetrated my father to his heart he rose up hastily from his chair and seizing hold of both my uncle tobys hands as he spoke  brother toby said he  i beg thy pardon  forgive i pray thee this rash humor which my mother gave me  my dear dear brother answered my uncle toby rising up by my fathers help say no more about it  you are heartily welcome had it been ten times as much brother but it is ungenerous replied my father to hurt any man  a brother worse  but to hurt a brother of such gentle manners  so unprovoking  and so unresenting  it is base  by heaven it is cowardly  you are heartily welcome brother quoth my uncle toby  had it been fifty times as much  besides what have i to do my dear toby cried my father either with your amusements or your pleasures unless it was in my power which it is not to increase their measure   brother shandy answered my uncle toby looking wistfully in his face  you are much mistaken in this point  for you do increase my pleasure very much in begetting children for the shandy family at your time of life  but by that sir quoth dr slop mr shandy increases his own  not a jot quoth my father  chap xiii my brother does it quoth my uncle toby out of principle  in a familyway i suppose quoth dr slop  pshaw  said my father  it is not worth talking of  chap xiv at the end of the last chapter my father and my uncle toby were left both standing like brutus and cassius at the close of the scene making up their accounts  as my father spoke the three last words  he sat down  my uncle toby exactly followed his example only that before he took his chair he rung the bell to order corporal trim who was in waiting to step home for stevinus  my uncle tobys house being no further off than the opposite side of the way  some men would have dropped the subject of stevinus  but my uncle toby had no resentment in his heart and he went on with the subject to show my father that he had none  your sudden appearance dr slop quoth my uncle resuming the discourse instantly brought stevinus into my head my father you may be sure did not offer to lay any more wagers upon stevinuss head  because continued my uncle toby the celebrated sailing chariot which belonged to prince maurice and was of such wonderful contrivance and velocity as to carry half a dozen people thirty german miles in i dont know how few minutes  was invented by stevinus that great mathematician and engineer  you might have spared your servant the trouble quoth dr slop as the fellow is lame of going for stevinuss account of it because in my return from leyden through the hague i walked as far as schevling which is two long miles on purpose to take a view of it   that is nothing replied my uncle toby to what the learned peireskius did who walked a matter of five hundred miles reckoning from paris to schevling and from schevling to paris back again in order to see it  and nothing else  some men cannot bear to be outgone  the more fool peireskius replied dr slop but mark twas out of no contempt of peireskius at all  but that peireskiuss indefatigable labor in trudging so far on foot out of love for the sciences reduced the exploit of dr slop in that affair to nothing  the more fool peireskius said he again  why so  replied my father taking his brothers part not only to make reparation as fast as he could for the insult he had given him which sat still upon my fathers mind  but partly that my father began really to interest himself in the discourse  why so  said he why is peireskius or any man else to be abused for an appetite for that or any other morsel of sound knowledge for notwithstanding i know nothing of the chariot in question continued he the inventor of it must have had a very mechanical head and though i cannot guess upon what principles of philosophy he has achieved it  yet certainly his machine has been constructed upon solid ones be they what they will or it could not have answered at the rate my brother mentions  it answered replied my uncle toby as well if not better for as peireskius elegantly expresses it speaking of the velocity of its motion tam citus erat quam erat ventus which unless i have forgot my latin is that it was as swift as the wind itself  but pray dr slop quoth my father interrupting my uncle though not without begging pardon for it at the same time upon what principles was this selfsame chariot set agoing  upon very pretty principles to be sure replied dr slop  and i have often wondered continued he evading the question why none of our gentry who live upon large plains like this of ours  especially they whose wives are not past childbearing attempt nothing of this kind for it would not only be infinitely expeditious upon sudden calls to which the sex is subject  if the wind only served  but would be excellent good husbandry to make use of the winds which cost nothing and which eat nothing rather than horses which the devil take em both cost and eat a great deal  for that very reason replied my father because they cost nothing and because they eat nothing  the scheme is bad  it is the consumption of our products as well as the manufactures of them which gives bread to the hungry circulates trade  brings in money and supports the value of our lands  and though i own if i was a prince i would generously recompense the scientific head which brought forth such contrivances  yet i would as peremptorily suppress the use of them  my father here had got into his element  and was going on as prosperously with his dissertation upon trade as my uncle toby had before upon his of fortification  but to the loss of much sound knowledge the destinies in the morning had decreed that no dissertation of any kind should be spun by my father that day  for as he opened his mouth to begin the next sentence  chap xv in poppd corporal trim with stevinus  but twas too late  all the discourse had been exhausted without him and was running into a new channel   you may take the book home again trim said my uncle toby nodding to him  but prithee corporal quoth my father drolling  look first into it and see if thou can spy aught of a sailing chariot in it  corporal trim by being in the service had learned to obey  and not to remonstrate  so taking the book to a sidetable and running over the leaves an please your honor said trim i can see no such thing  however continued the corporal drolling a little in his turn i will make sure work of it an please your honor  so taking hold of the two covers of the book one in each hand and letting the leaves fall down as he bent the covers back he gave the book a good sound shake  there is something fallen out however said trim an please your honor but it is not a chariot or any thing like one  prithee corporal said my father smiling what is it then  i think answered trim stooping to take it up  it is more like a sermon  for it begins with a text of scripture and the chapter and verse  and then goes on not as a chariot  but like a sermon directly  the company smiled  i cannot conceive how it is possible quoth my uncle toby for such a thing as a sermon to have got into my stevinus  i think it is a sermon replied trim  but if it please your honors as it is a fair hand i will read you a page  for trim you must know loved to hear himself read almost as well as talk  i have ever a strong propensity said my father to look into things which cross my way by such strange fatalities as these  and as we have nothing better to do at least till obadiah gets back i should be obliged to you brother if dr slop has no objection to it to order the corporal to give us a page or two of it  if he is as able to do it as he seems willing an please your honor quoth trim i officiated two whole campaigns in flanders as clerk to the chaplain of the regiment  he can read it quoth my uncle toby as well as i can  trim i assure you was the best scholar in my company and should have had the next halberd but for the poor fellows misfortune corporal trim laid his hand upon his heart and made an humble bow to his master  then laying down his hat upon the floor and taking up the sermon in his left hand in order to have his right at liberty  he advanced nothing doubting into the middle of the room where he could best see and be best seen by his audience  chap xvi  if you have any objection  said my father addressing himself to dr slop not in the least replied dr slop  for it does not appear on which side of the question it is wrote  it may be a composition of a divine of our church as well as yours  so that we run equal risks  it is wrote upon neither side quoth trim for it is only upon conscience an please your honors  trims reason put his audience into good humor  all but dr slop who turning his head about toward trim looked a little angry  begin trim  and read distinctly quoth my father  i will an please your honor replied the corporal making a bow and bespeaking attention with a slight movement of his right hand  chap xvii  but before the corporal begins i must first give you a description of his attitude  otherwise he will naturally stand represented by your imagination in an uneasy posture  stiff  perpendicular  dividing the weight of his body equally upon both legs  his eye fixed as if on duty  his look determined  clinching the sermon in his left hand like his firelock  in a word you would be apt to paint trim as if he was standing in his platoon ready for action  his attitude was as unlike all this as you can conceive  he stood before them with his body swayed and bent forwards just so far as to make an angle of    degrees and a half upon the plain of the horizon  which sound orators to whom i address this know very well to be the true persuasive angle of incidence  in any other angle you may talk and preach  it is certain  and it is done every day  but with what effect  i leave the world to judge  the necessity of this precise angle of    degrees and a half to a mathematical exactness  does it not show us by the way  how the arts and sciences mutually befriend each other  how the duce corporal trim who knew not so much as an acute angle from an obtuse one came to hit it so exactly  or whether it was chance or nature or good sense or imitation etc shall be commented upon in that part of this cyclopaedia of arts and sciences where the instrumental parts of the eloquence of the senate the pulpit the bar the coffeehouse the bedchamber and fireside fall under consideration  he stood  for i repeat it to take the picture of him in at one view with his body swayed and somewhat bent forwards  his rightleg firm under him sustaining seveneighths of his whole weight  the foot of his leftleg the defect of which was no disadvantage to his attitude advanced a little  not laterally nor forwards but in a line betwixt them  his knee bent but that not violently  but so as to fall within the limits of the line of beauty  and i add of the line of science too  for consider it had one eighth part of his body to bear up  so that in this case the position of the leg is determined  because the foot could be no further advanced or the knee more bent than what would allow him mechanically to receive an eighth part of his whole weight under it  and to carry it too  this i recommend to painters  need i add  to orators  i think not for unless they practice it  they must fall upon their noses  so much for corporal trims body and legs  he held the sermon loosely  not carelessly in his left hand raised something above his stomach and detached a little from his breast  his rightarm falling negligently by his side as nature and the laws of gravity ordered it  but with the palm of it open and turned toward his audience ready to aid the sentiment in case it stood in need  corporal trims eyes and the muscles of his face were in full harmony with the other parts of him  he looked frank  unconstrained  something assured  but not bordering upon assurance  let not the critic ask how corporal trim could come by all this i have told him it shall be explained  but so he stood before my father my uncle toby and dr slop  so swayed his body so contrasted his limbs and with such an oratorical sweep throughout the whole figure  a statuary might have modeled from it  nay i doubt whether the oldest fellow of a college  or the hebrew professor himself could have much mended it  trim made a bow and read as follows  the sermon hebrews xiii     for we trust we have a good conscience  trust  trust we have a good conscience  certainly trim quoth my father interrupting him you give that sentence a very improper accent for you curl up your nose man and read it with such a sneering tone as if the parson was going to abuse the apostle  he is an please your honor replied trim pugh said my father smiling  sir quoth dr slop trim is certainly in the right for the writer who i perceive is a protestant by the snappish manner in which he takes up the apostle is certainly going to abuse him  if this treatment of him has not done it already but from whence replied my father have you concluded so soon dr slop that the writer is of our church  for aught i can see yet  he may be of any church  because answered dr slop if he was of ours  he durst no more take such a license  than a bear by his beard  if in our communion sir a man was to insult an apostle  a saint  or even the paring of a saints nail  he would have his eyes scratched out  what by the saint quoth my uncle toby no replied dr slop  he would have an old house over his head pray is the inquisition an ancient building answered my uncle toby or is it a modern one  i know nothing of architecture replied dr slop  an please your honors quoth trim the inquisition is the vilest  prithee spare thy description trim i hate the very name of it said my father  no matter for that answered dr slop  it has its uses for though i am no great advocate for it yet in such a case as this he would soon be taught better manners and i can tell him if he went on at that rate would be flung into the inquisition for his pains god help him then quoth my uncle toby amen added trim for heaven above knows i have a poor brother who has been fourteen years a captive in it  i never heard one word of it before said my uncle toby hastily  how came he there trim  o sir the story will make your heart bleed  as it has made mine a thousand times  but it is too long to be told now  your honor shall hear it from first to last some day when i am working beside you in our fortifications  but the short of the story is this  that my brother tom went over a servant to lisbon  and then married a jews widow who kept a small shop and sold sausages which some how or other was the cause of his being taken in the middle of the night out of his bed where he was lying with his wife and two small children and carried directly to the inquisition where god help him continued trim fetching a sigh from the bottom of his heart  the poor honest lad lies confined at this hour  he was as honest a soul added trim pulling out his handkerchief as ever blood warmed    the tears trickled down trims cheeks faster than he could well wipe them away  a dead silence in the room ensued for some minutes  certain proof of pity  come trim quoth my father after he saw the poor fellows grief had got a little vent  read on  and put this melancholy story out of thy head  i grieve that i interrupted thee  but prithee begin the sermon again  for if the first sentence in it is matter of abuse as thou say i have a great desire to know what kind of provocation the apostle has given  corporal trim wiped his face and returning his handkerchief into his pocket and making a bow as he did it  he began again  the sermon hebrews xiii     for we trust we have a good conscience  trust trust we have a good conscience surely if there is any thing in this life which a man may depend upon and to the knowledge of which he is capable of arriving upon the most indisputable evidence it must be this very thing  whether he has a good conscience or no  i am positive i am right quoth dr slop  if a man thinks at all he cannot well be a stranger to the true state of this account  he must be privy to his own thoughts and desires  he must remember his past pursuits and know certainly the true springs and motives which in general have governed the actions of his life  i defy him without an assistant quoth dr slop  in other matters we may be deceived by false appearances and as the wise man complains hardly do we guess aright at the things that are upon the earth and with labor do we find the things that are before us but here the mind has all the evidence and facts within herself  is conscious of the web she has wove  knows its texture and fineness and the exact share which every passion has had in working upon the several designs which virtue or vice has planned before her  the language is good and i declare trim reads very well quoth my father  now  as conscience is nothing else but the knowledge which the mind has within herself of this and the judgment either of approbation or censure which it unavoidably makes upon the successive actions of our lives it is plain you will say from the very terms of the proposition  whenever this inward testimony goes against a man and he stands selfaccused  that he must necessarily be a guilty man  and on the contrary when the report is favorable on his side and his heart condemns him not  that it is not a matter of trust as the apostle intimates  but a matter of certainty and fact that the conscience is good and that the man must be good also  then the apostle is altogether in the wrong i suppose quoth dr slop and the protestant divine is in the right sir have patience replied my father for i think it will presently appear that st paul and the protestant divine are both of an opinion  as nearly so quoth dr slop as east is to west  but this continued he lifting both hands comes from the liberty of the press  it is no more at the worst replied my uncle toby than the liberty of the pulpit for it does not appear that the sermon is printed or ever likely to be  go on trim quoth my father  at first sight this may seem to be a true state of the case and i make no doubt but the knowledge of right and wrong is so truly impressed upon the mind of man  that did no such thing ever happen as that the conscience of a man by long habits of sin might as the scripture assures it may insensibly become hard  and like some tender parts of his body by much stress and continual hard usage lose by degrees that nice sense and perception with which god and nature endowed it  did this never happen  or was it certain that selflove could never hang the least bias upon the judgment  or that the little interests below could rise up and perplex the faculties of our upper regions and encompass them about with clouds and thick darkness  could no such thing as favor and affection enter this sacred court  did wit disdain to take a bribe in it  or was ashamed to show its face as an advocate for an unwarrantable enjoyment  or lastly were we assured that interest stood always unconcerned whilst the cause was hearing  and that passion never got into the judgment seat and pronounced sentence in the stead of reason which is supposed always to preside and determine upon the case  was this truly so as the objection must suppose  no doubt then the religious and moral state of a man would be exactly what he himself esteemed it  and the guilt or innocence of every mans life could be known in general by no better measure than the degrees of his own approbation and censure  i own in one case whenever a mans conscience does accuse him as it seldom errs on that side that he is guilty and unless in melancholy and hypocondriac cases we may safely pronounce upon it that there is always sufficient grounds for the accusation  but the converse of the proposition will not hold true  namely that whenever there is guilt the conscience must accuse and if it does not that a man is therefore innocent  this is not fact  so that the common consolation which some good christian or other is hourly administering to himself  that he thanks god his mind does not misgive him and that consequently he has a good conscience because he has a quiet one  is fallacious  and as current as the inference is and as infallible as the rule appears at first sight yet when you look nearer to it and try the truth of this rule upon plain facts  you see it liable to so much error from a false application  the principle upon which it goes so often perverted  the whole force of it lost and sometimes so vilely cast away that it is painful to produce the common examples from human life which confirm the account  a man shall be vicious and utterly debauched in his principles  exceptionable in his conduct to the world shall live shameless in the open commission of a sin which no reason or pretense can justify  a sin by which contrary to all the workings of humanity he shall ruin for ever the deluded partner of his guilt  rob her of her best dowry and not only cover her own head with dishonor  but involve a whole virtuous family in shame and sorrow for her sake  surely you will think conscience must lead such a man a troublesome life  he can have no rest night or day from its reproaches  alas conscience had something else to do all this time than break in upon him as elijah reproached the god baal  this domestic god was either talking or pursuing or was in a journey or peradventure he slept and could not be awoke  perhaps he was gone out in company with honor to fight a duel to pay off some debt at play  or dirty annuity the bargain of his lust perhaps conscience all this time was engaged at home talking loud against petty larceny and executing vengeance upon some such puny crimes as his fortune and rank in life secured him against all temptation of committing so that he lives as merrily if he was of our church though quoth dr slop he could not  sleeps as soundly in his bed  and at last meets death as unconcernedly  perhaps much more so than a much better man  all this is impossible with us quoth dr slop turning to my father  the case could not happen in our church  it happens in ours however replied my father but too often  i own quoth dr slop struck a little with my fathers frank acknowledgment  that a man in the romish church may live as badly  but then he cannot easily die so  it is little matter replied my father with an air of indifference  how a rascal dies  i mean answered dr slop he would be denied the benefits of the last sacraments  pray how many have you in all said my uncle toby  for i always forget  seven answered dr slop  humph  said my uncle toby  though not accented as a note of acquiescence  but as an interjection of that particular species of surprise when a man in looking into a drawer finds more of a thing than he expected  humph replied my uncle toby dr slop who had an ear understood my uncle toby as well as if he had wrote a whole volume against the seven sacraments  humph replied dr slop stating my uncle tobys argument over again to him  why sir are there not seven cardinal virtues  seven mortal sins  seven golden candlesticks  seven heavens  it is more than i know replied my uncle toby  are there are not seven wonders of the world  seven days of the creation  seven planets  seven plagues  that there are quoth my father with a most affected gravity but prithee continued he go on with the rest of thy characters trim  another is sordid unmerciful here trim waved his right hand a straithearted selfish wretch incapable either of private friendship or public spirit take notice how he passes by the widow and orphan in their distress and sees all the miseries incident to human life without a sigh or a prayer and please your honors cried trim i think this is a viler man than the other  shall not conscience rise up and sting him on such occasions  no thank god there is no occasion i pay every man his own  i have no fornication to answer to my conscience  no faithless vows or promises to make up  i have debauched no mans wife or child thank god i am not as other men adulterers unjust or even as this libertine who stands before me  a third is crafty and designing in his nature view his whole life  it is nothing but a cunning contexture of dark arts and unequitable subterfuges basely to defeat the true intent of all laws  plain dealing and the safe enjoyment of our several properties  you will see such a one working out a frame of little designs upon the ignorance and perplexities of the poor and needy man  shall raise a fortune upon the inexperience of a youth or the unsuspecting temper of his friend who would have trusted him with his life  when old age comes on and repentance calls him to look back upon this black account and state it over again with his conscience  conscience looks into the statutes at large  finds no express law broken by what he has done  perceives no penalty or forfeiture of goods and chattels incurred  sees no scourge waving over his head or prison opening his gates upon him  what is there to affright his conscience  conscience has got safely entrenched behind the letter of the law sits there invulnerable fortified with cases and reports so strongly on all sides  that it is not preaching can dispossess it of its hold  here corporal trim and my uncle toby exchanged looks with each other  aye  aye trim quoth my uncle toby shaking his head  these are but sorry fortifications trim  o very poor work answered trim to what your honor and i make of it  the character of this last man said dr slop interrupting trim is more detestable than all the rest  and seems to have been taken from some pettifogging lawyer amongst you  amongst us a mans conscience could not possibly continue so long blinded  three times in a year at least he must go to confession will that restore it to sight quoth my uncle toby  go on trim quoth my father or obadiah will have got back before thou have got to the end of thy sermon  it is a very short one replied trim  i wish it was longer quoth my uncle toby for i like it hugely  trim went on  a fourth man shall want even this refuge  shall break through all this ceremony of slow chicane  scorns the doubtful workings of secret plots and cautious trains to bring about his purpose  see the barefaced villain how he cheats lies perjures robs murders  horrid  but indeed much better was not to be expected in the present case  the poor man was in the dark  his priest had got the keeping of his conscience  and all he would let him know of it was that he must believe in the pope  go to mass  cross himself  tell his beads  be a good catholic and that this in all conscience was enough to carry him to heaven what  if he perjures  why  he had a mental reservation in it  but if he is so wicked and abandoned a wretch as you represent him  if he robs  if he stabs  will not conscience on every such act receive a wound itself aye  but the man has carried it to confession  the wound digests there and will do well enough and in a short time be quite healed up by absolution o popery what have thou to answer for  when not content with the too many natural and fatal ways through which the heart of man is every day thus treacherous to itself above all things  thou have wilfully set open this wide gate of deceit before the face of this unwary traveller too apt god knows to go astray of himself and confidently speak peace to himself when there is no peace  of this the common instances which i have drawn out of life are too notorious to require much evidence if any man doubts the reality of them or thinks it impossible for a man to be such a bubble to himself  i must refer him a moment to his own reflections and will then venture to trust my appeal with his own heart  let him consider in how different a degree of detestation numbers of wicked actions stand there though equally bad and vicious in their own natures  he will soon find that such of them as strong inclination and custom have prompted him to commit are generally dressed out and painted with all the false beauties which a soft and a flattering hand can give them  and that the others to which he feels no propensity appear at once naked and deformed surrounded with all the true circumstances of folly and dishonor  when david surprised saul sleeping in the cave and cut off the skirt of his robe  we read his heart smote him for what he had done  but in the matter of uriah where a faithful and gallant servant whom he ought to have loved and honored fell to make way for his lust  where conscience had so much greater reason to take the alarm his heart smote him not a whole year had almost passed from the first commission of that crime to the time nathan was sent to reprove him and we read not once of the least sorrow or compunction of heart which he testified during all that time for what he had done  thus conscience this once able monitor  placed on high as a judge within us and intended by our maker as a just and equitable one too  by an unhappy train of causes and impediments takes often such imperfect cognizance of what passes  does its office so negligently  sometimes so corruptly  that it is not to be trusted alone and therefore we find there is a necessity an absolute necessity of joining another principle with it to aid if not govern its determinations  so that if you would form a just judgment of what is of infinite importance to you not to be misled in  namely in what degree of real merit you stand either as an honest man an useful citizen a faithful subject to your king or a good servant to your god  call in religion and morality  look  what is written in the law of god  how read thou  consult calm reason and the unchangeable obligations of justice and truth  what say they  let conscience determine the matter upon these reports  and then if they heart condemns thee not which is the case the apostle supposes  the rule will be infallible here dr slop fell asleep  thou will have confidence toward god  that is have just grounds to believe the judgment thou have past upon thyself is the judgment of god and nothing else but an anticipation of that righteous sentence which will be pronounced upon thee hereafter by that being to whom thou art finally to give an account of thy actions   blessed is the man indeed then as the author of the book of ecclesiasticus expresses it who is not pricked with the multitude of his sins blessed is the man whose heart has not condemned him whether he be rich or whether he be poor if he have a good heart a heart thus guided and informed he shall at all times rejoice in a cheerful countenance his mind shall tell him more than seven watchmen that sit above upon a tower on high  a tower has no strength quoth my uncle toby unless it is flanked in the darkest doubts it shall conduct him safer than a thousand casuists and give the state he lives in a better security for his behavior than all the clauses and restrictions put together which lawmakers are forced to multiply  forced i say as things stand human laws not being a matter of original choice but of pure necessity brought in to fence against the mischievous effects of those consciences which are no law unto themselves well intending by the many provisions made  that in all such corrupt and misguided cases where principles and the checks of conscience will not make us upright  to supply their force and by the terrors of goals and halters oblige us to it  i see plainly said my father that this sermon has been composed to be preached at the temple  or at some assize  i like the reasoning  and  sorry that dr slop has fallen asleep before the time of his conviction  for it is now clear that the parson as i thought at first never insulted st paul in the least  nor has there been brother the least difference between them  a great matter if they had differed replied my uncle toby  the best friends in the world may differ sometimes  true  brother toby quoth my father shaking hands with him  well fill our pipes brother and then trim shall go on  well  what do thou think of it said my father speaking to corporal trim as he reached his tobaccobox  i think answered the corporal that the seven watchmen upon the tower who i suppose are all sentinels there  are more an please your honor than were necessary  and to go on at that rate would harrass a regiment all to pieces which a commanding officer who loves his men will never do if he can help it because two sentinels added the corporal are as good as twenty  i have been a commanding officer myself in the corpse de guard a hundred times continued trim rising an inch higher in his figure as he spoke  and all the time i had the honor to serve his majesty king william in relieving the most considerable posts i never left more than two in my life  very right trim quoth my uncle toby  but you do not consider trim that the towers in solomons days were not such things as our bastions flanked and defended by other works  this trim was an invention since solomons death nor had they hornworks or ravelins before the curtin in his time  or such a fosse as we make with a cuvette in the middle of it and with coverdways and counterscarps pallisadoed along it to guard against a coup de main  so that the seven men upon the tower were a party i dare say from the corpse de guard set there not only to look out but to defend it  they could be no more an please your honor than a corporals guard  my father smiled inwardly  but not outwardly  the subject between my uncle toby and corporal trim being rather too serious considering what had happened to make a jest of  so putting his pipe into his mouth which he had just lighted  he contented himself with ordering trim to read on he read on as follows  to have the fear of god before our eyes and in our mutual dealings with each other to govern our actions by the eternal measures of right and wrong  the first of these will comprehend the duties of religion  the second those of morality which are so inseparably connected together that you cannot divide these two tables even in imagination though the attempt is often made in practice without breaking and mutually destroying them both  i said the attempt is often made and so it is  there being nothing more common than to see a man who has no sense at all of religion  and indeed has so much honesty as to pretend to none who would take it as the bitterest affront should you but hint at a suspicion of his moral character  or imagine he was not conscientiously just and scrupulous to the uttermost mite  when there is some appearance that it is so  though one is unwilling even to suspect the appearance of so amiable a virtue as moral honesty yet were we to look into the grounds of it in the present case i am persuaded we should find little reason to envy such a one the honor of his motive  let him declaim as pompously as he chooses upon the subject it will be found to rest upon no better foundation than either his interest his pride his ease or some such little and changeable passion as will give us but small dependence upon his actions in matters of great stress  i will illustrate this by an example  i know the banker i deal with or the physician i usually call in there is no need cried dr slop waking to call in any physician in this case to be neither of them men of much religion i hear them make a jest of it every day and treat all its sanctions with so much scorn as to put the matter past doubt well  notwithstanding this i put my fortune into the hands of the one  and what is dearer still to me i trust my life to the honest skill of the other  now let me examine what is my reason for this great confidence  why in the first place i believe there is no probability that either of them will employ the power i put into their hands to my disadvantage  i consider that honesty serves the purposes of this life  i know their success in the world depends upon the fairness of their characters  in a word  i am persuaded that they cannot hurt me without hurting themselves more  but put it otherwise namely that interest lay for once on the other side that a case should happen wherein the one without stain to his reputation could secret my fortune and leave me naked in the world  or that the other could send me out of it and enjoy an estate by my death without dishonor to himself or his art  in this case what hold have i of either of them  religion the strongest of all motives is out of the question  interest the next most powerful motive in the world is strongly against me  what have i left to cast into the opposite scale to balance this temptation  alas i have nothing  nothing but what is lighter than a bubble  i must lay at the mercy of honor or some such capricious principle  strait security for two of my most valuable blessings  my property and my life  as therefore we can have no dependence upon morality without religion  so on the other hand there is nothing better to be expected from religion without morality  nevertheless it is no prodigy to see a man whose real moral character stands very low who yet entertains the highest notion of himself in the light of a religious man  he shall not only be covetous revengeful implacable  but even wanting in points of common honesty yet inasmuch as he talks aloud against the infidelity of the age  is zealous for some points of religion  goes twice a day to church  attends the sacraments  and amuses himself with a few instrumental parts of religion  shall cheat his conscience into a judgment that for this he is a religious man and has discharged truly his duty to god and you will find that such a man through force of this delusion generally looks down with spiritual pride upon every other man who has less affectation of piety  though perhaps ten times more moral honesty than himself   this likewise is a sore evil under the sun and i believe there is no one mistaken principle which for its time has wrought more serious mischiefs  for a general proof of this  examine the history of the romish church  well what can you make of that cried dr slop  see what scenes of cruelty murders rapines bloodshed they may thank their own obstinacy cried dr slop have all been sanctified by a religion not strictly governed by morality  in how many kingdoms of the world here trim kept waving his right hand from the sermon to the extent of his arm returning it backwards and forwards to the conclusion of the paragraph  in how many kingdoms of the world has the crusading sword of this misguided sainterrant spared neither age or merit or sex or condition  and as he fought under the banners of a religion which set him loose from justice and humanity he showed none mercilessly trampled upon both  heard neither the cries of the unfortunate nor pitied their distresses  i have been in many a battle an please your honor quoth trim sighing but never in so melancholy a one as this  i would not have drawn a tricker in it against these poor souls  to have been made a general officer  why what do you understand of the affair said dr slop looking toward trim with something more contempt than the corporals honest heart deserved  what do you know friend about this battle you talk of  i know replied trim that i never refused quarter in my life to any man who cried out for it  but to a woman or a child continued trim before i would level my musket at them i would lose my life a thousand times  here is a crown for thee trim to drink with obadiah tonight quoth my uncle toby and i will give obadiah another too  god bless your honor replied trim  i had rather these poor women and children had it  thou art an honest fellow quoth my uncle toby  my father nodded his head  as much as to say  and so he is   but prithee trim said my father make an end  for i see thou have but a leaf or two left  corporal trim read on  if the testimony of past centuries in this matter is not sufficient  consider at this instant how the votaries of that religion are every day thinking to do service and honor to god by actions which are a dishonor and scandal to themselves  to be convinced of this go with me for a moment into the prisons of the inquisition god help my poor brother tom  behold religion with mercy and justice chained down under her feet  there sitting ghastly upon a black tribunal proppd up with racks and instruments of torment hark  hark what a piteous groan here trims face turned as pale as ashes see the melancholy wretch who uttered it  here the tears began to trickle down just brought forth to undergo the anguish of a mock trial and endure the utmost pains that a studied system of cruelty has been able to invent  dn them all quoth trim his color returning into his face as red as blood  behold this helpless victim delivered up to his tormentors  his body so wasted with sorrow and confinement  oh it is my brother cried poor trim in a most passionate exclamation dropping the sermon upon the ground and clapping his hands together  i fear it is poor tom my fathers and my uncle tobys hearts yearnd with sympathy for the poor fellows distress  even slop himself acknowledged pity for him  why trim said my father this is not a history  it is a sermon thou art reading  prithee begin the sentence again  behold this helpless victim delivered up to his tormentors  his body so wasted with sorrow and confinement you will see every nerve and muscle as it suffers  observe the last movement of that horrid engine i would rather face a cannon quoth trim stamping  see what convulsions it has thrown him into  consider the nature of the posture in which he now lies stretched  what exquisite tortures he endures by it  i hope it is not in portugal  it is all nature can bear good god see how it keeps his weary soul hanging upon his trembling lips  i would not read another line of it quoth trim for all this world  i fear an please your honors all this is in portugal where my poor brother tom is i tell thee trim again quoth my father it is not an historical account  it is a description  it is only a description honest man quoth slop there is not a word of truth in it  that is another story replied my father  however as trim reads it with so much concern  it is cruelty to force him to go on with it  give me hold of the sermon trim  i will finish it for thee and thou may go i must stay and hear it too replied trim if your honor will allow me  though i would not read it myself for a colonels pay  poor trim quoth my uncle toby my father went on    consider the nature of the posture in which he now lies stretched  what exquisite torture he endures by it  it is all nature can bear  good god see how it keeps his weary soul hanging upon his trembling lips  willing to take its leave  but not suffered to depart  behold the unhappy wretch led back to his cell then thank god however quoth trim they have not killed him  see him dragged out of it again to meet the flames and the insults in his last agonies which this principle  this principle that there can be religion without mercy has prepared for him then thank god  he is dead quoth trim  he is out of his pain  and they have done their worst at him  o sirs  hold your peace trim said my father going on with the sermon lest trim should incense dr slop  we shall never have done at this rate  the surest way to try the merit of any disputed notion is to trace down the consequences such a notion has produced and compare them with the spirit of christianity  it is the short and decisive rule which our savior has left us for these and suchlike cases and it is worth a thousand arguments  by their fruits ye shall know them  i will add no further to the length of this sermon than by two or three short and independent rules deducible from it   first whenever a man talks loudly against religion  always suspect that it is not his reason but his passions which have got the better of his creed a bad life and a good belief are disagreeable and troublesome neighbors and where they separate depend upon it it is for no other cause but quietness sake   secondly when a man thus represented tells you in any particular instance  that such a thing goes against his conscience  always believe he means exactly the same thing as when he tells you such a thing goes against his stomach  a present want of appetite being generally the true cause of both  in a word  trust that man in nothing who has not a conscience in every thing  and in your own case remember this plain distinction a mistake in which has ruined thousands  that your conscience is not a law  no god and reason made the law and have placed conscience within you to determine  not like an asiatic cadi according to the ebbs and flows of his own passions  but like a british judge in this land of liberty and good sense who makes no new law but faithfully declares that law which he knows already written  finis thou have read the sermon extremely well trim quoth my father  if he had spared his comments replied dr slop he would have read it much better i should have read it ten times better sir answered trim but that my heart was so full  that was the very reason trim replied my father which has made thee read the sermon as well as thou have done and if the clergy of our church continued my father addressing himself to dr slop would take part in what they deliver as deeply as this poor fellow has done  as their compositions are fine i deny it quoth dr slop i maintain it that the eloquence of our pulpits with such subjects to inflame it  would be a model for the whole world  but alas continued my father and i own it sir with sorrow that like french politicians in this respect what they gain in the cabinet they lose in the field  twere a pity quoth my uncle that this should be lost i like the sermon well replied my father  it is dramatic  and there is something in that way of writing when skilfully managed which catches the attention  we preach much in that way with us said dr slop  i know that very well said my father  but in a tone and manner which disgusted dr slop full as much as his assent simply could have pleased him  but in this added dr slop a little piqued  our sermons have greatly the advantage that we never introduce any character into them below a patriarch or a patriarchs wife or a martyr or a saint  there are some very bad characters in this however said my father and i do not think the sermon a jot the worse for em  but pray quoth my uncle toby  who is can this be  how could it get into my stevinus a man must be as great a conjurer as stevinus said my father to resolve the second question  the first i think is not so difficult  for unless my judgment greatly deceives me  i know the author for it is wrote certainly by the parson of the parish  the similitude of the style and manner of it with those my father constantly had heard preached in his parish church was the ground of his conjecture  proving it as strongly as an argument a priori could prove such a thing to a philosophic mind that it was yoricks and no ones else  it was proved to be so a posteriori the day after when yorick sent a servant to my uncle tobys house to enquire after it  it seems that yorick who was inquisitive after all kinds of knowledge had borrowed stevinus of my uncle toby and had carelessly poppd his sermon as soon as he had made it into the middle of stevinus and by an act of forgetfulness to which he was ever subject he had sent stevinus home and his sermon to keep him company  illfated sermon thou wast lost after this recovery of thee a second time dropped through an unsuspected fissure in thy masters pocket down into a treacherous and a tattered lining  trod deep into the dirt by the left hind foot of his rosinante inhumanly stepping upon thee as thou falledst  buried ten days in the mire  raised up out of it by a beggar sold for a halfpenny to a parishclerk  transferred to his parson  lost for ever to thy own the remainder of his days  nor restored to his restless manes till this very moment that i tell the world the story  can the reader believe that this sermon of yoricks was preached at an assize in the cathedral of york before a thousand witnesses ready to give oath of it by a certain prebendary of that church and actually printed by him when he had done  and within so short a space as two years and three months after yoricks death  yorick indeed was never better served in his life  but it was a little hard to maletreat him after and plunder him after he was laid in his grave  however as the gentleman who did it was in perfect charity with yorick  and in conscious justice printed but a few copies to give away  and that i am told he could moreover have made as good a one himself had he thought fit  i declare i would not have published this anecdote to the world  nor do i publish it with an intent to hurt his character and advancement in the church  i leave that to others  but i find myself impelled by two reasons which i cannot withstand  the first is that in doing justice i may give rest to yoricks ghost  which as the country people  and some others believe  still walks  the second reason is that by laying open this story to the world i gain an opportunity of informing it  that in case the character of parson yorick and this sample of his sermons is liked  that there are now in the possession of the shandy family as many as will make a handsome volume at the worlds service  and much good may they do it  chap xviii obadiah gained the two crowns without dispute for he came in jingling with all the instruments in the green bays bag we spoke of slung across his body just as corporal trim went out of the room  it is now proper i think quoth dr slop clearing up his looks as we are in a condition to be of some service to mrs shandy to send up stairs to know how she goes on  i have ordered answered my father the old midwife to come down to us upon the least difficulty  for you must know dr slop continued my father with a perplexed kind of a smile upon his countenance that by express treaty solemnly ratified between me and my wife you are no more than an auxiliary in this affair  and not so much as that  unless the lean old mother of a midwife above stairs cannot do without you  women have their particular fancies and in points of this nature continued my father where they bear the whole burden and suffer so much acute pain for the advantage of our families and the good of the species  they claim a right of deciding en soveraines in whose hands and in what fashion they choose to undergo it  they are in the right of it  quoth my uncle toby but sir replied dr slop not taking notice of my uncle tobys opinion but turning to my father  they had better govern in other points  and a father of a family who wished its perpetuity in my opinion had better exchange this prerogative with them and give up some other rights in lieu of it  i know not quoth my father answering a little too testily to be quite dispassionate in what he said  i know not quoth he what we have left to give up in lieu of who shall bring our children into the world  unless that  of who shall beget them  one would almost give up any thing replied dr slop  i beg your pardon  answered my uncle toby  sir replied dr slop it would astonish you to know what improvements we have made of late years in all branches of obstetrical knowledge but particularly in that one single point of the safe and expeditious extraction of the foetus  which has received such lights that for my part holding up his hands i declare i wonder how the world has  i wish quoth my uncle toby you had seen what prodigious armies we had in flanders  chap xix i have dropped the curtain over this scene for a minute  to remind you of one thing  and to inform you of another  what i have to inform you comes i own a little out of its due course  for it should have been told a hundred and fifty pages ago but that i foresaw then twould come in pat hereafter and be of more advantage here than elsewhere  writers had need look before them to keep up the spirit and connection of what they have in hand  when these two things are done  the curtain shall be drawn up again and my uncle toby my father and dr slop shall go on with their discourse without any more interruption  first then the matter which i have to remind you of is this  that from the specimens of singularity in my fathers notions in the point of christiannames and that other point previous thereto  you was led i think into an opinion and i am sure i said as much that my father was a gentleman altogether as odd and whimsical in fifty other opinions in truth there was not a stage in the life of man from the very first act of his begetting  down to the lean and slipperd pantaloon in his second childishness but he had some favorite notion to himself springing out of it as skeptical and as far out of the highway of thinking as these two which have been explained   mr shandy my father sir would see nothing in the light in which others placed it  he placed things in his own light  he would weigh nothing in common scales  no  he was too refined a researcher to lay open to so gross an imposition  to come at the exact weight of things in the scientific steelyard the fulcrum he would say should be almost invisible to avoid all friction from popular tenets  without this the minutiae of philosophy which should always turn the balance will have no weight at all  knowledge like matter he would affirm was divisible in infinitum  that the grains and scruples were as much a part of it as the gravitation of the whole world  in a word he would say error was error  no matter where it fell  whether in a fraction  or a pound  twas alike fatal to truth and she was kept down at the bottom of her well as inevitably by a mistake in the dust of a butterflys wing  as in the disk of the sun the moon and all the stars of heaven put together  he would often lament that it was for want of considering this properly and of applying it skilfully to civil matters as well as to speculative truths that so many things in this world were out of joint  that the political arch was giving way  and that the very foundations of our excellent constitution in church and state were so sappd as estimators had reported  you cry out he would say we are a ruined undone people  why he would ask making use of the sorites or fyllogism of zeno and chrysippus without knowing it belonged to them  why why are we a ruined people  because we are corrupted  whence is it dear sir that we are corrupted  because we are needy  our poverty and not our wills consent  and wherefore he would add  are we needy  from the neglect he would answer of our pence and our halfpence  our banknotes sir our guineas  nay our shillings take care of themselves  it is the same he would say throughout the whole circle of the sciences  the great the established points of them are not to be broke in upon  the laws of nature will defend themselves  but error  he would add looking earnestly at my mother  error sir creeps in through the minute holes and small crevices which human nature leaves unguarded  this turn of thinking in my father is what i had to remind you of  the point you are to be informed of and which i have reserved for this place is as follows  amongst the many and excellent reasons with which my father had urged my mother to accept of dr slops assistance preferably to that of the old woman  there was one of a very singular nature which when he had done arguing the matter with her as a christian and came to argue it over again with her as a philosopher he had put his whole strength to depending indeed upon it as his sheet anchor  it failed him though from no defect in the argument itself but that do what he could he was not able for his soul to make her comprehend the drift of it  cursed luck  said he to himself one afternoon as he walked out of the room after he had been stating it for an hour and a half to her to no manner of purpose  cursed luck said he biting his lip as he shut the door  for a man to be master of one of the finest chains of reasoning in nature  and have a wife at the same time with such a headpiece that he cannot hang up a single inference within side of it to save his soul from destruction  this argument though it was entirely lost upon my mother  had more weight with him than all his other arguments joined together  i will therefore endeavor to do it justice  and set it forth with all the perspicuity i am master of  my father set out upon the strength of these two following axioms  first that an ounce of a mans own wit was worth a tun of other peoples and  secondly which by the bye was the groundwork of the first axiom  though it comes last that every mans wit must come from every mans own soul  and no other bodys  now as it was plain to my father that all souls were by nature equal  and that the great difference between the most acute and the most obtuse understanding  was from no original sharpness or bluntness of one thinking substance above or below another  but arose merely from the lucky or unlucky organization of the body in that part where the soul principally took up her residence  he had made it the subject of his enquiry to find out the identical place  now from the best accounts he had been able to get of this matter he was satisfied it could not be where des carts had fixed it upon the top of the pineal gland of the brain which as he philosophised formed a cushion for her about the size of a marrow pea though to speak the truth as so many nerves did terminate all in that one place  twas no bad conjecture  and my father had certainly fallen with that great philosopher plumb into the center of the mistake had it not been for my uncle toby who rescued him out of it by a story he told him of a walloon officer at the battle of landen who had one part of his brain shot away by a musketball  and another part of it taken out after by a french surgeon and after all recovered and did his duty very well without it  if death said my father reasoning with himself is nothing but the separation of the soul from the body  and if it is true that people can walk about and do their business without brains  then certes the soul does not inhabit there q e d  as for that certain very thin subtle and very fragrant juice which coglionissimo borri the great milaneze physician affirms in a letter to bartholine to have discovered in the cellulae of the occipital parts of the cerebellum and which he likewise affirms to be the principal seat of the reasonable soul for you must know in these latter and more enlightened ages there are two souls in every man living  the one according to the great metheglingius being called the animus the other the anima  as for this opinion i say of borri  my father could never subscribe to it by any means the very idea of so noble so refined so immaterial and so exalted a being as the anima or even the animus taking up her residence and sitting dabbling like a tadpole all day long both summer and winter in a puddle  or in a liquid of any kind how thick or thin soever he would say shocked his imagination he would scarce give the doctrine a hearing  what therefore seemed the least liable to objections of any was that the chief sensorium or headquarters of the soul and to which place all intelligences were referred and from whence all her mandates were issued  was in or near the cerebellum  or rather somewhere about the medulla oblongata wherein it was generally agreed by dutch anatomists that all the minute nerves from all the organs of the seven senses concentered like streets and winding alleys into a square  so far there was nothing singular in my fathers opinion  he had the best of philosophers of all ages and climates to go along with him  but here he took a road of his own setting up another shandean hypothesis upon these cornerstones they had laid for him  and which said hypothesis equally stood its ground whether the subtilty and fineness of the soul depended upon the temperature and clearness of the said liquor or of the finer network and texture in the cerebellum itself which opinion he favored  he maintained that next to the due care to be taken in the act of propagation of each individual which required all the thought in the world as it laid the foundation of this incomprehensible contexture in which wit memory fancy eloquence and what is usually meant by the name of good natural parts do consist  that next to this and his christianname which were the two original and most efficacious causes of all  that the third cause or rather what logicians call the causa sine qua non and without which all that was done was of no manner of significance  was the preservation of this delicate and finespun web from the havoc which was generally made in it by the violent compression and crush which the head was made to undergo by the nonsensical method of bringing us into the world by that part foremost   this requires explanation  my father who dipped into all kinds of books upon looking into lithopaedus senonesis de partu difficili the author is here twice mistaken  for lithopaedus should be wrote thus lithopaedii senonensis icon the second mistake is that this lithopaedus is not an author but a drawing of a petrified child the account of this published by albosius    0 may be seen at the end of cordaeuss works in spachius mr tristram shandy has been led into this error either from seeing lithopaeduss name of late in a catalogue of learned writers in dr  or by mistaking lithopaedus for trinecavellius  from the too great similitude of the names  published by adrianus smelvgot had found out that the lax and pliable state of a childs head in parturition the bones of the cranium having no futures at that time was such  that by force of the womans efforts which in strong labourpains was equal upon an average to a weight of   0 pounds averdupoise acting perpendicularly upon it  it so happened that in    instances out of  0 the said head was compressed and molded into the shape of an oblong conical piece of dough such as a pastrycook generally rolls up in order to make a pie of  good god cried my father what havoc and destruction must this make in the infinitely fine and tender texture of the cerebellum  or if there is such a juice as borri pretends  is it not enough to make the clearest liquor in the world both feculent and mothery  but how great was his apprehension when he further understood that this force acting upon the very vertex of the head not only injured the brain itself or cerebrum  but that it necessarily squeezed and propelld the cerebrum toward the cerebellum which was the immediate seat of the understanding  angels and ministers of grace defend us cried my father  can any soul withstand this shock  no wonder the intellectual web is so rent and tattered as we see it and that so many of our best heads are no better than a puzzled skein of silk  all perplexity  all confusion within side  but when my father read on and was let into the secret that when a child was turned topsyturvy which was easy for an operator to do and was extracted by the feet  that instead of the cerebrum being propelld toward the cerebellum the cerebellum on the contrary was propelld simply toward the cerebrum where it could do no manner of hurt  by heavens cried he the world is in a conspiracy to drive out what little wit god has given us  and the professors of the obstetric art are listed into the same conspiracy  what is it to me which end of my son comes foremost into the world provided all goes right after and his cerebellum escapes uncrushed  it is the nature of an hypothesis when once a man has conceived it that it assimilates every thing to itself as proper nourishment and from the first moment of your begetting it it generally grows the stronger by every thing you see hear read or understand this is of great use  when my father was gone with this about a month there was scarce a phenomenon of stupidity or of genius which he could not readily solve by it  it accounted for the eldest son being the greatest blockhead in the family  poor devil he would say  he made way for the capacity of his younger brothers  it unriddled the observation of drivellers and monstrous heads  showing a priori it could not be otherwise  unless     i dont know what it wonderfully explained and accounted for the acumen of the asiatic genius and that sprightlier turn and a more penetrating intuition of minds in warmer climates not from the loose and commonplace solution of a clearer sky and a more perpetual sunshine etc  which for aught he knew might as well rarify and dilute the faculties of the soul into nothing by one extreme  as they are condensed in colder climates by the other  but he traced the affair up to its springhead  showed that in warmer climates nature had laid a lighter tax upon the fairest parts of the creation  their pleasures more  the necessity of their pains less insomuch that the pressure and resistance upon the vertex was so slight that the whole organization of the cerebellum was preserved  nay he did not believe in natural births that so much as a single thread of the network was broke or displaced  so that the soul might just act as she liked  when my father had got so far  what a blaze of light did the accounts of the caesarian section and of the towering geniuses who had come safe into the world by it cast upon this hypothesis here you see he would say there was no injury done to the sensorium  no pressure of the head against the pelvis  no propulsion of the cerebrum toward the cerebellum either by the os pubis on this side or the os coxcygis on that  and pray what were the happy consequences why sir your julius caesar who gave the operation a name  and your hermes trismegistus who was born so before ever the operation had a name  your scipio africanus your manlius torquatus our edward the sixth  who had he lived would have done the same honor to the hypothesis  these and many more who figured high in the annals of fame  all came sideway sir into the world  this incision of the abdomen and uterus ran for six weeks together in my fathers head  he had read and was satisfied that wounds in the epigastrium and those in the matrix were not mortal  so that the belly of the mother might be opened extremely well to give a passage to the child  he mentioned the thing one afternoon to my mother  merely as a matter of fact  but seeing her turn as pale as ashes at the very mention of it as much as the operation flattered his hopes  he thought it as well to say no more of it  contenting himself with admiring  what he thought was to no purpose to propose  this was my father mr shandys hypothesis concerning which i have only to add that my brother bobby did as great honor to it whatever he did to the family as any one of the great heroes we spoke of  for happening not only to be christened as i told you but to be born too when my father was at epsom  being moreover my mothers first child  coming into the world with his head foremost  and turning out afterward a lad of wonderful slow parts  my father spelt all these together into his opinion and as he had failed at one end  he was determined to try the other  this was not to be expected from one of the sisterhood who are not easily to be put out of their way  and was therefore one of my fathers great reasons in favor of a man of science whom he could better deal with  of all men in the world dr slop was the fittest for my fathers purpose  for though his newinvented forceps was the armor he had proved and what he maintained to be the safest instrument of deliverance  yet it seems he had scattered a word or two in his book in favor of the very thing which ran in my fathers fancy  though not with a view to the souls good in extracting by the feet as was my fathers system  but for reasons merely obstetrical  this will account for the coalition betwixt my father and dr slop in the ensuing discourse which went a little hard against my uncle toby  in what manner a plain man with nothing but common sense could bear up against two such allies in science  is hard to conceive  you may conjecture upon it if you please  and whilst your imagination is in motion you may encourage it to go on and discover by what causes and effects in nature it could come to pass that my uncle toby got his modesty by the wound he received upon his groin  you may raise a system to account for the loss of my nose by marriage articles  and show the world how it could happen that i should have the misfortune to be called tristram in opposition to my fathers hypothesis and the wish of the whole family godfathers and godmothers not excepted  these with fifty other points left yet unraveled you may endeavor to solve if you have time  but i tell you beforehand it will be in vain  for not the sage alquise the magician in don belianis of greece nor the no less famous urganda the sorceress his wife were they alive could pretend to come within a league of the truth  the reader will be content to wait for a full explanation of these matters till the next year  when a series of things will be laid open which he little expects  end of the second volume
