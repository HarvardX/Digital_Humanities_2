a letter to   esquire on buonapartes proposals for opening a negotiation for peace in which the britsh guarantee of the crown of france to the house of bourbon contained in the triple and quadruple

what spirit the nominal acts of the city for the year would be directed notwithstanding it appears by the tables of the prices of wheat  by dr adam smith that when the price  to advance war strongly retards that  and in every other case greatly  its rate and that the increase of prices in yrs of scarcity is always greatest in peace on the revisal of this letter i had purposed to give a note on this but a continuation of smiths table having fallen into my hands i judged it useful to enter into the subject at large which i have done in a tract recently published on the depression of the price of corn in war  yet many persons having never examined this irresistible body of evidence hold the contrary and among the advantages of peace number the cheapness of bread the opportunity of an unprecedented dearth was too precious for the engineers of the cabal to fling away they conjoined the continuance of war and the price of bread together affirming the first as they had done on a former occasion to be the cause of the second we may admit a part of those who disclaim the intention of exciting commotion hereby to have done it bona fide but it cannot be doubted to be the object of others and that there are men among them of extensive and curious information whom the real fact has not escaped although it may not have been noted by all  nothing could be more opportune to these republican disciples of the florentine than the french proposition for a general peace  apparent eagerness with which the  rhetoric of buonaparte specifying  seemed to court it a common hall was  and peace petitioned for by exciting the  expectation stated above the error was very general it was calculated that it would operate generally and that the example of the capital would be followed and distract the whole country with riot and petitioning the dexterity of the corsican in this measure has been undoubtedly great all those who before him have possessed themselves of the seat of power for sixteen or eighteen months have obtained acquiescence long enough to give such consolidation to it is heterogeneous foundation as it was capable of barely by professing their readiness to hear propositions of peace  the crafty consul colors the mask higher he puts on the appearance of zealously soliciting it to which he adds in the eyes of those of his new subjects whom he can deceive and the last hope of preservation will deceive even wisdom itself the semblance of resigning the high expectation he may from his talents be reputed to form of the additions to his great military reputation which the continuance of war may procure to him and which may carry him that one step higher which it still remains for him to ascend  in so well studied a mode has he played over again the

at home plays also the cards so well do not think him blind enough to imagine that a general peace can take place with security to his power and consequently to his life they know the example of the romans has been aped and prated about many years by every republican of france and that this alien consul and his political mentor have extracted the whole spirit of the history of that republic for his use  they know he argues thus in the roman republic the reign of purity of private manners was universal even in the turbulent times  gracchi for cicero speaking of the  morals says no one dissolute man was to  in those most exemplary times illis optimis temporibus cum hominum invenire nequam neminem posses orat pro m fonteio c     at that period it appears that the only moral quality from which these republicans derived personal honor as excelling each other was frugality cum in concionem l pisonem gracchus vocari juberet et viator quaereret quem pisonem quod erant plures cogis me inquit dicere inimicum meum frugi  cic ibid  when gracchus ordered piso to be called by name in the assembly and his officer asked of him which of the pisos for there were many of that family you compel me says he to give my enemy the appellation of the frugal    and when this virtue primarily useful to the individual was a source of honorable and popular distinction how prevalent must it have been together with its consequences moderate passions the general case of individuals and contentment in their situations yet with all these preservatives of the wholesome state of the public mind it was corrupted by too strong a portion of the leaven of political equality whereby the constitution of the republic was kept in such a constant intestine motion and fermentation that war abroad was the sole means of securing any peace at home  yet if ever the spirit of universal political equality could subsist without external war or the annihilation of government rome must have held out an example of this possibility its effects seem there to have been so mitigated as to divest it of danger to the utmost degree of which we can form a ption by the exact spirit and habits of subordination the plebeians who had shaken the basis of the state to obtain the capacity of being elected to certain high offices for their whole body as soon as it was acquired refused to raise the most eminent individuals of it to those dignities when the elections came on the most active declaimers and agitators of the tribunicial party solicited the votes of the people in vain they were animated with one sentiment while liberty and dignity were at stake but with another when the cessation of the struggle made way for the operation of uncorrupted judgment  all the military tribunes were created from the patricians  they were content that a plebeian could be legitimately nominated where shall we find now says the historian that modesty that equity that elevation of mind in a single individual which was then the character of the whole people live l   c    and the populace and their leaders seemed willing enough for different reasons to let their acquisition drop into obvion so early as the year after it was obtained for the fathers desired the consulship to which they only were eligible to be restored and they carried their point  the people had lost the inclination of contending to which of the two honors they should elect patricians while the leading plebeians rather chose those elections to take place in which they could not become candidates than those in which they were rejected as unworthy of choice live c    it was at the interval of thirtynine years after and on the occasion of the gross misconduct of two of the patrician military tribunes that the plebeians chose one of their own class in the whole number of those officers which was seven as an exercise of their right live l   c    usurpandi juris causa p lic call ad novum delibandum honorem habitus   while this spirit of practical subordination subsisted which was probably generated as its duration was protracted by the legal relation of patron and client which in rome strongly cemented the plebeian to the patrician order such an exemplary and general power of morals industry and frugality was an insufficient counterpoise to the pernicious effects of one disorganizing principle what therefore is to be expected of a nation whose morals having been long much relaxed has now been systematically taught to hold morality itself in contempt as hostile in many respects to the laws of nature clearly announcing themselves in the voice of morbid passion and appetite the mass of the people there are not rendered easy and contented in their private situations by their frugality and industry on the contrary dissoluteness daily leads an unexampled proportion of them to ruin and has left them nothing but the keen wants of habitual and extreme excess and the inward irritation and shame of guilty poverty goading them to whatever unprincipled resolution subtlety and despair can suggest if foreign war was necessary to provide an outlet for the internal distempered spirit of the one state to preserve any authority to those at the head of it must not that necessity be indefinitely increased in the other and must not a short interval of peace destroy the present form of rule in france together with its rulers  of the perpetual necessity of external war to the roman republic no one can entertain a doubt and the greater necessity of it to france is equally clear but its government has always labored under a compulsion to avoid a general peace of a more imperative nature caused by the impossibility of maintaining the armies on their return home  how fully the directory were sensible of this in the year      will appear by what passed t a conference of its members with the committee of finance they had represented to the latter that if they would suffer  00 millions of livres to be put into their disposition they could obtain a peace the requisition was granted gibert a leading member of the committee and author of its reports says the pretext was false and gives the following account of what passed at a second conference of the same parties when the directory was obliged to go into the reasons which had obstructed a peace taking place they appeared he affirmed to dread it and to fear the return of the army into the interior the committee then said do you dread our defenders what then do you hope have you determined that they shall perish in the enemies country the reply was we have no such thought we wish to see them again and to embrace them but who will maintain them copy of his speech tableau etc de ladministration etc lannee      sir f dlvernois p       the best informed undertakers for the sincerity of buonapartes pacific propositions in this country perfectly know that his situation in this respect is not at all superior to that of the directory whom selfpreservation compelled never to be without a foreign war and it is as manifest to them as to himself that he has fettered himself down to this by a much more rigid necessity arising out of a special act of his own  when the first usurpers bribed their armies fluctuating and almost hostile to them to support them in the war by the promise of that immense donative of a milliard of livres         l sterling to be paid on its termination in the state to which france was then reduced they made the conclusion of a peace impossible to themselves the promise could not be accomplished and they would have paid with their lives for the violation of it however the scythe which has cut down almost annually every thing that is rooted and flourishes in the soil of that violent revolution had swept them all away and their successors seemed in much less danger of having the performance of a promise to which they were not parties exacted on pain of death  but the consul has placed himself in the situation of the first set of rulers in the commotions preceding the revolution of fructidor he was the first commander who engaged his army to declare against the party of the two directors and the majority of the councils the generals of the others followed his example and in the manifestoes of one of them his particular creature transmitted to the government then existing in the name of his soldiers we find the following interrogation put to it where now is the milliard promised to us with so much emphasis when our services were wanted declaration of the army of hoche tableau etc sir f divernois p       thus buonaparte rendered himself instrumental to the revival of this expectation when he wanted to trample underfoot a party which had shown a disposition to call him to account motion of dumolard  and to obtain effect to that expectation the armies by force protected him from an inquiry into his conduct the ground of which i shall hereafter find necessary to state and drove his opponents into exile hence he is conscious that he dares not act contrary to the promise thus chargeable upon him and that it will be impossible for him to fulfill it for the original decree was a sentence by which france was condemned to pay a penalty of fortytwo millions sterling on the return of peace to an inexorable claimant who will hear nothing of abatement or delay a sum not now to be found unburied in that country from which emigration and nonproductive necessity has carried out money every year faster than requisition and plunder has brought it in and for this payment the consul has thus given bond under his hand and seal  if a tumultuous debauched irresistible soldiery could be brought to hear reason he cannot allege to them as the expelled powers might have done that the expectation was not given by us or our friends on our behalf but by our enemies who have most of them perished by your aid in our proscriptions therefore we cannot carry into effect one of their engagements the most destructive to the country in present oppression and future example and the plenitude of power with which the last revolution has invested the grand consul robs him of the excuse that was apparently well founded in the impotence of the illconstructed system last superseded the armies will demand that with the power they have conferred oh him that he will work this impossibility in their behalf  the royalty of france when the country abounded in wealth was swallowed up in the gulf of a deficit this greater gulf must swallow up and destroy any semblance of government and set of governors which succeeds it provisional directorial or consular which shall make peace with all its enemies but if it could be filled up will not the soldiery grown insolent in sharing so rich a prey set up other pretensions to spoil their native country especially any that can be pleaded with the color of equity the donative they will say is an addition to our just wages as soldiers not a discharge of arrears due both for pay and for provision which we have been compelled to purchase or to procure at the hazard of our lives by modes forming no part of the duty of a soldier a demand for these arrears they certainly will not pass over for in the manifesto before me they urge the justice of the claim of ten thousand officers to an adequate provision who have received no other price of their services than their wounds who are now languishing in the inner country without support or help tableau etc p      yet this provision is an object with them far second to their own arrears and certainly occurring to them much later  when acting under the influence of buonaparte they have been taught to press such pretensions on what they held to be the sovereign power of their country will they not assail him with the same whom they look upon to be their creature as holding his power in effect entirely from them he cannot expect any thing else than when the occasion occurs to be attacked by the same combination of armies and to hear the same menaces denounced against him which he thus taught them to employ against others who wished to set their claim to the donative aside and that they will be carried into full execution he dares not to conclude a general peace without money in the treasury to pay the immense arrears of the army and this donative of nearly fortytwo millions the seal to the decrees of the milliard is iron and infrangible and the inscription ingraved round it is the unalterable destiny of the republic meurs ou tue destroy or perish corneille le cid a   sc     hence the consul knows that the conclusion of a general peace must be followed by his fall from his elevation and that his tenure of life and of power must terminate together he offers therefore what it is impossible for him to be determined to carry into effect in case that offer were accepted  it is thus this vice of rulers this cutpurse of an empire reasons and thus it is well known by many at least of those who maintain the sincerity of his desire for peace with the greatest perverted ability that he of necessity must reason he has not hitherto succeeded any where in his overtures and those who second him here have prevailed no farther than to obtain a declaration from the capital in their expectation that it would be a general example to the country they have notoriously failed  but the remoteness of harvest and the alarming prospect even of a still higher price of food before we can be relieved by it is such that many months of danger remain for us and of expectation for them in which they flatter themselves petitions will be heaped on petitions the promoters of them are divided into two parties one which knows it can have at no future time any access to power but by strange means in the present singular calamity hopes to obtain it from an effective although not nominal coercion of an excellent parliament while the other to which the first always affords a solicitous protection flatters itself with a general insurrection in consequence of the expected firmness of that assembly and by the cry of peace bread to involve us in sanguinary civil wars and desolation  the friends of their country then are to look forward that every possible attempt will be made by the two parties in conjunction by propagating fallacies more or less artful to convert the constitutional franchise of petitioning to the one or the other of those purposes i here give an abstract of the other leading topics which will be employed by them on this occasion previous to the demonstration of their fallacy  the sole purpose of the continuation of the war on our parts these demagogues will contend is the restoration of the monarchy of france for this the blood and treasure of this kingdom is to be still further exhausted a sacrifice which we are called to make by no obligation for which no british interest can be pretended for what interest of ours can be served by restoring to power a family whose inveterate and we may call it perfidious hostility to these kingdoms has involved us in all the wars of the last century and the burdens they have brought upon us  this calamitous struggle has already been too long protracted by the most futile of all pretensions that the rulers of france have been always incapable of maintaining the relations of amity with other nations a position refuted by the real friends of their country the friends of her peace and prosperity as often as it has been advanced there may have indeed been a period when the indignation of overweening prosperity might have made that people daily insulted with this language repulse overtures which they had done better to have attended to but if any suspicion of extraordinary infidelity to their engagement might then have been entertained nothing of that kind can attach to the repeated propositions of buonaparte nothing hostile or faithless can be supposed to be covered under them he knows the mode of succeeding against the most formidable enemies with what is called glory and is even supposed too much attached to it he cannot therefore prefer attaining the same end by means which must cover him with infamy  the leading propositions i shall take in the order i have placed them the first is that this kingdom is neither interested in the restoration of the house of bourbon or under any obligation to assist therein by war  those who are reduced to give up the second part of the proposition will not all of them afterward offer such an insult to the national morality as to make any stand upon the first this will induce me to be most particular in my observations upon it  the moralists tell us that there is the same moral relation between one people and another as between man and man that it is a national crime to plead interest against an express specific national compact when the casus foederis takes place and that the crime is much aggravated when the article of the compact is matter of special moral obligation antecedent to the formal agreement as for instance when one nation having received a high benefit from another binds itself by a written compact in case of necessity to return that benefit and it is by such an obligation that we were bound at the commencement of the war to assist by arms in the restoration of the house of bourbon no extreme necessity moral or physical restraining us  nothing can be more clear than that we are under an express obligation of this kind this i will first show and afterward that it is of the higher or moral nature described  by the second article of the last definitive treaty with france dated september        the triple alliance of the hague of      and the quadruple alliance of london      with other treaties therein specified are declared to serve as the basis of that treaty and for this purpose they were both renewed and confirmed in the best form new annual register      public papers p      these treaties therefore were in full force when the unfortunate louis xvi was formally deposed the protestant succession to the throne of great britain and that of france in the descendants of the french branch of the house of bourbon had been recognized by the sovereigns of the two kingdoms mutually at the treaty of utrecht but by the seventh article of the triple alliance of      it is stipulated that if the kingdoms of france or england be disturbed by intestine quarrels or by rebellions on account of the said successions or under any other pretense whatever the ally thus in trouble shall have full right to demand the succors therein abovementioned that is to say france or england was to furnish  000 foot and  000 horse each to the other on such demand and by the fourth article of the quadruple alliance signed in      to which england france holland and the emperor were parties england and the two other powers promise to guarantee and defend the right of succession to the kingdom of france mr burkes three memorials on french affairs appendix note by editor the letter writer has long expected a much more important discussion of these articles than he is able to give but as he looks upon the occasion of it to be gone by he applies them to a still remaining use against all persons whatsoever who may presume to disturb the order of the said succession  thus at the last treaty of peace with a king of france and subsisting at the time of his deposition we renewed and confirmed in the best form a specific engagement to succor him on demand with a force of  0000 men against all rebellions excited under any pretense whatsoever a right to which aid by our act remained in him as long as the treaty subsisted and his helpless situation cut off from the possibibility of appealing to the faith then given him was the most solemn of demands but i now proceed to the second point and shall show that without special compact this aid was a debt from this country to that unfortunate monarch and therefore not having been discharged remains exigible by his heir whenever it can be effectively paid to him  in order to this i must state some important transactions which took place in an early part of the long reign of the immediate predecessor of louis xvi on which this moral obligation was founded at the accession of the house of hanover the eyes of a great party of the kingdom were not opened to the brilliant fortune it was destined to under the new dynasty they did not foresee the future progress of our power opulence and commerce the uninterrupted and exclusive reign of law and the stability it would give to our constitution of government which during the whole of the preceding age had been repeatedly and alternately in the hazard of being lost in arbitrary monarchy or an anarchial democracy the partisans of an illegal claimant were so numerous as to endanger the hanoverian succession and the vigorous interposition of a foreign power might have turned the balance in their favor established a foreign interest in our councils and annexed a foreign dependence to the crown  louis xiv from political and other motives was deeply engaged in the interests of the pretender by his death which soon followed that of queen anne the regency during the minority of his successor devolved on his brother the duke of orleans who adopted a new system of politics and had already entered into engagements with the king of great britain before the breaking out of the rebellion in      he appears indeed for a time to have concealed the short turn he had caused the system of the french cabinet to take and instead of assisting the pretender he amused his agents with vague declarations calculated to frustrate the expedition univ hist v  0 p     england preparing at the kings death  after its failure there were many who otherwise wished well to the stuart line yet were averse to its being placed on the throne by a power of the romish religion but who would with great alacrity have acted in its favor if they had seen it is cause supported in the kingdom by an army of foreign protestants conducted by a good leader george the first had incurred the implacable resentments of charles the   th the greatest and most enterprising general of his age he had also incensed peter the great they sacrificed their rivality to dethrone him and by the assistance of peter charles was to have attempted this at the head of a formidable protestant force  his minister the baron goertz who had brought about this singular reconciliation and associated cardinal alberoni in the conspiracy went to the hague to further its progress and gyllenburgh the swedish ambassador at london carried on the plot with the disaffected here every thing seemed to promise a successful issue to it when it was discovered by the regent of france voltaires life of charles the   th  who sent such intelligence of it to our court as occasioned the arrest of gyllenburgh here and of goertz in holland univer hist of sweden v  0 p      the latter on his liberation in      strengthened the resentments and connection of charles and the czar against this country by the aid of the regent the first design had been baffled but the danger still remaining was formidable against this france further concurred in guarding us by entering into the treaty called the triple alliance wherein was stipulated with what force the kings of england and france should aid each other in case of a rebellion in the dominion of either by the terms of the treaty the advantage to each seems mutual but the circumstances of the period considered when no danger menaced the throne of france and that of the hanoverian family in england was assailed by a strong domestic faction and the coalition of the two most able sovereigns who have reigned in europe in the present century the benefit of this mutual guarantee was entirely on our side  the quadruple alliance binding us to the support of the king of france in case of rebellion was signed in the following year      in which the connection between charles and peter had been further strengthened by the conferences at ahland  it is proper to add here that the solemn adoption of the whole of both the treaties in that subsisting with the unfortunate louis strictly obliged us at the time of his deposition and imprisonment to have concurred with the stipulated force in any attempt for his preservation and restoration or placing his successor upon the throne after he was murdered and as far forth as the object convention of pilnitz was to maintain the guarantee of the house of austria entered into in      and to protect the person and family of the sovereign in france from danger then adequately manifest so far forth we by the spirit of those articles were obliged to have concurred openly in its object if unrestricted by a necessity which shall be afterward spoken of  and on that treaty itself it is to be remarked that the faction which finally deposed the king had attained considerable strength at the time it was made and its objects were not indistinctly foreseen hence the emperor being by the quadruple alliance obliged to take arms to succor the king on an actual attack the spirit of his obligation called upon him to keep his preparations in the same state of forwardness as those of the conspirators he was also in full right to form alliances for that purpose as was the king of prussia to enter into a league with him to enable him to fulfill any moral obligation and the execution of every initially just treaty is such  these treaties were in terms equal as preserving to each sovereign the honorable appearance of being seated with an equal stability on his throne in effect they bound france to the support of the hanoverian family at first certainly not firmly established here and at that particular juncture in much additional hazard and britain to the support of the crown of france seemingly in the firmest security this obligation as undertaken spontaneously was almost a nudum pactum and conventional only upon the latter whereas on the side of britain it is conventional and moral and this nation thereby came under a moral obligation to give to the prince reigning in france the same support the king of great britain had received the circumstances being the same that is to aid him against all rebels during the time of peace for it is dormant from its nature in every war and revives on its termination during a war the assistance of a hostile power cannot be called in to aid a king against his rebels the obligation by compact is also dormant in war otherwise there would be no necessity that it should be renewed at the conclusion of peace as it was by the treaty of      art    it was therefore in force in the year      when louis was deposed and not having been discharged to him is yet due to his heirs  but the affirmation of a moral obligation existing in this case will be met by an objection derived from the support that unfortunate prince was induced to give in the time of full peace to the revolted colonies and his commencing a war for that purpose here it will be urged that by giving aid to a rebellion against the family on the throne he by his own act cancelled that obligation as to himself the objection might at first fight be thought to have it is convenience to those who have contended for a declaration from this country against all future aid to the restoration of the french monarchy but unfortunately for them their most avowed principles preclude them from the use of it they maintain the resistance of america to have been justifiable and therefore no rebellion which is always as the term imports an unjustifiable resistance and where no rebellion took place none was supported hence they must admit that if such obligation existed before the french interposition it is not in the least invalidated since to the whig club therefore and its factious supporters i present the following alternative for their choice was the resistance in america a rebellion or justifiable if you say a rebellion then your principles by your own confession lead to rebellion and civil war if you say it was justifiable or no rebellion then it remained matter of moral obligation to have given aid to the late king of france after he had given his assent to a constitution which you have declared to be the most stupendous and glorious edifice of liberty which had been erected on the foundation of human integrity in any time or country dod ann reg      p      for you must admit that it was a rebellion which drove him from the throne this constitution had erected and placed him upon into a prison and then buried the throne itself beneath the ruins of this most stupendous and glorious edifice of liberty or you must deny the possibility of committing the crime of rebellion  the great body of those who affirm the resistance of the colonies to britain to have been a rebellion are in fact adverse to a declaration on our parts against all future aid to the restoration however it may be proper to inquire how far the point here maintained is affected by admitting their affirmation and here the quality of the interposition of france in favor of the insurgents is to be examined as it must be granted to have modified although not annihilated the moral obligation arising from the assistance of france to the house of hanover in the most difficult times the object of this rebellion was not to take a throne from an august family on which the house of bourbon had been very serviceable in establishing it but to cut off from its dominions a remote and illconnected province of great magnitude indeed but the goitre of the empire from which with a true alpine absurdity we boasted that it derived both ornament and strength  an error common to our rivals also our prior obligation as it was exclusively founded on those friendly acts stated above was to defend the king of france against a rebellion in the time of peace the object of which was either to deprive him of his crown or such a one as should be set on foot to wrest a single province from him the latter he cancelled by his act whether he was influenced or uninfluenced in it the case is the same that part of the obligation he did away but the former to defend him against all rebellions to depose him remained  but the treaties with france furnish us with further matter of comment not to be passed over the principle that we are not bound to assist the house of bourbon has been here examined and refuted because it is a topic to which recourse is had to obtain petitions of a dangerous tendency it also strictly applies to the ultimate object of this letter to show from those treaties that the common end of one party who will actively push for petitions the bringing of mr fox and his attached phalanx into power is in a high degree dangerous and dishonorable to this kingdom as he maintains that this country ought to have made no efforts to restore the king and the monarchy of france and concurs with those who move us to declare that we ought to disavow all intention of continuing the war a day for that purpose  the articles of no treaty ever underwent a more thorough parliamentary examination than that of      and this position is substantiated by the part he took therein the question on the preliminaries was a trial of strength between two great parties for the possession of the whole government which it was expected would prove decisive i am not disposed to defend them as either adequate or honorable their defects were examined with the greatest attention  the declarations of the rockingham party when the vote of censure was passed by the commons on the articles are to be regarded as those of mr fox leaving what their new allies spoke on the subject out of the question because by the interposition of mr burke he was become the leader of that party there and every greater ground of objection brought forward against them was of course selected by him or by others who consulted with him yet no exception was then taken as appears by the account of the debate i have before me against the article renewing the former obligation of great britain to assist the king of france against all rebellion now effectively proposed to be renounced it was not even mentioned in the debate on the preliminaries the censure of them was brought forward by lord john cavendish in five resolutions which before they were offered to the house had been certainly approved by that party of which mr f was the head by the first of these which was adopted without contest it was declared that in consideration of public faith which ought to be preserved inviolable his faithful commons will support his majesty in rendering firm and permanent the peace to be concluded definitively in consequence of the preliminary articles new ann reg      hist p     a resolution which passed without a dissenting voice and mr fox spoke in favor of all of them collectively when the previous address of thanks to his majesty was debated on the preliminaries being first laid before the commons lord john c had also moved them to declare that whatever the sentiments of the commons might be on the terms of pacification they beg leave to assure his majesty of their firm and unalterable resolution to adhere inviolably to the several articles for which the public faith is pledged ibid p     and mr fox and most of those who now with him contend that we never ought to have endeavored to fulfill the obligations of the second article gave an unqualified support to these declarations  we read in grotius that treaties being made by the supreme power in that behalf lawfully acknowledged by the people the infraction of their articles exposes a nation to the divine wrath de jur l   c    s      our constitution places that power in an hereditary king and his engagement alone would in any supposable case bind us to every article of a treaty even if parliament be silent i may ask mr fox and the elder members of the phalanx whether the added promise of the people which their recommendations contributed so far to procure to be given by those who alone can lawfully and bindingly speak for them their representatives annihilates the obligation which would arise out of their very silence does the completest declaration of a great nations taking upon itself an obligation that it is in its nature able to make cancel its articles  these declarations of the party of which mr fox was the head might be very well regarded as his own had we not a specific avowal of assent to the substance of them from himself when he laid the definitive treaty before the commons conceived even in stronger terms he contended in his speech on that occasion that there were considerable improvements made in the preliminaries and in proof of this entered into his own exceptions against them here we find no reprobation of the article renewing the obligation of each country to aid with a certain force the king of the other in case of a rebellion on any pretense whatever he came likewise into the examination of the demerits of the treaty apparently better prepared than any of the leaders even of his own party except mr sheridan for mr f himself had drawn up an original project and transmitted it to mr grenville the first time he was in the cabinet as appears by the joint declarations of both new ann reg      hist p         and it is to be supposed that his project itself according to every precedent of a treaty in the last seventy years contained this compact for as there was nothing apparently unequal in it so there was nothing dishonorable to this country and perhaps according to appearances the balance of its probable expedience must have seemed to mr fox to be on his and our side for when he was in power he was hardly without his apprehensions of a principle he had brought forward in parliament in      that it is not only legal but laudable for the people of this country to appoint delegates to reside in the metropolis to watch the conduct of their representatives new ann reg      p      that is to appoint a permanent convention this right also was declared to include necessarily the right of establishing associations and committees of correspondence ib p          throughout the kingdom at large and the stability of the throne of france was not then menaced by the society naming themselves the friends of the constitution moores journal vol   p   0  which since from their place of meeting at paris the convent of the jacobins have had a different name given them who also at first incorporated themselves ib p     to watch over the general interests of liberty only not over the whole conduct of their representatives the more extensive object of mr fs delegates these copyists also established similar associations and a regular correspondence with them all over france moores journal p       thus we see no hostility on the part of mr fox or of those who then acted and still continue to act with him to the reciprocal guarantee of the succession of the two crowns on the contrary there arises a strong presumption that it was entered into with his total approbation from his apprehension of the effect this fourth power which he had been desirous of wedging into the very summit of the arch of the constitution might have on those of the crown the perpetual administration of which he is supposed soon after to have grasped at by strange means well colored over in power he wished to guard himself against the discharge and battery of his own engine and was willing to provide himself beforehand with aid from any quarter whence it might be obtained  i place not here in too strong a light the danger of those distempered times before mr foxs coming into the cabinet when the worst schemes received his most decided patronage and in proof of this i will give you some traits of the description of them transmitted to us by one who lived and acted a great part in that period and was in much confidence even with the principal agitators a great statesman always temperately wise in his measures and who in a life of active service to his country which bloated blundering arrogance joined with impotent malignity drove him to write the apology of boasted of his being able to prevent this cloud bursting out into a hurricane as one of his best services to the state i mean the late mr burke  he describes this time as one of the most critical periods in our annals there was a dreadful fermentation wild and savage insurrection quitted the woods and prowled about our streets in the name of reform other projects exactly coincident with this struck at the very existence of the kingdom under any constitution there are who remember the blind fury of some and the lamentable helplessness of others at the same time a sort of national convention sat with a kind of superintendance over parliament and little less than dictated to it and had the portentous comet of the rights of man then crossed upon us in that internal state of england nothing could have prevented our being irresistibly hurried like a planet out of the highway of heaven into all the vices crimes horrors and miseries of the french revolution letter to a noble lord p            mr fox when he was in power probably entertained serious apprehensions from the explosion of these prepared inflammable materials to the accumulation of which he had contributed so much and thence came to wish for the reciprocal guarantee thinking that after the court of france had effected one democratic revolution on the other side of the atlantic which had made a considerable impression on the minds of its subjects at home that power would willingly concur with her real aid to prevent the greater danger which might assail her from the example of a second breaking out at her own door  let us now grant that he condemned the mutual guarantee that he even went so far as to use endeavors to have it omitted in the definitive treaty and that he failed therein although he was able in many other articles to improve on the preliminaries yet neither he nor any of his present maniple of a phalanx then acting with him can pretend that it was not of entire obligation and by his act in which they cordially joined after the rebellion of the tenth of august for he declared and with much justice when the definitive treaty came under debate on a comparison of the articles we had been engaged to with our resources and those of our late enemies that the faith of the nation was now taken against the state of the country and this in his apprehension was a consideration of so much weight that now the business was concluded he would not hesitate to say that committed as the public faith had been by the preliminary articles he would have concluded the definitive treaty upon the basis of them if the ministers of the other belligerent powers had thought proper to adhere to their letter new ann reg      hist p      what will be said of the character of that nation where positions contrary to the faith of treaties and moral obligation are not only supported in senates but senates come to decree upon them are the articles of those compacts which sheath the sword of war and end the calamities of three quarters of the habitable globe of no obligation or is that of the obnoxious article the reciprocal guarantee cancelled because if it could have been acted upon with effect in time past it would have prevented the most atrocious scene of crimes and the most dreadful calamities that in latter ages have visited the world or if in future we may be able so to act upon it because it presents the best hope of that recovery from these afflictions a future generation may rejoice in but we shall never see  grant that the violation of treaties is common that is has been so frequent as to have been one of the most terrible scourges to human kind does mr fox contend that there should be one more added to the number in the mouth of any man the scorn of that important part of the code of morals which binds nation to nation would have covered him with disgrace but such a mans offense will not nearly approach the rankness of his it exhibits a contempt of honest political reputation of which there are few parallels indeed in the history of this kingdom  for the reciprocal guarantee being now considered as one of the articles which he regarded as disadvantageous at the signature of the treaty it must be further asked did he not come forward and tell the body of the nation through their representatives that there were bad articles in the treaty but that the public faith was pledged upon them and if worse had been insisted on that faith was so committed it must have been definitively given even to those but mr fox was in office when the definitive treaty was concluded he is therefore pledged personally to endeavor to the utmost that its letter and spirit should be carried into effect and he was not only in office but he tells us it was concluded by himself see p    l   extract of his speech  it was then by his council that the faith and signature of his sovereign were given to it and now he seeks and has all along sought to make use of the force of parliament as an engine to offer violence to the conscience of his king rightly or wrongly implicated by his own advice representing also the preliminaries as disadvantageous he caused the whole nation by a singular resolution to engage its faith to the performance of them even as such by their representatives and now he calls upon us in the same mode gratuitously i have not heard that the consul has insisted previous to entering into a negotiation with us that the parliament shall declare that this nation ought not to aid the house of bourbon if the war should continue according to the guarantee to declare we will break that very faith he recommended us to engage and which the history of the day informs us was unanimously given did he know or did he not know the guarantee he brought the nation into by renewing the triple and quadruple alliances if he was informed of it was there ever a more frontless dereliction of principle and of a principle he himself has talked so highly of than is contained in his recent declarations and those he has been making ever since the war if he really was ignorant of it was there ever a more criminal neglect of public care and duty in a minister in neither case can such a man be elevated to power again without extreme danger and dishonor to the kingdom and this elevation is the declared object of his party for exciting the movements which at this distempered time agitate the nation  that he should maintain our most solemn national engagements to foreign powers to bind us no longer than it is our interest to adhere to them is perfectly consonant as to its spirit to what he has laid down in parliament that individuals may enter into engagements respecting the public injurious to its interest to avoid pecuniary losses and consequently for pecuniary gain  he has before been charged with this by some writers but as it is wanted in proof here the heads of the evidence shall be repeated in the debate on the associations entered into in      for the prosecution of seditious libels he expressed his doubts of their legality but the purposes to which they were employed he represented as execrable he affirmed that they were then made the instruments of tyranny over mens minds almost as bad as the clubs in france debretts parl register dec   th       and compared them to the riotous assemblies of lord george gordon in    0 burkes letter to the duke of portland art     with respect to these associations in his belief equivocal in principle and which he asserted to be execrable in object what council did he give how did he act he declared in the house that he advised his friends in westminster to sign them whether they agreed to them or not in order to avoid two evils the latter of which was a desertion of their shops burke ib the parallel passage in debretts debates is less full but that collection preserving mr ds answer shows mr bs statement to be correct not the garbled passage of debretts compiler substituted in its stead it applies to the former not to the latter  this exhortation to a general avowed and prostitute falsehood in public engagements was deservedly and indignantly reprobated by mr dundas men he said on that occasion who signed papers of which they disapproved might soon learn to swear what they did not believe and the signature of traitors might appear among those of good citizens but mr fox to show that he was not ashamed to act as he had advised on the morning after this debate with several of his particular and most intimate friends inhabitants of st georges parish attended and signed an association burke ib art     of particular passages of which the following is an extract we hold ourselves bound by duty and we now think ourselves particularly called upon by the times to declare that we will each of us in our respective stations individually contribute every assistance in our power to discountenance all illegal meetings and all seditious and inflammatory writings etc g robinsons annual register      pub papers p    a full parallel of the coincidence of his prior and subsequent declarations and acts with these parts of his engagement would form a tract of no little prolixity  one of the motives alleged by mr fox to induce his friends to subscribe these declarations which following him they must have reputed to be instruments to promote the worst ends is omitted above to avoid the destruction of their persons and their houses burkes letter to the duke of portland art     it was certainly expedient for mr fox to feign the existence of some more cogent necessity to give color to his criminal advice than considerations of profit in trade could furnish him with if the danger alleged had been true the principle his advice rests upon is immoral but the allegation was as defective in truth as the principle in morality i shall proceed to show it was a calumnious imputation on the friends of regular government which he pressed into the service of the minute and that they were the persons whose apprehensions were great and who sought in those associations security only  i rest this on the authority of what mr chalmers has said in the dedication of the last edition of that capital work his estimate to jasper wilson the astur of political arithmetic and economy and the perfect representative of the ligurian faith and foppery of that hero of virgil history says this wellinformed observer will record the month of november      as a memorable epoch in our annals it was peculiarly unfortunate to our traders yet it was a month propitious to the constitution i was not inattentive as you may suppose to the passages of that month i knew that the violence of the republicans and levellers had by its action and reaction spread terror far and wide i was acquainted with persons who feared the loss of their lands from the tumults of the jacobins at sheffield i was acquainted with persons who sold their stock in the british funds in order to invest it where they supposed it would be more safe i was acquainted with those who disposed at an under value of moveable property which they imagined was most likely to be destroyed by innovation and tumult dedication p      it might very well be expected that this agitated state of the public mind should be attended with dangerous effects to commercial credit that such effects followed it is indicated sufficiently in the bankruptcies of that very month in the preceding ten months their number had been     or    monthly in that november it suddenly rose to  0  the greatest number stated in mr chalmerss table for any month in any preceding year is    that of no other exceeded  0 in the month of december in which mr fox affirmed the solidest property to have been endangered and consequently mutual credit at its lowest depression the bankruptcies were reduced again to    the average of the first ten months of the year and less than that of the preceding mr chalmerss observation immediately annexed to the passage before cited is whether these apprehensions produced any of the numerous bankruptcies of november      i pretend not to know that is from positive and particular information as he knew the other effects of the national fears on this fact he tacitly refers to the evidence of his table he goes on to say i believe that all terrors disappeared when the parliament was called the militia were embodied and above all when the nation with an overpowering voice avowed her attachment to the constitution and promised her support of the laws estimate edition      introduction p    and table p     that support was engaged for by the national accession to that association which was set on foot on the  0th of this month of november by mr reeves it was as mr fox alleges the commencement of these very associations which caused the terror of assassination and plunder mentioned by him as if such a terror could have existed when in the very month in the middle of which he made his declaration the bankruptcies were reduced suddenly and nearly enough in the proportion of five to two  we cannot much wonder to see that the statesman who can teach individuals that they may for the continuance of their private profit enter into solemn engagements in face of their country contrary to their principles should not hesitate to propose the breach pf those which one country enters into with another even although they be his own acts when its interest well or ill understood may seem to require it or what with such a statesman is the same thing when his own interest well or ill understood seems to require it and that there are cases in which a statesman may utterly mistake his own interest is very evident for if mr fox had not contended for the infraction of the guarantee primarily his own ministerial act it is undeniably certain that he would at this instant have been high in power or at least that he would before this time have been recalled to an eminent station which he would have enjoyed for the whole term his infatuated impetuosity ordinarily gives him leave  the infusing of these principles relating to the engagements they give to the public into the minds of the people at large is great crime in a statesman and affects the total of his character as such it is long since that the fact has been charged upon mr fox with full evidence by mr burke and no defense set up in his behalf those therefore of his partisans who since continue to maintain that his public character is excellent and immaculate are morally become accessaries after the fact but if they shall say that they never deigned to examine the charges of mr burke against him then the probability of that declaration must be enquired into and if the inquiry turn out in their favor it follows from the defense established and the great name the moral character and the honor of the accuser that their bigoted belief of the impeccability of mr fox robs what they say in his praise of every pretense to more belief than bigotry voluntarily blinding itself can claim to its declarations to its foolish creed from the authority due to the clearness of its views and from this unfortunate position they can extricate themselves only by proving the falsehood of their own plea so set up  it is not the question of peace or war which is examined in this part of my letter it is not the prayer of the petitions past and future and the ostensible pretense by which commotion is solicited it is the danger of the real object of one of the parties which promotes the petitions that of the superior class of agitators namely to have mr fox called into power the first end with all and with many the last although they openly call for it only as the necessary means to obtain the prayer of such petitions this is the object here contended against and it is this which makes his character as a statesman clearly shown in his public acts and declarations an essential inquiry at this juncture the right to go into which restraining my condemnation of mr fox to what arises from his public acts he has fully admitted himself in the debate on postponing the recommitment of the quebec bill in      when he declared that the public has a right to the opinions of public men on public measures dodsleys ann reg      hist etc p          meaning to include his own a right which would be totally nugatory if individuals had not beside a coexisting and subsidiary right to lay their comments on such opinions before that public and he will not say he meant to admit hereby a nugatory or noneffective right only to be vested in it  i have long anticipated a question you may have formed in your own mind on the subject of the guarantee you will ask how has it happened that in all the debates in which the restoration of the house of bourbon has been considered this article has never been brought forward by those whose principles and arguments it would so decidedly have supported the existence of the guarantee having been proved i am in full right to say that whether an answer to this be or be not given it can neither reinforce nor diminish the obligation arising out of it and such an answer i am not of necessity obliged to attempt to give i shall however revert to the question afterward here it would be a mere scholium the bringing home the guarantee to mr fox and the deduction of its consequences although necessarily connected with the measures pursued to compel a present negotiation with france in the manner shown above yet has retarded the progress of the consideration of the former for no short time and i decline entering into another branch of the subject which will lead to a second discussion lengthening that inconvenience i therefore postpone the answer to this inquiry noting only that it terminates in a new proof of the danger and dishonor of ever at any future period intrusting mr fox with power  it is only a few observations that i have to add on the guarantee and its formal renunciation it will be said that the effective execution of it is evidently now impossible and that our obligation terminates with the possibility but political possibilities are subject to die and revive alternately at least to all appearance a few months continuance has not yet in any case given stability to those who have usurped power in france and if there be some circumstances which seem to promise it to the present usurpation which were wanted to the former they are more than overbalanced by the consul being an effective alien the spirit of revolution often seems dormant when it is secretly exerting itself with great efficacy and may be really dormant but not dead revolution in france resembles a certain insect which the researches of modern naturalists have discovered and which from its incessant gyration or rotatory motion has obtained with us the name of the wheel animalculum it follows from what dr pulteney in his view of the writings of linnaeus tells us that this great legislator of natural history includes this species among the chaotic animalcula which immediately follow the furiae general view etc p  0   when dried it will remain as dust for long periods of time but revives in full vigor by barely putting a single drop of water upon it and instantly resumes its revolutionary movements now according to the average duration of a french constitution the present consular government seems already to have survived almost a third of its term the time may be a little more or a little less for without a diligent inquiry which i have not time to enter upon an error may be easily fallen into in reckoning the periods of power enjoyed by their several sets of rulers before they have been sent to cayenne or the guillotine but i have a descriptive catalogue lying before me drawn up by one of the curious in revolutions fouliss history of plots p     following mr gray i will not steal a beautiful phrase from a classical writer without acknowledgment for this see advertisement by oystericus newspapers      or      to the curious in oysters  which makes the number of those taking place in our civil wars to have amounted to seventeen in nineteen years however it evidently includes some provisional and constituent councils which cannot be called governments and we are not to reckon more than seven distinct forms constituted in that term although two or three of them were violently or otherwise set aside and afterward restored again whence the mean duration of an experimental constitution in england comes out to be      years or two years eight months seventeen days and a small fraction and if we admit the mutability of the french character to be to that of the english in the exact ratio of two to one then will the probable length of the consular revolution be sixteen months and a few odd days but considerably less than a fortnight  indeed the example of harrington should serve as a warning to those who at this time maintain the impossibility of a regal counterrevolution in france hume somewhere in his essays tells us that he had predicted that the constitution of this kingdom would permanently remain republican a consequence which he had deduced from some abstract political principle i think it was that no change could take place in the form of a state after the center of power and the center of property were brought into coincidence the last sheets of his work were not dry from the press when monk was on his march from st albans to london france therefore is not arrived to the period which the lawyers would name that after the possibility of counterrevolution extinct but in a word nothing can procure universal peace but removing from those who wield the force of republicanized france the necessity of continuing war to preserve themselves from the vengeance of their armies whose hopes of the immense donative must be frustrated on its conclusion a separate peace leaving a war on the continent whereby the other powers especially spain portugal and the smaller german and italian states may one by one be swallowed all in the vortex of the republic or rendered dependent on it ought not to be made and a universal peace cannot therefore a declared dereliction of the guarantee contained in the last treaty can effect nothing or is neither necessary or honorable if renouncing engagements to which the body of the nation has in a singular manner pledged itself and for no motive or foreseen effect at all be both nugatory and dishonorable  but the ambition of the princes of the house of bourbon and their insidious policy which experience has shown to have formerly been almost perpetually employed against this island is an argument it will be urged furnishing the clearest demonstration that the interest of great britain can never be promoted by their restoration to the monarchy of france this charge against them i shall leave without attempting to detract any thing from that strength with which it may be supported and courteously suffer even some present overcharged exaggerations of it to pass it will be here sufficient to say that as frail as the security of the faith of those princes may have been it must be acknowledged that stronger reliance might at all times have justly been placed upon it than on that of the republic under the first constitution on which there was more dependence than on the faith of the second and that the engagements of the latter were entitled to a greater confidence than that which can be given to any treaty to be concluded with buonaparte  the proof of this will be evident enough from the consideration i am now going to enter upon of the further arguments of the present gallomanistes and of some cidevant gallomanistes whose measures and declarations still continue in different modes to give the most effective support here to the views of the great consul they urge that our calamitous struggle with france has been too long protracted and by the most futile of all pretensions that the rulers of the republic have been constantly incapable of maintaining the relations of amity with other states a position refuted by the real friends of their country as often as it has been advanced  to show the fallacy of this sturdy assertion little remains for me to do but to make extracts from some curious documents brought together to my hand in an excellent pamphlet published in the beginning of the present year reflections on the political state of society at the commencement of the year   00 by john bowls esquire  and to inquire as a consequence deducible from them how far the credit of those who advanced it and continue to repeat it is at this juncture affected thereby on questions relating to the proposed negotiation  the friends of their country had not failed to study with accuracy the general spirit and detail of the semiorganised anarchy called the constitution during the tyranny of roberspierre and one result of their scrutiny was that thereby the party in power was unable to maintain the relation of amity with foreign states or in the language of vatel that by the fundamental laws no power was constituted able to contract with validity this charge against the new system was refuted here indeed as far as a positive declaration against it could go but the party maintaining such power to have been any where vested by it omitted one mode to confirm their affirmation which the laws of reasoning as they stood before the revolution obliged them to follow namely to produce the title and section of the constitution in which this power was to be found  after the fall of roberspierre a committee was appointed to draw up the plan of a new constitution they turned their views to the old one and among other objects to see what it established on the head of compacts with foreign states the result of their search we are made acquainted with by the speech of boissy danglas to the national assembly in the name of that committee after enumerating many defects of the system to be repealed what must we think says he of a constitution in which no principle of relation to foreign powers is to be found translation lloyds evening post july  st       it is highly worthy of remark here that while he adopts the charge advanced against the constitution before existing in france and so resolutely denied by our opposition he at the same time adopts the very language in which it had been here expressed  the system which originated from the labors of this committee was called the constitutional as that which it superseded had been named the revolutionary government so lately as the month of november last boulay de la meurthe confirmed the declaration of boissy danglas quoted above relating to the former it is well known he affirmed that peace could not be concluded before the establishment of the constitutional government for there then existed a government which called itself revolutionary and which afforded no certain guarantee either to things or persons see bowless reflections p         for this and the two following extracts from the same speech   boissy danglas having been at the head of the committee to draw up the plan of the constitutional government it was to be expected that a power would have been somewhere vested in it to contract with validity with foreign states the mode in which de la meurthe has lately expressed himself on that head seems however to cast a doubt even on this yet it does not amount to an absolute negation of it and it is known to have been true on other authorities but there may exist in a state other incapacities to treat or be treated with equal to the former in effect for certain persons by a constitution of government may have legal powers to conclude a formal treaty to which that government itself is unable to give either force or continuance  it is from boulay de la meurthe we are officially informed that this was the case of the republic under the system which was called the constitutional government it should seem says that great statesman of the new school that this permanence and guarantee ought to have existed from the establishment and by the operations of the constitutional system and yet there were not more but perhaps less of them than before and by way of conclusion he adds thus if we form an opinion according to well known facts the french government cannot be considered as possessing any permanence either with respect to men or things  it is found difficult to stipulate conditions of peace and still more difficult to preserve them  thus the first constitution afforded no certain guarantee either to persons or things and the second was found more defective than the first treaties of peace were quickly broken and became the source of a new war still more desperate and bloody than the former and the directory terrified all europe and destroyed according to its caprice several governments  but this iniquity and caprice very inadequately accounts for the conduct of the directory the motive to which as it must continue to act and produce the same effects in every form the republic may assume the speaker who was the mouth piece of its new rulers was obliged to keep out of sight for none can doubt the iniquity of the old directors to have been interested and systematical and nothing could have been of less power than caprice to determine in what acts it should manifest itself in this its members were guided by policy and if general peace had been consistent with their personal safety the best policy would have dictated that measure to them the impossibility of discharging the donative to the army forced them to continue war but a war that would maintain itself and perhaps afford some slight temporary aids to their exhausted treasury they were driven to support their armies as a tartar feeds his herds where there is but little plunder to be acquired in the one case and the herbage is almost eaten off in the other the herd and the army are led perhaps to very remote distances to devour and fatten upon a fresh country hence we have seen their wars ceasing in one quarter and breaking out suddenly and unexpectedly in another germany began to threaten the republicans to be equally barren of triumphs and of plunder a kind of treaty was suddenly patched up with the emperor and the french armies were immediately sent to invade the friendly territories of egypt and switzerland it is the fear of the return of their armies home that is the motive of their wars abroad they arise from the inability of the state to pay the debt to them at the return of peace it depends neither on the nominal powers of the executive government nor the personal character of its members it is not in the nature of a pentarchy or a consular or a dictatorial government to create the funds to discharge this immense debt although in the inaugural oration of the consular government it was incumbent on boulay de la meurthe roundly to affirm the first and suppress every idea of the second  i have before endeavored to prove to you that the consul is compelled to maintain a perpetual war by a stronger degree of necessity than that by which the directors were fettered boulay de la meurthe indeed tacitly denies this necessity by ascribing all their infractions of the laws of nations to their violences and the caprice of iniquity and many argue so here let us therefore now suppose with him and them that the continuation of the war and all these violations of the rights of foreign states arose solely from a bad system of government and the bad character of those who possessed the executive power and not from that necessity hitherto insisted on and proceed to examine what the consequence of this admission will be on the question whether we ought to have entered into a negotiation on the late invitation of buonaparte  as the infidelity of france to her compacts which took place under the second constitution was effectively greater than that under the first the sole motives to our treating with her rulers now must be either the greatest necessity or the expectation that the last revolution has introduced some amelioration to this evil the fallacy of this shall therefore be shown and moreover that there is a probability of great magnitude that its effect must be of a directly contrary nature  the consular constitution has given to buonaparte an authority much greater than that of the deposed directory the plenitude of dominion or the entire sovereignty is nominally divided between the chief consul and his three senates as before between the directory and the two councils but fetters have been forged for the latter of so complicated a contrivance that the check upon his acts is a name only the measures therefore which will be pursued by the republic with respect to other nations will be more fully impressed with his character than those carried into execution under the constitutional system at any particular time with the character of the directors then in authority hence the fidelity of the consul to his own public declarations and acts becomes not only a proper but a necessary object of diligent inquiry the character of the state having now become identified with his there being no adequate balance to his power to direct its measures  but while that constitution subsisted the violation of the laws of nations by treachery and force solely imputable to him exceeded in degree the crimes of the same kind great and many as they were with which those ephemeral tyrants were deservedly charged and the atrocity of those committed by him were likewise further heightened by this circumstance that if the enterprises to be considered had been politically just if undertaken by legitimate authority yet in him they were high civil crimes having been usurpations of the right of the sovereign power he acknowledged in its high capacity of making peace and war therefore admitting as we must do here the authority from which he received his military appointment these violations of the law of nations were aggravated by a crime his principals could not in the nature of things possibly commit they could not usurp on their own sovereignty in matters of peace and war  these acts were the subversion of the republics of venice and genoa it was on their ruins says mr mallet du pan that buonaparte drew up the sentence of the neutral states merc brit essai etc destruc de la l helv p      and the criminality of these acts of duplicity rapine and frontless infraction of the law of nations was heightened by his ingratitude to these two republics which from the day of his passing the po had loaded him and his army with gratifications ib      this intelligent writer apparently brings forward these two usurpations as the worst in principle to be found even in the annals of the french revolution and in effect if the peculiar circumstances attending them be examined in the proper point of view they will so be found to have been for let it here for a moment be granted that the law of nations is to give way according to the new principles to the republicanizing of europe in every case where they come in competition the destruction of a republic neutral in name but in effect a dependent and obedient ally is in one act a subversion of the new and the old principles together this remark on the character of these usurpations it is not unnecessary to give although it is not to be imagined that any one be his political system ever so hostile to that mr mallet du pan was known to hold will imagine him not minutely acquainted with the crimes of the french against other nations or that when his subject required him to bring forward the most atrocious that he would err in the examples he selected  but in the subversion of these friendly republics buonaparte clearly appears to have acted without orders or instructions from france for when the contests between the councils and the majority of the directory which terminated in what is called the revolution of fructidor were approaching to a crisis dumolard made a motion that the directory should give an account of the revolutions of venice and genoa effected apparently without previous order pour demander compte au directoire des revolutions en appearance inopinees de venise et de genes sir f divernois tab de la repub franc      p      although the terms in which this demand was couched were general it was levelled at buonaparte and mr mallet du pan speaking of the subversion of the two republics says that these excesses of buonaparte excited rather a desire than a determination to bring him to justice but the first plaint of the council against him cost that assembly its existence sa premiere plainte lui couta lexistence merc brit p       the directory seized with eagerness this opportunity afforded to them by their adversaries of attaching buonaparte to their interests they made no other answer to the demand than dispatching to him an ostensible letter in which they declared to him that they gave their full approbation to his conduct both political and military namely with respect to venice and genoa sir f di tableau      p       it will not fail to strike you that if he had acted in consequence of their instructions such an approbation and ratification of his acts would have been not only totally nugatory but even prejudicial to him as it would have left him exposed to the charge of having acted without orders in a matter which the more respectable and popular party in france and in the councils actually then treated as highly criminal it is to be noted also that a considerable period was suffered to elapse between these transactions of buonaparte and the date of the approbation of the directory there is therefore a strong probability that they wished to preserve these charges of his acting without authority in matters of the very highest consequence outstanding against him in order to be produced at a proper time to annihilate the power he was acquiring which began to overshadow all others in the state or at least by the apprehension of them to reduce him from an almost independent agent to a subordinate instrument of their purposes this mode of reducing military officers into subordination is not new in idea here admiral keppel seemed to have conceived it and thought himself in like danger from the administration of his time from an exercise of his political discretion in directing an act of hostilities the first action of the last war with france was the capture of the belle poule war said he in his defense on the court martial upon him had not been declared nor even reprisals ordered my situation was singular i might be disavowed and a war with france laid to the account of my rashness there was not wanting some discourse of that tendency among people whose opinions are of moment he then goes on to affirm from this hour i have not received one syllable of direct or official approbation of my conduct annual register      appendix      clearly intimating an apprehension that an accusation on account of the capture of that vessel might intentionally be kept suspended over his head of the justice of that apprehension and that it was a fear qui cadere possit in virum constantem non timidum et meticulosum i shall not pronounce to the noble lord at the head of the administration from whom the gallant admiral feared so much his relation gave the most public testimony that he had found him honorable as an enemy and that he did not expect to discover in him the tricks the stratagems and the subterfuges which he had experienced in others robinsons ann reg      hist p    mr foxs speech  meaning some of the speakers former friends but thus much undoubtedly follows from this extract from keppels defense that an administration like a french directory if the members were jealous of a commander employed by them would not let slip an opportunity of taking away his power or reducing him to a degrading dependence upon them if by criminally acting without orders he should have given them an opportunity so to do  but the councils on this occasion commenced the process of buonaparte the stronger party in the directory was weak in those assemblies and the popular cry was against them their whole dependence was on the military force the use also of this accusation as an instrument to restrain the power of the general was taken out of their hands there remained to them therefore only to promote the intended proceedings against him rather with disgrace than advantage to themselves as having for purposes not ostensible long tolerated gross crimes while by concurring in the charge they likewise were reduced to multiply their enemies and take from themselves the last hope of support or they were constrained to meet his accusers in his defense with a ratification of his acts and by voluntarily making a common cause with him to attempt to ensure his strong support  i am sensible that the invasion of switzerland which happened after the destruction of the sister republics of venice and genoa was followed by more sanguinary scenes the plan of the first is ascribed to the directory the latter were the acts of buonaparte and the determination upon them will be found the most flagitious and faithless it is the degrees of infidelity shown in the acts of the directory and the corsican that are to be compared not the misery which in different countries as a natural consequence has followed that of each the two italian states had granted if not anticipated every wish that buonaparte could form from them each had been subservient to his requisitions and furnished him with great loans for the support of his army but switzerland although desirous to preserve peace with this tyrannical power had furnished to it no such assistance on the contrary the republic had sent   000 men to the defense of geneva when it was first attacked by france and forced her for that time to relinquish her prey when the french were plundering suabia they armed to protect their own borders from their rapines and if during their calamitous retreat they suffered a division of the army to return to their native country through a part of their territories they compelled them to pass through them disarmed the invasion of switzerland as a violation of national faith was no more so than the conquest of venice and genoa and was not at the same time a violation of national gratitude at least in a sense any thing so high as in the latter case and it is to be considered that the moral criminality of doing an evil to a benefactor is double to that of the same injury to an indifferent person hence these infractions of the laws binding nation to nation by buonaparte show a more frontless defiance of the principles of their moral rights than any act of the late directory the destruction of the swiss republic and the slaughter and massacres which attended and followed it are above exclusively considered as the crimes of the directory then in power because the immediate agents were avowed by them but when the first measures to consummate this great crime were in preparation mr mallet du pan who has written the history of this revolution of his country who had the most indefatigable attention to information of every kind access to the first and the finest abilities to make use of it describes buonaparte himself as laboring to bury switzerland under the ruins of italy essai hist p      although at that very time two of the five directors barthelemi and carnot exerted their endeavors to turn away the blow meditated against that country ibid p      the revolution of fructidor effected by a military force headed by the creatures of buonaparte drove them into exile a catastrophe which decided that of the helvetic body ibid p      he therefore had taken measures preparatory to its subversion before it was determined upon by the executive council of the republic it is not worth while to inquire whether after he had confirmed the power of the directory which he has recently overthrown they spontaneously came to a formal determination to consummate this crime or were induced by his influence which was the sole support of their power we see even here that acting under a commission he without legal authority from his superiors began the overthrow of a third friendly state  the invasion of egypt is said to have been a project of buonapartes but as in this he had the sanction of the directory he committed no act of usurpation upon their authority it therefore is to be taken as their act now as the port had never armed to protect any allied state from the iniquitous attempts of the republic so far the attack on one of its finest provinces and the granary of the capital was initially worse than the invasion of switzerland but as that power had not under the name of neutrality assisted the progress of the french armies almost as a dependent ally still the resolution to attack its dominions had not all the turpitude of the destruction of the republics of venice and genoa undertaken by buonaparte without orders from his government     if the grand consul when acting by commission from a superior power thus trampled under foot the law of nations brought utter ruin without the very shadow of a pretext upon two feeble unoffending states his benefactors trampling under foot by the same crime the authority he acted under being now freed even from the appearance of restraint and armed with powers trusted to none of his predecessors will he shrink at a repetition of these crimes or the commission of others possible to the utmost abuse of unprincipled unrestricted force  quid domini faciant audent cum talia fures what will grand consuls of france do when french generals dare so much or what human principle is there to induce him to observe his compacts better with his most determined enemies than with the beneficent submissive friends of his necessities as well as his prosperity  france tells us and by the partisans of that revolution which placed this power in his hands that the former sets of men who held the reins of her executive government were perfidious  power under less control is now fallen into the hands of one more perfidious shall we now give that faith to him which france assures us we justly and wisely refused to them  yet if this conclusion be erroneous every one must foresee the calamities in which if it should be generally embraced it must involve all europe it is necessary therefore to consider every thing bearing the form of an argument which may be advanced against it none has occurred to me deserving consideration except the following which although in some instances it might have weight in this case such are the particular circumstances with which it is attended it may be clearly showed to be entitled to none  some it will be said who have waded through crimes to empire have displayed in the possession of it qualities which with a juster original title would have ensured to their names a preeminent place among the best of sovereigns and is not buonaparte daily making fair advances in that expiatory career his accession to power has not been clouded over by the exile or death of his predecessors his attention to decorum of manners has made him discountenance as far as he is yet able some of that depraved licentiousness which has spread over the country like a moral pestilence or at least he has checked the outward marks of it he has lightened the restraints and removed the severe oppressions of the professors of a religion the great body of whom he may regard as his most powerful and irreconcilable enemies all practicable indulgence he has extended to the emigrants of many he has permitted and even invited the return and his justice and liberality has softened the miseries of others and are such returns to what is liberal and virtuous to be taxed as void of all reality  i answer that these appearances are still to continue to be so reputed granting all that is here said formed of consequences drawn some from accounts of dubious or little authority and others from such as more probably lead to different conclusions or which are evidently carried too far for i say of no bad quality of the character of the consul are the lines more full and dark than of hypocrisy  for he can counterfeit a faith in what if he believe in a god he knows to be a superstition injurious to a due reverence to him and therefore to the obedience due to him for an end as cruel as the means are impious to lead ignorant and credulous nations into the deepest human calamities those which have afflicted his own this he has done in his proclamation addressed to the inhabitants of egypt speaking of his countrymen and certainly meaning to be understood first of himself solemnly invoking the name of god gracious and merciful he declares the french honor the prophet and his holy koran  the french are true mussulmen bowless reflect p        as a divine it may be thought by some that i have censured this crime with an interested rigor to show i have not described it too strongly i shall cite a text confirming what i have said from the canonical writings of one of the princes of the apostles of infidelity he is considering indeed an act of apostasy differing in some circumstances from this that of a man making a professed change of religion to save his own life and that of another where although the mean is impious the end is lawful these are his words cest trahir a la fois sous une masque hypocrite et le dieu quon prefere et le dieu que lon quitte cest mentir au ciel meme a luniverse a soi voltaire azir a   so    the wretch betrays masked in hypocrisy in one vile act the god he bows to and the god he quits he lies to heaven the universe himself   if we compare the ends for which such an unhappy criminal puts on this mask of hypocrisy with those of the french general we must judge the latter to be the more atrocious and unprincipled hypocrite of the two the crime of the one is committed on extreme compulsion of the other in the plenitude of power  and if in egypt buonaparte had found that the hypocritical assumption of some virtues the fine playing off of something like redress of grievances would have probably attached to him a confidence which would have enabled him to carry his sanguinary schemes of rapacity into effect would he with more reluctance have assumed this other mask or is it contended that to obtain the means of carrying his execrable designs into execution he would have rather chosen to have committed one of the most impious crimes than to have embraced a few measures which would have been of temporary benefit to some not undeserving objects now if it be certain that he would have put on this specious appearance of moderation in egypt shall we believe he will not do the same in europe among blind and ignorant barbarians it may be said whose praise or reprobation could be of little honor or discredit to him he cared as little about the character of his measures but there is no effrontery which does not stand in more awe of the just and indignant condemnation of wise and enlightened nations the admission this contains that his acts are under the influence of no moral principle may be passed by  but ask at venice and at genoa with what awe he regards the judgment and execration of this part of the world  after the proclamation of buonaparte in egypt it would seem to be the extreme of folly from the evident farce of the confessor at dijon to think him in real persuasion a member of the romish church but certainly no man with any pretension to wisdom or any state governed by wise councils can conceive that the wound he gave in that country to the faith of his public instruments is in the smallest degree closed thereby or take any important measure in consequence of that belief is he who can falsely and with solemn appeals to god set up a religious pretense for the purpose of slaughtering and pillaging a people at peace with him worthy of credit a second time be his second religious professions ever so solemn or may a true or a false religion be so sported with even political infidelity which has not lost sight of moral sentiment and political wisdom would at all times have execrated such a conduct and at this juncture will view it with a stronger execration than ever and to those who continue to contend that the hypocrisy of buonaparte has not been such as to deprive his declarations of all faith it may be fairly urged that he either believes or disbelieves the creed of the romish church then they may be desired to make their election of either of the alternatives the position holds out to them if they say he disbelieves it  what is his act in taking a confessor and appointing him apartments at dijon it will not be affirmed it was a piece of the old etiquette of the revolutionary chiefs of the republic which it was impolitic to lay aside for fear of affronting the principles of his partisans and which we have the guarantee of their influence over him to expect something from and in this case the language of the poet voltaire  who when he chose it wrote morally is perfectly applicable to him such hypocrisy is a lie to god and to man now let his retainers take the opposite side of the alternative and say that he holds the creed of that church judging him then by his own private conscience and belief as stated by themselves could there be in him a more profane and public act of apostasy than the first words of his manifesto in egypt in the name of god gracious and merciful  there is no god but god  he has no son  no associate in his kingdom see proclamation bowless reflections p     will he who solemnly denies the redeemer whom in his heart he adores be incapable of writing a few inflated phrases to deceive you or setting his hand to a treaty which he is predetermined on certain events to break in expectation that he can use it as the most probable means to bring them to maturity  i proceed in the next place to show that the favorable sentiments now attempted to be propagated of the moderation of his principles on the foundation of some of his late acts are refuted by proofs of his hypocrisy even superior in validity to those brought above against the romish church of which he pretends to be a member he has declared in words against the system of moderation which he pretends to embrace he has declared in words and in the strongest acts  every one knows that during that part of the tempestuous night of the revolutionary tyranny when barthelemi was in the direction and before the violence of thermidor something like a dawn of moderation like the beginning of the reign of a milder oppression began to appear the system brought into action was the same from which at this time the partisans of the consul draw their inferences in favor of the principles of his future internal administration of the country immediately before that crisis the councils and the directory were divided into two hostile parties either of them at first would gladly have availed itself of the protection the generals ascendency over the armies would have given it and in return he might have commanded any terms from either of which he could avow his desire it was for a long time perfectly open to him to choose his party to establish its power and reap great rewards from his act  from the measures then embraced by the general against moderate party we may judge from what sincerity of principle his late assumed moderation flows a quality to which at that time he gave the fatal name of royalism it was to crush its partisans that he demanded of his legions whether they were not ready if it were necessary to pass with the rapidity of the eagle the mountains which separated them from france sir f divernois tableau etc      p      and their reply was an eager declaration of hostility against the majority of the councils that it was only a step from the adige to the rhine and the seine and the army of augereau the attack by which the revolution of fructidor was effected was entrusted to general augereau to whom buonaparte had caused the command of the troops in paris to be given as soon as that lieutenant had excited his division to proclaim sonner the hour of vengeance and to announce to the french legislators that the reward of their crimes etc  see sir f divernois tableau etc      p      to whom buonaparte caused the execution of his intended violence to be committed told the same party in their manifesto something less metaphorically that the price of their iniquities was at the point of their bayonets ibid p      they passed the magic circle which the constitution had traced round the seat of legislation and government and the majority of the directory aided by buonapartes agent augereau who was appointed by him for that purpose sent the defenders of that moderation he now is said to assume to a death almost certain in the pestilential morasses of cayenne the disposition the most open to confidence must see in his assumption of the appearances of moderation nothing at present but a new act of political hypocrisy and that instead of adding faith to the most specious propositions it diminishes the minute probability of sincerity which they might otherwise have carried  his sudden display of reverence for a religion he has solemnly abjured and of an attachment to political virtues he has persecuted with proscription and death carry such evident marks of being the mere sacrifices of hypocrisy to a temporary expedience that no absurdity can surpass that of the endeavor to extract an argument from them to prove that he who when his authority was limited regardless of those limits trampled with greater perfidy on the law of nations than the directory themselves who left all other criminals recorded in the history of europe far behind them will now armed with great and independent powers fulfill the contracts he may enter into with foreign states with the customary degree of fidelity with which they are in fact observed between nation and nation however short that may fall of the sanctity with which they ought to be adhered to  in a word from the very commencement of his political and military career buonaparte seems to have been attached to no religious or moral principles but those of dicaearchus of which polybius has transmitted to us the following account  when the last philip of macedon contrary to the faith of treaties determined to attack the cyclades he had the command of the enterprise placed at the head of an expedition apparently so impious he stopped not at the simple commission of a great crime but carried his insolence so far as to determine to astonish gods and men therefore on his arrival in port he erected two altars consecrating one to impiety and the other to injustice and offered sacrifices upon each b    c   from the translation of thuillier in folard  curious as the monuments of ancient greece are this marble must be one of the most singular even among them the buccaneer nation in its universal robberies has professedly seized with particular avidity on all the fine or singular remains of grecian art if it should have fallen into their hands and now decorates their ostentatious and crammed repository of stolen goods that altar might well suit the corsican to swear to the future treaty and offer the federative sacrifice upon with the orthodox rites established at its consecration by its pious founder but we ought to put little confidence in such rites or the permanency of the compacts we enter into with the votary of such divinities no party i suppose among us will controvert this conclusion hardly an individual except there should be found one who having officially advised that we should become bound to the aid of the exiled family of the bourbons may in his parliamentary capacity persist to urge for a declaration of the nation by its representatives that it will in no wise in any future instant of the present war endeavor to perform the obligation we have laid ourselves under but when the great consul shall so ratify that peace which is to join together the conflicting nations in bands of perpetual amity happily of a firmer texture than the former weak ligaments the same in name only but liable four or five times in every century to be untwisted by perfidy or cut through by the sword of ambition we must entirely agree with his partisans  such a statesman and such a one only will be worthy to receive on our parts that high and solemn ratification  there are other points of view of high importance on which the fallacy of the pretension of those who contend that we ought to have entered into negociations on the late proposition from france and renounced immediately the guarantee of that monarchy might be shown and which even reduce those who maintain them to the most indefensible situations but i shall not now or probably in future enter upon them inclined here to quit the argument and not stopping to add any farther matter even to anticipate one or two frivolous objections to what i have written above which may or may not occur to the open or hypocritical enemies of the real peace and happiness of the nations of europe  but although i refrain from considering any further objections to the matter i have written i shall state and consider one which will be made to its manner  against that it will be zealously urged that nations with whom we are in a state of hostility or the rulers of such nations should never be attacked with the strong and indignant language of crimination for even where its justice cannot be disputed it operates on their minds as insult provoking added injuries on their parts and no good purpose can be answered by exasperating representations that the lines of such pictures when drawn by the pencil of a professed enemy are seldom truly drawn and if they obtain not general credit will be estimated as the imbecility of virulence but if unfortunately they become the popular belief they may put off the return of a peace until long after the term a nation so deluded may have felt that it becomes necessary and the possibility that term may arrive no one can deny  to what is said of necessity it is readily answered that in this case the necessity admitted has certain qualities by which it may be described it must be such a one as can be acted upon but this it cannot be when the public enemy is under a necessity of continuing the war we must look also to its origin the difficulty and danger of continuing the war but against this is to be stated the danger emergent upon the peace that after we shall have disarmed a perfidious enemy will certainly watch his opportunity to renew the war at a crisis most convenient to himself and threatening to be most fatal to us and here the balance of danger and difficulty seems on the other side and this necessity is moreover required to be of that urgency which gives to a nation a real dispensation from a moral obligation such as the guarantee is for public treaties constitute such an obligation  nor can such charges in any possible though improbable case be attended with the irritating effect supposed on those against whom they are brought the facts on which they are grounded are all transcribed literally from authorities of the most extensive circulation and the censure would be very singular on any one that he recalls from oblivion what is of a nature never to be forgotten there remains only therefore one circumstance in which this letter can have the tendency censured that these facts are considered here somewhat in a new point of view and applied to in a new way to the question but here i am sensible that those who take up all the rest of the objection against me will be among the first to deny the charge on my behalf and however desirous i may be to enter on a defense against it myself i rely with much more confidence on the zeal and ability with which they will do it for me i leave it to them therefore entirely without suggesting a single hint which they might apply on the subject  but until the virtuous sentiments of moral indignation see butlers sermons sermon  th  th edit p     and the analogy part   chapter   of the moral government of god  th section  the strong antipathy of good to bad shall be eradicated by the reformers of our nature for even the moral constitution of our nature ordained by providence has its set of reformers men will continue to think that on the highest crimes the strongest reprobation ought to be inflicted and include those mentioned above among them  and if they be not duly present to general recollection at certain seasons it will become even of the highest necessity to state them afresh with all their consequences and particularly it becomes a duty when forbearance tends strongly to expose new victims to the repetition of former crimes where they have been fatal to individuals only the truth of this has never been contested but a political party now contends that this does not hold equally true of such as may involve states and nations in utter desolation and their native country as well as any other the misery arising from which must be perpetuated to many generations but those who shall venture to censure the indignant statement of crimes that are the scourges of the world in awful periods like the present must rank under one of the three following descriptions either of partisans of the criminals and promoters of the success of their meditated enormities or of factionaries who for a chance of obtaining gain or power determinately involve their country in the hazard of destruction or men of that duped and devoted blindness whom the calamities of others will never teach wisdom for themselves  it is therefore not only defensible but necessary and right to call the friends of their country to look with solicitous apprehension to the events which must follow a peace signed by the same hand which guaranteed the states of venice and genoa and almost before the ink of the subscription was dry subscribed the instruments of their annihilation they may justly suppose the motives of the grand consul the same in any future treaty with us as in his two latter compacts with them to lay asleep the vigilance of the state the destruction of which he is plotting expecting that if after the peace we continue powerfully armed the expense will foster the spirit of discontent until it be matured into insurrection among us without his appearing at first to cast any fuel upon the fire and in case we disarm the correspondence of the two countries being reopened his plan will be to employ every machination to inflame and propagate the spirit of anarchy and rebellion in every class by the aid of which he will renew his hostile attack upon us with better hope of success if we be thus forced into a second contest in victory we shall have much to fear in consequence of the burden of another war almost immediately succeeding the present from the inflammable state and perverted disposition of the populace and the criminal ambition of their greater and less leaders educated and disciplined in the arts of attacking and subverting civil government by the experience of more than ten years here and the example of the more successful divisions of their fraternity abroad embarked in the same warfare and acting with the utmost dexterity and frequently with success in the same and almost every other variety of circumstances  but it is time to put an end to this very long letter with assurances that i am etc  postscript i had promised in my letter a particular account of the silence observed on the subject of the guarantee by the leaders of both parties as it had already run to a great length i could not there enter fully into the complicated detail it would lead to i shall therefore add here as a postscript an analysis of what in such an account i should have insisted on this i had designed to have done in a second letter an intention some reasons have induced me to lay aside  the motives of the silence of opposition in both houses may be dispatched in a single sentence to have brought the guarantee forward would have been an appeal to the national faith and honor against the measures they recommended involving the personal condemnation of their two leaders  that of administration is to be accounted for in a different manner it may be shown that the guarantee has been by them fulfilled in act and there has occurred only two periods in which circumstances seemed to call upon them to declare its existence in either of which the declaration would have greatly tended to defeat the execution of it  the first was when the king of france was put under restraint the second when war was proclaimed against us  it could not be declared at the first period false conceptions had been taken up artificially heightened and long supported concerning the nature of the revolution its popularity was then hardly upon the wane administration had equipped three armaments in a few years of peace in consequence of which they were taxed with eagerness to plunge the nation into a war to display their abilities in the conduct of it the last they were compelled by clamor to lay aside its object had been to establish the emancipation of poland from the yoke of russia and its new soberly free constitution and to restrain the increase of that overgrown power in another quarter but although it seemed to fall in with the current of popular opinion then setting strongly in favor of liberty it was defeated with a high hand to have declared for the guarantee at the first period would have been construed as a confirmation of the charge of eagerness for war it must have been opposed by the force of that current and would have been condemned as an effective accession to the treaty of pilnitz always unpopular although arising out of the quadruple alliance formed by a whig ministry here when the house of hanover was in its greatest danger and the guarantee of its succession which has the broadest and most definite basis  the existence and obligation of the guarantee to the house of bourbon could not be declared at the second period or when france proclaimed war against us without the danger of sacrificing the object to the formality for the war was supported in both houses and in the nation at large by a coalition of parties the one hostile to the ruling powers in france on account of the revolution at least in the shape it had taken the invasion of holland and their other usurpations and the other party for the second reason only and a declaration for the guarantee at that time probably would have dissolved this junction again a hazard which even for the interest of the unfortunate family of bourbon it would have been impolitic to have run because the latter division of this coalition always readily suped the aids from time to time given to the royalists as a customary mode of carrying on hostilities against a power with which we were at war  thus the effect of the guarantee has been secured without the declaration which might have been endangered by its having been made when circumstances seemed to call for it and it may very well so go on in execution thus the formal declaration at the commencement of the last war with france having been omitted at the customary period it was not declared afterward and as at that time the armaments against france were an affirmation in act by administration of the existence of a war and of their full knowledge and admission of that fact the armaments in favor of the royalists and other aids given them amount on the part of the present administration to the same affirmation in act of the existence of the guarantee without the formality of a declarn of it  printed by bye and law st johnssquare clerkenwell
