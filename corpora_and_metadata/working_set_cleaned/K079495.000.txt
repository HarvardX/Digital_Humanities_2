breast that public favor calls with just demand the expected volume from his lingering hand lost are those anxious hopes that eager pride with thee my thornton they declined they died friend of my opening soul whose love began to hail thy poet ere he ranked as man whose praise like dewdrops which the early morn sheds with mild virtue on the vernal thorn taught his young mind each swell of thought to show and gave the germs of fancy strength to blow dear firm associate of his studious hour who led his idler step to learnings bower though young imparting to his giddier youth thy thirst of science and thy zeal for truth ye towers of granta where our friendship grew and that pure mind expanded to my view our love fraternal let thy walls attest where attic joys our lettered evening blessed where midnight from the chains of sleep relieved stole on our social studies unperceived but not my thornton in that calm alone was thy mild genius thy warm virtue known when manhood marked the hour for busy strife and led us to the crowded maze of life from whence to sweet retirements soothing shade love and the muse thy willing friend conveyed thy soul more firm to join the struggling crowd to nobler themis toilsome homage vowed with zeal devoting to her sacred throne a heart as uncorrupted as her own still as thy mind with manly powers endued the opening path of active life pursued and round the ripening field of business ranged thy heart unwarpd unhardend unestrangd to early friendship still retained its truth with all the warm integrity of youth whenever afflictions force thy friend oppressed thou were the rock on which his cares might rest from thy kind words his rising hopes would own the charm of reason in affections tone where is the soothing voice of equal power to take it is anguish from the present hour beneath the pressure of a grief so just the lenient aid of books in vain i trust they that could once the war of thought control and banish discord from the jarring soul now irritate the mind they used to heal they speak too loudly of the loss i feel thou faithful censor of the poets strain no more shall thou his sinking hope sustain no more with ardent zeals enlivening fire call from inglorious shades his silent lyre no more as in our days of pleasure past the eye of judgment over his labors cast keen to discern the blemishes that lurk in the loose texture of his growing work eager to praise yet resolute to blame kind to his verse but kinder to his fame how may the muse who prosperd by thy care now meet the public eye without despair now if harsh censures on her failings pour her warmest advocate can speak no more cold are those lips which breathed the kind defense if spleens proud cavil strained her tortured sense which bade her song to public praise aspire and called attention to her trembling lyre ah could she now thus petrified with grief find in some lighter lay a vain relief still must she deem such verse if such could be a wound to friendship and a crime to thee profanely uttered at this sacred time when thy pale corse demands her plaintive rhyme and virtue weeping whom she could not save calls the just mourner to thy recent grave hail hallowed vault whose darksome caverns hold a frame though mortal of no common mould a heart scarce sullied with a human flaw which shunned no duty and transgressed no law in joy still guarded in distress serene through life a model of the golden mean which friendship only led him to transgress whose purer spirit sanctifies excess pure mind whose meekness in thy mortal days pursuing virtue still retired from praise nor wished that friendship should on marble give that perfect image of thy worth to live which twas thy aim alone to leave impressed on the close tablet of her faithful breast if now her verse against thy wish rebel and strive to blazon what she loved so well forgive the tender thought the moral song which would thy virtues to the world prolong that rescued from the graves oblivious shade their useful luster may be still surveyed dear to the pensive eye of fond regret as light still beaming from a sun that is set often to our giddy muse thy voice has taught the just ambition of poetic thought bid her bold view to latest time extend and strive to make futurity her friend if any verse her little art can frame may win the partial voice of distant fame be it the verse whose fond ambition tries to paint thy mind in truths unfading dies though firm yet tender ardent yet refined with roman strength and attic grace combined what though undeckd with titles power and wealth great were thy generous deeds and done by stealth for thy pure bounty from observance stole nor wished applause but from thy conscious soul though thy plain tomb no sculptured form may show no boastful witness of suspected woe yet heavenly shapes that shun the glare of day to that dear spot shall nightly visits pay pale science there shall over her votary strew her flowers yet moist with sorrows recent dew there charity compassions lovely child in rustic notes pathetically wild with grateful blessings bid thy name endure and mourn the patron of her villagepoor even from the midnight show with music gay the soul of beauty to thy tomb shall stray in sweet distraction steal from present mirth to sigh unnoticd over the hallowed earth which hides those lips that glowed with tender fire and sung her praises to no common lyre but friendship wrapped in sorrows deepest gloom shall keep the longest vigils at thy tomb her wounded breast disdainful of relief there claims a fond praeeminence in grief short was thy life but ah its thread how fine how pure the texture of the finished line what though thy opening manhood could not gain those late rewards maturer toils attain hopes firmest promises twas thine to raise that merits brightest meed would grace thy lengthened days for thine were judgments patient powers to draw entangled justice from the nets of law thine firm integrity whose language clear never swelled with arrogance or shook with fear reasons mild power unvexd by mental strife swayed the calm current of thy useful life whose even course was in no season lost nor rough with storms nor stagnated by frost in scenes of public toil or social ease twas thine by firm sincerity to please sweet as the breath of spring thy converse flowed as summers noontide warmth thy friendship glowed over thy mild manners by no art constrained a pensive pleasing melancholy reigned which won regard and charmed the attentive eye like the soft luster of an evening sky yet if perchance excited to defend the injured merit of an absent friend that gentle spirit roused to virtuous ire indignant flashed resentments noble fire though just observance in thy life may trace a lovely model of each moral grace thy last of days the noblest lesson taught severe instruction and too dearly bought whose force from memory never can depart but while it mends must agonize the heart though thy shrunk nerves were destined to sustain the increasing horrors of slowwasting pain those spiritquenching pangs whose base control cloud the clear temper and exhaust the soul yet in that hour when death asserts his claim and his strong summons shakes the conscious frame when weaker minds by frantic fear overthrown shrink in wild horror from the dread unknown thy firmer soul with christian strength renewed nor lost in languor nor by pain subdued while thy cold grasp the hand of friendship pressed and her vain aid in faultring accents blessed with awe but not as superstitions slave surveyed the gathering shadows of the grave and to thy god in death devoutly paid that calm obedience which thy life displayed thou friend yet left me of the choicer few whom griefs fond eyes with growing love review o thou whom mutual sorrow will incline to mix thy sympathetic sighs with mine still be it ours to pay with just regret at friendships sacred shrine our common debt though doomed so heaven ordains to see no more the gentle being whom we both deplore painting shall still sweet soothing art supply a form so precious in affections eye ah little thought we in that happier hour when our gay muse rehearsed the pencils power to mourn that form in cold obstruction laid and see him only by the pencils aid blessed be that pencil every art be blessed that stamps his image deeper on our breast often let us loiter on his favorite hill whose shades the sadlypleasing thought instill recount his kindness as we fondly rove and meet his spirit in the lonely grove at evenings pensive hour or opening day he yet shall seem the partner of our way blessed spirit still through fancys ear impart the calm of virtue to the troubled heart correct each sordid view each vain desire and touch the mortal with celestial fire so may we still in this dark scene of earth hold sweet communion with thy living worth and while our purer thoughts thy merit scan revere the angel as we loved the man finis
