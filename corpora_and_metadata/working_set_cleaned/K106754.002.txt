a simple story in four volumes by mrs inchbald  vol ii  london printed for g g j and j robinson paternoster row m dcc xci  a simple story chapter i when miss milner arrived at bath she thought it the most altered place she ever saw  she was mistaken  it was she herself who was changed  the walks were melancholy the company insipid the ballroom fatigueing  in fine she had left behind all that could charm or please her  though she found herself far less happy than when she was at bath before yet she felt she would not to enjoy all that past happiness be again reduced to the being she was at that time thus does the lover consider the extinction of his passion with the same horror as the libertine looks upon annihilation the one would rather live hereafter though in all the tortures with which his future state is described than cease to exist so there are no tortures a lover would not suffer rather than cease to love  in the wide prospect of melancholy before her miss milners fancy caught hold of the only comfort which presented itself and this slender as it was in the total absence of every other her imagination pictured as excessive the comfort was a letter from miss woodley  a letter wherein the subject of her love would most assuredly be mentioned and in whatever terms must still be the means of delight  a letter arrived  she devoured it with her eyes  the post mark on the outside denoting from whence it came the name of milner lodge written on the top were all sources of pleasure  and she read slowly every line it contained to procrastinate the pleasing expectation she enjoyed till she should arrive at the name of dorriforth at last her impatient eye caught the word three lines beyond the place she was reading  irresistibly she skipped over those lines and fixed on the point to which she was attracted  miss woodley was cautious in her indulgence she made the slightest mention of dorriforth saying only he was extremely concerned and even dejected at the little hope there was of his cousin lord elmwoods recovery  short and trivial as this passage was it was still more important to miss milner than any other in the letter  she read it again and again considered and reflected upon it  dejected thought she what does that word exactly mean  did i ever see mr dorriforth dejected  how i wonder does he look in that state  thus did she muse while the cause of his dejection though a most serious one and pathetically described by miss woodley scarce arrested her attention once  she run over with haste the account of lord elmwoods state of health she certainly pitied him while she thought of him but she did not think of him long to die was a hard fate for a young nobleman just in possession of his immense fortune and on the eve of marriage with a beautiful young woman but miss milner thought heaven might be still better than all this and she had no doubt but his lordship would go there the forlorn state of miss fenton ought to have been a subject for compassion but she knew that lady had resignation to bear any lot with patience and that a trial of her fortitude might be more flattering to her vanity than to be countess of elmwood in a word she saw nobodys misfortunes equal to her own because she saw no one so little able to bear misfortune  she replied to miss woodleys letter and dwelt very long on that subject which miss woodley had taken care to pass over lightly this was another indulgence and to hear from and to write to her friend were now the only enjoyments she possessed from bath miss milner paid several festive visits with lady luneham  all were alike tedious and melancholy  but her guardian wrote to her and though the subject was sorrowful the letter gave her joy  the sentiments it expressed were but trite and commonplace yet she valued them as the dearest effusions of friendship and affection and her hand trembled and her heart beat with rapture while she wrote the answer though she knew it would not be received with one emotion such as those which she experienced in her second letter to miss woodley she prayed like a person insane to be taken home from confinement and like a lunatic protested in sensible language she had no disorder but her friend replied that very declaration proves its violence and assured her that nothing less than placing her affections elsewhere should induce her to believe but that she was incurable  miss woodleys third letter acquainted miss milner with the death of lord elmwood  miss woodley was exceedingly affected by this event and said little else on any other subject  miss milner was shocked when she read the words he is dead and for a moment thought how transient are all sublunary things  within a few years i shall be dead  and how felicitous will it then be if i have resisted every temptation to the delusive pleasures of this life  the happiness of a peaceful death occupied her contemplation for near an hour but at length every virtuous and pious sentiment this meditation inspired served but to remind her of the many sentences she had heard fall from her guardians lips upon the same subject  her thoughts were again fixed on him and she could think of nothing beside  in a very short time after her health became impaired from the indisposition of her mind she languished and was once in imminent danger during a slight delirium of her fever miss woodleys name and her guardians were repeated incessantly lady luneham sent them immediate word of this and they both hastened to bath and arrived there just as her disorder had taken a most favorable turn as soon as she became perfectly recollected her first care was knowing the frailty of her heart to enquire what she had uttered while delirious  miss woodley who was by her bedside begged her not to be alarmed on that account and assured her she knew from all her attendants that she had only spoken with a friendly remembrance as was really the case of those persons who were dear to her  she wished to know whether her guardian was come to see her but she had not the courage to ask before miss woodley and her friend was afraid by the too sudden mention of his name to discompose her her woman however after some little time entered the chamber and whispered miss woodley miss milner asked inquisitively what she said and the woman going to her replied softly lord elmwood madam would wish to come and see you for a few moments if you will allow him miss milner turned her head and stared wildly  i thought said she i thought lord elmwood had been dead  are my senses disordered still  no my dear answered miss woodley it is the present lord elmwood who wishes to see you he whom you left ill when you came hither is dead  and who is the present lord elmwood she asked  miss woodley after a short hesitation replied  your guardian  and so he is cried miss milner he is the next heir  i had forgot  but is it possible he is here  yes   returned miss woodley with a grave voice and manner to moderate that glow of satisfaction which for a moment sparkled even in her languid eye and blushed over her pallid countenance  yes  as he heard you were ill he thought it right to come and see you  he is very good answered she and the tears started in her eyes  would you please to admit his lordship asked her woman  not yet not yet she replied let me recollect myself first and she looked with a timid doubt upon her friend to ask if it was proper  miss woodley could scarce support this humble reference to her judgment from the wan face of the poor invalid and taking her by the hand whispered in tears you shall do what you please  in a few minutes lord elmwood was introduced  to those who sincerely love every change of situation or circumstances in the object beloved appears an advantage  so the acquisition of a title and estate was in miss milners eye an immeasurable advantage to her guardian not on the score of their real value but any change instead of diminishing her passion would have served but to increase it  even a change to the utmost poverty  when he entered  the sight of him seemed to be too much for her and after the first glance she turned her head away  the sound of his voice encouraged her however to look once more  and now she rivited her eyes upon him  it is impossible my dear miss milner he gently whispered to say the joy i feel that your disorder has subsided  but though it was impossible to say it was possible to look what he felt and his looks expressed his feelings  in the zeal of those sensations he laid hold of her hand and held it between his  this he himself did not know  but she did  you have prayed for me my lord i dare say said she with a smile of thanks for those prayers  fervently ardently  returned he and the fervency with which he prayed spoke in every feature  but i am a protestant my lord and if i had died such do you believe i should have gone to heaven  most assuredly that would not have prevented you  but mr sandford does not think so  he must for he means to go there himself  to keep her guardian with her miss milner seemed inclined to converse but miss woodley perceived the temporal as well as the spiritual evil of this and advised his lordship to retire  they had only one more interview before he left the place at which miss milner was capable of sitting up  he was with her however but a very short time some necessary concerns relative to the late lord elmwoods affairs calling him in haste to london miss woodley continued with her friend till she saw her entirely reinstated in her health during which time his lordship was frequently the subject of their private conversation and upon those occasions miss milner has sometimes brought miss woodley to acknowledge that could mr dorriforth have foreseen the early death of the late lord elmwood it had been for the greater honor of his religion considering that ancient title would now after him become extinct had he preferred marriage vows to those of celibacy  chapter ii when the time for miss woodley to depart arrived miss milner entreated earnestly to accompany her home and made the most solemn promises that she would guard not only her behavior but her very thoughts within the limitation her friend should prescribe miss woodley at length yielded thus much that as soon as lord elmwood was set out on his journey to italy where she had heard him say he should shortly be obliged to go she would no longer deny her the pleasure of returning and if after the long absence which must consequently take place between him and her she should then positively affirm the suppression of her passion was the happy result she would at that time take her word and risk the danger of their once more residing together  with this concession on the side of miss woodley they parted and as winter was now far advanced that lady returned to her aunts house in town from whence mrs horton was however preparing to remove in order to superintend lord elmwoods house which had been occupied by the late earl in grosvenorsquare and miss woodley was to accompany her  if lord elmwood was not desirous miss milner should conclude her visit and return to his protection it was partly from the multiplicity of affairs in which he was at this time engaged and partly from having mr sandford now entirely placed with him as his chaplain for he dreaded that living in the same house their natural antipathy might be increased to aversion  upon this account he once thought of advising mr sandford to take up his abode elsewhere but the great pleasure his lordship took in his society joined to the great mortification he knew such a proposal would be to his friend would not suffer him to make it  miss milner all this time was not thinking upon those she hated but on those she loved  sandford never came into her thoughts while the image of lord elmwood never left them one morning as she sat talking to lady luneham on various subjects but thinking alone on him sir harry with another gentleman a mr fleetmond came in and the conversation turned upon the great improbability there was during the present lord elmwoods youth that he should ever inherit the title and estate that had now fallen to him  and said mr fleetmond independent of the fortune it must be matter of infinite joy to dorriforth  no answered sir harry independent of the fortune it must be a motive of concern to him for he must now regret beyond measure his folly in taking priests orders  thus depriving himself of the hopes of an heir by which the title at his death will be lost  by no means replied mr fleetmond he may yet have an heir for he will certainly marry  marry cried sir harry  yes answered the other it was that i meant by the joy it might probably give him beyond the possession of his estate and title  how be married said lady luneham has he not taken a vow never to marry  yes answered mr fleetmond but there are no religious vows from which the great pontiff of rome cannot grant a dispensation  those commandments made by the church the church has always the power to dispense withal and when it is for the general good of religion his holiness thinks it incumbent on him to publish his bull to remit all pains and penalties for their nonobservance and certainly it is for the honor of the catholics that this earldom should continue in a catholic family  in short i will lay a wager my lord elmwood is married within the twelvemonth  miss milner who listened with attention feared she was in a dream or deceived by the pretended knowledge of mr fleetmond who might know nothing  but on consideration all that he had said was very probable and to confirm its truth he was himself a roman catholic and must be well informed on the subject upon which he spoke  if she had heard the direst news that ever sounded in the ears of the most susceptible of mortals the agitation of her mind and person could not have been stronger  she felt while every word was speaking a chill through all her veins  it was a pleasure too exquisite not to bear along with it the sensation of exquisite pain of which she was so sensible that for a few moments it caused her to wish she had not heard the intelligence though very soon after she would not but have heard it for the world  as soon as she had recovered from her first astonishment and joy she wrote to miss woodley an exact account of what she had heard and received this answer  i am sorry any body should have given you this piece of information because it was a task in the executing of which i had promised myself the most extreme satisfaction  but the fear your health was not sufficiently returned to support without danger the burden of hopes which i knew would upon this occasion press upon you i deferred my pleasing communication and have had it anticipated yet as you seem in the utmost doubt as to the truth of what you have been told perhaps this confirmation of it may fall little short of the first news especially when it is strengthened by my entreating you to come to us as soon as you can with propriety leave lady luneham  come my dear miss milner and find in your once rigid monitor a faitful confident  i will no longer threaten to disclose a secret you have trusted me with but leave it to the wisdom and sensibility of his heart who is now to penetrate into the hearts of our sex in search of one consonant to his own to find it out  i no longer condemn but congratulate you on your passion and will assist you with all my advice and earnest wishes that you may obtain a return  this letter was another of those excruciating pleasures that nearly reduced miss milner to the grave  it took away from her all appetite to food and from her eyes the power of being closed for several nights  she thought so much upon the prospect of accomplishing her wishes that she could think of nothing beside not even invent a probable excuse for leaving lady luneham before the appointed time which was yet two months to come she wrote to miss woodley to beg her contrivance to reproach her for keeping the secret so long from her and to thank her for having revealed it to her in so kind a manner at last  she begged also to be acquainted how mr dorriforth for still she called him by that name spoke and thought of this sudden change in his destiny  miss woodleys reply was a summons for her to town upon some pretended business which she avoided explaining but which entirely silenced her ladyships entreaties for her stay  to her question concerning lord elmwood she answered it is a subject on which he seldom speaks  he appears just the same he ever did nor could you by any part of his conduct conceive that any such change had taken place miss milner exclaimed to herself i am glad he is not altered  if his words looks or manners were any thing different from what they formerly were i should not like him so well and just the reverse would have been the case had miss woodley sent her word he was changed the day for her leaving bath was fixed she expected it with rapture but before its arrival sunk under the care of expectation and when it came was so much indisposed as to be forced to defer her journey for a week  at length she found herself in london  in the house of her guardian  and that guardian no longer bound to a single life but enjoined to marry he appeared in her eyes as in miss woodleys the same as ever or perhaps more endearing than ever as it was the first time she had beheld him with hope  mr sandford did not appear the same yet he was in reality as surly and as disrespectful in his behavior to her as usual but she did not observe or she did not feel his morose temper as heretofore  he seemed amiable mild and gentle at least such was the happy medium through which she saw him now for good humor like the jaundice makes every one of its own complexion  chapter iii lord elmwood was preparing to go abroad to receive in form the dispensation from his vows it was however a subject he seemed carefully to avoid speaking upon and when by any accident he was obliged to mention it it was without any marks either of satisfaction or concern  miss milners pride for the first time began to take the alarm  while he was mr dorriforth and confined to a single life his indifference to her charms was rather an honorable than a reproachful trait in his character and in reality she admired him for the insensibility  but on the eve of being at liberty and on the eve of making his choice she was offended that choice was not immediately fixed upon her  she had been accustomed to receive the devotion of every man who saw her and not to obtain it of the man from whom of all others she most wished it was cruelly humiliating  she complained to miss woodley who advised her to have patience but that was one of the virtues in which she was the least practiced  encouraged nevertheless by her friend in the commendable desire of gaining the affections of him who possessed all here is she however left no means unattempted to make the conquest  but she began with too great certainty of success not to be sensible of the deepest mortification in the disappointment  nay she anticipated a disappointment as she had before anticipated her success and by turns felt the keenest emotions from hope and from despair  as these passions alternately governed her she was alternately in spirits or dejected in good or in ill humor and the frequent vicissitudes of her prospects at length gave to her behavior an air of capriciousness which not all her follies had till now produced  this was not the way to secure the affections of lord elmwood she knew it was not and before him she was under some restriction  sandford observed this and added to her many other failings hypocrisy it was plain to see mr sandford esteemed her less and less every day and as he was the person who most of all influenced the opinion of her guardian he became to her very soon an object not merely of dislike but of abhorrence  these sentiments for each other were discoverable in every word and action while they were in each others company but still in his absence miss milners good nature and little malice never suffered her to utter a sentence injurious to his interest  sandfords charity did not extend thus far and speaking of her with severity one evening while she was at the opera his meaning as he said but to caution her guardian against her faults lord elmwood replied  there is one fault however mr sandford i cannot lay to her charge  and what is that my lord cried sandford eagerly what is that one fault which miss milner has not  i never replied his lordship heard miss milner in your absence utter a syllable to your disadvantage  she durst not my lord because she is in fear of you and she knows you would not suffer it  she then answered his lordship pays me a much higher compliment than you do for you freely censure her and yet imagine i will suffer it  my lord replied sandford i am undeceived now and shall never take that liberty again  as his lordship always treated sandford with the utmost respect he began to fear he had been deficient upon this occasion and the disposition which had induced him to take his wards part was likely in the end to prove unfavourable to her for perceiving sandford was offended at what had passed as the only means of retribution his lordship began himself to lament her volatile and captious propensities in which lamentation sandford now forgetting his affront joined with the heartiest concurrence adding  that you sir having now other cares to employ your thoughts ought to insist upon her marrying or her retiring wholly into the country  she returned home just as this conversation was finished and sandford the moment she entered rung for his candle to retire miss woodley who had been at the opera with miss milner cried  bless me mr sandford are you not well you are going to leave us so early  he replied no i have a pain in my head  miss milner who never heard complaints without sympathy rose immediately from her seat saying  i think i never heard you mr sandford complain of indisposition before  will you accept of my specific for the headache indeed it is a certain relief  i will fetch it instantly  she went hastily out of the room and returned with a bottle which she assured him was a present from lady luneham and would certainly cure him  and she pressed it upon him with such an anxious earnestness that with all his churlishness he could not refuse taking it  this was but a commonplace civility such as is paid by one enemy to another every day but the manner was the material part  the unaffected concern the attention the good will she demonstrated in this little incident was that which was remarkable and which immediately took from lord elmwood the displeasure to which he had been just before excited or rather transformed it into a degree of admiration even sandford was not insensible to her behavior and in return when he left the room wished her a good night  to her and to miss woodley who had not been witnesses of the preceding conversation what she had done appeared of no merit but to the mind of lord elmwood it had much and upon the departure of sandford he began to be unusually cheerful he first reproached the ladies for not offering him a place in their box at the opera  would you have gone my lord asked miss milner highly delighted  certainly returned he had you invited me  then from this day my lord i give you a general invitation nor shall any other company be admitted but what you approve  i am very much obliged to you answered his lordship  and you continued she who have been only accustomed to churchmusick will be more than any one enchanted on hearing the soft harmonious sounds of love  what ravishing pleasures are you preparing for me returned he i know not whether my weak senses will be able to support them  she had her eyes upon him as he spoke this and discovered in his which were fixed upon her a sensibility unexpected  a kind of fascination which enticed her to look on while her eyelids fell involuntarily before its mighty force and a thousand blushes crowded over her face  he was struck with these sudden signals hastily recalled his former countenance and stopped the conversation  miss woodley who had been a silent observer for some time now thought a word or two from her would be acceptable rather than troublesome  and pray my lord said she when do you go to france  to italy you mean  said he not at all  my superiors are very indulgent for they dispense with all my duties  i ought and meant to have gone abroad but as variety of concerns require my presence in england every necessary ceremony has taken place here  then your lordship is no longer in orders said miss woodley  no they have been resigned these five days  my lord i give you joy said miss milner  he thanked her but added with a sigh if i have given up content in search of joy i shall probably be a loser by the venture  soon after this he wished the ladies good night and retired  happy as miss milner found herself in his company she saw him leave the room with infinite satisfaction because her heart was impatient to give a loose to its hopes on the bosom of miss woodley  she bid mrs horton immediately good night and in her friends apartment gave way to all the language of the tenderest passion warm with the confidence of meeting its return  she described the sentiments she had read in lord elmwoods looks and though miss woodley had beheld them too miss milners fancy heightened every glance and her construction became by degrees so extremely favorable to her own wishes that had not her friend been present and known in what measure to estimate those symptoms she must infalliably have thought by the joy to which they gave birth his lordship had openly avowed a passion for her  miss woodley therefore thought it her duty to allay those extacies and represented to her she might be deceived in her hopes  or even supposing his lordships inclinations tended toward her there were yet great obstacles between them  would sandford who governed or at least directed his almost every thought and purpose not be consulted upon this and if he was on what but the most romantic affection on the part of lord elmwood had miss milner to depend and his lordship was not a man to be suspected of submitting to the excess of any passion  thus did miss woodley argue for fear her friend should be misled by her wishes yet in her own mind she scarce harbored a doubt that any thing would thwart them  the succeeding circumstance proved she was mistaken  another gentleman of family and fortune made overtures to miss milner and her guardian so far from having his thoughts inclined toward her on his own account pleaded this lovers cause even with more zeal than he had formerly pleaded for sir edward and lord frederick and thus at once destroyed all those plans of happiness poor miss milner had meditated  in consequence her melancholy humor was now predominant and for several days she staid entirely at home and yet was denied to all her visitants  whether this arose from pure melancholy or the still lingering hope of making her conquest by that sedateness of manners she knew her guardian admired perhaps she herself did not know  be that as it may lord elmwood could not but observe this change and one morning thought fit to mention and applaud it  miss woodley and she were working together when he came into the room and after sitting several minutes and talking upon indifferent subjects to which his ward replied with a dejection in her voice and manner  he said  perhaps i am wrong miss milner but i have observed you are lately grown more thoughtful than usual  she blushed as she always did when the subject was herself  he continued your health appears perfectly restored and yet you do not take delight in your former recreations  are you sorry for that my lord  no madam i am extremely glad and i was going to congratulate you upon the change  but give me leave to enquire to what lucky accident we are to attribute this alteration  your lordship then thinks all my commendable deeds arise from accident and that i have no virtues of my own  pardon me miss milner i think you have many this he spoke emphatically and the blood flowed to her face more than at first  he resumed  how can i doubt of a ladys virtues when her countenance gives such evident proofs of them  believe me miss milner that in the midst of your gayest follies while you thus continue to blush i shall reverence your internal sensations  oh my lord did you know some of them i am afraid you would think them unpardonable  this was so much to the purpose miss woodley found herself uneasy  but she needed not  miss milner loved too sincerely to reveal it to the object  his lordship answered  and did you miss milner know some of mine you might think them equally unpardonable  she turned pale and could no longer guide her needle  in the fond transports of her heart she imagined the sensations to which he alluded was his love for her  she was too much embarrassed to reply and he continued  we have all a great deal to pardon in one another and i know not whether the officious person who forces even his good advice is not as blameable as the obstinate one who will not listen to it  and now having made a preface to excuse you should you once more refuse mine i will venture to give it  my lord returned she i have never yet refused to follow your advice but where my own peace of mind was so nearly concerned as to have made me culpable had i complied  well madam i submit to your determinations and shall never again oppose your inclination to remain single  this sentence as it excluded his ever soliciting for himself gave her the utmost pain and she cast a glance of her eye at him full of reproach  he did not observe it but went on  continuing unmarried it seems to have been your fathers intention you should continue under my immediate care but as i mean for the future to reside chiefly in the country  answer me heartily do you think you could be happy there for at least three parts of the year  after a short hesitation she replied  i have no objection  i am glad to hear it he returned eagerly for it is my earnest desire to have you with me  your welfare is dear to me as my own and were we apart continual apprehensions would prey upon my mind  the tear started in her eye at the earnestness with which this was spoken  he saw it and to soften her still more with the sense of his esteem for her he increased his earnestness while he said  if you will take the resolution to quit london for the time i mention there shall be no means unemployed to make the country all you can wish  i shall insist upon miss woodleys accompanying you and it will not only be my study to form such a society as you may approve but i am certain it will be likewise the study of lady elmwood    he was going on but as if a poniard had thrust her heart she writhed under this unexpected stroke  he saw her countenance change  he looked at her steadfastly  it was not a common change from joy to sorrow from content to uneasiness which miss milner discovered  she felt and she expressed anguish  lord elmwood was alarmed and shocked  she did not weep but she called miss woodley to come to her with a voice that indicated a degree of agony  my lord cried miss woodley seeing his consternation and trembling lest he should guess the secret my lord miss milner has again deceived you  you must not take her from london  it is that which is the cause of her uneasiness  he seemed more amazed still and still more shocked at her duplicity than at her torture  good heaven exclaimed he how am i to accomplish her wishes what am i to do how can i judge while she will not confide in me but thus grossly deceives me  she leaned pale as death on the shoulder of miss woodley her eyes fixed with a seeming insensibility to all that was said while he continued  heaven is my witness if i knew  if i could conceive the means how to make her happy i would sacrifice my own happiness to here is  my lord cried miss woodley with a smile perhaps i may call upon you hereafter to fulfill your word  he was totally ignorant what she meant nor had he leisure from the confusion of his thoughts to reflect upon her meaning he nevertheless replied with warmth do  you will find i will perform it  do  i will faithfully perform it  though miss milner was conscious this declaration could not in delicacy ever be brought against him yet the fervent and solemn manner in which he made it cheered her spirits and as persons enjoy the reflection of having in their possession some valuable gem although they are determined never to use it so she upon this was comforted and grew better  she now lifted up her head from miss woodley and leaned it on her hand as she sat by the side of a table  still she did not speak but seemed overcome with sorrow  as her situation became however less alarming her guardians pity and affright began to take the color of resentment and though he did not say so he was and looked highly offended  at this juncture mr sandford entered  on beholding the present party it needed not his sagacity to see at the first view they were all uneasy but instead of the sympathy this might have excited in some dispositions mr sandford after casting a look at each of them appeared in high spirits  you seem unhappy my lord said he with a smile  you do not  mr sandford replied his lordship  no my lord nor would i were i in your situation  returned he what should make a man of sense out of temper but a worthy object  and he looked at miss milner  there are no objects unworthy our care replied lord elmwood  but there are objects on whom all care is fruitless your lordship will allow  i never yet despaired of any one mr sandford  and yet there are persons of whom it is presumption to entertain hopes  and he looked again at miss milner  does your head ach miss milner asked miss woodley seeing her hold it with her hand  very much returned she  mr sandford said miss woodley did you use all those drops miss milner gave you for a pain in the head  yes answered he i did  but the question at that moment somewhat embarrassed him  and i hope you found benefit from them said miss milner with great kindness as she rose from her seat and walked slowly and despondently out of the room  though miss woodley followed her so that mr sandford was left alone with lord elmwood and might have continued his unkind insinuations without one restraint yet his lips were closed for the present  he looked down on the carpet  twitched himself upon his chair  and began to talk of the weather  chapter iv as soon as the first transports of despair were over miss milner suffered herself to be once more in hope  she found there were no other means to support her life and to her no small joy her friend miss woodley was much less severe on the present occasion than she expected  no engagement between mortals was in miss woodleys opinion binding like that entered into with heaven and whatever vows lord elmwood had made to another she justly supposed no womans love for him equalled miss milners  it was prior to all others too and that established a claim at least to contend for success and in a contention what rival would not fall before her  it was not difficult to guess who this rival was or if they were a little time in suspense miss woodley soon arrived at the certainty by inquiring of mr sandford who unsuspicious why she asked readily informed her the intended lady elmwood was no other than miss fenton and that her marriage with his lordship would be solemnized as soon as the mourning for the late lord elmwood was expired  this last intelligence made miss woodley shudder  however she repeated it to miss milner word for word  happy happy woman exclaimed miss milner of miss fenton she has received the first fond impulses of his heart and has had the transcendent happiness of teaching him to love  by no means returned miss woodley finding there was no other method to comfort her do not suppose lord elmwoods marriage is the result of love  it is no more than a duty a necessary piece of business and this you may plainly see by the wife on whom he has fixed  miss fenton was thought a proper match for his cousin and this same propriety you must perceive still exists  it was easy to convince miss milner all her friend said was truth for she wished it to be so and oh she exclaimed could i but stimulate passion in the place of propriety  do you think my dear miss woodley and she looked with such begging eyes it was impossible not to answer as she wished do you think it would be unjust to miss fenton were i to inspire her destined husband with a passion which she may not have inspired and which i believe she herself cannot feel  miss woodley paused a minute and then answered no  but there was a hesitation in her manner of delivery  she did say no but she looked as if she was afraid she ought to have said yes  miss milner however did not wait to give her time to recall the word or to alter its meaning by adding others to it but run on eagerly and declared as that was her opinion she would abide by it and do all she could to supplant her rival  in order nevertheless to justify this determination and satisfy the conscience of miss woodley they both concluded miss fentons heart was not engaged in the intended marriage and consequently she was indifferent whether it took place or not  since the death of the late earl that young lady had not been in town nor had the present lord been near the spot where she resided since the week her lover died of course nothing like love could be declared at so early a period and if it had been made known since it must only have been by letter or by the deputation of mr sandford whom they knew had been once in the country to visit her but how little he was qualified to enforce a tender passion was a comfortable reflection  revived with these conjectures of which some were true and others false the very next day a dark gloom overspread their bright prospects on mr sandfords saying as he entered the breakfastroom  miss fenton ladies desired me to present her compliments to you  is she in town asked mrs horton  she came to town yesterday morning returned sandford and is at her brothers in ormond street my lord and i supped there last night and that made us so late home  his lordship entered soon after and confirmed what had been said by bowing to his ward and telling her miss fenton had charged him with her kindest respects  how does poor miss fenton look mrs horton asked lord elmwood  to which question sandford replied beautiful  she looks beautifully  she has got over her uneasiness i suppose then said mrs horton  not knowing she was asking the question before her new lover  uneasy replied sandford uneasy at any trial this world can send that had been highly unworthy of her  but sometimes women do fret at such things replied mrs horton innocently  lord elmwood asked miss milner  if she meant to ride this charming day  while she was hesitating   there are very different kind of women answered sandford directing his discourse to mrs horton there is as much difference between some women as between good and evil spirits  lord elmwood asked miss milner again  if she took an airing  she replied no  and beauty continued sandford when endowed upon spirits that are evil is a mark of their greater their more extreme wickedness  lucifer was the most beautiful of all the angels in paradise    how do you know said miss milner  but the beauty of lucifer continued sandford in perfect neglect and contempt of her question was an aggravation of his guilt because it showed a double share of ingratitude to the divine creator of that beauty  now you talk of angels said miss milner i wish i had wings and i should like to fly through the park this morning  you would be taken for an angel in good earnest said lord elmwood  sandford was angry at this little compliment and cried then instead of the wings i would advise the serpents skin  my lord cried she does not mr sandford use me ill  vexed with other things she felt herself extremely hurt at this and made the appeal almost in tears  indeed i think he does answered his lordship and he looked at sandford as if he was displeased  this was a triumph so agreeable to her she immediately pardoned the offense but the offender did not so easily pardon her  good morning ladies said his lordship rising to go away  my lord said miss woodley you promised miss milner to accompany her one evening to the opera this is opera night  will you go my lord asked miss milner in a voice so soft he seemed as if he wished but could not resist it  i am to dine at mr fentons today he replied and if he and his sister will go and you will allow them part of your box i will promise to come  this was a condition that did not please her but as she felt a strong desire to see him in the company of his intended bride for she fancied she could perceive his most secret sentiments could she once see them together she answered not ungraciously yes my compliments to mr and miss fenton and i hope they will favor me with their company  then madam if they come you may expect me  else not and he bowed and left the room  all the day was passed in anxious expectation by miss milner what would be the event of the evening for upon the skill of her penetration that evening all her future prospects she thought depended  if she saw by his looks his words or assiduity he loved miss fenton she flattered herself she would never think of him again with hope but if she observed him treat her with inattention or indifference she meant to cherish from that moment the fondest expectations  against that short evening her toilet was consulted the whole day and the alternate hope and fear which fluttered at her heart gave a more than usual brilliancy to her eyes and more than usual bloom to her complexion  but in vain was her beauty vain all the pains she had taken to decorate that beauty vain the many looks she cast toward her boxdoor to see it open lord elmwood did not come  the music was discord  every thing she saw was disgusting  in a word she was miserable  she longed impatiently for the curtain to drop because she was uneasy where she was  yet she asked herself shall i be less unhappy at home yes at home i shall see lord elmwood and that will be happiness  but he will behold me with neglect and that will be misery  ungrateful man i will no longer think of him she said to herself  or could she have thought of him without joining in the same idea miss fenton her anguish had been supportable but while she pictured them as lovers the tortures of the rack give but a few degrees more pain than she endured  there are but few persons who ever felt the real passion of jealousy because few have felt the real passion of love but to those who have experienced them both jealousy not only affects the mind but every fiber of the frame is a victim to it and miss milners every limb ached with agonizing torment while miss fenton courted and beloved by lord elmwood was present to her imagination  the moment the opera was finished she flew hastily down stairs as if to fly from the sufferings she experienced  she did not go into the coffeeroom though repeatedly persuaded by miss woodley but waited at the door till her carriage drew up  piqued  heartbroken  full of resentment to the object of her uneasiness as she stood inattentive to all that passed a hand gently laid hold of here is and the most humble and insinuating voice said will you permit me to hand you to your carriage she was awaked from her reverie and found lord frederick lawnly by her side  her heart just then melting with tenderness to another was perhaps more accessible than heretofore or bursting with resentment thought this the moment to retaliate whatever passion reigned that instant it was favorable to the desires of lord frederick and she looked as if she was glad to see him he beheld this with the rapture and the humility of a lover and though she did not feel the slightest love in return she felt a gratitude proportionate to the insensibility with which she had been treated by her guardian and lord frederick was not very erroneous if he mistook this gratitude for a latent spark of affection the mistake however did not force from him his respect he handed her to her carriage bowed lowly and disappeared miss woodley wished to divert her thoughts from the object which could only make her wretched and as they rode home by many encomiums upon lord frederick endeavored to incite her to a regard for him miss milner was displeased at the attempt and exclaimed  what love a rake a man of professed gallantry impossible  to me a common rake is as odious as a common prostitute is to a man of the nicest feelings  where can be the pride of inspiring a passion fifty others can equally inspire or the transport of bestowing favors where the appetite is already cloyed by fruition of the selfsame enjoyments  strange cried miss woodley that you who possess so many follies incident to your sex should in the disposal of your heart have sentiments so contrary to women in general  my dear miss woodley returned she put in competition the languid love of a debauchee with the vivid affection of a sober man and judge which has the dominion oh in my calender of love a solemn lord chief justice or a devout archbishop ranks before a licentious king  miss woodley smiled at an opinion which she knew half her sex would laugh at but by the air of sincerity with which it was delivered she was convinced her late behavior to lord frederick was but the mere effect of chance  lord elmwoods carriage drove to his door just at the time here is did mr sandford was with him and they were both come from passing the evening at mr fentons  so my lord said miss woodley as soon as they met in the apartment you did not come to us  no answered his lordship i was sorry but i hope you did not expect me  not expect you my lord cried miss milner did not you say you would come  if i had i certainly should have come returned he but i only said so conditionally  that i am witness to cried sandford for i was present at the time and his lordship said it should depend upon miss fenton  and she with her gloomy disposition said miss milner chose to sit at home  gloomy disposition repeated sandford she is a young lady with a great share of sprightliness  and i think i never saw her in better spirits than she was this evening my lord  lord elmwood did not speak  bless me mr sandford cried miss milner i meant no reflection upon miss fentons disposition i only meant to censure her taste for staying at home  i think replied sandford a much greater censure should be passed upon those who prefer rambling abroad  but i hope ladies my not coming said his lordship was no cause of inconvenience to you you had still a gentleman with you or i should certainly have come  oh yes two gentlemen answered the young son of lady evans a lad from school whom miss milner had taken along with her and to whom his lordship had alluded  what two asked lord elmwood  neither miss milner or miss woodley answered  you know madam said young evans that handsome gentleman who handed you into your carriage and you called my lord  oh he means lord frederick lawnley said miss milner carelessly but a blush of shame spread over her face  and did he hand you into your coach asked his lordship earnestly  by mere accident my lord miss woodley replied for the crowd was so great    i think my lord said sandford it was very lucky you were not there  had lord elmwood been with us we should not have had occasion for the assistance of any other said miss milner  lord elmwood has been with you madam returned sandford very frequently and yet    mr sandford said his lordship interrupting him it is near bedtime your conversation keeps the ladies from retiring  your lordships does not said miss milner for you say nothing  because madam i am afraid to offend  but does not your lordship also hope to please and without risking the one it is impossible to arrive at the other  i think at present the risk of one would be too hazardous and so i wish you a good night and he went out of the room somewhat abruptly  lord elmwood said miss milner is very grave  he does not look like a man who has been passing his evening with the woman he loves  perhaps he is melancholy at parting from her said miss woodley  more likely offended said sandford at the manner in which that lady has spoken of her  who i cried miss milner i protest i said nothing but    nothing madam did not you say she was gloomy  but what i thought  i was going to add mr sandford  when you think unjustly you should not express your thoughts  then perhaps i should never speak  and it were better you did not if what you say is to give pain  do you know madam that my lord is going to be married to miss fenton  yes answered miss milner  do you know that he loves her  no answered miss milner  how madam do you suppose he does not  i suppose he does yet i dont know it  then supposing he does how can you have the imprudence to find fault with her before him  i did not  to call her gloomy was i knew to praise her both to him and to you who admire such tempers  whatever her temper is every one admires it and so far from its being what you have described she has a great deal of vivacity vivacity which proceeds from the heart  no if it proceeded i should admire it too but it rests there and no one is the better for it  come miss milner said miss woodley it is time to retire you and mr sandford must finish your dispute in the morning  dispute madam said sandford i never disputed with any one beneath a doctor of divinity in my life  i was only cautioning your friend not to make light of virtues which it would do her honor to possess  miss fenton is a most amiable young woman and worthy just such a husband as my lord elmwood will make her  i am sure said miss woodley miss milner thinks so  she has a high opinion of miss fenton  she was at present only jesting  but madam jests are very pernicious things when delivered with a malignant sneer  i have known a jest destroy a ladys reputation  i have known a jest give one person a distaste for another  i have known a jest break off a marriage  but i suppose there is no apprehension of that in the present case said miss woodley  wishing he might answer in the affirmative  not that i can foresee replied he  no heaven forbid for i look upon them to be formed for each other  their dispositions their pursuits their inclinations the same  their passions for each other just the same  pure  white as snow  and i dare say not warmer replied miss milner  he looked provoked beyond measure  dear miss milner cried miss woodley how can you talk thus i believe in my heart you are only envious my lord did not offer himself to you  to her said sandford affecting an air of the utmost surprise to her do you think his lordship received a dispensation from his vows to become the husband of a coquette  a   he was going on  nay mr sandford cried miss milner i believe my greatest crime in your eyes is being a heretic  by no means madam  it is the only circumstance that can apologize for your faults and had you not that excuse there would be none for you  then at present there is an excuse  i thank you mr sandford this is the kindest thing you ever said to me but i am vexed to see you are sorry you have said it  angry at your being a heretic he resumed indeed i should be much more concerned to see you a disgrace to our religion  miss milner had not been in a good humor during the whole evening  she had been provoked to the full extent of her patience several times but this harsh sentence hurried her beyond all bounds and she arose from her seat in the most violent agitation and exclaimed what have i done to be treated thus  though mr sandford was not a man easily intimidated he was on this occasion evidently alarmed and stared about him with so strong an expression of surprise that it partook in some degree of fear  miss woodley clasped her friend in her arms and cried with the tenderest affection and pity my dear miss milner be composed  miss milner sat down and was so for a minute but her dead silence was nearly as alarming to sandford as her rage had been and he did not perfectly recover himself till he saw a flood of tears pouring down her face he then heaved a sigh of content that it had so ended but in his heart resolved never to forget the ridiculous affright into which he had been put  he stole out of the room without uttering a syllable  but as he never retired to rest before he had repeated a long form of evening prayers so when he came to that part which supplicates grace for the wicked he named miss milners name with the most fervent devotion  chapter v among the many sleepless nights miss milner passed the present was not one of them it is true she had a weight of care upon her heart even heavier than usual but its burden had overcome her strength and wearied out with hopes with fears and at the end with disappointment and rage she sunk into a profound slumber as soon as she was laid down  but the more forgetfulness had prevailed the greater was the force of remembrance when she awoke  at first so sound had her sleep been she had a difficulty in calling to mind why she was unhappy but that she was unhappy she well recollected  and when the cause came to her memory she would have slept again but that was impossible  though her rest had been sound it had not been refreshing she was far from well and sent word so as an apology for not being present at breakfast lord elmwood looked concerned when the message was delivered mr sandford shook his head  miss milners health is not good said mrs horton a few minutes after  lord elmwood laid down the newspaper to attend to her  to me there is something very extraordinary about her continued mrs horton finding she had caught his lordships attention  so there is to me added sandford with a sarcastick sneer  and so there is to me said miss woodley with a most serious face and heartfelt sigh  lord elmwood gazed by turns at each as each delivered their sentiments  and when they were all silent he looked bewildered not knowing what judgment to form from any of these sentences  soon after breakfast mr sandford withdrew to his own apartment mrs horton in a little time went to here is and lord elmwood and miss woodley were left alone  his lordship immediately rose from his seat and said  i think miss woodley miss milner was extremely to blame though i did not choose to tell her so before mr sandford in giving my lord frederick an opportunity of speaking to her unless she means he shall renew his addresses  that i am sure my lord replied miss woodley she does not mean  and i assure you my lord seriously it was by mere accident she saw him yesterday evening or permitted him to attend her to her carriage  i am glad to hear it he returned quickly for although i am not of a suspicious nature yet in regard to her affection for him i cannot but have my doubts  you need have none my lord replied miss woodley with a smile of confidence  and yet you must own her behavior has warranted them  has it not been in this particular incoherent undefinable unaccountable  the behavior of a person in love no doubt said mis woodley  dont i say so replied he warmly and is not that a just reason for my suspicions  but is there only one man in the world on whom these suspicions should fix said miss woodley with the color mounting into her face  not that i know of  not one more that i know of returned he with astonishment at what she had insinuated and yet with a perfect assurance she was in the wrong  perhaps i am mistaken replied she  nay that is impossible too   returned he with anxiety you share her confidence you are perpetually with her and provided she did not confide in you you must know must be acquainted with her inclinations  i believe i am perfectly acquainted with them replied miss woodley with a significance in her voice and manner which convinced him there was some secret to learn  after a hesitation  it is far from me replied he to wish to be entrusted with the private sentiments of those who desire to withhold them from me much less would i take any unfair means of being informed of them  to ask any more from you i believe would be unfair  yet i cannot but lament that i am not as well informed as you are  i wish to prove my friendship to miss milner but she will not suffer me  and every step i take for her happiness i take in the most perplexing uncertainty  miss woodley sighed but did not speak  he seemed to wait for her reply but as she made none he proceeded  if ever a breach of confidence could be tolerated i certainly know no occasion that would so justly authorize such a measure as the present  i am not only proper from my character but from my circumstances to be relied upon  my interest is so nearly connected with the interest and my happiness with the happiness of my ward that those principles as well as my honor would protect her from every peril arising from my being trusted  oh my lord cried miss woodley with a most forcible accent  you are the last person on earth she would pardon me for intrusting  why so said he warmly but that is the way  the person who is our friend we misdoubt  where a common interest is concerned we are ashamed of drawing on a common danger  afraid of advice though that advice is to save us  miss woodley said he changing his voice with excess of earnestness do you believe that i would do any thing to make miss milner happy  any thing in honor my lord  she can desire nothing farther  he replied in agitation  are her desires so unwarrantable i cannot grant them  miss woodley again did not speak  and he continued  great as my friendship is there are certainly bounds to it bounds that shall save her in spite of herself  and he raised his voice  in the disposal of themselves resumed he with a less vehement tone that great that terrifick disposal in marriage at which i have ever looked with affright and dismay there is no accounting for the rashness of a womans choice or sometimes for the depravity of her taste  but in such a case miss milners election of a husband shall not direct mine  if she does not know her own value i do  independent of her fortune she has beauty to captivate the heart of any man and with all her follies she has a frankness in her manner an unaffected wisdom in her thoughts a vivacity in her conversation and withal a softness in her demeanor that might alone engage the affections of a man of the nicest sentiments and the strongest understanding  i will not see all these qualities and accomplishments debased  it is my office to protect her from the consequences of a degraded choice and i will  my lord miss milners taste is not a depraved one it is but too much refined  what do you mean by that miss woodley you talk mysteriously  is she not afraid i will thwart her inclinations  she is sure you will my lord  then must not the person be unworthy of her  miss woodley rose from her seat the tears trinkled down her cheeks she clasped her hands and every look every gesture proved her alternate resolution and irresolution of proceeding farther  lord elmwoods attention was arrested before but now it was fixed to a degree which her manner could only occasion  my lord said she with a tremulous voice promise me declare to me swear to me it shall  remain a secret in your own breast and i will reveal to you on whom she has placed her affections  this solemn preparation made lord elmwood tremble and he run over instantly in his mind all the persons he could recollect in order to arrive at the knowledge by thought quicker than by words  it was in vain he tried and he once more turned his enquiring eyes upon miss woodley  he saw her silent and covered with confusion  again he searched his own thoughts nor ineffectually as before  at the first glance the object was presented and he beheld himself  the rapid emotion of varying passions which immediately darted over his features informed miss woodley her secret was discovered  she hid her face while the tears that fell down to her bosom confirmed him in the truth of his suggestion beyond what oaths could have done  a short interval of silenced followed during which she suffered tortures for the manner in which he would next speak to her  two seconds gave her this reply  for gods sake take care what you are doing  you are destroying my prospects of futurity  you are making this world too dear to me  her drooping head was then lifted up and as she caught the eye of dorriforth she saw it beam expectation amaze joy ardour love  nay there was a fire a vehemence in the quick fascinating rays it sent forth she never before had seen  it filled her with alarm  she wished him to love miss milner but to love her with moderation  miss woodley was too little versed in the subject to know that had been not to love at all at least not to the extent of breaking through engagements and all the various obstacles that still militated against their union  lord elmwood was sensible of the embarrassment his presence gave miss woodley and understood the reproaches which she seemed to vent upon herself in silence  to relieve her from both he laid his hand with force upon his heart and said do you believe me  i do my lord she answered trembling  i will make no unjust use of what i know returned he with firmness  i believe you my lord  but for what my passions now dictate continued he i will not answer  they are confused  they are triumphant at present  i have never yet however been vanquished by them and even upon this occasion my reason shall combat to the last  that shall fail me before i do wrong  he was going to leave the room  she followed him and cried  but my lord how shall i see again the unhappy object of my treachery  see her replied he as one to whom you meant no injury and to whom you have done none  but she would account it such my lord  we are not judges of what belongs to ourselves  he replied  i am transported at the tidings you have revealed and yet perhaps i had better never have heard them  miss woodley was going to say something farther but as if incapable of attending to her he hasted out of the room  chapter vi miss woodley stood for some time to consider which way she was to go  the first person she met would enquire why she had been weeping to that excess her eyes were scarce discernible and if miss milner was to ask the question in what words could she tell or in what manner deny the truth  to avoid her was her first caution and she took the only method she had a hackneycoach ordered rode several miles out of town and returned to dinner with so little remains of her swollen eyes that complaining of the headache was a sufficient excuse for them  miss milner was enough recovered to be present at dinner though she scarce tasted a morsel lord elmwood did not dine at home at which miss woodley rejoiced but at which mr sandford appeared highly disappointed  he asked the servants several times what his lordship said when he went out they replied nothing more than that he should not be at home to dinner  i cannot imagine where he dines said sandford  bless me mr sandford cannot you guess cried mrs horton who by this time was made acquainted with his intended marriage he dines with miss fenton to be sure  no replied sandford he is not there i came from thence just now and they had not seen him all day  poor miss milner on this put a mouthful into her mouth for where we hope for nothing we receive small indulgences with joy  notwithstanding the anxiety and trouble under which miss woodley had labored all the morning her heart for many weeks had not felt so light as it did this day at dinner  the confidence she reposed in the promises of lord elmwood  the firm reliance she had upon his delicacy and his justice  the unabated kindness with which her friend received her while no one suspicious thought she knew had taken harbor in her bosom  and the conscious integrity of her own intentions however she might be misled by her judgment all conspired to comfort her with the hope she had done nothing she ought to wish recalled  but although she felt thus tranquil in respect to what she had divulged yet she felt a great deal embarrassed with the dread of next seeing lord elmwood  miss milner not having spirits to go abroad passed the evening at home  she read part of a new opera played upon her guitar mused sighed occasionally talked with miss woodley and so passed the tedious hours till near ten when mrs horton asked mr sandford to play a game at piquet and on his excusing himself miss milner offered in his stead and was gladly accepted  they had just begun to play when lord elmwood came into the room  miss milners countenance immediately brightened and although she was in a negligent morning dress and looked paler than usual she did not look less beautiful  miss woodley was leaning on the back of her chair to observe the game and mr sandford sat reading one of the greek fathers at the other side of the fire place lord elmwood as he advanced to the table bowed not having seen the ladies since morning or miss milner that day they returned his salute and he was going up to miss milner seemingly to enquire of her health when mr sandford laying down his book said  my lord where have you been all day  i have been very busy replied his lordship and walking from the cardtable went up to him  miss milner began to make mistakes and play one card for another  you have been at mr fentons this evening i suppose said sandford  no not at all today replied his lordship  how came that about my lord cried sandford  miss milner played the ace of diamonds instead of the king of hearts  i shall call tomorrow answered his lordship and going with a very ceremonious air up to miss milner said he hoped she was perfectly recovered  mrs horton begged her to mind what she was about  she replied i am much better sir  he then returned to sandford again but never during all this time did his eye once encounter miss woodleys and she with equal care avoided his  some cold dishes were now brought up for supper  miss milner lost deal and the game ended  as they were arranging themselves at the suppertable do miss milner said mrs horton have something warm for your supper a chicken boiled or something of that kind you have eat nothing all day  with the feeling of humanity and apparently no other sensation  but never did he feel philanthropy so forcibly  lord elmwood said let me beg of you miss milner to have something provided for you  the earnestness and emphasis with which these few words were pronounced were more flattering than the finest turned compliment had been her gratitude was expressed by blushes and by assuring his lordship she was now so well as to be able to sup on what was before her  she spoke however and had not made the trial for the moment she carried a piece to her lips she laid it on her plate again and turned paler from the vain endeavor to force her appetite lord elmwood had ever been attentive to her but now he watched her as he would a child and when he saw by her struggles she could not eat he took her plate from her gave her something else and all with a care and watchfulness in his looks as if he had been a tenderhearted boy and she his darling bird the loss of which would embitter all the joy of his holidays  this attention had something about it so tender so officious and yet so sincere that it brought the tears into miss woodleys eyes attracted the notice of mr sandford and the observation of mrs horton while the heart of miss milner overflowed with a gratitude that gave place to no sentiment except her love  to relieve that anxiety her guardian expressed she endeavored to appear cheerful and that anxiety at length really made her so  he now pressed her to take one glass of wine with such solicitude he seemed to say a thousand things beside  sandford still made his observations and being unused to conceal his thoughts before the present company he said bluntly  miss fenton was indisposed the other night my lord and yet you did not seem half so anxious about her health  had sandford laid all lord elmwoods estate at miss milners feet or presented her with that eternal bloom which adorns the face of a goddess he would have done less to endear himself to her than by that single sentence  she looked at him with the most benign countenance and felt affliction that she had ever offended him  miss fenton lord elmwood replied has a brother with her her health and happiness are in his care miss milners are in mine  mr sandford said miss milner i am afraid i behaved very uncivilly to you last night will you accept of an atonement  no madam returned he i accept no expiation without amendment  well then said she smiling suppose i promise never to offend you again what then  why then you will break your promise returned he churlishly  do not promise said lord elmwood for he means to provoke you to it  in the like conversation the evening was passed and miss milner retired to rest in far better spirits than the mornings prospect had given her to hope for miss woodley too had cause to be well pleased but her pleasure was in a great measure eclipsed by the reflection there was such a person as miss fenton she could not but fear that in doing miss milner a right she had perhaps done that lady a wrong  she wished she had been equally acquainted with her heart as she was with miss milners and she would then have acted without injustice to either but miss fenton had of late shunned their society and even in their company she was of a temper too reserved to discover her mind miss woodley was therefore obliged to act to the best of her judgment only and leave all events to providence  chapter vii within a few days in the house of lord elmwood every thing and every person wore a new face  his lordship was the professed lover of miss milner  she the happiest of human beings  miss woodley partaking in her joy  while mr sandford was lamenting with the deepest concern that miss fenton had been supplanted and what added most poignantly to his sorrow was that she had been supplanted by miss milner  though a church man he bore his disappointment with the impatience of one of the laity he could hardly speak to lord elmwood he would not look at miss milner and was displeased with every body  it was his intention when he first became acquainted with lord elmwoods resolution to quit his house and as his lordship had with the utmost degree of inflexibility resisted all his good counsel and advice upon this subject he resolved in quitting him never to be his adviser or counselor again  but in preparing to leave his friend his pupil his patron and yet him who upon most occasions implicitly obeyed his will the spiritual got the better of the temporal man and he determined to stay lest in totally abandoning him to the pursuit of his own passions he might make his punishment even greater than his offense  my lord said he on the stormy sea upon which you are embarked though you will not shun the rocks your faithful pilot would point out he will nevertheless sail in your company and lament over your watery grave the more you slight my advice the more you want it and till you command me to leave your house as i suppose you will soon do to oblige your lady i will continue along with you  lord elmwood liked him sincerely and was glad he took this resolution yet as soon as his lordships reason and affections had once told him he ought to break with miss fenton and marry his ward he became so decidedly of that opinion sandfords never had the most trivial weight upon the subject nor would he flatter the supposed authority he possessed over him by urging him to remain in his house a single day contrary to his inclinations sandford beheld with grief this firmness but finding it vain to contend submitted  not however with a good grace  amidst all the persons affected by this change in lord elmwoods marriage designs miss fenton was perhaps the least  she would have been content to have married she was contented to live single  mr sandford was the first who made overtures to her on the part of lord elmwood and the first sent to ask her to dispense with the obligation  she received both these proposals with the same insipid smile of approbation and the same cold indifference at the heart  it was a perfect knowledge of this disposition in his intended wife which had given to lord elmwoods thoughts on matrimony the prospect of dreary winter but the sensibility of miss milner had now reversed that prospect to perpetual spring or the dearer variety of spring summer and autumn  it was a knowledge also of this torpor in miss fentons nature from which he formed the purpose of breaking with her for lord elmwood still retained enough of the priests sanctity to have yielded up his own happiness and even that of his beloved ward rather than have plunged one heart into affliction by his perfidy this before he offered his hand to miss milner he was perfectly convinced would not be the case  even miss fenton herself assured him her thoughts were more inclined toward the joys of heaven than earth and as this circumstance would she believed induce her to retire to a convent she thought it a happy rather than an unhappy event  her brother on whom her fortune devolved if she took this resolution was exactly of her opinion  lost in the maze of happiness which surrounded her miss milner oftentimes asked her heart and her heart whispered like a flatterer yes are not my charms even more invincible than i ever believed them to be dorriforth the grave the sanctified the anchorite dorriforth by their force is animated to all the ardour of the most impassioned lover  while the proud priest the austere guardian is humbled if i but frown into the veriest slave of love  she then asked why did i not keep him longer in suspense he could not have loved me more i believe but my power over him might have been greater still  i am the happiest of women in that affection he has proved to me but i wonder whether it would exist under ill treatment if it would not he still does not love me as i wish to be loved  if it would my triumph my felicity would be enhanced  these thoughts were mere phantoms of the brain and never by system put into action but repeatedly indulged they were practiced by casual occurrences and the dearbought experiment of being beloved in spite of her faults a glory proud women ever aspire to was at present the ambition of miss milner  unthinking woman she did not reflect that to the searching eye of lord elmwood she had faults with her every care to conceal or overcome them sufficient to try all his love and all his patience but what female is not fond of experiments to which how few are there that do not fall a sacrifice  perfectly secure of the affections of the man she loved her declining health no longer threatened her her declining spirits returned as before and the suspicions of her guardian being now changed to the liberal confidence of a doting lover she now again professed all her former follies all her fashionable levities and indulged them with less restraint than she had ever done  for a while blinded by his passion lord elmwood encouraged and admired every new proof of her restored happiness nor till sufferance had tempted her to proceed beyond her usual bounds did he remonstrate  but she who as his ward had been ever gentle and when he strenuously opposed always obedient he now found as a mistress sometimes haughty and to opposition always insolent  he was surprised but the novelty pleased him  and miss milner whom he tenderly loved could put on no change or appear in any new character that did not for the time she adopted it seem to become her  among the many causes of complaint she gave him want of economy in the disposal of her income was one  bills and drafts came upon him without number while the account on her part of money expended amounted but to articles of dress she sometimes never wore toys that were out of fashion before they were paid for and charities directed by the force of whim  another complaint was as usual extreme late hours and oftentimes company he did not approve  she was charmed to see his love struggling with his censure  his politeness with his anxiety  and by the light frivilous or resentful manner in which she treated his admonitions she triumphed in showing to miss woodley and more especially to mr sandford how much she dared upon the strength of his affections  every thing in preparation for their marriage which was to take place at elmwoodhouse during the summer months she resolved for the short time she had to remain in london to let no occasion pass of tasting all those pleasures which were not likely ever to return but which eager as she was in their pursuit she still placed in no kind of competition with those she hoped would succeed those more sedate and far greater joys she had in domestic contemplation  and often merely to hasten on the tedious hours that intervened she varied and diverted them with the many recreations her intended husband could not approve  it so happened and it was unfortunate it did that a lawsuit and some other intricate affairs that came with his title and estate frequently kept lord elmwood from his house part of the day sometimes the whole evening and when at home would often closet him for hours with his lawyers  but while he was thus off his guard sandford never was  and had miss milner been the dearest thing on earth to him he could not have watched her more narrowly or had she been the frailest thing on earth he could not have been more hard upon her in all the accounts of her conduct he gave to lord elmwood  his lordship knew sandfords failing was to think ill of miss milner he pitied him for it and he pitied her for it  and all the aggravation his representations gave to her real follies affection for them both in the heart of dorriforth stood between every other impression  but facts are glaring and he at length beheld those faults in their true colors although previously pointed out by the prejudice of mr sandford  as soon as sandford perceived his lordships uneasiness there my lord cried he exultingly did i not always say the marriage was an improper one  but you would not be ruled  you would not see  can you blame me for not seeing replied his lordship when you yourself were blind  had you been dispassionate had you seen miss milners virtues as well as her faults i should have believed and been guided by you  but you saw her failings only and therein have been equally deceived with me who have only beheld her perfections  my observations however my lord would have been of most use to you for i have seen what to avoid  but mine have been the most charitable replied his lordship for i have seen  what i must always love  sandford sighed and lifted up his hands  mr sandford resumed his lordship with a voice and manner such as he puts on when not all the power of sandford or any other can change his fixed determination mr sandford resumed he my eyes are now open to every failing as well as to every accomplishment to every vice as well as to every virtue of miss milners nor will i suffer myself to be again prepossessed in her favor by your prejudice against her  for i believe it was compassion at your unkind treatment of her that first gained her my heart  i my lord cried sandford do not load me with the burden  with the mighty burden of your love for her  do not interrupt me said his lordship whatever your meaning has been the effect of your unkindness to her is what i say  now i will no longer continued he have an enemy such as you have been to heighten her charms which are too transcendent in their native state i will hear no more complaints against her but i will watch her closely myself  and if i find her mind and heart such as my suspicions have of late whispered too frivolous for that substantial happiness i look for with an object so beloved depend upon my word  the marriage shall yet be broken off  i depend upon your word it will then replied sandford eagerly  you are unjust sir in saying so before the trial replied his lordship and your injustice shall make me more cautious lest i follow your example  but my lord    my mind is made up mr sandford returned he interrupting him i am no longer engaged to miss milner than she shall deserve i should  but in my observations i will take care not to wrong her as you have done  my lord call my observations wrong when you have reflected upon them as a man and not as a lover  divest yourself of your passion and meet me upon equal ground  i will meet no one  i will consult no one  my own judgment shall be the judge and in a few months marry or  banish me from her for ever  there was something in these last words in the tone and firmness with which they were delivered that the heart of sandford rested upon with content  they bore the symptoms of a menace that would be executed and he parted from his patron with congratulations upon his wisdom and the warmest assurances of his firm reliance on his word  lord elmwood having come to this resolution was more composed than he had been for several days before while the horror of domestic wrangles  a family without subordination  a house without economy  in a word a wife without discretion had been perpetually present to his mind  mr sandford although he was a man of understanding of learning and a complete casuist yet all the faults he himself committed were entirely  for want of knowing better  he constantly reproved faults in others and he was most assuredly too good a man not to have corrected and amended his own had they been known to him  but they were not  he had been for so long time the superior of all with whom he lived had been so busied with instructing others he had not recollected he himself wanted instructions  and in such awe did his severity keep all about him that notwithstanding he had many friends not one told him of his failings  except just now lord elmwood but who in this instance as a man in love he would not credit  was there not then some reason for him to suppose he had no faults  his enemies indeed hinted that he had but enemies he never hearkened to and thus with all his good sense wanted the sense to follow the rule believe what your enemies say of you rather than what is said by your friends this rule attended to would make many a one amiable that is now the reverse and had made him a perfect upright character  for could an enemy to whom he would have listened whispered to sandford as he left lord elmwoods study cruel barbarous man you go away with your heart satisfied nay even elated in the prospect that miss milners hopes on which she alone exists those hopes which keep her from the deepest affliction and cherish her with joy and gladness will all be disappointed  you flatter yourself it is for the sake of your friend lord elmwood you rejoice because he has escaped a danger  you wish him well but there is another cause for your exultation which you will not seek to know  it is that in his safety shall dwell the punishment of his ward  for shame for shame forgive her faults as this of yours needs forgiveness  had any one said this to sandford whom he would have credited or had his own heart suggested it he was a man of that rectitude and conscientiousness he would have returned immediately to lord elmwood and have endeavored to strengthen all his favorable opinions of his intended wife  but having no such monitor as this he walked on highly contented and meeting miss woodley said with an air of triumph  where is your young lady  where is lady elmwood  miss woodley smiled and answered  she was gone with such and such ladies to an auction  but why give her that title already mr sandford  because answered he i think she will never have it  bless me mr sandford said miss woodley you shock me  i thought i should replied he and that is why i tell it you  for heavens sake what has happened cried she  nothing new  her indiscretions only  i know she is imprudent said miss woodley i can see she is often to blame  but then my lord surely loves her and love will overlook a great deal  he does love her  but he has understanding and resolution  he loved his sister too tenderly loved her and yet when he had taken the resolution passed his word he would never see her again even upon her deathbed he would not retract it  no entreaties could prevail upon him  and now though he maintains and i dare say loves her child yet you remember when you brought him home he would not bear him in his sight  poor miss milner  said miss woodley in the most pitying accents  nay said sandford lord elmwood has not yet passed his word that he will never see her more  he has only threatened to say so  but i know enough of him to know his threats are generally the same as the actions done  you are very good said miss woodley to acquaint me of this in time i may now warn miss milner of it and she may behave with more circumspection  by no means  cried sandford hastily what would you warn her for  it will do her no good  besides added he i dont know whether his lordship does not expect secresy from me on this subject and if he does    but with all deference to your opinion said miss woodley and with all deference did she speak dont you think mr sandford that secresy upon this occasion would be wicked for consider the anguish it may cause my friend and if by advising her we can save her from   she was going on  you may call wicked madam not to inform her of it cried he but i call a breach of promise if i did give my promise which i dont say i did much more sinful  i suppose you are right sir said miss woodley with humility but if you have given your promise i have not given mine and therefore may divulge    there now cried sandford there is how you judge of this matter  you judge of things as they are in reality not what they are by construction the only way to judge of any thing  if i did make a promise to lord elmwood  which i again say i dont know that i did  the promise was that i would not communicate the secret meaning not tell it to miss milner herself  i have not and therefore have kept my word  and in revealing it to you i did it with a full persuasion you would conceal it which confidence on my part binds you as much as the most solemn promise you could have given  the fault will be mine then not yours if it comes to the knowledge of miss milner  certainly  then as it will be my fault do not you sir be uneasy about it   he was going to explain again but miss milner entered and put an end to the discourse  she had been passing the whole morning at an auction and had laid out near two hundred pounds in different things she had no one use for but bought them because they were said to be cheap  among the rest was a lot of books on chemistry and some latin authors  why madam cried sandford looking over the catalogue where her purchases were marked by a pencil do you know what you have done you cannot read a word of these books  cannot i mr sandford but i assure you you will be vastly pleased with them when you see how elegantly they are bound  my dear said mrs horton why have you bought china you and lord elmwood have more now than you have places to put them in  very true mrs horton  i forgot that  but then you know i can give these away  lord elmwood was in the room at the conclusion of this conversation  he shook his head and sighed  my lord said she i have had a very pleasant morning but i wished for you  if you had been with me i should have bought a great many other things but i did not like to appear unreasonable in your absence  sandford fixed his inquisitive eyes upon lord elmwood to observe his countenance  his lordship smiled but appeared thoughtful  and oh my lord i have bought you a present said she  i do not wish for a present miss milner  what not from me  very well  if you present me with yourself madam it is all i ask  sandford moved upon his chair as if he sat uneasy  why then miss woodley said miss milner  you shall have the present  but then it will not suit you  it is for a gentleman  i will keep it and give it to my lord frederick the first time i meet with him  i saw him this morning and he looked divinely i longed to speak to him  miss woodley cast by stealth an eye of apprehension upon lord elmwoods face and trembled to behold it red as scarlet  sandford stared with both his eyes full upon him then drew himself upright on his chair and took a pinch of snuff upon the strength of his uneasiness  a silence ensued  after a short time  you all appear very melancholy said miss milner i wish i had not come home yet  miss woodley was in agony  she saw lord elmwoods extreme displeasure and dreaded lest he should express it by some words he could not recall or she could not forgive  therefore whispering to her she had something particular to say to her she took her out of the room  the moment she was gone mr sandford rose nimbly from his seat rubbed his hands walked briskly across the room then asked his lordship in a cheerful tone whether he dined at home today  that which had given sandford spirits to speak with cheerfulness had depressed lord elmwoods so much that he sat silent and dejected  at length he answered in a faint voice no i believe i shall not dine at home  where is your lordship going to dine asked mrs horton i thought we should have had your company today miss milner dines at home i believe  i have not yet determined where i shall dine replied he taking no notice of the conclusion of her speech  my lord if you mean to go to the hotel i will go with you if you please cried sandford officiously  with all my heart sandford replied his lordship and they both went out together before miss milner returned to the apartment  chapter viii miss woodley for the first time disobeyed the will of mr sandford and as soon as miss milner and she were alone informed her of all he had revealed to her accompanying the recital with every testimony of sympathy and affection  but had the genius of sandford presided over this discovery it could not have influenced the mind of miss milner to receive the intelligence more exactly opposite to the intention of the informer instead of shuddering with fear at the menace lord elmwood had uttered she boldly said she dared him to perform it he durst not repeated she  why durst not said miss woodley  because he loves me too well  because his own happiness is too dear to him  i believe he loves you replied miss woodley and yet there is a doubt if    there shall be no longer a doubt  cried miss milner i will put him to the proof  for shame my dear you talk inconsiderately  what do you mean by proof  i mean i will do something that any prudent man ought not to forgive and yet with that vast share of prudence he possesses i will force him still to yield to his love  but suppose you should be disappointed and he should not yield said miss woodley  then i have only lost a man who had no regard for me  he may have a great regard for you notwithstanding  but for the love i have and do still bear my lord elmwood i will have something more than a great regard in return  you have his love i am sure  but is it such as mine  i could love him if he had a thousand faults  and yet said she recollecting herself and yet i believe his being faultless was the first cause of my passion  thus she talked on  sometimes in anger sometimes apparently jesting  till her servant came to tell her dinner was served  upon entering the diningroom and seeing his lordships place at table vacant she started back she was disappointed of the pleasure she expected in dining with him and his sudden absence so immediately after the intelligence she had received from miss woodley increased her uneasiness  she drew her chair and sat down with an indifference that said she should not eat and as soon as she was seated she put her fingers sullenly to her lips nor touched her knife and fork or spoke a word in reply to any thing that was said to her during the whole dinner  miss woodley and mrs horton were both too well acquainted with the good disposition of her heart to take offense or any notice of this behavior  they dined and wisely said nothing either to provoke or sooth her  just as the dinner was going to be removed a loud rap came at the door  who is that said mrs horton  one of the servants went to the window and answered my lord and mr sandford madam  come back to dinner as i live cried mrs horton   miss milner still continued her position and said nothing  but at the corners of her mouth which her fingers did not entirely cover there were discoverable a thousand dimpled graces like small convulsive fibers which a restrained smile on lord elmwoods return had sent there  his lordship and sandford entered  i am glad you are returned my lord said mrs horton for miss milner would not eat a morsel  it was because i had no appetite returned she blushing like crimson  we should not have come back said sandford but at the place where we went to dine all the rooms were filled with smoke  it has been a very windy day indeed said mrs horton and one part of this house is now in a smother  lord elmwood put the wing of a fowl on miss milners plate but without previously asking if she chose any yet she condescended to eat  they spoke to each other too in the course of conversation yet it was with a reserve that appeared as if they had been quarrelling and so felt to themselves though no such circumstance had happened  about two weeks passed away in this kind of distant behavior on both sides without either venturing a direct quarrel and without either expressing except inadvertently their strong affection for each other  during this time they were once however nearly becoming the dearest friends in expressions as well as in sentiments  this arose from a favor he granted in compliance to what he knew was her earnest desire and as a favor which he had refused to the repeated requests of many friends she could not but esteem the high value of the obligation  she and miss woodley had taken an airing to see the poor child young rushbrook and on their return his lordship inquiring of the ladies how they had passed their morning miss milner frankly told him and added what pain it gave her to leave the child behind as he still cried to come away with her  go for him then tomorrow said his lordship and bring him home  home she repeated with surprise  yes replied he if you desire it this shall be his home  you shall be a mother and i will henceforward be a father to him  sandford who was present looked unusually four at this high token of his lordships regard to miss milner yet with resentment on his face he wiped a tear of joy from his eye for the boys sake  his frown was the force of prejudice his tear the force of nature  rushbrook was brought home and whenever lord elmwood wished to show a kindness to miss milner without directing it immediately to her he took his nephew upon his knee talked to him and told him he was glad they had become acquainted  in the various though delicate struggles for power between miss milner and her guardian there was not one person witness to these incidents who did not suppose all would at last end in wedlock  for the most common observer perceived ardent love was the foundation of every discontent as well as of every joy they experienced  one great incident however totally reversed the prospect of all future accommodation  the fashionable mrs g  gave a masked ball tickets were presented to persons of the first quality and among the rest three were sent to miss milner  she had never been at a masquerade and received them with extacy  more especially as the masque being at the house of a woman of fashion she did not conceive there could be any objection to her going  she was mistaken  the moment she mentioned it to lord elmwood he desired her somewhat sternly not to think of being there  she was vexed at the prohibition but more at the manner in which it was delivered and flatly said she should certainly go  she expected a severe rebuke for this but what alarmed her much more he never replied a word but looked with a resignation which foreboded her more sorrow than the severest reproaches would have done  she sat for a minute reflecting how to rouse him from this composure  she first thought of attacking him with upbraidings then she thought of soothing him and at last of laughing at him  this was the least supportable of all and yet this she ventured upon  i am sure your lordship said she with all your saintliness can have no objection to my being present at the masquerade provided i go as a nun  he made no reply  that is a habit continued she which covers a multitude of faults  and for that evening i may have the chance of making a conquest even of you my lord  nay i question not if under that inviting attire even the pious mr sandford would not ogle me  hush  said miss woodley  why hush cried miss milner aloud though miss woodley had spoken in a whisper i am sure continued she i am only repeating what i have read in books about nuns and their confessors  your conduct miss milner replied lord elmwood gives evident proofs what authors you have read you may spare yourself the trouble of quoting them  her pride was hurt at this beyond bearing and as she could not like him govern her anger it flushed in her face and almost forced the tears  my lord said miss woodley in a voice so soft and peaceful it ought to have calmed the resentment of both my lord suppose you were to accompany miss milner there are tickets for three and you can then have no objection  miss milners brow was immediately smoothed her eye beamed hope and she fetched a sigh in anxious expectation he would consent  i go miss woodley he replied with astonishment do you imagine i would play the buffoon at a masquerade  miss milners face changed to its former state  i have seen many grave characters there my lord said miss woodley  dear miss woodley cried miss milner why persuade lord elmwood to put on a mask just at the time he has laid it aside  his patience seemed now to be tempted to its height and he answered if you suspect it madam you shall find me changed  pleased she had been able at last to irritate him she smiled with a degree of triumph and in that humor was going to reply but before she could speak four words and before she thought of it he abruptly left the room  she was highly offended at this insult and declared from that moment she banished him her heart for ever and to prove she set both his love and anger at defiance she immediately ordered her chariot and said she was going to some of her acquaintance whom she knew had tickets and with whom she would fix upon the dress she meant to appear in at the masquerade for nothing unless she was locked up should alter the resolution she had taken of being there to remonstrate at that moment miss woodley knew would be in vain the chariot came to the door and she drove away  she did not return to dinner nor till late in the evening lord elmwood was at home but never once mentioned her name  she came home after he had retired to bed and in great spirits the first time she ever appeared careless what he might think of her behavior  but her whole thoughts were occupied upon the business she had been about and her dress engrossed all her conversation as soon as miss woodley and she were alone  she told miss woodley she had been shown the greatest variety of beautiful and becoming dresses she had ever beheld and yet said she i have fixed upon a very plain one but one i look so well in you will hardly know me when i have it on  you are seriously then resolved to go said miss woodley provided you hear no more on the subject from your guardian  whether i do or not miss woodley i am equally resolved to go  but you know my dear he has desired you not  and you used always to obey his commands  as my guardian i certainly did obey him and i could obey him as a husband but as a lover i will not  yet that is the means never to have him for a husband  as he pleases  for if he will not submit to be my lover i will not submit to be his wife  nor has he the affection i require in a husband  thus the old sentiments were repeated as heretofore and prevented a separation till toward morning  miss milner for that night dreamt less of her guardian than of the masquerade on the evening of the next day it was to be she was up early breakfasted in her dressing room and remained there most of the day busied in all the thousand preparations for the night one of which was to take every particle of powder out of her hair and have it curled all over in falling ringlets  her next care was that her dress should exactly fit and display her fine person to the best advantage  it did so  miss woodley entered as it was trying on and was struck with astonishment at the elegance of the habit and the beautiful effect it had upon her graceful person but most of all she was astonished at her venturing on such a character  for although it was there presentative of the goddess of chastity yet from the buskins and the petticoat made to festoon far above the ankle it had on the first glance the appearance of a a female much less virtuous  miss woodley admired the dress yet objected to it but as she admired first her objections after had no weight  where is lord elmwood said miss milner he must not see me  no for heavens sake cried miss woodley i would not have him see you for the universe  and yet returned the other with a sigh why am i then thus pleased with this dress for i had rather he should admire me than all the world beside and yet he is not to see me in it  but he would not admire you thus said miss woodley  how shall i contrive to avoid him said miss milner if he should offer to hand me into my carriage  but i believe he will not be in good humor enough for that  you had better dress at the ladies house with whom you go said miss woodley and this was agreed upon  at dinner they learnt his lordship was to go that evening to windsor in order to be in readiness for the kings hunt early in the morning and this intelligence having dispersed miss milners fears she concluded to dress at home  lord elmwood appeared at dinner in an even but not in a goodtemper  the subject of the masquerade was never brought up or indeed was once in his thoughts for though he was offended at his wards behavior on the occasion and thought she committed a fault in telling him she would go yet he never suspected she meant to do so not even at the time she said it much less that she would persist coolly and deliberately in so direct a contradiction to his will  she for her part flattered herself his going to windsor was intended in order to give her an opportunity of passing the evening as she pleased without his being obliged to know of it and consequently to complain  miss woodley who was willing to hope as she wished began to be of the same opinion and without reluctance dressed herself as a woodnymph to accompany her friend  chapter ix at half after eleven miss milners chair and another with miss woodley took them from lord elmwoods house to call upon the party a group of woodnymphs and huntresses which were to acompany them and make up the suit of diana  they had not left the house two minutes when a thundering rap came at the door  it was lord elmwood in a post chaise  upon some occasion the next days hunt was put off he had been made acquainted with it and came from windsor at that late hour  after his lordship had told mrs horton and mr sandford who were sitting together the cause of his sudden return and some supper was ordered for him he inquired what company had just left the house  we have been alone the whole evening my lord replied mrs horton  nay returned he i saw two chairs with several servants come out of the door as i drove up but what livery i could not discern  we have had no creature here repeated mrs horton  nor has miss milner asked he  this brought mrs horton to her recollection and she cried oh now i know  and then checked herself as if she knew too much  what do you know madam said his lordship sharply  nothing  said mrs horton i know nothing and she lifted up her hands and shook her head  so all people say who know a great deal cried sandford and i suspect that is at present your case  then i know more than i wish to know i am sure mr sandford returned she shrugging up her shoulders  lord elmwood was all impatience explain madam explain cried he  dear my lord said she if your lordship will recollect you may just have the same knowledge that i have  recollect what said he sternly  the quarrel you and your ward had about the masquerade  what of that she is not gone there he cried  i am not sure she is returned mrs horton but if your lordship saw two sedan chairs going out of this house i cannot but suspect it must be miss milner and my niece going to the masquerade  his lordship made no answer but rung the bell violently  a servant entered  send miss milners woman hither said he immediately  the man withdrew  nay my lord cried mrs horton any of the other servants could tell you just as well whether miss milner is at home or gone out  perhaps not replied he  the maid entered  where is your lady said he  the woman had received no orders to conceal where her lady was gone and yet some secret influence which governs the thoughts of all waiting women and chamber maids whispered to her she ought not to tell the truth  where is your lady repeated lord elmwood in a louder voice than before  gone out my lord she replied  where  my lady did not tell me  and dont you know  no my lord she answered and without blushing  is this the night of the masquerade said he  i dont know my lord upon my word but i believe my lord it is not  sandford as soon as lord elmwood had asked the last question run hastily to the table at the other side of the room snatched something from it and returned to his place again  and as soon as the maid said it was not the night of the masquerade he exclaimed but it is my lord it is  yes it is and showing a newspaper he held in his hand pointed to the paragraph which contained the information  leave the room said lord elmwood to the woman i have done with you  she withdrew  yes yes here it is repeated sandford with the paper in his hand  he then read the paragraph  the masquerade at the honorable mrs g  s this evening   this evening my lord you find  it is expected will be the most brilliant of any thing of the kind for these many years past  they should not put such things in the papers said mrs horton to tempt young women to their ruin the word ruin seemed to grate upon his lordships ear and he said to the servant who came to wait on him while he supped take the supper away  he had not attempted to eat or even to sit down and he now walked backwards and forwards in the room lost in thought and care  a little time after one of miss milners footmen came in upon some occasion and mr sandford said to him pray did you attend your lady to the masquerade  yes sir replied the man  lord elmwood stopped himself short in his walk and said to the servant you did  yes my lord replied he  his lordship walked again  i should like to know what she was dressed in said mrs horton and turning to the servant do you know what your lady had on  yes madam replied the man she was in mens clothes  how cried lord elmwood  you tell a story to be sure said mrs horton to the servant  no cried sandford i am sure he does not for he is an honest good young man and would not tell a lie upon any account  would you  lord elmwood ordered miss milners woman to be again sent up  she came  in what dress did your lady go to the masquerade asked his lordship and with a look so extremely morose it seemed to command her to answer in a word and to answer truly  a mind with a spark of sensibility more than she possessed could not have equivocated with such an interrogator but her reply was she went in her own dress my lord  was it a mans or a womans dress asked his lordship with the same commanding look  ha ha my lord half laughing and half crying a womans dress to be sure my lord  on which sandford cried  call the footman up and let him confront her  he was called but lord elmwood now disgusted with the scene sat down at the farther end of the room and left sandford to question them  with all the authority and consequence of a country magistrate sandford with his back to the fire and the witnesses before him began with the footman  in what dress do you say you saw your lady when you attended and went along with her to the masquerade  in mens clothes replied the man boldly and firmly as before  bless my soul george how can you say such a thing cried the woman  in what dress do you say she went in cried sandford to her  in womens clothes indeed sir  this is very odd said mrs horton  had she on or had she not on a coat asked sandford  yes sir a petticoat replied the woman  do you say she had on a petticoat said sandford to the man  i cannot answer exactly for that replied he but i know she had boots on  they were not boots replied the maid with vehemence indeed sir turning to sandford they were only half boots  my girl said sandford kindly to her your own evidence convicts her  what has a woman to do with any boots  impatient at this mummery lord elmwood rose from his seat and ordered the servants out of the room and then looking at his watch found it was near one at what time am i to expect her at home said he  perhaps not till three in the morning answered mrs horton  three six more likely cried sandford  i cannot wait with patience till that time answered his lordship with a most anxious sigh  you had better go to bed my lord said mrs horton and by sleeping the time will pass away unperceived  if i could sleep madam returned he  will you play a game of cards my lord said sandford for i will not leave you till she comes home and though i am not used to sit up all night    all night repeated his lordship she durst not stay all night  and yet after going said sandford in defiance to your commands i should suppose she dares  she is in good company at least my lord said mrs horton  she does not know herself what company she is in replied his lordship  how should she cried sandford where every one hides his face  till five oclock in the morning in such conversation as this the hours passed away  mrs horton indeed retired to her chamber at two and left the gentlemen to a graver discourse but a discourse still less advantageous to poor miss milner  she during this time was at the scene of pleasure she had pictured to herself and all the pleasure it gave her was that she was sure she should never desire to go to a masquerade again  the crowd and bustle fatigued her  the freedom offended her delicacy  and though she perceived she was the first object of admiration in the place yet there was one person still wanting to admire and the remorse at having transgressed his injunctions for so trivial an entertainment weighed upon her spirits and added to its weariness  she would have come away sooner than she did but she could not with any degree of good manners leave the company with whom she went and not till half after four were they prevailed on to return  daylight just peeped through the shutters of the room where his lordship and sandford were sitting when the sound of her carriage and its sudden stop at the door caused lord elmwood as suddenly to start from his seat  he trembled extremely and looked pale  sandford was ashamed to seem to notice it yet he could not help asking him to take a glass of wine  he took it  and for once evinced he was reduced so low as to be glad of such a resource  what passion thus agitated lord elmwood at this crisis it is hard to define  perhaps it was indignation at miss milners imprudence and the satisfaction he felt at being on the point of revenge  perhaps his emotion arose from joy to find she was safe  perhaps it was perturbation at the regret he felt that he must upbraid her  perhaps it was one alone of these sensations but most probably it was them all combined  she wearied out with the tedious nights dissipation and less joyous than melancholy had fallen asleep as she rode home and when the carriage stopped came half asleep out of it  light me to my bedchamber instantly said she to her woman who waited in the hall to receive her  but one of lord elmwoods valets went up to her and answered madam my lord desires to see you before you go to bed  your lord man cried she is he not out of town  no madam my lord has been at home ever since you went out and has been sitting up with mr sandford waiting for your return  she was wide awake instantly  the heaviness was removed from her eyes but fear grief and shame seized upon her heart  she leaned against her woman as if unable to support herself under those feelings and said to miss woodley  make my excuse  i cannot see him to night  i am unfit  indeed i cannot  miss woodley was alarmed at the thought of going to him by herself and thus perhaps aggravating him still more she therefore said he has sent for you for heavens sake do not disobey him a second time  no dear madam cried her woman for he is like a lion  he has been scolding me  good god exclaimed miss milner and in a tone that seemed prophetic then he is not to be my husband after all  yes cried miss woodley if you will only be humble and appear sorry  you know your power over him and all may yet be well  she turned her speaking eyes upon her friend the tears starting from them her lips trembling do i not appear sorry she cried  the bell at that moment rung furiously and they mended their pace to the door of the apartment where his lordship was  no this is only fright  replied miss woodley say to him you are sorry and beg his pardon  i cannot said she if mr sandford is with him  the servant opened the door and she and miss woodley went in  lord elmwood by this time was composed and received her with a slight inclination of his head she bowed to him in return and said with some marks of humility  i suppose my lord i have done wrong  you have indeed miss milner answered he but do not suppose i mean to upbraid you i am moreover going to release you from any such apprehension for the future  those last three words he spoke with a countenance so serious and so determined with an accent so firm and so decided they pierced through her heart  she did not however weep or even sigh but her friend miss woodley knowing what she felt exclaimed oh as if for her  she herself strove with her anguish and replied but with a faltering voice i expected as much my lord  then madam you may perhaps expect all that i intend  in regard to myself she replied i suppose i do  then said he you may expect in a few days we shall part  i am prepared for it my lord she answered and while she said so sunk upon a chair  my lord what you have to say farther said miss woodley in tears defer till the morning miss milner you see is not able to bear it now  i have nothing to say farther replied he coolly i have now only to act  lord elmwood cried miss milner divided between grief and anger you think to frighten me by your menaces but i can part with you heaven knows i can  your late behavior has reconciled me to a separation  on this he was going out of the room  but miss woodley catching hold of him cried oh my lord do not leave her in this sorrow  pity her weakness and forgive it  she was proceeding and he seemed inclined to listen to her when sandford called out in so sharp a tone  miss woodley what do you mean she gave a start and desisted  his lordship turned to sandford and said nay mr sandford you need entertain no doubts of me i have judged and have deter    he was going to say determined but miss milner who dreaded to hear the word interrupted the period and exclaimed oh could my poor father know the grief the days of sorrow i have experienced since his death how would he repent his fatal choice in a protector  this sentence wherein his friends memory was recalled with the additional allusion to her long and secret affection for himself affected lord elmwood much  he was moved but ashamed of being so and as soon as possible conquered the propensity  yet for a short interval he did not know whether to go out of the room or to remain in it whether to speak or to be silent  at length he turned toward her and said  appeal to your father in some other form in that pointing to her dress he will not know you  reflect upon him too in your moments of dissipation and let his idea control your indiscretions  not merely in an hour of contradiction call peevishly upon his name only to wound the dearest friend you have  there was a degree of truth and a degree of feeling in the conclusion of this speech that alarmed sandford and he caught up one of the candles and laying hold of his lordships elbow drew him out of the room crying come my lord come to your bedchamber it is very late  it is morning  it is time to rise and by a continual repetition of these words in a very loud voice drowned whatever his lordship or any other person might have wished to have spoken or heard  in this manner lord elmwood was taken out of the apartment and the evenings entertainment concluded  chapter x two whole days passed in the bitterest suspense on the part of miss milner while neither one word or look from lord elmwood denoted the most trivial change of those sentiments he had declared on the night of the masquerade  still those sentiments or intentions were not explicitly delivered they were more like intimations than solemn declarations  for though he had said he would never reproach her for the future and that she might expect they should part he had not positively said they should and upon this doubtful meaning of his words she hung with the strongest agitation of hope and of fear  miss woodley seeing the distress of her mind much as she endeavored to conceal it entreated nay implored of her to permit her to be a mediator to suffer her to ask for a private interview with lord elmwood and provided she found him inflexible behave with a proper degree of spirit in return but if he appeared not absolutely averse to a reconciliation to offer it to him in so cautious a manner it might take place without farther uneasiness on either side but miss milner peremptorily forbad this and acknowledging to her friend every weakness she felt on the occasion yet concluded with solemnly declaring that after what had passed between her and lord elmwood he must be the first to make a concession before she herself would condescend to be reconciled  i believe i know lord elmwoods temper replied miss woodley and i do not think he will be easily induced to beg pardon for a fault which he thinks you have committed  then he does not love me  pshaw miss milner this is the old argument  he may love you too well to spoil you  consider he is your guardian as well as your lover he means also to become your husband and he is a man of such nice honor he will not give you a specimen of that power before marriage which he does not intend to submit to hereafter  but tenderness affection the politeness due from a lover to his mistress demands this submission and as i now despair of enticing i will oblige him to it  at least i will make the trial and know my fate at once  what do you mean to do  invite my lord frederick to the house and ask my guardians consent for our immediate union you will then see what effect that has upon his pride  but you will then make it too late for him to be humble  if you resolve on this my dear miss milner you are undone at once  you may thus hurry yourself into a marriage with a man you do not love and the misery of your whole future life may be the result  or would you force mr dorriforth i mean lord elmwood to another duel with my lord frederick  no call him dorriforth   answered she with the tears stealing from her eyes i thank you for calling him so for by that name alone is he dear to me  nay miss milner with what rapture did you not receive his love as lord elmwood  but under that title he has been barbarous under the first he was all friendship and tenderness  notwithstanding miss milner indulged herself in all those soft bewailings to her friend  before lord elmwood she maintained a degree of pride and steadiness which surprised even him who had perhaps ever thought less of her love for him than any other person  she now began to fear she had gone too far in discovering her affection and resolved to make trial of a contrary method  she determined to retrieve that haughty character which had inspired so many of her admirers with passion and take the chance of the effect upon this only one to whom she ever acknowledged a mutual love  but although she acted this character well  so well that every one but miss woodley thought her in earnest  yet with the nicest and most attentive anxiety did she watch even the slightest circumstance that might revive her hopes or confirm her despair lord elmwoods behavior was calculated to produce the latter  he was cold polite and perfectly indifferent  yet whatever his manners now were they did not remove from her recollection what they had been  she recalled with delight the ardour with which he had first declared his passion to her and the thousand proofs he had since given of its reality  from the constancy of his disposition she depended a great deal that those sentiments were not totally eradicated and from the extreme desire which mr sandford now more than ever discovered to depreciate her in his patrons esteem  from the now more than common earnestness with which he never failed to take lord elmwood from her company whenever he had it in his power she was led to believe that while his friend entertained such strong fears of his lordship relapsing into love she had reason to indulge the strongest hopes that he would  but the reserve and even indifference she had so well assumed for a few days and which might perhaps have effected her designs she had not the patience to persevere in without calling levity to their aid  she visited repeatedly without saying where or with whom  kept later hours than usual  appeared in the highest spirits sung laughed and never heaved a sigh but when she was alone  still lord elmwood protracted a resolution he was determined not to break when once taken  miss woodley was extremely uneasy and with cause she saw her friend was providing herself with a weight of cares she would soon find too much for her strength to bear  she would have reasoned wih her but all her arguments had long since proved unavailing  she strongly wished to speak to lord elmwood upon the subject and unknowing to her plead her excuse but he apprehended miss woodleys intention and evidently shunned her  mr sandford was now the only person to whom she could speak of miss milner and the delight he took to expatiate on her faults was more sorrow to her friend than not to speak of her at all she therefore sat a silent spectator waiting with dread for that time when she who now scorned her advice would fly to her in vain for comfort  sandford had however said one thing to miss woodley which gave her a ray of hope during their conversation on this subject not by way of consolation to her but as a reproach to lord elmwood he one day angrily exclaimed and yet notwithstanding all this provocation he has not come to the determination to think no more of her  he lingers and hesitates  i never saw him so weak upon any occasion before  this was joyful hearing to miss woodley still she could not but reflect the longer he was in coming to this determination the more irrevocable it would be when once taken and every moment she passed she trembled lest that should be the moment in which lord elmwood resolved to banish miss milner from his heart  among the unpardonable indiscretions she was guilty of during this trial upon the temper of her guardian was the frequent mention of many gentlemen who had been her professed admirers and mentioning them with partiality  teased if not tortured by this lord elmwood still behaved with a manly evenness of temper and neither provoked on the subject or insolently careless  in a single instance however this calmness had nearly deserted him  entering the drawing room one evening he suddenly started on seeing lord frederick lawnly there in earnest conversation with miss milner  mrs horton and miss woodley were both indeed present and lord frederick was talking in an audible voice and upon some indifferent subjects but with that impressive manner in which a man never fails to speak to the woman he loves be the subject what it will  the moment lord elmwood started which was the moment he entered lord frederick arose  i beg your pardon my lord said lord elmwood i protest i did not know you  i ought to entreat your lordships pardon returned lord frederick for this intrusion which an accident alone has occasioned miss milner has been nearly overturned by the carelessness of a ladys coachman in whose carriage she was and therefore suffered me to bring her home in mine  i hope you are not hurt said lord elmwood to miss milner but his voice was so much affected by what he felt he could scarcely articulate the words  not with the apprehension she was hurt was he thus agitated for the gaiety of her manners convinced him that could not be the case nor did he indeed suppose any accident such as was mentioned had occurred but the circumstance of unexpectedly seeing lord frederick had taken him off his guard and being totally unprepared he could not conquer those signs of surprise and the shock it had given him  lord frederick who had heard nothing of his intended union with his ward for it was even kept a secret at present from every servant in the house imputed this discomposure to the personal resentment his lordship might bear him in consequence of their duel for notwithstanding lord elmwood had assured the uncle of lord frederick who once waited upon him on the subject of miss milner that all resentment was on his part entirely at an end and that he was willing to consent to the ladies marriage with his nephew if she herself would concur yet lord frederick doubted the sincerity of this and would still have had the delicacy not to have entered lord elmwoods house but encouraged by miss milner and emboldened by his love personal resentment was then the construction he put upon lord elmwoods emotion on entering the room but miss milner and miss woodley knew his agitation to arise from a far different cause  after his entrance lord frederick did not attempt to resume his seat but bowing most respectfully to all present took his leave while miss milner followed him as far as the door repeating her thanks and gratitude for his protection  lord elmwood was hurt beyond measure but he had a second concern and that was he had not the power to conceal how much he was affected  he trembled  when he attempted to speak he stammered  he perceived his face burning with the blood that had flushed to it from confusion and thus one confusion gave birth to another till his state was pitiable  miss milner with all her assumed gaiety and real insolence had not however the insolence to seem to observe his situation she had only the confidence to observe it by stealth  and mrs horton and miss woodley having opportunely begun a discourse upon some trivial occurrences gave him time to recover himself by degrees  yet still it was merely by degrees for the impression this incident had made was deep and not easily to be erased  the entrance of mr sandford who knew nothing of what had happened was also some relief and his lordship and he entered into a conversation which they very soon retired into the library to terminate  miss milner taking miss woodley with her went directly to her own apartment and there exclaimed to her friend in rapture  he is mine  he loves me  and he is mine for ever  miss woodley congratulated her upon believing so but confessed she herself had her fears  what fears cried miss milner dont you perceive he loves me  i do said miss woodley but that i always supposed and i think if he loves you now he has still the good sense to know he has cause to hate you  what has good sense to do with love returned miss milner if a lover of mine suffers his understanding to get the better of his affection    and the same arguments were again going to be repeated but miss woodley interrupted her by requiring an explanation of her conduct not in respect to her guardian but to lord frederick whom at least she must allow she was treating with cruelty if she only made use of his affection to stimulate that of lord elmwoods  by no means my dear miss woodley  returned she  i have indeed done with my lord frederick from this day and he has certainly given me the proof i wanted of lord elmwoods love but then i did not engage him to this by the smallest degree of hope  no do not suspect me of that while my heart was anothers  and i assure you seriously it was from the circumstance we described that he came with me home  yet i must own that had i not had this design upon lord elmwoods jealousy in idea i would have walked on foot through the streets rather than have suffered his rivals civilities  but he pressed his services so violently and my lady evans in whose chariot i was when the accident happened pressed me so violently to accept them that he cannot expect any farther meaning from my acquiescence than my own convenience  miss woodley was going to reply when she resumed  nay if you intend to say i have done wrong still i am not sorry for it while it has given me such convincing proofs of lord elmwoods love  did you see him i am afraid you did not see how he trembled  and that manly firm voice faltered as mine does some times  his proud heart was humbled too as mine is some times  oh miss woodley i have been counterfeiting indifference to him i now find all his indifference has been counterfeit too and we not only love but we love equally  supposing this all as you hope i yet think it highly necessary your guardian should be informed seriously informed that it was mere accident for at present that plea seems but as a subterfuge which brought lord frederick hither  no that will be destroying the work so successfully began  i will not suffer any explanation to take place but let my lord elmwood act just as his love shall dictate and now i have no longer a doubt of its excess instead of stooping to him i wait in the certain expectation of his submission to me  chapter xi in vain for three long days did miss milner wait impatiently for this submission not a sign not a symptom appeared  nay lord elmwood had since the evening of lord fredericks visit which at the time it happened seemed to affect him so exceedingly become just the same man he was before the circumstance occurred except indeed something less thoughtful and now and then cheerful but without the smallest appearance that his cheerfulness was affected  miss milner was vexed she was alarmed but was ashamed to confess those humiliating sensations even to miss woodley  she assumed therefore the vivacity she had so long assumed but gave way when alone to a still greater degree of melancholy than usual she no longer applauded her scheme of bringing lord frederick to the house and trembled lest on some pretense he should dare to call again but as these were feelings her pride would not suffer her to disclose to her friend who would have condoled along with her their effects were doubly poignant  sitting in her dressing room one forenoon with miss woodley and burdened with a load of grief she blushed to acknowledge while her companion was charged with apprehensions she was as loath to disclose one of lord elmwoods valets tapped gently at the door and delivered a letter to miss milner  by the person who brought it as well as by the address she knew it came from lord elmwood and laid it down upon her toilet as if fearful to unfold it  what is that said miss woodley  a letter from my guardian replied miss milner  good heaven exclaimed miss woodley  nay returned she it is i have no doubt to beg my pardon but her reluctance to open it plainly evinced she did not think so  do not read it yet said miss woodley  i do not intend replied she trembling extremely  will you dine first said miss woodley  no  for not knowing its contents i shall not know how to conduct myself toward him  here a silence ensued  during this silence miss milner took up the letter  looked earnestly at the handwriting on the out side  at the seal  inspected into its folds  and seemed to wish by some equivocal method to guess at the contents without daring to come at the certain knowledge of them  curiosity at length got the better of her fears she opened the letter and scarce able to hold it while she read read the following words  madam while i considered you only as my ward my friendship for you was unbounded  when i looked upon you as a woman formed to grace a fashionable circle my admiration equalled my friendship  and when fate permitted me to behold you in the tender light of my betrothed wife my soaring love left those humbler passions at a distance  that you have still my friendship my admiration and even my love i will not attempt to deceive either myself or you by disavowing but still with a firm assurance i declare prudence outweighs them all and i have not from henceforward a wish to be regarded by you in any other respect than as one who wishes you well  that you ever beheld me in the endearing quality of a destined and an affectionate husband such as i would have proved my hopes my vanity own the deception and are humiliated  but i entreat you to spare their farther trial and for a single week do not insult me with the open preference of another  in the space of that time i shall have taken my leave of you for ever  i shall visit italy and some other countries for a few years till i become once more reconciled to the change of state i am enjoined a change i now most fervently wish could be entirely dispensed with  the occasion of my remaining in england a week longer is to settle some necessary affairs but chiefly that of delivering to a friend a man of worth and tenderness all those writings which have invested me with the power of my guardianship  he will the day after my departure without one upbraiding word resign them to you in my name and even your father could he behold the resignation would concur in its propriety  and now my dear miss milner let not affected resentment contempt or levity oppose that serenity which for the week to come i wish to enjoy  by complying with this request give me to believe that since you have been under my care you think i have at least faithfully discharged some part of my duty  and wherever i have been inadequate to your wishes attribute my demerits to some infirmity of mind rather than to a negligence of your happiness  yet be the cause what it will since these faults have existed i acknowledge them and beg your pardon  however time and succession of objects may eradicate more tender sentiments i am sure never to lose the liveliest anxiety for your welfare  and with all that solicitude which i cannot describe i entreat for your own sake for mine  when we shall be far asunder  and for the sake of your dead fathers memory call upon every important occasion your serious judgment to direct you  i am madam your sincerest friend elmwood   after reading every syllable of this letter it dropped from miss milners hands but she uttered not a word  there was however a paleness in her face a deadness in her eye and a kind of palsy over her frame which miss woodley who had seen her in every stage of her uneasiness never had seen before  i do not want to read the letter said miss woodley your looks tell me its contents  they will then discover to lord elmwood replied she what i feel but heaven forbid  that would sink me even lower than i am  scarce able to crawl she rose and looked in the glass as if to arrange her features so as to impose upon him alas this was of no avail a serenity of mind could alone effect what she desired  you must endeavor said miss woodley to feel that disposition you wish to make appear  i will replied she i will feel a proper pride  and a proper scorn of this treatment  and so desirous was she to attain the appearance of these sentiments she made the strongest efforts to calm her thoughts in order to acquire it  i have but a few days to remain with him she said to herself and we part for ever  in those few days it is not only my duty to obey his commands or rather comply with his request but it is also my wish to leave upon his mind an impression which may not add to the ill opinion he has formed of me but perhaps serve to diminish it  if in every other instance my conduct has been blameable he shall at least in this acknowledge its merit  the fate i have drawn upon myself he shall find i can be resigned to and he shall be convinced that the woman of whose weakness he has had so many fatal proofs is yet in possession of some fortitude  fortitude to bid him farewell without discovering one affected or one real pang though her death should be the immediate consequence  thus she resolved and thus she acted  the severest judge could not have arraigned her conduct from the day she received lord elmwoods letter to the day of his departure  she had indeed involuntary weaknesses but none with which she did not struggle and in general her struggles were victorious  the first time she saw him after the receipt of his letter was on the evening of the same day  she had a little concert of amateurs in music and was herself singing and playing when he entered the room the connoisseurs immediately perceived she lost the tune but lord elmwood was no connoisseur in the art and did not observe it  they occasionally spoke to each other during the evening but the subjects were general  and though their manners every time they spoke were perfectly polite they were not tinctured with the smallest degree of familiarity  to describe his behavior exactly it was the same as his letter polite friendly composed and resolved  some of the company staid supper which prevented the embarrassment that must unavoidably have arisen had the family been by themselves  the next morning each breakfasted in their separate apartments  more company dined with them and in the evening and at supper lord elmwood was from home  thus all passed on as peaceably as he had requested and miss milner had not betrayed one particle of frailty when the third day at dinner some gentlemen of his acquaintance being at table one of them said  and so my lord you absolutely set off on tuesday morning  this was friday  sandford and he both replied at the same time yes and sandford but not lord elmwood looked at miss milner when he spoke  her knife and fork gave a sudden spring in her hand but no other emotion witnessed what she felt  ay elmwood cried another gentleman at table you will bring home i am afraid a foreign wife and that i shall not forgive  it is his errand abroad i make no doubt said another visitor  before his lordship could return an answer sandford cried and what objection to a foreigner for a wife do not crowned heads all marry foreigners and who happier in the marriage state than some kings  lord elmwood directed his eyes to the side of the table opposite to that where miss milner sat  nay answered one of the guests who was a country gentleman what do you say ladies  do you think my lord ought to go out of his own nation for a wife and he looked at miss milner for the reply  miss woodley uneasy at her friends being thus forced to give an opinion upon so delicate a subject endeavored to satisfy the gentleman by answering to the question herself whoever my lord elmwood marries sir said miss woodley he no doubt will be happy  but what say you young lady asked the gentleman still keeping his eyes on miss milner  that whoever his lordship marries he deserves to be happy returned she with the utmost command of her voice and looks for miss woodley by replying first had given her time to collect herself  the color flew to lord elmwoods face as she delivered this short sentence and miss woodley flattered herself she saw a tear start in his eye  miss milner did not look that way  in an instant his lordship found means to change the subject but that of his journey still employed the conversation and what horses servants and carriage he took with him was minutely asked and so accurately answered either by himself or by mr sandford that miss milner although she had beheld her doom before till now had received no circumstantial account of it  and as circumstances add to or diminish all we feel hearing these things told increased the bitterness of their truth  soon after dinner the ladies retired and from that time though miss milners behavior still continued the fame yet her looks and her voice were totally altered  for the world she could not have looked cheerfully for the world she could not have spoken with a sprightly accent she frequently began in one but not three words had she uttered before her tones sunk into the flattest dejection  not only her color but her features became changed her eyes lost their brilliancy her lips seemed to hang without the power of motion her head drooped and her dress was wholly neglected  conscious of this distressed appearance and conscious of the weakness from whence it arose it was her desire to hide herself from the only object she could have wished to have charmed  accordingly she sat alone or with miss woodley in her own apartment as much as was consistent with that civility her guardian had requested and which forbade her from totally absenting herself  miss woodley felt so acutely the torments of her friend that had not her reason told her the inflexible mind of lord elmwood was fixed beyond her power to shake she had cast herself at his feet and implored the return of his affection and tenderness as the only means to save his once beloved ward from an untimely grave but her understanding  her knowledge of lord elmwoods firm and immovable temper and all his grievous provocations  her knowledge of his word long since given to sandford that if once resolved he would not recall his resolution  the certainty of the many plans that had been arranged for his travels all agreed to convince her that by any interference she only exposed miss milners tenderest love and delicacy to a contemptuous rejection  if the conversation did not every day turn upon the subject of lord elmwoods departure  a conversation he evidently avoided himself  yet every day some new preparation for his journey struck the ear or the eye of miss milner  and had she beheld a frightful spectre she could not have shuddered with more horror than when she unexpectedly passed his large trunks in the hall nailed and corded ready to be sent off to meet him at venice  at the sight she flew from the company that happened to be along with her and stole to the first lonely corner of the house to conceal her tears  she reclined her head upon her hands and bedewed them with the sudden anguish that had overcome her  she heard a footstep advancing toward the spot where she hoped to have been concealed she lifted up her eyes and beheld lord elmwood  pride was the first emotion his presence inspired  pride which arose from the humility into which she was plunged  she instantly stifled her tears and looked at him earnestly as if to imply what now my lord  he only answered with a bow which expressed these words alone i beg your pardon and immediately withdrew  thus each understood the others language without either uttering a word  the just construction which she put upon his looks and behavior upon this occasion kept up her spirits for some little time and she blessed heaven repeatedly for the singular favor of showing to her clearly by this accident his negligence of her sorrows his total indifference  the next day was the eve of that on which he was to depart  and the one on which she was to bid adieu to dorriforth to her guardian to lord elmwood to all her hopes at once  the moment she awoke on monday morning the recollection that this was perhaps the last day she was ever again to see him softened all the resentment his yesterdays conduct had given birth to and forgetting his austerity and all she once termed cruelties she now only remembered his friendship his anxious tenderness and his love  she was impatient to behold him and promised to herself for this last day to neglect no one opportunity of being with him for that purpose she did not breakfast in her own room as she had done for several mornings before but went into the breakfastroom where all the family generally met  she was rejoiced on hearing his voice as she opened the door yet the sound made her tremble so much she could scarcely totter to the table  miss woodley looked at her as she entered and was never so shocked at seeing her for never had she yet seen her look so ill  as she approached she made an inclination of her head to mrs horton and then to her guardian as was her custom when she first saw them in a morning  his lordship looked in her face as he bowed then turned his eyes upon the fire place rubbed his forehead and began talking with mr sandford  sandford during breakfast by accident cast his eyes upon miss milner his attention was caught by her deathly countenance and he looked earnestly  he then turned to lord elmwood to see if he was observing her appearance  he was not  and so much were her thoughts engaged on him alone she did not once perceive sandford gazing at her  mrs horton after a little while observed it was a beautiful morning  lord elmwood said he thought he heard it rain in the night  sandford cried for his part he slept too well to know and then unasked held a plate with buiscuits to miss milner  it was the first civility he had ever in his life offered her she smiled at the whimsicality of the circumstance but took one in return for his attention  he looked grave beyond his usual gravity and yet not with his usual ill temper she did not eat what she had so politely taken but laid it down soon after  lord elmwood was the first who rose from breakfast and did not return to dinner  at dinner mrs horton said she hoped his lordship would however favor them with his company at supper  to which sandford replied no doubt for you will hardly any of you see him in the morning as we shall be off by six or soon after  sandford was not going abroad with lord elmwood but was to go with him as far as dover  these words of his   not see lord elmwood in the morning  never again to see him after this evening were like the knell of death to miss milner  she felt the symptoms of fainting and eagerly snatched a glass of wine which the servant was holding to sandford who had called for wine and drank a part of it  as she returned the glass to the servant she began to apologize to mr sandford for her seeming rudeness but before she could utter what she meant he said goodnaturedly never mind  you are very welcome  i am glad you took it  she looked at him to observe whether he had really spoken kindly or ironically but before his countenance could satisfy her her thoughts were away from that trivial circumstance and again fixed upon lord elmwood  the moments seemed tedious till he came home to supper and yet when she reflected for how short a time the rest of the evening would continue she wished to defer the hour of his return for months  at ten oclock he arrived and at half after ten the family without any visitor met at supper  miss milner had considered that the period for her to counterfeit appearances was diminished now to a very short one and she rigourously enjoined herself not to shrink from that little which remained  the certain end that would be so soon put to this painful deception encouraged her to struggle through it with redoubled zeal and this was but necessary as her weakness increased  she therefore listened she talked and even smiled with the rest of the company nor did their vivacity seem to arise from a much less compulsive source than her own  it was past twelve when lord elmwood looked at his watch and rising from his seat went up to mrs horton and taking her hand said till i see you again madam i sincerely wish you every happiness  miss milner fixed her eyes upon the table before her  my lord replied mrs horton i sincerely wish you health and happiness likewise  he then went to miss woodley and taking her hand repeated much the same as he had said to mrs horton  miss milner now trembled beyond all power of concealment  my lord replied miss woodley a good deal affected i sincerely hope my prayers for your happiness may be heard  she and mrs horton were both standing as well as his lordship but miss milner kept her seat till his eye was turned upon her and he moved slowly toward her she then rose  and every one who was present attentive to what he would now say and how she would receive what he said cast their eyes upon them and listened with impatience  they were all disappointed  he did not utter a syllable  yet he took her hand and held it closely between his  he then bowed most respectfully and left her  no i wish you well  i wish you health and happiness no prayers for blessings on her  not even the word farewell escaped his lips  perhaps to have attempted any of these might have choked his utterance  she had behaved with fortitude the whole evening and she continued to do so till the moment he turned away from her  her eyes then overflowed with tears and in the agony of her mind not knowing what she did she laid her cold hand upon the person next to her  it happened to be sandford but not observing it was him she grasped his hand with violence  yet he did not snatch it away nor look at her with his wonted severity  and thus she stood silent and motionless while his lordship lighted a candle he took from the sideboard bowed once more to all the company and retired  sandford had still miss milners hand fixed upon his and when the door was shut after lord elmwood he turned his head to look in her face and turned it with some marks of apprehension for the grief he might find there  she strove to overcome that grief and after a heavy sigh sat down as if resigned to the fate to which she was decreed  instead of following lord elmwood as usual sandford poured out a glass of wine and drank it  a general silence ensued for near three minutes  at last turning himself round on his seat toward miss milner who sat like a statue of despair at his side will you breakfast with us tomorrow said he  she made no answer  we shall not breakfast before half after six continued he i dare say and if you can rise so early  why do  miss milner said miss woodley for she caught eagerly at the hope of her passing this night in less unhappiness than she had foreboded pray rise at that hour to breakfast mr sandwould not invite you if he thought it would displease his lordship  not i replied sandford churlishly  then desire her woman to call her said mrs horton to miss woodley  nay she will be awake i have no doubt returned her niece  no replied miss milner since lord elmwood has thought proper to take his leave of me without even speaking a word by my own design never will i see him again and here a flood of tears burst forth as if her heart burst at the same time  why did not you speak to him cried sandford  pray did you bid him farewell  and i dont see why one is not as much to be blamed in that respect as the other  i was too weak to say i wished him happy cried miss milner but heaven is my witness i do wish him so from my soul  and do you imagine he does not wish you so too cried sandford  you should judge him by your own heart and what you feel for him imagine he feels for you my dear  though  my dear is a trivial phrase yet from certain people and upon certain occasions it is a phrase of infinite comfort and assurance  mr sandford seldom said my dear to any one to miss milner never and upon this occasion and from him it was an expression most precious  she turned to him with a look of gratitude but as she only looked and did not speak he rose up and soon after said with a friendly tone he had seldom spoken with in her presence i sincerely wish you a good night  as soon as he was gone miss milner exclaimed however my fate may have been precipitated by the unkindness of mr sandford yet for that particle of concern he has shown for me this night i will always be grateful to him  ay cried mrs horton good mr sandford may show his kindness now without any danger from its consequences  now his lordship is going away for ever he is not afraid of your seeing him once again and she thought she praised him by this suggestion  chapter xii when miss milner retired to her bedchamber miss woodley went with her nor would leave her the whole night  but in vain did she persuade her to go to rest she absolutely refused and declared she would never from that hour indulge the smallest repose  the part i undertook to perform cried she is over i will now for my whole life appear in my own character and give a loose to the anguish i endure  as day light showed itself and yet i might see him once again said she i might see him within these two hours if i pleased for mr sandford invited me  if you think my dear miss milner said miss woodley that a second parting from lord elmwood would but give you a second agony in the name of heaven do not see him any more  but if you think your mind would be easier were you to bid each other adieu in a more direct manner than you did last night let us go down and breakfast with him  i will go before to prepare him for your reception  you shall not unexpectedly surprise him  and i will let him know it is by mr sandfords invitation you are coming  she listened with a smile to this proposal yet objected to the indelicacy of her wishing to see him after he had taken his leave  but as miss woodley nevertheless perceived she was inclined to infringe this delicacy of which she had so proper a sense she easily persuaded her it was impossible for the most suspicious person and lord elmwood was far from such a character to suppose that by paying him a visit at that period of time could be with the most distant idea of regaining his heart or of altering one resolution he had taken  in this opinion miss milner acquiesced yet she had not the courage to come to the determination she would go  day light now no longer peeped but stared broad upon them  miss milner went to the lookingglass breathed upon her hands and rubbed them on her eyes put some powder into her hair yet said after all i dare not see him again  you may do as you please said miss woodley but i will i that have lived for so many years under the same roof with him and on the most friendly terms and he going away perhaps for these ten years perhaps for ever i should think it a disrespect not to see him to the last moment of his remaining in the house  then do you go said miss milner eagerly and if he should ask for me i will gladly come you know but if he does not ask for me i will not  and pray do not deceive me  miss woodley gave her her word not to deceive her and soon after as they heard the servants pass about the house and the clock had struck six miss woodley went to the breakfastroom  she found lord elmwood there in his traveling dress standing pensively by the fire place  and as he did not dream of seeing her he started when she entered and with an appearance of alarm said dear miss woodley what is the matter  she replied nothing my lord but i could not be satisfied without seeing your lordship once again while i had it in my power  i thank you he returned with a sigh and the heaviest and most intelligent sigh she ever heard him condescend to give  she imagined also he looked as if he wished to ask how miss milner did but would not allow himself the indulgence  she was half inclined to mention her to him and debating in her mind whether she should or not mr sandford came into the room saying as he entered  for heavens sake my lord where did you sleep last night  why do you ask said his lordship  because replied sandford i went into your bedchamber but now and i found your bed made  you have not slept there tonight  i have slept no where answered his lordship i could not sleep  and having some papers to look over and to rise early i thought i might as well not go to bed at all  miss woodley was pleased at the frank manner in which he made this confession and could not resist the strong impulse to say you have done just then my lord like miss milner for she has not been in bed the whole night  miss woodley spoke this in a negligent manner and yet lord elmwood echoed back the words with solicitude and tenderness has not miss milner been in bed the whole night  if she is up why does not she come and take some coffee said sandford as he began to pour it out  if she thought it would be agreeable returned miss woodley i dare say she would and she looked at lord elmwood while she spoke though she did not absolutely address him but he made no reply  agreeable returned sandford angrily has she then a quarrel with any body here or does she suppose any body here bears enmity to her  is she not in peace and charity  yes replied miss woodley that i am sure she is  then bring her hither said he directly  would she have the wickedness to imagine we are not all friends with her  miss woodley left the room and found miss milner almost in despair left she should hear lord elmwoods carriage drive off before her friends return  did he send for me were the words she uttered as soon as she saw her  mr sandford did in his presence returned miss woodley and you may go with the utmost decorum or i would not tell you so  she required no protestations of this but readily followed her beloved adviser whose kindness never appeared in half the amiable light as at that moment  on entering the room through all the dead white of her present complexion she blushed to a crimson  lord elmwood rose from his seat and brought a chair for her to sit down  sandford looked at her inquisitively then sipped his tea and said he never made tea to his own liking  miss milner took a cup but had scarce strength to hold it  it seemed but a very short time they were at breakfast when the carriage that was to take his lordship away drove to the door  miss milner started at the sound so did he but she had nearly dropped her cup and saucer on which sandford took them out of her hand saying  perhaps you had rather have coffee  her lips moved but he could not hear what she said  a servant came in and told lord elmwood the carriage was at the door  he replied very well but though he had breakfasted he did not attempt to move  at last rising briskly from his seat as if it was necessary to go in haste when he did go he took up his hat which he had brought with him into the room and was turning to miss woodley to take his leave when sandford cried my lord you are in a great hurry  and then as if he wished to give poor miss milner every moment he could added looking about i dont know where i have laid my gloves  his lordship after repeating to miss woodley his last nights farewell now went up to miss milner and taking one of her hands again held it between his but still without speaking  while she unable to suppress her tears as heretofore suffered them to fall in torrents  what is all this cried sandford going up to them in anger  they neither of them replied or changed their situation  separate this moment  cried sandford  or resolve never to be separated but by death  the commanding and awful manner in which he spoke this sentence made them both turn to him in amazement and almost petrified with the sensation his words had caused  he left them for a moment and going to a small bookcase in one corner of the room took out of it a book and returning with it in his hand said  lord elmwood do you love this woman  more than my life replied his lordship with the most heartfelt accents  he then turned to miss milner  can you say the same by him  she spread her hands over her eyes and cried oh heavens  i believe you can say so returned sandford and in the name of god and your own happiness since this is the case let me put it out of your power to part  lord elmwood gazed at him with wonder and yet as if enraptured by the sudden appearance of a change in his prospects  she sighed with a trembling kind of extacy while sandford with all the pomp and dignity of a clergyman in his official character delivered these words  my lord while i thought my counsel might save you from the worst of misfortunes conjugal strife i importuned you hourly and set forth your danger in the light it appeared to me  but though old and a priest i can submit to think i have been in an error and i now firmly believe it is for the welfare of you both to become man and wife  my lord take this womans marriage vows you can ask no fairer promises of her reform she can give you none half so sacred half so binding and i see by her looks she will mean to keep them  and my dear continued he addressing himself to her act but under the dominion of those vows to a husband of sense and virtue like him and you will be all that i himself or even heaven can desire  now then lord elmwood this moment give her up for ever or this moment constrain her by such ties from offending you she shall not dare to violate  lord elmwood struck his forehead in doubt and agitation but still holding her hand he cried i cannot part from her  then feeling this reply as equivocal he fell upon his knees and cried will you pardon my hesitation  and will you in marriage show me that tender love you have not shown me yet  will you in possessing all my affections bear with all my infirmities  she raised him from her feet and by the expression of her face the tears with which she bathed his hands gave him confidence  he turned to sandford  then placeing her by his own side as the form of matrimony requires gave this as a sign for sandford to begin the ceremony  on which he opened his book and  married them  while with a countenance  manner  and voice so serious and so fervent did he perform these rites that the idea of jest or even of lightness was far from the mind of every one present  miss milner covered with shame sunk on the bosom of miss woodley  when the ring was wanting lord elmwood supplied it with one from his own hand but throughout all the rest of the ceremony appeared lost in zealous devotion to heaven  yet no sooner was it finished than his thoughts seemed to descend to this world  he embraced his bride with all the transport of the fondest happiest bridegroom and in raptures called her by the endearing name of wife  but still my lord cried sandford you are only married by your own church and conscience not by your wifes or by the law of the land and let me advise you not to defer that marriage long lest in the time you disagree and she yet refuse to become your legal spouse  i think there is danger returned his lordship and therefore our second marriage must take place tomorrow  to this the ladies objected and it was left to sandford to fix their second wedding day as he had done their first  he after consideration gave four days interval  miss woodley then recollected for every one else had forgot it that the carriage was still at the door to convey lord elmwood abroad  it was of course dismissed  and one of those great incidents of delight miss milner that morning tasted was to look out of the window and see this very carriage drive from the door unoccupied  never was there a more rapid change from despair to happiness  to happiness most supreme  than was that which miss milner and lord elmwood experienced within one single hour  the few days that intervened between this and their legal marriage were passed in the delightful care of preparing for that happy day  yet with all its delights inferior to the first when every joy was doubled by the expected sorrow  nevertheless on that first wedding day that joyful day which restored her lost lover to her hopes again even on that very day after the sacred ceremony was over miss milner  with all the fears the tremors the superstition of her sex  felt an excruciating shock when looking on the ring lord elmwood had put upon her finger in haste when he married her she perceived it was a  mourning ring  end of the second volume errata to the second volume page   for ever saw read had ever seen   for for a
