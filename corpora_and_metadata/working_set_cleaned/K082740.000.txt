elegies by mr delap  london printed for r and j dodsley in pall mall mdcclx  elegies elegy i ah stay  thy wand oblivious over my eyes yet wave mild power of sleep  my prayer is vain she flies the partial nurse of nature flies with all her soothing visionary train then let me forth and near yon flowering thorn taste heavens pure breath while robbed in amber vest fresh from her watery couch the youthful morn steals on the slumbers of the drowzy east lo at her presence the strong arm of toil with glittering sickle mows the prime of may while yon poor hirelings for the mine is rude soil leave to their sleeping babes their cots of clay with sturdy step they cheerly whistle over the path that flings across the reedy plain to the deep caverns of that yawning moor whose shaggy breast abhors the golden grain there in her green dress nature never roves spreads the gay lawn nor lifts the lordly pine they see no melting clouds refresh the groves no living landscape drawn by hands divine but many a fathom from the sunny breeze their painful way in central night they wear heave the pikd axes on their bended knees or sidelong the rough quarry slowly tear yet while damp vapors chill each reeking brow how loudly laughs the jovial voice of mirth pleased that the wages of the day allow a social blaze to cheer their evening hearth there the chaste housewife with maternal care her thrifty distaf plies in grave attire blessed to behold her ruddy offspring wear the full resemblance of their sturdy sire to spread with such coarse fare their homely board as fits the genius of their little fate free from those ills that haunt their pampered lord to be unhappy we must first be great in these dark caves where heavens paternal hand far from the world their private cradle laid they toil secure the storms that strike the land with wild dismay roll harmless over their head for who the load of weary life to bear would from these murky mansions chase the slave who cease to breathe heavens pure and cheerful air to be but living tenants of the grave yet harrassd as they are their face still wears the reverend comeliness of green old age no stains their mind from worldly science bears their ray of knowledge gleams from natures page the few plain rules her simple lessons give they still through life with pleased attention ply their helpless offspring bid them wish to live their breathless parents bid them learn to die and surely heaven whose penetrating sight pierces the soul and reads its inmost groan must see content with more sincere delight toil in the mine than triumph on the throne see charles v of spain who in the full blaze of his glory resigned the throne to his son philip and retired to a convent in estremadura charles more pleased within the convents gloom seeking the slaves calm nights their temperate days and peaceful passage to the private tomb than diademd with glorys crimson rays even the proud sage whose deep mysterious brain has reasoned all the balm of hope away convinced that learnings but ingenious pain might hail their happier lot and sighing say oh had i thus within the dark profound by daily labor earned my daily food or with yon seedsman sowed the quickening ground or cleavd with ponderous ax the groaning wood full many an hour that now though sped with art on slow and dusky pinions sullen flies full many an anxious wish or pang of heart that reasons boasted anodyne defies had never been born nor had the uneasy mind pent in the prison of this mortal mould felt its ethereal energy confined its brightest sunshine in dark clouds enrolled but native sense her modest course had run her saintly luster untaught virtue spread health crowned my toils and ere the day was done sound sleep beneath some alders rustling shade then as i stole down lifes declining hill here natures gifts had furnished natures needs the brooks cold beverage every latent ill had starved that cloistered contemplation feeds till in the peaceful shade of this lone bower or near yon shattered tower in silence laid the orient orb that watched my natal hour had brightly glittered over my mouldering head to sickness elegy ii how blithe the flowery graces of the spring from natures wardrobe come and hark how gay each glittering insect hovering on the wing sings their glad welcome to the fields of may they gaze with greedy eye each beauty over they suck the sweet breath of the blushing rose sport in the gale or sip the rainbow shower their lifes short day no pause of pleasure knows like theirs dread power my cheerful morn displayed the flattering promise of a golden noon till each gay cloud that sportive nature spread died in the gloom of thy distempered frown yes ere i told my two and twentieth year swift from thy quiver flew the deadly dart harmless it past mid many a blithe compeer and found its fated entrance near my heart pale as i lay beneath thy ebon wand i saw them rove through pleasures flowery field i saw health paint them with her rosy hand eager to burst my bonds but forced to yield yet while this mortal cot of mouldering clay shakes at the stroke of thy tremendous power ah must the transient tenant of a day bear the rough blast of each tempestuous hour say shall the terrors thy pale flag unfolds too rigid queen unnerve the souls bright powers till with a joyless smile the eye beholds arts magic charms and natures fairy bowers no let me follow still those bowers among her flowery footsteps as the goddess goes let me just lifted bove the unlettered throng read the few books the learned few compose and suffer when thy aweful pleasure calls the soul to share her frail companions smart yet suffer me to taste the balm that falls from friendships tongue so sweet upon the heart then though each trembling nerve confess thy frown even till this anxious being shall become but a brief name upon a little stone without one murmur i embrace my doom for many a virtue sheltered from mankind lives calm with thee and lord over each desire and many a feeble frame whose mighty mind each muse has touched with her immortal fire even mr pope he sole terror of a venal age the tuneful bard whose philosophic soul with such bright radiance glowed on virtues page learned many a lesson from thy moral school he mr gray too who mounts and keeps his distant way his daring mind thy humanizing glooms have tempered with a melancholy ray and taught to warble mid the village tombs yes goddess to thy temples deep recess i come and lay for ever at its door the siren throng of follies numberless nor wish their flattering songs should sooth me more thy decent garb shall oer my limbs be spread thy hand shall lead me to thy sober train who here retired with pensive pleasure tread the silent windings of thy dark domain hither the cherub charity shall fly from her bright orb and brooding over my mind for misery raise a sympathizing sigh pardon for foes and love for humankind then while ambitions trump from age to age its slaughtered millions boasts while fame shall rear her deathless trophies over the bard and sage be mine the widows sigh the orphans prayer the end
