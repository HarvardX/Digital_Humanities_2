an enquiry into the disposal of the equivalent it has been the subject of debate for sometime now whether we should have an equivalent in scotland for such payments as are to be made on a coalition of the nations  but whether what was proposed was equal was really an equivalent or no and the world has been long hurried with these enquities  but now here arises a new cloud and though it is not only no bigger than a mans hand but is never like to be bigger yet as it is dressed up it threatens mighty things and this is what you shall do with the equivalent when you have it  it is a little hard people that cry up your national sagacity in their arguments against an equivalent in general should question your sagacity in knowing what to do with the money when you have it  to answer therefore the doubts of some and prevent the objections of others i shall enter a little briefly on an enquiry into the manner of disposing the equivalent you are to have or in short enquire how you shall employ the money when it comes  and in general as to this head i think the nature of the payment it self and the very words of the treaty direct us to the use to which this money is to be employed viz an equivalent  the property here will have no alteration in its denomination it remains an equivalent to its last circulation into the chaos of the current cash of britain you receive it as an equivalent and you pay it as an equivalent it is an equivalent paid you for money which by your customs and excises will of course be appropriated to the uses of another nation after the union which nation therefore advances you the sum in specie that you may not be out of purse on their account  when you have it you dispose of it    as an equivalent to the africancompany for the demise and dissolution of their society there being companies in england already embarked in those trades and double companies having proved incompatible as in the two eastindiacompanies who if they had remained ununited to this time had been both ruined and the members of this company having by the union full leave to come in to the said english company as freely and on the same conditions as englishmen may it is agreed the scots company shall cease and for a satisfaction the first part of the equivalent is appropriated to be an equivalent for the said company by paying the subscribers their principal and interest and so  ompany expiring sets them down just where it took them up and i think they ought to esteem it a very happy landing and what without the assistance of england they could not have obtained by trade in  0 years    another head for the disposing this money is as an equivalent for the coin which by the treaty is to be reduced to the standard of the english money  i shall say very little to a gentlemans paper who is for having this equivalent made good before that to the african company as a thing of vast moment to the nation  if i understand the dispute one previous question well discussed will effectually answer all his objections and that is whether there is not enough in the equivalent that england is to pay to discharge both and if that be true the mighty dispute drops of course and it is not one farthing matter which of these two go first  i cannot but think the gentleman that wrote that sheet went on a calcul of the coin as false as he has done of the equivalent it self where he mistakes ninety thousand pound atone clap and no wonder he is in such concern since he has lost such a sum out of the whole just at his first setting out for he says it is  0     l  0 s and the several times whereas if i think right it is just    0   l  0 sh  i shall therefore attempt here two things   examine what the species of coin are that are to be reduced and  ly to make a probable conjecture at the deficiency  for the species i shall observe the words of the treaty say not the current money in scotland but the current coin of scotland and this distinction will immediately lead me to this negative  that you are not to imagine as some have very grossly done that the foreign coins which the error of custom the disaster of trade and the searcity of bullion have made current here at an extravagant rate should be brought into your mint and be recoind and the owner of such money be allowed the difference from the rate of their present valuation to the price of that new standard  let no men flatter themselves with such a notion if this were true it would not only expose scotland to innumerable incoveniencies but might indeed soon eat up the whole equivalent since as there must be a certain stated time given for bringing in the money into the mint all the rix dollars in europe might be brought into scotland the difference between their real and imaginary value be paid in specie by the public and the owner receive the new money for the remainder which difference would make it very well worth while to bring the dollars from abroad and carry back the british crowns in their room or may lay out the money in any part of britain in manufactures corn or lead and carry them cheaper to market than any native of britain can do it his money costing him less than theirs does  this was exactly the case in england when guineas rose from    s   d each to  0 the merchants in holland and hamburgh immediately fall to buying of gold and send it to england by all possible conveyance so much as by the very post and such was the hurry that had it held much longer all the gold in europe would have flowed into england  the consequence of this was that the english merchants were struck out of their own trade a dutch merchant could buy bays at colchester or sarges at exeter and send them to spain and sell  0 per cent cheaper than the english merchants that lived at the same town the case was plain the gold which in holland stood them in   l to   l   s   d and though at last it rise up to   l per ounce yet in england went for above   pound and so their money cost them    per cent less than the english merchant could buy for  from this example i think it is evident that the foreign coin has no concern in this reduction  if it had been answered that this then will be an immediate loss to the nation and to private persons also i answer  to the nation it can be no loss because when ever such pieces came into scotland the imaginary value was an addition to its real value and so raised its currency to the credit of the general stock and when ever it goes away again the difference is only an imaginary diminution and stands to the debit of the public stock in the same manner and the general value of scotland receives no real alteration  money is a real intrinsic species appointed by custom as the medium of trade to bring commerce in all its particular states to a balance  so much as its real value amounts to so much real wealth is in that nation and this real value is every where the same but its received value differs in the several nations according to the particular circumstances of those nations as to coin standards plenty or scarcity of money  these differences are again reconciled among merchants and all is brought to par in their negotiating by adding or diminishing as the imaginary differences in value require between nation and nation or port and port and this is called exchange a thing full of nicety and which i take to be the best accomplishment of a complete merchant  it is true the rates of exchange differ rise and fall according to the quantities of money that lie to draw or to remitt but this is a thing that depends so much on the artifice of the merchant or exchanger that it has little regard to the real differences of the species and therefore it is not to my purpose    the next negative relates to the coin of england which is now current here such as guineas of gold and silver pieces of the crown half crown shilling and sixpence these i presume shall find no alteration here and being the same to which the coin of britain is to be reduced there can be no melting them down for that would be to do nothing at all but melt the half crown into half a crown and a shilling into a shilling and so on  as to the loss upon this money it is impossible to have it rectified by any law or any just equivalent given for it since should any time be given for that it would make a wild trade to fetch a million or two of it from england carry it into the mint demand   d per shilling and immediately carry back the very same species again  i confess i should have thought these negatives of no use had i not seen abundance of people weak enough to imagine they should receive satisfaction here from the public for all the deficiency of the imaginary value of foreign money  i could spend some time to show examples but i think it needless england made three essays about money and these are examples enough in two of them they made no equivalent for loss and in the third they did and they exactly hit the case  first they reformed the guineas and gave no equivalent for the loss they sunk them from  0 to    shil each at one blow and some rich engrossers of those pleasant manufactories lost great sums of money by it  the reason was plain it was a distemper in trade and wanted a cure every man had a share in the benefit at first and every body ought to bear their share of the burden and take their chance for their particulars  another time the parliament finding trade oppressed by a flux of french pistoles reduced them to    shil each and for this there was no equivalent offered for the evil was of the same original  and here by the way i must note that it was not a mischief to england to have a flux of gold either guineas or pistoles nor can it be to scotland if she had ten millions of dollars among her current money but the evil is these several coins going there or here at an advance in price by which your neighbors always have this advantage that they draw your goods away at the price of all that imaginary value  at last the parliament of england fell to work with their own coin reduced it all to the standard and recoind it and then they allowed an equivalent to the proprietor  because now they did not reduce advanced value but took in the very species at which time clipping counterfeiting and such like abuses had made it really deficient in the species this the government was obliged to and so in scotland it will be of course  now the gentleman that quarrels at this argues this is a mighty concern and is angry it is put off to the last or excrescence as he calls it of the equivalent since twill undoubtedly be an unknown and insupportable loss and hazard to the nation  now not to spend time to be merry upon the blunder of the loss being insupportable first and then unknown i would be glad this insupportable burden might be examined and i will go the nearest way to it that i can  it is plain none but the coin is to be reduced and when all the present coin is called in i believe no man will say it is likely it should amount to  00000 lib sterling in silver  of this a great part is in the new coin   d  0 d  0 d  0 d pieces and of these there can be no loss if the gentlemen who have carried so great a quantity abroad lately in specie should be pleased to carry away a few more there would be so few left as would effectually take off the loss on that head  as to the old    sh pieces and   d and   d and   d half penny the quantity is very small and all the rest is coppermoney the deficiency of which cannot be much and upon the whole if this gentleman will please to procure a tack or farm upon this casuality i shall at any time bring him people that giving unquestionable security to the government shall undertake all the loss and deficiency and make it good to scotland the coinage excepted on the whole coin of scotland for  0000 lib sterling  if this be so then the mighty weight of insupportable loss is at an end  i know it is inquired here whether on reducing the coin to the standard the prices of goods labor etc shall not fall in all places and so scotland suffer a loss here which may be indeed insupportable and though i know a long answer is expected to this mine will be very short  i answer this is no loss at all for this only reason  there is a sinking the imaginary value indeed but no sinking the real value  the species is not debased nor your standard allayed and therefore though your goods manufactories and labor seem to sink they really do not sink  it is true you shall buy as much for    d then as you do for    d now but that you buy for    d now shall sell for as much abroad as that you bought for    d before and you shall remit home at the same price too  the poor man shall labor as much now for    d as he did before for    d but then his    d shall now buy as much provision for his family as his    d would do before  the landlord shall receive but    d for his farm that before paid him    but he shall buy as many horses or houses lands or goods for his    d as he could before for his    d so that every way the intrinsic remains the same and the nation has no loss  in foreign exchanges it is the same your value is all over the world the same from england you shall draw without gain but then you remit without loss and which way soever you turn as to balance of exchange it is the same thing because the intrinsic value of the species remains the same  all the imaginary inconveniences about the coin with respect to the time of coinage may as effectually be answered as this and the practice in england is a precedent to go by if the currency of the mint be supported by a small sum of new money before hand there can be no inconvenience of time or stop of species and therefore the sad complaint the author of that sheet makes of foreign bills being protested or landlords ruining the poor tennent for want of species of current money is at an end  indeed if the old money was to be called in before the new money was to be given out there might be some stop and for want of money trade might suffer some inconvenience bills be protested and the like  but it is but keeping the old money current till the gross of the new money be delivered out it will circulate insensibly and not the least sensible hesitation be felt  finis
