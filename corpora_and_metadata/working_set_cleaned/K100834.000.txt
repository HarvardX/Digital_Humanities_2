the works of homer and of aristotle began to be restored and studied in italy when the pure and uncorrupted sources of ancient poesy and ancient criticism were opened and literature in general seemed emerging from the depths of gothic ignorance and barbarity it might have been expected that instead of the romantic species of poetical composition introduced by the provencal bards a new and more legitimate taste of writing would have succeeded that unnatural events the machinations of imaginary beings and adventures entertaining only as they were improbable would have given place to justness of thought and design and to that decorum which nature dictated and which the example and the precept of antiquity had authorized but it was a long time before such a change as this was effected and we find ariosto many years after the revival of letters rejecting truth for magic and choosing rather to follow the irregular and ridiculous excursions of boiardo than the propriety and uniformity of the great grecian and roman epic models nor was the state of criticism less generally and effectually influenced than that of poesy by the restoration of ancient learning beni one of the most celebrated critics of the sixteenth century was still so infatuated with a love of the old provencal vein that he ventured to write a regular dissertation in which he compares ariosto with homer trissino indeed who was nearly contemporary with ariosto had taste and boldness enough to publish a poem written in professed imitation of the iliad but this attempt met with little regard or applause for that very reason on which its real merit was founded it was rejected as an insipid and unentertaining performance having few devils or enchantments to recommend it to trissino succeeded tasso who in his gierusaleme liberata took the ancients for his guides but was at the same time too sensible of the prevailing taste for ideal beings and romantic description to omit them entirely though he was well acquainted with and fully convinced of the excellencies of homer and virgil yet he still kept the old provencal poets in his eye like his own rinaldo who after he had gazed on the diamond shield of truth and while he was departing from armida and her enchanted gardens could not help looking back upon them with some remains of fondness nor did tassos poem though composed in some measure on a classical and uniform plan gain its author in his own country at least any higher share of praise and reputation upon that account ariosto with all his extravagancies was still preferred and the superiority of the orlando furioso to the gierusaleme liberata was at length established by a formal decree of the academicians della crusca who held a solemn court of enquiry concerning the merit of both poems  in the midst of this bad taste spenser began to write his faerie queen which after the practice of ariosto was to consist of allegories enchantments and romantic adventures carried on by fairy knights giants magicians and fictitious beings it may indeed be urged as an instance of spensers weak and undiscerning judgment that he chose to follow ariosto rather than tasso the plan and conduct of whose poem was much more regular and legitimate than that of his rival to this objection it may be answered in defense of our author that he was reasonably induced to follow that poem which was most celebrated and popular for though the french critics in general gave the preference to tasso yet in italy the partisans on the side of ariosto were by far the most numerous and consequently in england for italy in the age of queen elizabeth gave laws to our island in all matters of taste as france has done ever since it must however be confessed at the same time that spenser was in some measure influenced from the natural biass of his mind to prefer that plan which would admit of the most extensive range for his unbounded imagination what this plan is and how it is conducted we shall now proceed to examine  see spensers letter to sir w raleigh etc the poet supposes that the faerie queen held a magnificent feast according to annual custom which lasted twelve days on each of which respectively twelve several complaints are preferred before her accordingly in order to redress the injuries which were the occasion of these several complaints she sends out twelve different knights each of which in the particular adventure allotted to him proves an example of some particular virtue as of holiness temperance justice chastity etc and has one complete book assigned to him of which he is the hero but besides these twelve knights severally exemplifying twelve moral virtues there is one principal knight or general hero viz prince arthur who represents magnificence a virtue which is supposed to be the perfection of all the rest who assists in every book the end of whose actions is to find out gloriana or glory and in whose person the poet intends to pourtray the image of a brave knight perfected in the twelve private moral virtues  it is evident that our author in establishing one hero who seeking and attaining one grand end viz gloriana or glory should exemplify one grand character viz that of a brave knight perfected in the twelve private moral virtues had the practice of virgil and homer in his eye but though he was sensible of the importance and expediency of a unity of the hero and of his design yet he does not at the same time seem convinced of the necessity of that unity of action by which this design should be properly accomplished nor sufficiently acquainted with the method of proceeding made use of by the two great originals abovementioned in conducting their respective heroes to the one grand end proposed it may be asked with great propriety how does arthur execute this one grand ultimate design it may be answered with no less plausibility that by assisting each patron of the twelve virtues respectively in his allotted defense or patronage of each arthur approaches still nearer and nearer to glory till at last he obtains it and so consummates the intended grand design but surely to assist only is not sufficient to gain this end or complete the proposed character the poet ought to have made his arthur the principal agent in the redress of each particular wrong which arose from the various violation of holiness temperance justice chastity etc if the hero had thus in his own person exerted himself in the service of all the twelve virtues he might have been deservedly styled the perfect pattern of them all and consequently would then have completed the proposed grand end viz the attainment of glory at present he is only a subordinate or rather accessory character the difficulties and obstacles which he should have surmounted in order to gain the proposed end are done to his hand and removed by others it is not he who conquers the dragon in the first book to instance in no other or who quells the magician busirane in the third these are achievements executed by st george and by britomart in short the twelve several knights or patrons do too much for arthur to do any thing or at least what may reasonably be expected from the plan of the poet while we are attending to the design of the hero of the book we forget that of the hero of the poem mr dryden remarks we must do spenser that justice to observe that magnanimity magnificence which is the true character of prince arthur shines throughout the whole poem and succors the rest when they are in distress dedication to juvenal if the magnanimity of prince arthur did in reality shine throughout the whole poem with a steady and superior luster our author would stand excused but at present it breaks forth but seldom in dim and interrupted flashes it is not like the pervading spirit of virgil which  agitat molem and magno se corpore miscet aen vi ver      and to succor the rest when they are in distress is a circumstance of too little importance in the hero of a poem to succor is in fact a service to be performed in the cause of the hero by some dependent and inferior chief the business of a gyas or a cloanthus a mnestheus or a serestus  upon the whole and in general it must be observed that spensers adventures which are the subject of each single book have no mutual dependence upon each other and consequenly do not contribute to constitute one legitimate poem and mr hughes not considering this has advanced a remark in commendation of spenser which may most properly be turned to his censure if we consider the first book as an entire work of itself we shall find it to be no irregular contrivance there is one principal action which is completed in the twelfth canto and the several incidents are proper as they tend either to obstruct or promote it remarks on the fairy queen hughess edit of spensers works vol   as the heroic poem is required to be one whole compounded of many various parts depending upon and relative to each other so it is expedient that not one of those parts should be so regularly contrived and so completely finished as to become a whole of itself for the mind being thus once satisfied in arriving at the completion of an orderly series of events acquiesces in that satisfaction and its attention and curiosity are diverted from pursuing with due vigor the final and general catastrophe whereas while each part is left imperfect i mean incomplete if disjoined or separated from the rest the mind still desirous and eager of gratifying its expectations is irresistibly and imperceptibly drawn on from part to part till it receives a full and ultimate satisfaction from the accomplishment of one great event which all those parts following and illustrating each other contributed to produce  our author was probably aware that by constituting twelve several adventures for twelve several knights a want of continuity and general concatenation of facts would be laid to his charge and upon this account i suppose he sometimes begins a story in one book the completion of which he defers not without much interruption to some future and distant book a proceeding which unavoidably occasions much confusion to the reader and it seems to be for the same reason that after one of the twelve knights has fulfilled the adventure of his book he introduces him in the next book acting perhaps in an inferior light and degraded to some less dangerous adventure a conduct which destroys that repose which the mind feels after having accompanied a hero through various distresses and difficulties to success and victory besides when we view the hero entering upon an inferior attempt our former admiration is diminished having seen him once nobly and decisively conquer we become so warmly interested in his honor that we look upon his engagement in any posterior enterprise however successfully which is less arduous than that of which we had just before hailed him the conqueror as derogatory to that glory which he had just acquired by such a conquest spenser perhaps would have embarassed himself and the reader less had he made every book one entire detached poem without any the least reference to the rest thus he would have written twelve distinct poems in all of which he might have completed the pattern of a particular virtue in twelve knights respectively at present he has remarkably failed in endeavoring to represent all the virtues completed in the character of one the poet must either have established twelve knights without an arthur or an arthur without twelve knights upon supposition that spenser was resolved to characterise the twelve moral virtues the former plan perhaps would have been best the latter must necessarily want simplicity as it is an action consisting of twelve actions all equally great and unconnected between themselves and not an action consisting of one uninterrupted and coherent chain of incidents tending to the accomplishment of one design  it has been observed before that our author endeavored to express the character of a knight perfected in the twelve moral virtues by representing him as assisting in the service or defense of each till at last he becomes possessed of all this plan however injudicious he certainly was obliged to observe but in the third book which is styled the legend of chastity prince arthur does not so much as lend his assistance in the protection or vindication of that virtue he appears indeed but not as an auxiliary in the adventure of the book  it must however be confessed that there is something artificial in the poets manner of varying from historical precision a conduct which may be best illustrated from his own words but because the beginning of the whole work seems abrupt and as depending upon other antecedents it needs that ye know the occasion of these three knights several adventures for the method of a poet historical is not such as of an historiographer for an historiographer discourses of affairs orderly as they were done accounting as well the times as the action but a poet thrusts into the midst even where it most concerns him and there recoursing to the things forepast and divining of things to come makes a pleasing analysis of all the beginning therefore of my history were it to be told by an historiographer should be in the twelfth book which is the last where i devise that the faerie queen held her annual feast twelve days upon which twelve several days the occasion of twelve several adventures happened which being undertaken by twelve several knights are in these twelve books severally handled and discoursed letter to sir w raleigh it appears from this quotation that spenser had finished but three books when this letter was written  thus according to this plan the reader would have been agreeably surprised in the last book when he came to discover that all the adventures which he had just gone through were undertaken at the command of the faerie queen and that all the knights had severally set forward to the execution of them from her annual birthday festival but spenser in most of his books has injudiciously forestalled the first of these particulars which certainly should have been concealed till the last book not only to have prevented a needless repetition of the same thing but that he might likewise secure an opportunity to himself of amusing the readers mind with a circumstance new and unexpected  but notwithstanding the plan and conduct of our author in the poem before us is highly exceptionable yet i am apt to think that the faerie queen is not upon the whole so confused and irregular as the orlando furioso though there is no general unity in the former yet if we consider every book or adventure as a separate poem we shall meet with so many distinct however imperfect unities by which means the reader is less bewildered than by that general indigested medley of which the former totally consists and in which we meet with neither partial nor universal unity  cum nec pes nec caput uni reddatur formae  hor art poet v     the very idea of celebrating the madness of an hero carries with it somewhat extravagant and absurd orlando does not make his appearance till b   where he is placed in a situation not very heroic he is first discovered to us in bed desiring to sleep his ultimate design is to find angelica but his pursuit of her is broken off in b  0 after which there are sixteen more books to come and in which angelica disappears other heroes are likewise engaged in the same pursuit after reading the first stanza of b   one would be inclined to think that the subject of the poem was the expedition of the moors into france under their emperor agramante to fight against charlemayne but this matter is the least part of the poem in fact many of the knights perform exploits equal if not superior to those of orlando and particularly rogero with a grand achievement of wholn the poem is closed viz his killing rodomont but this event is not the completion of a story carried on principally through the whole work the author passes from one incident to another and from region to region whether it be from england to the hesperides or from the earth to the moon with such incredible swiftness and rapidity that one would think he was mounted upon his own winged steed ippogrifo he begins a tale of a knight in europe and suddenly breaks it off to resume the unfinished catastrophe of another in asia the imagination of the reader is not so much involved in as it is oppressed with the multiplicity of stories in the relation of each of which the poet is at the same time equally engaged to remedy this inconvenience it was thought proper to affix in some of the editions marginal hints informing the reader in what book and stanza the poet would recommence some interrupted episode an expedient not more inartificial than that which the first painters were obliged to make use of in order to assist their want of skill who having drawn the figure of a man a bird or a quadruped found it necessary to write underneath the name of the kind to which the thing represented belonged however this method has been the means of giving the reader a clear comprehension of ariostos tales which otherwise he could not have obtained without much difficulty this poet is seldom read twice in order that is by passing from the first canto to the second and from the second to the rest successively but by persuing without any regard to the order of the books or the stanzas the different stories which though all somewhere finished yet are at present so mutually interwoven that the incidents of one are perpetually clashing with those of another the ingenious abbe du bos reflections etc c    observes happily enough that homer is a geometrician in comparison of ariosto and indeed his miscellaneous matter cannot be better expressed than by the two first verses of his exordium le done i cavallier larme gli amori le cortesie laudaci imprese io canto c i s    of dames of knights of arms of loves delight of courtesies of high attempts i sing harrington but to return though the faerie queen does not exhibit that economy of plan and exact arrangement of parts which epic severity requires yet we scarcely regret the loss of these while their place is so amply supplied by something which more powerfully attracts us as it engages the affection of the heart rather than the applause of the head and if there be any poem whose graces please because they are situated beyond the reach of art and where the faculties of creative imagination delight us because they are unassisted and unrestrained by those of deliberate judgment it is in this of which we are now speaking to sum up all in a few words though in the faerie queen we are not satisfied as critics yet we are transported as readers  sect ii of spensers imitations from old romances although spenser formed his faerie queen upon the fanciful plan of ariosto as i remarked in the preceding section yet it must be confessed that the adventures of spensers knights are a more exact and immediate copy of those which we meet with in old romances or books of chivalry than they are of those of which the orlando furioso consists ariostos knights exhibit very surprising instances of their prowess and atchieve many heroic actions but our authors knights are more particularly engaged in revenging injuries and doing justice to the distressed which was the proper business and ultimate end of the ancient knighterrantry and thus though many of spensers incidents and expedients are to be found in ariosto such as that of blowing a horn at the sound of which the gates of a castle fly open of the vanishing of an enchanted palace or garden after some knight has destroyed the enchanter and the like yet these are not more peculiarly the property of ariosto than they are common to all ancient romances in general spensers first book is indeed a regular and precise imitation of such a series of action as we frequently meet with in books of chivalry for instance a kings daughter applies to a knight that he would relieve her father and mother who are closely confined to their castle upon account of a vast and terrible dragon that had ravaged their country and perpetually laid in wait to destroy them the knight sets forward with the lady encounters a monster in the way is plotted against by an enchanter and after surmounting a variety of difficulties and obstacles arrives at the country which is the scene of the dragons devastations kills him and is presented to the king and queen whom he has just delivered marries their daughter but is soon obliged to leave her on account of fulfilling a former vow it may be likewise observed that the circumstance of each of spensers twelve knights setting out from one place by a different way to perform a different adventure exactly resembles that of the seven knights proceeding forwards to their several expeditions in the wellknown romance entitled the seven champions of christendom in fact these miraculous books were highly fashionable and that chivalry which was the subject of them was still practiced in the age of queen elizabeth see hollingsheads chronicles vol iii p        among others there is one romance which spenser seems more particularly to have made use of it is entitled morte arthur the life of king arthur of his noble knights of the round table and in the end the dolorous death of them all this was translated into english from the french by one sir thomas maleory knight and printed by w caxton      this book has been reprinted twice or thrice the last edition is dated       from this fabulous history our author has borrowed many of his names viz sir tristram placidas pelleas pellenore percivall and others as to sir tristram he has copied from this book the circumstances of his birth and education with much exactness spenser informs us that sir tristram was born in cornwall etc and tristram is my name the only heir of good king meliogras which did reign in cornewaile        and afterward  the country wherein i was bred    the which the fertile lioness is hight ibid st  0  which particulars are drawn from the romance abovementioned there was a knight meliodas meliogras and he was lord and king of the country of lyones  and he wedded king marks sister of cornewale the issue of which marriage as we are afterward told was sir tristram book ii chap i  mention is then made in our romance of sir tristrams banishment from lyones into a distant country by the advice and under the conduct of a wise and learned counselor named governale a circumstance alluded to by spenser in these verses so taking counsel of a wise man red she was by him advizd to send me quight out of the country wherein i was bred the which the fertile lioness is hight      0 sir tristrams education is thus described below st    all which my days i have not lewdly spent nor spilt the blossom of my tender years in ydlesse but as was convenient have trained been with many noble feres in gentle thewes and such like semely leres amongst which my most delight has always been to hunt the savage chase among my peers of all that raungeth in the forest green of which none is to me unknown that ever was seen xxxii ne is there hawke that mantleth her on perch whether hightowring or accoasting low but i the measure of her flight do search and all her pray and all her diet know   which is agreeable to what is said in the romance after mention being made of tristrams having learned the language of france courtly behavior and skill in chivalry we have the following passage as he growed in might and strength he labored ever in hunting and hawking so that we never read of no gentleman more that so used himself therein  and he began good measures of blowing of blasts of venery hunting and chase and of all manner of vermeins and all these terms haves we yet of hawking and hunting and therefore the book of venery of hawking and hunting is called the book of sir tristram book ii chap    and in another place king arthur thus addresses sir tristram for of all manner of hunting thou bear the prise and of all measures of blowing thou art the beginner and of all the terms of hunting and hawking ye are the beginner b ii c      from this romance our author also took the hint of his blatant beast which is there called the questing beast therewithal the king saw coming toward him the strangest beast that ever he saw or heard tell off  and the noise was in the beasts belly like unto the questyn of thirty couple of hounds the questing beast is afterward more particularly described that had in shap an head like a serpents head and a body like a liberd buttocks like a lion and footed like a heart and in his body there was such a noise as it had been the noise of thirty couple of hounds questyn and such a noise that beast made wheresoever he went b ii c    spenser has made him a much more monstrous animal than he is here represented to be and in general has varied from this description though there is one circumstance in spensers representation in which there is a resemblance viz  speaking of his mouth and therein were a thousand tongues empight of sundry kinds and sundry qualities some were of dogs that barked night and day and some etc          so dreadfully his hundred tongues did bray         by what has been hitherto said perhaps the reader may not be persuaded that spenser in his blatant beast had the questing beast of our romance in his eye but the poet has himself taken care to inform us of this for we learn from the romance that certain knights of the round table were destined to pursue the questing beast perpetually without success which spenser hints at in these lines albe that long time after calidore the good sir pelleas him took in hand and after him sir lamoracke of yore and all his brethren borne in britain land yet none of these could ever bring him into band      sir lamoracke and sir pelleas are two very valourous champions of arthurs round table  this romance likewise supplied our author with the story of the mantle made of the beards of knights and locks of ladies which last circumstance is added by spenser for may no knight or lady pass along that way and yet they needs must pass that way by reason of the straight and rocks among but they that ladies locks do shave away and that knights berd for toll which they for passage pay        afterward his name is crudor who through high disdain and proud despyght of his selfepleasing mind refused has to yeald her love again until a mantle she for him do find with berds of knights and locks of ladies lynd        thus in morte arthur came a messenger  saying that king ryence had discomfited and overcomen eleaven knights and everiche of them did him homage and that was this they gave him their beards clean flayne of as much as there was wherefore the messenger came for king arthurs berd for king ryence had purfeled a mantell with kings beards and there lacked for one place of the mantell wherefore he sent for his berd or else he would enter into his lands and brenn and sley and never leave till he have thy head and beard b   c    after this passage we have an this is also printed in p enderburys cambria triumphans p     ancient ballad the subject of which is this insolent demand of king ryence drayton in his polyolbion speaks of a coat composed of the beards of kings he is celebrating king arthur as how great rithouts self he slew in his repair and ravished howels niece young helena the fair and for a trophie brought the giants coat away made of the beards of kings  song    but drayton in these lines manifestly alludes to a passage in geoffrey of monmouth who informs us that a spanish giant named ritho having forcibly conveyed away from her guard helena the niece of duke hoel possessed himself of st michaels mount in cornwall from whence he made frequent sallies and committed various outrages that at last king arthur conquered this giant and took from him a certain coat which he had been composing of the beards of kings a vacant place being left for king arthurs beard orig and gest reg brit b  0      as spenser has copied many other fictions from morte arthur i apprehend that he drew this from thence and not from geoffrey of monmouth not to mention that spensers circumstances tally more exactly with those in the romance  there is great reason to conclude not only from what has already been mentioned concerning spensers imitations from this romantic history of king arthur and his knights but from some circumstances which i shall now produce that it was a favorite and reigning romance about the age of queen elizabeth or at least one very well known and much read at that time spenser in the shepherds calendar has the following passage and whither rennes this bevie of ladies bright raunged in a row they been all ladies of the lake behight that unto her go april    upon the words ladies of the lake e k the old commentator on the pastorals has the following remark ladies of the lake be nymphs for it was an old opinion among the ancient heathens that of every spring and fountain was a goddess the sovereign which opinion stuck in the minds of men not many years since by means of certain fine fablers or loose liars such as were the authors of king arthur the great  who tell many an unlawful leesing of the ladies of the lake these fine fablers or loose liars are the authors of the romance abovementioned viz morte arthur where many miracles are brought about and much enchantment is carried on by the means and interposition of the lady of the lake now it should be observed that the lady of the lake was introduced to make part of queen elizabeths entertainment at kenelworth as an evidence of which i shall produce a passage from an ancient book entitled a letter wherein part of the entertainment untoo the queens majesty at killingworthcastl in warwicksheer in this soomers progress      is signified the passage is this her highness all along this tiltyard rode unto the inner gate next the baze coourt of the castle whear the lady of the lake famous in king arthurs book with too nymphs waiting upon her arrayed all in sylkes attended her highness coming from the midst of the pool whear upon a moveable island brightblazing with torches she floting to land met her majesty with a wellpenned meter and matter after this sort first of the auncientee of the castl who had been owners of the same even till this day most allways in the hands of the earls of leycester how she had kept this lake syns king arthurs days and now understanding of her highness hither coming thought it both offis and duty to discover in humble wise her and her estate offering up the same her lake and power thearin with promis of repair to the court it pleased her highness to thank this lady etc  gascoyne works london      in a little narrative called the princely pleasures of kenelworth castle gives us some of the abovementioned meter written by ferrers one of the contributors to the mirror of magistrates of which these may serve as a specimen i am the lady of this pleasant lake who since the time of great king arthurs reign that here with royal court aboade did make have led a lowering life in restless pain till now that this your third arrival here does cause me come abroad and boldly thus appear for after him such storms this castle shook by swarming saxons first who scourgde this land as forth of this my poole i near durst look etc   she is afterward introduced complaining to the queen that sir bruise had insulted her for doing an injury to merlin an incident related in morte arthur and that he would have put her to death had not neptune delivered her by concealing her in that lake from which confinement the queen is afterward supposed to deliver her etc  without expatiating upon the nature of such a royal entertainment as this i shall observe from it that the lady of the lake and consequently the romance which supplied this fiction was a very popular character in the reign of queen elizabeth and we may add that it is not improbable that spenser might allude in the above cited verses to some of the circumstances in this part of the queens entertainment for queen elisabeth the fair elisa is the lady whom the ladies of lake are represented as repairing to in that eclogue spensers pastorals were published about four years after this entertainment  nor is it improbable that this lady was often exhibited upon other occasions nor is it improper to remark in this place that been johnson has introduced her together with king arthur and merlin in an entertainment before the court of james i called prince henrys barriers  the above ancient letter acquaints us that the queen was entertained with a song from this romance which is another proof of it is popularity at that time a minstrall came forth with a sollem song warranted for story out of king arthurs acts the first book    whereof i gat a copy and that is this so it fell out on a pentecost day when king arthur etc   this is the song above hinted at where mention is made of king rience demanding the beard of king arthur in the same letter a gentleman who showed some particular feats of activity before the queen is said to be very cunning in fens and hardy as gawen which gawen was king arthurs nephew and whose achievements are highly celebrated in morte arthur  we find spenser in another place alluding to the fable of the lady of the lake so much spoken of in this romance  a little while before that merlin did he did intend a brazen wall in compass to compyle about cairmardin and did it commend unto these sprights to bring to perfect end during which time the lady of the lake whom long he loved for him in haste did send who therefore forced his workmen to forsake them bound till his return their labor not to slake       x in the mean time through that false ladies train he was surprised and buried under bear ne ever to his work returned again these verses are obscure unless we consider the following relation in morte arthur the lady of the lake and merlin departed and by the way as they went merlin showed to her many wonders and came into cornewaile and always merlin lay about the lady for to have her favor and she was ever passing weary of him and feign would have been delivered of him for she was afraid of him because he was a devils son and she could not put him away by no means and so upon a time it happened that merlin showed to her in a roche rock whereas was a great wonder and wrought by enchauntment which went under a stone so by her subtle craft and working she made merlin to go under that stone to let him wit of the marvailes there but she wrought so there for him that he came never out for all the craft that he could do b i c  0   our author has taken notice of a superstitious tradition which is related at large in this romance  good lucius that first received christianity the sacred pledge of christs evangelie yet true it is that long before that day hither came joseph of arimathie who brought with him the holy grayle they say and preached the truth but since it greatly did decay    0    the holy grayle that is the real blood of our blessed savior what spenser here writes grale is often written sangreal or st grale in morte arthur and is there said to have been brought into england by joseph of arimathea many of king arthurs knights are there represented as going in quest or in search of the sangreal or sanguis realis this expedition was one of the first subjects of the old romance  this romance seems to have extended its reputation beyond the reign of queen elizabeth b johnson besides his allusion to it in the lady of the lake mentioned above hints at it more than once had i compiled from amadis de gaul thesplandians arthurs palmerins etc an execration upon vulcan in the underwood  and afterward in the same poem  the whole sum of errant knighthood with the dames and dwarfes the charmed boats and the enchanted wharfes the tristrams lanclotts etc and camden remains printed   0  artic names refers to this history of king arthur as to a book familiarly known to the readers of his age speaking of the name tristram he observes i know not whether the first of this name was christened by king arthurs fabler again of lancelot he speaks some think it to be no ancient name but forged by the writer of king arthurs history for one of his douty knights and of gawen a name devised by the author of king arthurs table  to this we may add that milton manifestly hints at it in the following lines  damsels met in forests wide by knights of logris or of lyones lancelot pelleas or pellenore par reg b ii v      these are sir lancelot or sir meliot of logris sir tristram of lyones and king pellenore who are often mentioned in morte arthur and represented as meeting beautiful damsels in desolate forests and probably he might have it in his eye when he wrote the following as the round table is expressly hinted at siquando indigenas revocabo in carmina reges arturumque etiam sub terris bella moventem aut dicam invictae sociali faedere mensae magnanimos heroas  mansus  to which we may subjoin  what resounds in fable or romance of uthers son begirt with british and armoric knights parad lost   v        before i leave this romance i must observe that ariosto has been indebted to it i do not mean to the old translation which spenser made use of he has drawn his enchanter merlin from it and in these verses refers to a particular story concerning him quoted above bradamante is supposed to visit the tomb of merlin questa e lantica e memorabil grotta ch edifico merlino il savio mago che forse recordare odi talhotta dove inganollo la donna del lago il sepolcro e qui giu dove corotta di satisfare a lei che gliel suase giace la carne sua dove egli vago vivo corcossi e morto ci rimase c    0  thus translated by harrington here is the tomb that merlin erst did make by force of secret skill and hidden art in which sometimes the lady of the lake that with her beauty had bewitched his heart did force him enter fondly for her sake and he was by a woman overreached that unto others prophesied and preached xii his carkas dead within this stone is bound this description of merlins tomb says harrington in a marginal note is out of the book of king arthur ariosto has transferred the tomb from wales into france he afterward feigns that the prophetical sculpture in malagigis cave was performed by merlins enchantment merlino il savio incantator britanno fe for la font al tempo dil re arturo e di cose chal mondo hanno a venire la fe da buoni artefici scolpire c

them here in arthurs time harrington he also mentions some of the names of the knights of our romance when renaldo comes into great britain the poet celebrates that island for its achievements in chivalry and as having produced many brave knights  tristano lancillotto galasso artu e galuano c   s     afterward in b    tristram makes a great figure from this romance is also borrowed ariostos tale c       of the enchanted cup which in caxtons old translation is as follows by the way they met with a knight that was sent from morgan le faye to king arthur and this knight had a fair horn all garnished with gold and the horn had such a virtue that there might no lady or gentlewoman drink of that horn but if she were true to her husband and if she were false she should spill all the drink and if she were true unto her lord she might drink peaceably etc b   c    afterward many trials are made with this cup the inimitable fontaine has newmoulded this story from ariosto under the title of la coupe enchantee as it is manifest from a comparison of passages that ariosto was very conversant in this romance so i think it may be granted that he drew the idea of his orlando running mad with jealousy from it in morte arthur sir lancelot out of a jealous fit is driven to madness in which state he continues for the space of two years performing a thousand ridiculous pranks no less extravagant than those of orlando and like him at length he recovers his senses  i had forgot to remark before that our author has borrowed the name of materastas castle from that of lancelot in morte arthur  the goodly frame and stately port of castle joyeous        lancelots castle is styled joyous guard or castle  there is another ancient romance for so it may be called though it is written in verse which spenser apparently copies in prince arthurs combat with the dragon it will be necessary to transcribe the whole passage it fortuned as fair it then befell behind his back vnweeting where he stood of ancient time there was a springing well from which fast trickled forth a silver flood full of great virtues and for medicine good whylome before that cursed dragon got that happy land and all with innocent blood defiled those sacred waves it rightly hot the well of life ne yet his virtues had forgot for unto life the dead it could restore and guilt of sinful crimes clean wash away those that with sickness were infected sore it could recure and ages long decay renew as it were borne that very day both silo this and jordan did excel and the english bath and eke the german spau ne can cephise nor hebrus match this well into the same the knight back overthrowen fell now began the golden phoebus for to steep his fiery face in billows of the west and his faint steeds watered in ocean deep whiles from their iournall labors they did rest when that infernal monster having kest his weary foe into that living well began high advaunce his broad discolored breast above his wonted pitch with countenance fell and clapped his iron wings as victor he did dwell which when his pensive lady saw from far great woe and sorrow did her soul assay as weening that the sad end of the war and began to highest god entirely pray that feared chance from her to turn away with folded hands and knees full lowely bent all night she watched ne once adowne would lay her dainty limbs in her sad dreriment but praying still did wake and waking did lament the morrow next began early to appear that titan rose to run his daily race but early ere the morrow next began rear out of the sea fair titans deawy face up rose the gentle virgin from her place and looked all about if she might spy her loved knight to move his manly pase for she had great doubt of his safety since late she saw him fall before his enemy at last she saw where he vpstarted brave out of the well wherein he drenched lay as eagle fresh out of the ocean wave where he has left his plumes all hoary gray and decked himself with feathers youthly gay like eyas hawk up mounts unto the skies his newlybudded pineons to assay and marvailes at himself still as he flies so new this newborn knight to battle new did rise whom when the damned fiend so fresh did spy no wonder if he wondered at the sight and doubted whether his late enemy it were or other new supplied knight he now to prove his late renewed might high brandishing his bright deawburning blade upon his crested scalpe so sore did smite that to the scull a yawning wound it made the deadly dint his dulled senses all dismayed i wot not whether the revenging steel were hardened with that holy water dew wherein he fell or sharper edge did feel or his baptized hands now greater grew or other secret virtue did ensew else never could the force of fleshly arm ne molten metal in his blood embrew for till that stound could never wight him harm by subtlety nor slight nor might nor mighty charm          this miraculous manner of healing our author drew from an old poem entitled sir bevis of southampton viz what for weary and what for faint sir bevis was near attaint the dragon followed on bevis so hard that as he would have fled backward there was a well as i ween and he stumbled right therein then was sir bevis afraid and woe lest the dragon should him sloe or that he might away pass when that he in the well was then was the well of such virtue through the might of christ jesu for sometime dwelled in that land a virgin full of christs sand that had been bathed in that well that ever after as men can tell might no venomous worm come therein by the virtue of that virgin nor nigh it seven foot and more then bevis was glad therefore when he saw the dragon fell had no power to come to the well then was he glad without fail and rested awhile for his avail and drank of the water of his fill and then he leapt out of the well and with morglay his brand assailed the dragon i understand on the dragon he struck so fast etc after which the dragon strikes the knight with such violence that he falls into a swoon and tumbles as it were lifeless into the well by whose sovereign virtue he is revived when bevis was at the ground the water made him whole and sound and quenched all the venim away this well saved bevis that day   and afterward but ever when bevis was hurt sore he went to the well and washed him thore he was as whole as any man and ever as fresh as when he began it may be observed that this poem of sir bevis is written in that short measure which was frequently sung to the harp in queen elizabeths time a custom which descended from the ancient bards the author of the art of english poesy printed      thus speaks of it so on the other side does the overbusie and too speedy return of one manner of tune too much annoy and as it were glut the ear unless it be in small and popular musickes song by these cantabanqui upon benches and barrels heads where they have none other audience than boys or country fellows that pass by them in the street or else by blind harpers or such like taverneminstrels that give a fit of mirth for a groat and their matters being for the most part stories of old time as the tale of sir topas the reports of bevis of southampton guy of warwick adam bell and clymme of the clough and such other old romances or historical rhymes made purposely for recreation of the common people at christmasse diners and brideales and in tavernes and alehouses and such other places of base resort also they be used in carols and rounds and such light or lascivious poemes which are commonly more commodiously uttered by these buffoons and vices in plays than by any other person such were the rimes of skeleton usurping the name of a poet laureate being in deed but a rude railing rimer and all his doings ridiculous he used both short distaunces and short measures pleasing only the popular ear in our courtly maker we banish them utterly b ii c   hence it appears that chaucer was at that time sung to the harp for the tale or rhyme of sir thopas is a poem of chaucer now extant so the italians at present sing tasso and ariosto adam bell and clym of the clough were two famous archers the former of which is on that account alluded to by shakespeare  the same author in another place speaks of this kind of entertainment by which one would think that it was not always confined to such a vulgar audience we ourselves who compiled this treatise have written for pleasure a little brief romance or historical ditty in the english tongue of the isle of greatbritaine in short and long meeters and by breaches or divisions to be more commodiously sung to the harp in places of assembly where the company shall be desirous to hear of old adventures and valiaunces of noble knights in times past as are those of king arthur and his knights of the round table sir bevys of southampton guy of warwick and such other like b i c         the circumstance of the dragon not being able to approach within seven feet of this well is imitated by our author st    below where another water is mentioned which in like manner preserves the knight but nigh thereto the everdamned beast durst not approache for he was mortal made and all that life preserved did detest yet he it often adventured to invade   though we feel somewhat of an illnatured pride and a disingenuous triumph in having detected the latent and obscure source from whence an admired and original author has drawn some favorite and celebrated description yet it must be confessed that this is soon overwhelmed by a generous and exalted pleasure which naturally flows from contemplating the chemical energy of true genius which can produce so wonderful a transmutation and whose virtues are not less potent efficacious and vivifying in their nature than those of the miraculous water here described  it should be mentioned in this place that spenser in his dragonencounters follows the incidents made use of by the romancewriters with all the punctuality of a close copyist  as to spensers original and genealogy of the fairy nation i am induced to believe that part of it was supplied by his own inexhaustible imagination and part by some fabulous history he tells us b ii c  0 s  0 that man as first made by prometheus was called elfe who wandering through the world at last arrived at the gardens of adonis where he found a female whom he called fay that the issue of these two were called fairies who soon grew to be a mighty people and conquered all nations that their eldest son elfin governed america and the next to him named elfinan founded the city of cleopolis which was enclosed with a golden wall by elfiline that his son elfine overcome the gobbelines but that of all fairies elfant was most renowned who built panthea of crystal  to these succeeded elfar who killed two brethrengiants and to him elfinor who built a bridge of glass over the sea the sound of which was like thunder at length elficleos ruled the fairy land with much wisdom and highly increased its honor he left two sons the eldest of which fair elferon died an immature death and whose place was supplied by the mighty oberon whose wide memorial continues our author still remains and who dying left tanaquil to succeed him by will who is likewise called glorian or gloriana  in the circumstance of elfinel who overcame the gobbelines he plainly alludes to the faction of the guelfes and gibbelines in italy and his friend and commentator e k remarks eclogue june that our elfes and goblins were derived from those two parties guelfes and gibelines but in the latter part of this relation under the fictitious names of these ideal beings he has adumbrated some of our english princes elficleos is king henry vii whose eldest son arthur died at sixteen years of age and whose youngest son oberon that is henry viii succeeded to the crown marrying about the same time his brother arthurs widow the princess katherine which is what spenser more particularly hints at in these lines whose empty place the mighty oberon doubly supplied in spousall and dominion st     the same of this king was very recent in our authors age  it is remarkable that spenser says nothing of edward vi and queen mary who reigned between henry viii and queen elizabeth but that he passes immediately from oberon to tanaquill or gloriana i e queen elizabeth who was excluded from her right by those two intermediate reigns he dying left the fairest tanaquill him to succeed there by his last will fairer and nobler lives none this hour st     and the reader may observe that there is much address and art in the poets manner of making this omission there is so much confusion in spensers series of this fairy people that it is difficult to determine whether or no he has here allegorised any other english reign however in elfant who laid the foundation of cleopolis he may signify king lud as it appears by another place that cleopolis is london till now said then the knight i weened well that great cleopolis where i have been in which the fairest faerie queen does dwell   the fairest faerie queen is queen elizabeth and by the lines that immediately follow it should seem that panthea is the queens palace  the fairest city was that might be seen and that bright towr all built of crystal cleene panthea     0     but this idea of the crystal tower and of the golden wall and bridge of glass etc mentioned above seem to be some romantic tradition as to his faerie queen the notion of such a personage was very common chaucer in his rhyme of sir thopas speaks of her together with a fairy land and shakespere who was universally conversant in popular superstition has introduced her in his midsummernights dream she was supposed to have held her court in the highest magnificence in the days of king arthur a circumstance by which the happiness of that reign was originally represented in the romantic annals of it  thus chaucer  in the old dayis of the king arthure of which the britons speken great honor all was this land fulfillid of fayry the elfquene with her jolly company daunsid full often in many a grene mede this was the old opinion as i read the wife of baths tale     the reader is desired to take notice that in numbering any passage from chaucers cant tales we have followed urrys scheme  thus spenser followed the popular tradition in supposing his it appears from john marstons satires entitled the scourge of villainy three books of satyrs and printed in the year      that our authors faerie queen occasioned many publications in which fairies were the principal actors viz go buy some ballad of the faery king in lectores  and in another place  at length some wonted sleep does crown his newfalne lids dreams straight ten pound to one outsteps some faery with quick motion and tells him wonders of some flowrie vale  awakes strait rubs his eyes and prints his tale b   sat    and i have seen a romance which seems to have been written soon after spensers poem entitled the redrose knight where the knight after the example of prince arthur goes in search of the fairy queen  the satires abovementioned contain many welldrawn characters and several good strokes of a satirical genius but are not upon the whole so finished and classical as bishop halls the first part of which were published about a year before these among other passages the following struck me as being a good deal in the strain of the beginning of miltons lallegro sleep grim reproof my jocond muse does sing in other keys to nimble fingering dull sprighted melancholy leave my brain to hell cimmerian night in lively vain i strive to paint then hence all dark intent and sullen frowns come sporting merriment cheekedimpling laughter etc b   sat  0  from these satires we may learn also how popular a play romeo and juliet was in those days  he is speaking to a wit of the town luscus what is played to day  faith now i know i set thy lips abroach from whence does flow naught but pure juliet and romeo ibid  langbaine dram poets page     informs us that these satires now forgotten rendered marston more eminent than his dramatic poetry two years after these viz   00 another collection of satires appeared written by w rowlands which are by no means contemptible these are entitled the letting of humors blood in the headvaine so that bishop hall was not without some followers in the species of poetry which he had newly revived   faerie queen to exist in the age of arthur in chaucer we find that fairy land and fairies were used in a more general sense for an ideal place and people thus in the merchants tale pluto that is king of fayrie   and above proserpine and all her fayrie   this fiction of the fairies was undoubtedly brought with many other fantastic extravagancies of the like nature from the eastern nations by the european christians who had been at the holy war and those expeditions were some of the first subjects of romance as an admirable judge of this matter observes who farther informs us nor were the monstrous embellishments of enchantments etc the invention of the romancers but formed upon eastern tales brought thence by travelers from their crusades and pilgrimages which indeed have a cast peculiar to the wild imagination of the eastern people supplement to the translators preface before jarviss don quixote   the persians call the fairies peri and the arabs ginn and they feign that there is a certain country inhabited by them called ginnistian which corresponds to our fairyland our old romantic history supposes that arthur still reigns in fairyland from whence he will one day return to britain and reestablish the round table etc thus lydgate he is a king ycrounid in fairie with scepter and sword and with his regally shall resort as lord and sovereign out of fairie and reign in britain and repair again the old round table by prophecy merlin set the date etc fall of princes b   chapter       many other instances might be alleged from which it would be more abundantly manifested that the imagination of our author was deeply tinctured with that species of writing with which his age was so intimately acquainted and so generally delighted but we have perhaps been already sufficiently prolix in a disquisition which to the lovers of spenser cannot appear altogether unentertaining a disquisition affording that kind of information which though it does not improve the judgment will gratify the curiosity and if there should be any readers who disgusted with the ideas of knights dragons and enchanters should after perusing the faerie queen address the author of it as cardinal deste did ariosto after reading his orlando  dove diavolo messer lodovico avete pigliate tante coglionerie where the devil and did you pick up all these lies i beg those gentlemen will look upon this section as a sufficient answer to that question  sect iii of spensers use and abuse of ancient history and mythology as spenser sought to produce surprise by extravagant incidents and fantastic descriptions the mythology of the ancients afforded matter no less copious than suitable for such a design he has accordingly adopted some of their most romantic fictions in many of which he has departed from the received tradition as his purpose and subject required and indeed with regard to our authors misrepresentation of the fables of antiquity it may be observed that from those arguments which are produced against his fidelity new ones may be drawn in favor of his fancy spensers native force of invention would not permit him to pursue the letter of prescribed fiction with tame regularity and scrupulous exactness in many particulars he varies from antiquity merely that he may introduce new beauties and frequently mentions one or two circumstances of ancient fable not so much with a design of adorning his poem with them as of taking an opportunity from them of raising a new fiction of his own he sometimes indeed misrepresents these matters through haste his allusions to ancient history are likewise very frequent which in many instances he has not scrupled to violate with equal freedom and for the same reasons b i c i s xxxvii a bold bad man that dared to call by name great gorgon    mr jortin has cited many instances by which it appears that the ancients were most superstitiously fearful of uttering the name of gorgon or daemogorgon it may not be impertinent to remark that they were no less afraid of calling the furies by their names  electra in euripides says of the furies that tormented her brother    orestes v      vereor enim nominare deas eumenidas quae eum certatim perterrent and in another scene orestes says  visus surn mihi videre tres puellas nocti similes whom menelaus answers  ibid v   0  novi quas dixisti nominare autem nolo   below we have the same superstition concerning hecate for which it would be difficult perhaps to bring any ancient testimony and threatened unto him the dreaded name of hecate  st    either that her name was feared in general or that morpheus was particularly afraid of uttering or of hearing it our author with great strength of fancy has feigned such a circumstance as this of merlin the fiends do quake when any him to them does name        though perhaps this is not more expressive of merlins diabolical power than what olaus magnus mentions of that of a swedish enchanter viz that he could blunt the edge of the weapons of his enemies only by looking at them and that he could make hell a light place b i c iv s  0 he is describing envy  still did chaw between his cankred teeth a venomous toad that all the poison ran about his jaw   ovid met ii v   0 tells us that envy was found eating the flesh of vipers which is not much unlike spensers picture but our author has heightened this circumstance to a most disgusting degree for he adds that the poison ran about her jaw this is perhaps one of the most loathsome ideas that spenser has given us though he paints very strongly as jortin observes b i i  0  she spewd out of her filthy maw a flood of poison horrible and black full of great lumps of flesh and gobbets raw which stunk so vilely that it forced him slack his grasping hold  as also in the discovery of duessa           he is also very indelicate where he speaks of serenas wounds for now her wounds corruption gan to breed        see also        and      0 in reality the strength of our authors imagination could not be suppressed or kept in on any subject and in some measure it is owing to the fullness of his stanza and the frequency of his rhymes that he has described these disagreeable objects so minutely but to return to his envy this personage is again introduced         chawing a snake of which circumstance a most beautiful use is there made st    then from her mouth the gobbet she does take the which whyleare she was so greedily devouring even that halfgnawen snake and at him throws it most despitefully the cursed serpent though she hungrily erst chawd thereon yet was not all so dead but that some life remained secretly and as he past before withouten dread bit him behind that long the mark was to be read   it may be urged that spenser drew the thought of her throwing the snake at him from alectos attack upon amata huic dea caeruleis unum de crinibus anguem conjicit inque sinus praecordia ad intima condit aen viiv       but spensers application of this thought is surely a much greater effort of invention than the thought itself the malignity both of envy and of her snake could not have been expressed is more significant strokes though the snake was her constant food yet she was tempted to deprive herself of sustenance that she might cast it at him and though the snake by being thus constantly fed upon was almost dead yet it is natural malignity enabled it to bite him violently b i c v s xxxix  his rash sire began to rend his hair and hasty tongue that did offend   theseus did not rend his tongue upon this occasion mr jortin would excuse our author for his false representation of this matter by supposing an elleipsis viz he began to rend his hair and to blame or curse his tongue though spenser is full of elleipses yet he seldom has been guilty of such a one as this i should therefore think this passage ought not to be referred to spensers elleipses but to that fault which he so frequently commits the falication of ancient story besides the words that did offend joined to hasty tongue seem to be given by the poet as an express reason why he rent it b i c vi s xiv sylvanus is here introduced  his weak steps governing and aged limbs on cypress stadle stout   i do not remember that sylvanus is any where described as infirm with old age neither did he use a cypresstree for the purpose here mentioned which was a young plant torn up by the roots and carried in his hand virgil addresses him  teneram ab radice ferens sylvane cupressum georg iv 0  b i c vii s xvii  that renowned snake which great alcides in stremona slew longfostred in the filth of lerna lake   hercules slew the hydra in the lake of lerna between mycenae and argos stremona is no where to be met with which probably he put for strymon a river of macedonia in the confines of thrace but to read strymon here would no more help out the sense than it would the measure b ii c iv s xli  son of erebus and night spenser is just to mythology in representing erebus and night as married in another place this address is made to night  black erebus thy husband is         in these lines of milton hence loathed melancholy of cerberus and blackest midnight born mr upton would read erebus for cerberus the alteration is indeed ingenious and to his defense of it he might have added that milton in one of his juvenile latin poems has shown his knowledge of this mythological point viz nox senis amplexus erebi taciturna petivit   after all it is not improbable but that milton might write cerberus full of the idea of the loathsomness of melancholy he seems to have chosen out the most detestable parents for her that his imagination could suggest cerberus and midnight and it should be observed that he does not say midnight simply but blackest midnight an epithet by which he strongly marks out his abhorrence of the offspring of so foul a pair and the consistency and propriety of her being leagued with cerberus  our author is likewise true to mythology in what he says of night in the following verses o thou most ancient grandmother of old more old than jove whom thou at first did breed        thus orpheus in his hymn to night    noctem deorum genitricem cantabo atque hominum nox genetrix omnium  he afterward says of her which wast begot in daemogorgons hall that is in chaos who is the parent of night according to hesiod  theog      a chao autem erebus atraque nox gignebantur spenser makes night the mother of falsehood which is agreeable to hesiod  though i the mother be of falsehood  s    below   ibid      nox perniciosa post illam fraudem peperit   spenser gives night a chariot for which he has the authority of many ancient poets theocritus    aen        virgil jam bigis subvecta polum nox atra tenebat  b    apollonius mentions the horses of night   idyll        as does tibullus ludite jam nox jungit equos         i have often thought that what spenser says of the horses of night tempted milton to go farther and give them names  thus spenser and coleblack steeds yborne of hellish brood that on their rustie bits did champ as they were wood      0 and afterward her twyfold teme of which two black as pitch and two were brown yet each to each unlich        miltons lines are these nox senis amplexus erebi taciturna reliquit praecipitesque impellit equos stimulante flagello captum oculis typhlonta melanchaetemque ferocem atque acherontaeo prognatam patre siopem torpidam and hirsutis horrentem phrica capillis in quintum novembris v      though at the same time it is probable that he thought of the horses of the sun which are named in ovid milton in the same poem had an eye to another passage in our author who having described the personages that sat by the highway leading to hell adds this fine image and over them sad horror with grim hew did always sore beating his iron wings        milton after describing some of the same personages adds  exanguisque locum circumvolat horror ibid v       among these personages miltons description of phonos or murder whom he couples with prodotes or treason is remarkably beautiful ipsi etiam pavidi latitant penetralibus antri et phonos and prodotes nulloque sequente per antrum antrum horrent scopulosum atrum feralibus umbris diffugiunt sontes and retro lumina vertunt but i think is equaled by fletchers figure of phonos in his forgotten poem called the purple island last of this rout the savage phonos went whom his dire mother nursed with human blood and when more age and strength more fierceness lent she taught him in a dark and desert wood with force and guile poor passengers to slay and on their flesh his barking stomach stay and with their wretched blood his fiery thirst allay ten thousand furies on his steps awaited some seared his hardened soul with stygian brand some with black terrors his faint conscience baited that wide he stard and starched hair did stand the firstborn man still in his mind he bore foully arrayed in guiltless brothers gore which for revenge to heaven from earth did loudly roar cant   st          it is observable that this little poem of milton as containing a council conspiracy and attempt of satan may looked upon as an early prelusion of his genius to the subject of the paradise lost b ii c vii s    the garden of proserpina this hight and in the midst thereof a silver seat with a thick arbor etc next thereunto did grow a goodly tree   on this tree he adds grew golden apples and that from this likewise sprung the tree of the hesperides but these circumstances as also that of proserpinas garden etc is i think not to be justified from ancient writers he afterward informs us that the golden apples by which acontius won cydippe and that which ate threw among the gods were gathered from this tree but these as we learn from many passages in the classics were the produce of the hesperian tree abovementioned he then tells us that the branches of this tree overspread the river cocytus in which tantalus was plunged up to the chin who was perpetually catching at its fruit in which he copies homer in some measure who acquaints us that many trees of delicious fruit waved over the lake in which tantalus was placed but it does not appear from him that tantalus was fixed in cocytus but in some lake peculiarly appropriated to his punishment     spenser has also made another use of cocytus viz that the shores of cocytus perpetually resounded with the shrieks of damned ghosts who underwent an everlasting punishment by being dipped in its waters cocytus indeed says ancient fable must be past before there is any possibility of arriving at the infernal regions but we do not find that it was a punishment allotted to any of the ghosts to be thus plunged into its waves nor that this circumstance was the cause of the cries which echoed around its banks  what he has invented of cocytus exhibits a fine image he supposes that when sir guyon came to this river  he clomb up to the bank and looking down saw many damned wights in those sad waves which direful deadly stanke plonged continually of cruel sprights that with their pittious cries and yelling shrights they made the further shore resounden wide st     the ancients tell us that the golden apple for which the goddesses strove on mount ida was plucked in the garden of the hesperides but spensers allegorising imagination feigns that it grew in hell he might probably receive the hint of this tree with the golden apples from homers mention of various trees which grew in hell near the lake of tantalus hinted at above but the silver stool beneath it is entirely his own which mammon persuades the knight to seat himself upon and is a new circumstance of temptation  thou fearful fool why take not of that same fruit of gold ne sit down on that same silver stool to rest thy weary person in the shadow cool st    after all as the mythology of the pagans was their religion the violation of it is hardly excusable b ii c xii s xlvii they in that place him genius do call not that celestial power to whom the care of life and generation over all that lives pertaines in charge particular who wondrous things concerning our welfare and strange phantomes does let us often foresee xlviii therefore a god him sage antiquity did wisely make and good agdistes call but this same was to that quite contrary the foe of life that good envies to all that secretly does us procure to fall through guilefull semblaunts which he makes us see   these lines may be farther illustrated from the following passage in natalis comes  dictus est autem genius ut placuit latinis a gignendo vel quia nobiscum gignatur vel quia illi procreandorum cura divinitus commissa putaretur hic creditur nobis clam nunc suadens nunc dissuadens universam vitam nostram

errores incurrat necesse est si spectra fuerint praecipue a malignis daemonibus oblata      that the first genius here mentioned was likewise called agdistes we learn from the same author quem postea agdistem appellarunt ibid   the ceremony of offering flowers and wine to the genius expressed in these lines with diverse flowers he daintily was decked and strowed round about and by his side a

ingredientibus quid eis ubi in vitam venerint faciendum sit the third book of the faerie queen containing the legend of britomartis or of chastity  britomartis among the cretans was another name for diana the goddess of chastity and in this book spensers britomartis is represented as the patroness of chastity it is not improbable as our author has copied the greatest part of the second canto of this book from the ceiris of virgil that he learned from the same poem that britomartis was a name for diana viz dictynnam dixere tuo de nomine lunam v  0  she was a cretan nymph and the daughter of jupiter and charm whom virgil has introduced in his ceiris as the nurse of scylla and from whom our author has copied his glauce britomarts nurse in the canto mentioned above she was called dictynna because she invented nets for hunting which being also one of dianas names britomartis and diana were looked upon as the same callimachus speaks of her as one of the nymphs of dianas train but observes that she was called by the cydonians dictynna he has left us the history of britomartis in his hymn to diana               v      praecipue autem inter alias omnes gortynida amasti nympham cervarum venatricem britomartin jaculatricem cujus olim minos amore perculsus pervagatus est montes cretae illa vero alias quidem hirtis sub quercubus latitabat nympha alias autem in locis uliginosis at ipse novem menses percurrebat loca praerupta and pendentes scopulos nec intermisit insectationem donec apprebensa ferme nympha insiliit mare ab alto vertice insiliit autem in piscatorum retia quae ipsam conservarunt hinc deinceps cydones nympham ipsam dictynnam montem vero unde desiliit nympha dictaeum appellitant excitatisque ibi sacris sacra etiam faciunt    upon the word  says the scholiast  and solinus speaks to the same effect cretes dianam religiosissime venerantur  gentiliter nominantes quod sermon nostro sonat virginem dulcem polstyhi c    but though spenser in britomartis had some reference to diana yet at the same time he intended to denote by that name the martial britonesse  the reader is desired to take notice that the passage which spenser has copied from the ceiris of virgil begins at this verse of that poem quam simul ogygii phoenicis filia charm ver      and ends at despue ter virgo numero deus impare gaudet ver      b iii c vi s  0 speaking of the garden of adonis in that same garden all the goodly flowers wherewith dame nature does her beautify are fetched there is the first seminary of all things that are born to live and die   in his description of this garden he might probably have an eye to the notion of the ancients concerning adonis that he represented the sun which quickens the growth of all things thus orpheus in his hymn to adonis    others represent him as the seed of wheat thus the scholiast of theocritus after having informed us that adonis after his death remained six months in the embraces of venus and six months with proserpine   apud idyll   v    hoc re vera ita se habet scilicet quod adonis frumentum est satium quod sex menses sub terra degit and sex menses eum habet venus nimirum aeris temperies and postea a messoribus colligitur orpheus in the same hymn calls the body of adonis   corpus frugiferum   he has placed cupid and psyche in this garden where they live together in  steadfast love and happy state st  0 but apuleius represents this happy state of cupid and psyche to have commenced after their reception into heaven however their offspring pleasure is agreeable to what apuleius relates sic ecce psyche venit in manum cupidinis and nascitur illis maturo partu filia quam voluptatem nominamus metam b   he has made pleasure the daughter of cupid in another place speaking to love there with thy daughter pleasure they do play their hurtlesse sports  hymn of love    b iii c xi s xlviiof the statue of cupid  wings it had with sundry colors bright more sundry colors than the proud pavone bears in his boasted fan or iris bright when her discolored bow she spreads through heaven bright   cupid was represented by the ancients with part colored wings as we learn among others from this passage quoted by mr jortin from an epigram ascribed to virgil marmoreusque tibi diversicoloribus alis in morem picta stabit amor pharetra but this picturesque circumstance was probably supplied by our authors fancy in the pastorals march he draws cupid after the same manner with that sprung forth a naked swain with spotted wings like peacockes train thus also of love in the next canto st    and clapped on hie his colored wings twain in the comparison of the peacock and the rainbow as they occur together he probably imitated tasso nel superbo pavon si vago in monstra spiega la pompa de locchiute piume ne l iride si bella indora e inostra il curvo grembo e rugiadoso al lume gier lib b    s     the jolly peacock speads not half so fair the eyed feathers of his pompous train nor so bends golden iris in the air her twenty colored bow through clouds of rain fairfax spensers proud pavone is literally tassos superbo pavon he has again joined these two comparisons speaking of a butterflys wings not half so many sundry colors arre in iris bow  nor junos bird in her eyespotted train so many goodly colors does contain muipotmos  where eyespotted train is plainly the occhiute piume of the italian poet  chaucer in one of his figures of cupid supposes that his wings were adorned with rich plumage  and angelike his wingis saw i sprede leg of g wom v     b iii c xii s vii and every wood and every valley wide he filled with hylas name the nymphs eke hylas cride most of the ancient writers who relate the story of hylas mention the circumstance of hylass name being often reechod by the hills etc when it was so loudly and frequently called upon by hercules but i do not recollect that any of them speak of the nymphs as repeating his name with regard to the former particular antonius has given us an explication of it not generally known from the  of nicander hercules says he having made the hills and forests tremble by calling so mightily on the name hylas the nymphs who had snatched him away fearing lest the enraged lover should at last discover hylas in their fountain transformed him into echo which answered hylas to every call of hercules this solution throws a new light on the circumstance of hylass name being so often echoed back and which is particularly insisted on by virgil eclog   v    by propertius in his elegy de raptu hylae    0 and by valerius flaccus b   v     on account of the many invocations of his name said to be made by hercules and of its being so often reecchod i suppose a custom mentioned by solinus was every year celebrated on the banks of the lake hylas in cujus hylae memoriam usque adhuc solenni cursitatione lacum populus circuit and hylam voce clamat polyhist cap    the distress of hercules after he had lost hylas is finely described by valerius flaccus       and seq and the manner by which hylas is decoyed to the fountain is a pretty poetical fiction v     upon the whole i am induced to think that apollonius has much more beautifully described this story than theocritus it is remarkable that scaliger who in general prefers flaccus to his original apollonius should thus express himself of the comparison concerning the anguish felt by hercules on the occasion of losing hylas which occurs in both poets after quoting the latin of flaccus haec quidem sonora magis plus tamen arrident graeca poet b   c   b iv c x s xlvii the poet is addressing venus great god of men and women    mr jortin observes that venus is called god in virgil descendo ac ducente deo flammam inter and hosts expedior  aen   v      where servius deo secundum eos qui dicunt utriusque sexus participationem habere numina nam ait calvus pollentemque deum venerem  to this it may be added that the poet prepares the reader for the appellation god applied to venus st    above in his description of the statue of that goddess but for they say she has both kinds in one both male and female both under one name she sire and mother is herself alone begets and eke conceives ne needs other none he has also followed the same notion in colin clouts come home again for venus self does solely couples seem both male and female through commixture joined b v c i s xii but when she parted thence she left her groom an iron man which did on her attend always to execute her steadfast doom and willed him with arthegall to wend and do whatever things he did intend his name was talus made of iron mould immovable resistless without end who in his hand an iron flail did hold with which he thresht out falsehood and did truth unfold   the character of executing justice here attributed to talus is exactly agreeable to that which he bears in ancient story nor has spenser greatly varied from antiquity in the make of this wonderful man for he is there said to be formed of brass and by our author of iron plato gives the following account of him   in minoe plat op edit serran page   0 vol   utebatur autem minos hoc legum suarum custode apud urbem in caeteris vero cretae partibus talo et profecto talus ter in anno vicos circuibat legibus tuendis intentus in illis quas habebat in aeneis tabulis inscriptas unde nuncupatus est talus as to the circumstance of taluss traversing the isle of crete it exactly corresponds with what spenser says afterward of his iron man who did the same in ierne and that same iron man which could reveal all hidden crimes through all that realm he sent to search out those that used to rob and steal or did rebel against lawful government          plato has told us that talus was called brazen on account of his carrying the laws about with him written in brazen tables but apollonius informs us that he was actually made of brass and invulnerable      b   v       sed is cum caetero corpore and membris esset aeneus and invulnerabilis tamen sub tenonte habebat in malleolo turgentem sanguine venam quam tenuis continebat tunicula and vitae praestabat mortisque confinium apollonius likewise takes notice of his circuiting crete three times a year  ibid v       ter in anno cretam aeneis obeuntem pedibus   apollodorus will further illustrate this matter  bibliothec b   c    exinde

talus is likewise referred to by our author his iron page who him pursewd so light as that it seemed above the ground he went for he was swift as swallow in her flight      0 and is alluded to by catullus in his ode to camerius where he tells him that he should not be able to pursue him non custos si ego fingar ille cretum car     orpheus or rather who lived in the time of the pisistratic

in hand she threw her husbands murdered infant out ovid reports met   that ino threw herself with her son melicerta from the top of a rock into the sea others say that she murdered melicerta and after that leapt into the sea it is difficult to fix upon spensers precise meaning in these verses ibid or as that madding mother amongst the rout of bacchus priests her own dear flesh did tear the madding mother is agave her son pentheus being of a very temperate disposition and consequently averse to the rites of bacchus she together with the rest of the maenades tore him in pieces in the midst of the bacchanalia mr upton instead of  her own dear flesh did tear would read her sons dear flesh but surely the poet and that with no great impropriety of expression might mean her sons flesh by her own flesh b v c x s x orthrus begotten by great typhaon and foul echidna  who guarded the purple oxen of geryon i wonder that spenser should in this place omit the mention of a sevenheaded dragon who together with orthrus was placed to guard these oxen and was likewise the offspring of typhaon and echidna  b iv c xi s xiiihe is giving a catalogue of the sea gods among the rest is astraeus  that

filled how can they all in this so narrow verse contained be etc   natalis comes having finished his catalogue of these divinities adds ut alios infinitos prope praetermittam nam plures quam octoginta me legisse memini spenser probably took his catalogue from this mythologist i think he has given us no names albion excepted but what are found in that author and besides the account of astraeus abovementioned we find spensers euphemus copied from him and fair euphemus that upon them goth as on the ground without dismay or dread s    n comes  euphemus  cui munus dedit ut super undis tanquam

prophetical power of nereus mr jortin has produced ancient testimonies this last part of his character may be illustrated from these lines in orpheus    quinquaginta puellis laetate in fluctibus elegantibus choris nereu b vi c x s    speaking of the graces they are the daughters of skyruling jove by him begot of fair eurynome milton in his lallegro represents the graces as the offspring of venus and bacchus this mythology as an ingenious critic on that passage observes without doubt suits the nature of miltons subject better but i can hardly think that such a liberty is allowable upon any occasion the mention of eurynome in this stanza of our author puts me in mind of another passage in milton where this goddess is likewise mentioned and fabled how the serpent whom they called ophion with eurynome the wide encroaching eve perhaps had first the rule of high olympus etc par l b  0 v   0  which as the learned dr newton and others observe is copied from these verses of apollonius    b   v      what i have to observe here is that apollonius as well as milton has hinted that ophion was of the serpentrace which will appear from considering what goes before these lines spenser alludes to this song of orpheus and the occasion upon which it was sung more than once such one was orpheus that when strife was grown amongst those famous impes of greece did take his silver harp in hand and shortly friends them make       and in sonnet    when those renowned noble peers of greece through stubborn pride among themselves did jar forgetful of the famous golden fleece then orpheus with his harp their strife did bar   scaliger finds great fault with the subject of this song and prefers to it the subject of orpheuss song in valerius flaccus long enim aptius orpheus canit apud flaccum minyas and phryxum and athamantem quam apud apollonium terrae caelique creationem quid enim viris militaribus cum philosophorum umbris poet b   c   but by this piece of criticism scaliger has greatly betrayed his ignorance of the nature of ancient poesy and of the character of orpheus in the early ages of the grecian state says the admirable author of the enquiry into the life and writings of homer the wild and barbarous inhabitants wanted the assistance of the muses to soften and tame them they stood in need of being impressed with an awe of superior and irresistible powers and a liking to social life they wanted a mythology to lead them by fear and dread the only holds to be taken of a rude multitude into a feeling of natural causes and their influence upon our lives and actions the wise and good among the ancients saw this necessity and supplied it the oldest of the inspired train were the  pii vates and phaebo digna locuti they had religion for their theme and the service of mankind for their song sect   and in another place the same author acquaints us that all the poems of orpheus were philosophical prophetical and religious sect   thus the conduct of apollonius was highly consistent in attributing a song to orpheus whose subject was philosophy and religion and it was for the same reason that onomacritus in his argonautics v     many years before apollonius represented orpheus singing the origin of the gods and the creation of things in his contest with chiron  but the propriety of the subject of this song is easily to be defended without considering the character of orpheus the occasion of this song was a quarrel among the argonauts whom orpheus endeavors to pacify with the united powers of music and verse upon which account says the scholiast  to this it may be added that a song whose subject is likewise religious and which asserts the right of jupiter to the possession of olympus was even expedient as one of the chiefs had but just before spoken blasphemy against him    etc  v     testor nunc penetrabilem hastam quicum lemniscatam e bellis palmam reporto non enim jovi rescripsero victorias justius quam hastae meae etc nor were the auditors of this song of so mean a rank as scaliger would represent them he terms them viri militares but it should be considered that they were princes and demigods  but whether the subject of orpheuss song in apollonius be good or bad there is one circumstance belonging to it which gives it a manifest superiority to that of orpheus in valerius flaccus i mean the design of it which was to repress the vehemence of the passions at once so agreeable to the wellknown character of orpheus and so expressive of the irresistible influence of music in the latin poet orpheus sings upon no occasion and to no end unless it be to make the night pass away more pleasantly thracius hic noctem dulci testudine vates extrahit    i cannot close this note without remarking that milton in these lines had a reference both to apollonius and onomacritus in their respective songs of orpheus tunc de more sedens festa ad convivia vates aesculea intonsos redimitus ab arbore crines heroumque actus imitandaque gesta canebat et chaos and positi late fundamina mundi reptantesque deos and alentes numina glandes et nondum aetneo quaesitum fulmen ab antro denique quid vocis modulamen inane juvabit verborum sensusque vacans numerique loquacis silvestres decet iste choros non orphea cantus qui tenuit fluvios and quercubus addidit aures carmine non cithara  ad patrem v     silius italicus b    v     alludes to the contest of chiron with orpheus as related by onomacritus and it is remarkable that in describing the miraculous power of the music of orpheus he has plainly translated from the greek poet particularly in this circumstance   v     avesque circumdederunt stabula centauri pennis defessis suique oblitae erant nidi the verses of sil italicus are these inmemor and dulcis nidi positoque volatu non mota volucris captiva pependit in aethra   the latin poet has however omitted to describe the manner in which chiron was affected at seeing the wonderful effect of orpheuss music on the trees mountains rivers beasts etc his astonishment on that occasion is thus beautifully painted by the greek poet   v     sed videns haec centaurus obstupuit manum super volam valde feriens terramque pulsavit unguibus    orpheus begins his song with the creation of things after mentioning the sun and moon mountains and rivers he speaks of the creation of serpents   ibid  0   quemadmodum exorti sint montes and resonantes fluvii cum ipsis nymphis and quomodo omnia reptilia concreverint and in the next line from these epiteta or serpents he passes on to ophion  etc thus here is a close connection and an easy transition in the context of apollonius which does not appear at first sight  as an instance of an imitation of milton from apollonius has been just produced i hope the reader will excuse my taking this opportunity of producing another the english poet thus describes adams hair  hyacinthin locks round from his parted forelock manly hung clustring  p l    0     the circumstance of the hair hanging like bunches of grapes has been justly admired but it is literally translated from this description of apollos hair in the greek poet     b   v       aurei ab utraque gena cincinni racemantes assultabant eunti the word  could hardly be rendered into english by any other word than by clustring  b vii c vi s iiispenser here makes hecate the daughter of the titans authors differ concerning the parents of hecate orpheus calls her    v      tartari filia hecate the titans were indeed thrown into tartarus but it could not be said from thence that the titans were her parents though this i presume was the best argument that our author had for his genealogy in this stanza bellona is likewise feigned to be the offspring of the titans but bellona was the sister of mars who was the son of jupiter and juno or as ovid reports of juno alone  a classical reader of the faerie queen may discover many other examples which properly belong to this section but those which are here omitted he may find see remarks on spensers poems collected with equal learning and sagacity by one whose excellent writings as a critic are only surpassed by those in which he has distinguished himself as a christian  sect iv of spensers stanza versification and language although spensers favorite chaucer had made use of the ottave rhyme chaucers stanza is not strictly so or stanza of eight lines yet it is most probable that our author was induced to make choice of it with the addition of one line from the example of tasso and ariosto who were the most fashionable poets of his age but spenser in making this choice of his stanza seems not sufficiently to have considered the genius of the english language which will not easily admit of that more frequent repetition of the same termination which this stanza requires a circumstance not difficult in the italian which deals largely in identical cadences i am obliged to the admirable author of the rambler for this observation this constraint led our author into many absurdities for example i it necessitated him to dilate the thing to be expressed however unimportant with trifling and insipid circumlocutions viz now has fair phaebe with her silver face thrice seen the shadows of the nether world since last i left that honorable place in which her royal presence is enrolled        that is it is three months since i left her palace ii it obliged him when matter failed him toward the close of his stanza to run into a ridiculous redundancy and repetition of words viz in which was nothing pourtrahed nor wrought nor wrought nor pourtrahed but easy to be thought        iii it forced him in order to make out his complement of rhymes to introduce a puerile or impertinent idea viz not that proud tower of troy though richly gilt        in this line being laid under a necessity of producing somewhat consonant to spilt and built which went before he has given us an image at once little and improper and to the difficulty of his stanza i think we may impute the great number of his ellipses some of which will be pointed out in another place   notwithstanding these absurdities flow from spensers stanza yet it must be owned that some advantages arise from it and we may venture to affirm that the fullness and significancy of spensers descriptions is often owing to the prolixity of his stanza and the multitude of his rhymes the discerning reader is desired to consider the following stanza as an instance of what is here advanced guyon is binding furor with hundred iron chains he did him bind and hundred knots which did him sore constrain yet his great iron teeth he still did grind and grimly gnash threatening revenge in vain his burning eyes whom bloody strakes did stain stared full wide and threw forth sparks of fire and more for rank despite than for great pain shakt his long locks colored like copper wire and bit his tawny beard to show his raging ire        in this stanza there are some images which are perhaps the consequence of a multiplicity of rhymes he all that night that too long night did pass and now the day out of the oceanmaine began to peep above this earthly mass with pearly dew sprinkling the morning grass then up he rose like heavy lump of lead that in his face as in a looking glass the signs of anguish one might plainly read         dryden i think somewhere remarks that rhyme often helped him to a thought an observation which probably spensers experience had likewise supplied him with spenser however must have found more convenience in this respect from writing in rhyme than dryden in proportion as the stanza of the former obliged him to a more repeated use of it  in speaking of spensers rhyme it ought to be remarked that he often newspells a word to make it rhyme more precisely take these specimens and of her own foul entrails makes her meat meat fit for such a monsters monsterous dieat         timely to joy and carry comely cheer for though this clowd have now me overcast yet do i not of better times despeare        though when the term is full accomplishid then shall a spark of fire which has long while been in his ashes raked up and hid

meet with ycled for yclad darre for dare prejudize for prejudice sam for same lam for lamb denay for deny pervart for pervert hear for hair and numberless other instances of the orthography being destroyed for the rhymesake this was a liberty which chaucer gower and lydgate frequently made use of and it may not be improper in this place to exhibit the sentiments of a the author of the art of english poesy critic in q elizabeths age upon it now there cannot be in a maker a fowler fault than to falsify his accent to serve his cadence or by untrue orthography to wrench his words to help his rhyme for it is a sign that such a maker is not copious is his own language  however he seems afterward to allow the deviation from true spelling in some measure it is somewhat more tolerable to help the rhyme by false orthographie than to leave an unpleasant dissonance to the ear by keeping true orthographie and losing the rhyme as for example it is better to rhyme door with restore than in his true orthographie which is door  such men were in effect the most part of all your old rimers and specially gower who to make up his rhyme would for the most part write his terminant syllable with false orthographie and many times not stick to put in a plain french word for an english and so by your leave do many of our common rymers at this day b   c   we find in many passages of our author the orthography violated when the rhyme without such an expedient would be very exact thus bite when made to rhyme with delight is sometimes spelt bight as if the eye could be satisfied in this case as well as the ear instances of this sort occur often in harringtons ariosto and more particularly of the word said which is often occasionally written sed this practice was continued as far down as the age of milton besides what the grim wolf with privy paw daily devours apace and nothing sed said is thus printed sed in the edition of      that it might appear to rhyme with greater propriety to the preceding spread later editors not knowing the fashion of writing said upon some occasions sed altered it to fed which utterly destroyed the sense the same spelling is met with again in the same edition and for the same reason in lallegro she was pincht and pulled she sed and he by friars lantern led   hughes not considering our authors custom of misspelling a word for the convenience of rhyme makes him frequently guilty of some very bad rhymes for that editor among other examples of his correctness has reduced spensers text to modern orthography with great accuracy  it is indeed surprising upon the whole that our author should have been able to execute a poem of such a length as the faerie queen with so much spirit laden with so many shackles and oppressed with so grievous a bondage of riming i do not remember that he has been so inaccurate as to make the same word rhyme to itself in more than four or five instances a fault which if he had committed very frequently his many beauties of versification would have obliged us to overlook and which harrington should more frequently have avoided to compensate in some measure for the tameness and prosaic mediocrity of his numbers  notwithstanding our authors affectation the author of the art of english poesy seems to have censured this practice of spencer our maker therefore at these days shall not follow piers plowman nor gower nor lydgate nor yet chaucer for their language is now out of use with us b   c   the faerie queen was not published when this critic wrote so that this censure is levelled at the pastorals which however in another place he has commended for eglogue and pastoral poesy sir ph sydney and master challener and that other gentleman who wrote the late shepherds calendar b   c    spenser had published the pastorals about ten years before to which he did not prefix his name of obsolete phrases and words yet it may be affirmed that his style is in general perspicuous flowing and exuberant his pastorals are written in a professed imitation of the style of chaucer of which he has taken care to acquaint us in the beginning of colin clouts come home again the shepherds boy best known by that name that after tityrus first sung his lay milton in imitation of our author styles chaucer tityrus where he hints at chaucers having traveled into italy mansus    quin and in has quondam pervenit tytirus oras   and the tale of the oak and briar in the pastoral of february is more particularly modelled after chaucers manner and is accordingly ushered in with this preparatory introduction  a tale of truth which i cond of tityrus in my youth and in another pastoral he hints at his having copied chaucer that colin hight which well could pipe and sing for he of tityrus his songs did lere he even seems in the pastorals to have attempted an imitation of the visions the author of the visions of pierce plowman is roberte longelande or langelande according to bale script brit cent      and wood hist and antiq univ oxon b   page  0  who likewise calls him malverne it is plain that his poem called the visions of p plowman was published after the year    0 from this passage in it in date of our bryghte in a dry apriell a thousand and three hundred twyse twentye and ten my wafers there were geisen when chichester was mair pass    so that several of gowers and chaucers pieces made their appearance before it it is divided into twenty parts passus as he styles them and consists of many distinct visions which have no mutual dependence upon each other so that the poem is not a regular and uniform whole consisting of one action or design the author seems to have intended it as a satire on almost every occupation of life but more particularly on the clergy in censuring whom wickliff had led the way not many years before this piece abounds with humor spirit and imagination all which are dressed to great disadvantage in a very uncouth versification and obsolete language it seems to be written without rhyme an ornament which the poet has endeavored to supply by making every verse to consist of words beginning with the same letter this practice has contributed not a little to render his poem obscure and perplexed exclusive of its obsolete style for to introduce his alliteration he must have been often necessarily compelled to depart from the natural and more obvious way of expressing himself the learned dr hickes observes that this alliterative versification was drawn by langland from the practice of the saxon poets and that these visions abound with many saxonisms haec obiter ex satyrographo nostro langelande cui anglosaxonum poet adeo familiares fuerunt ut non solum eorum verbis versus scripsit sed tinnitum illum consonantem initiaum apud eos literarum imitatus est and nonnunquam etiam versus tantum non saxonice condidit linguar vett septentrien thesaurus cap    page  0  and afterward speaking of the anglosaxon poems he adds this of their alliteration quorum in primis se observandum offert dictionum ab eadem initiali litera incipientium usus non infrequens cap    page     from this it appears that the example of gower and chaucer who sought to reform the roughness of their native tongue by naturalizing many new words from the latin french and italian and who introduced the sevenlind stanza from petrarch and dante into our poetry had little influence upon longland who chose rather to go back to the saxon models both for language and form of verse  the curious reader may not perhaps be displeased with a specimen of the introduction to the first vision the poet shadowed by the name and character of peter or piers a plowman represents himself as weary with wandering on a maymorning and at last laid down to sleep by the side of a brook where in a vision he sees a stately tower upon a hill with a dungeon and dark dismal ditches belonging to it and a very deep dale under the hill before the tower a large field or plain is supposed filled with men of every rank and occupation all being respectively engaged in their several pursuits when suddenly a beautiful lady appears to him and unravels to him the mystery of what he had seen  as a specimen of his manner the reader is desired to accept some of the verses of which i have just given an analysis in a summer season when set was the sun i shoupe me into the shroubes as i a sheep were in habit as a hermet unholie of works went wide into the world wonders to hear and on a maymorning on malvernehylles me befell a ferly a fairy methought i was weary a wandering etc pass   v   etc in these verses there is a manifest contradiction for the poet says that the sun was set and that it was a maymorning however it is plain that in the first line instead of set was the sun we should read  when hot was the sun for bale ubi supra speaking of this work thus translates the first line of it in aestivo tempore cum sol caleret and it should be remembered that bale had an opportunity of quoting from the most original editions  before every vision the manner of circumstances of his falling asleep are distinctly described before one of them in particular p plowman is supposed with equal humor and satire to fall asleep while he is bidding his beads in the course of the poem the satire is carried on by means of several allegoric personages such as mede simony conscience sloth etc the learned seldom notes on polyolb s    mentions this author with honor and by hickes he is frequently styled celeberrimus ille satyrographus morum vindex acerrimus etc leland seems to have confounded this poem with chaucers plowmans tale speaking of two editions of chaucer he adds sed petri aratoris fabula quae communi doctorum consensu chaucero tanquam vero parenti attribuitur in utraque editione quia malos sacerdotum mores vehementer increpavit suppressa est comment de script brit cap    chaucer indeed in the plowmans tale seems to have copied from our author  i shall conclude this note with a short extract from bale  ubi supra illud veruntamen liquido constat eum langelande fuisse ex primis joannis vuiclefi discipulis unum atque in spiritus fervore contra apertas papistarum blasphemias adversus deum and ejus christum sub amaenis coloribus and typis edidisse in sermon anglico pium opus ac bonorum virorum lectione dignum quod vocabat visionem petri aratoris  in hoc opere erudito prater similitudines varias and jucundas prophetice plura praedixit quae nostris diebus impleri vidimus complevit suum opus a d      dum joannes cicestrius londini praetor esset   of pierce plowman for after exhorting his muse not to contend with chaucer he adds nor with the plowman that the pilgrim playde awhile epilogue to shep kal  and besides that his pastorals might appear a more complete specimen of a work in old english he has given them the title of an old book called the shepheards calendar first printed by wynkin a word and reprinted about twenty years before our author published his pastorals viz      hence says e k in his epistle prefixed he terms it the shepherds calendar applying an old name to a new work one of spensers reasons for using so much ancient phraseology in these pastorals was undoubtedly with a design to stamp a doric or rather rustic simplicity upon them but the principal one was that which is delivered by his friend and commentator ibid  who was privy to all his designs e k in mine opinion says he it is one especial praise of many which are due to this poet that he has labored to restore as to their rightful heritage such good and natural english words as have been long time out of use and almost clean disherited which is the only cause that our mother tongue which truly of itself is both full enough for prose and stately enough for verse has long time been counted most bare and barren of both which default when as some have endeavored to salve and recure they patched up the holes with pieces and rags of other languages borrowing here of the french there of the italian and every where of the latin not weighing how ill those tongues accord with themselves but much worse with ours so now they have made our english tongue a gallimaufrey or hodgepodge of all other speeches thus that which induced spenser to adopt so much obsolete language in the pastorals induced him likewise to do the same in the faerie queen hence it is manifest that he was disgusted with the practice of his cotemporary writers who had adulterated according to his judgment the purity of the british tongue by various innovations from the spanish french latin and italian and that this was the case in the age of queen elizabeth will appear from the following passages thus marston in his satires i cannot quote a motte italianate or brand my satires with a spanish term proem b      and camden having given us a specimen of the lords prayer in old english has these words hitherto will our sparkfull youth laugh at their great grandfathers english who had more care to do well than to speak minionlike and left more glory to us by their exploiting great acts than we shall by our forging new words and uncouth phrases remains artic languages a learned gentleman one r c who has inserted a letter to camden in his remains thus speaks so have our italian travelers brought us acquainted of their sweetrelished phrases even we seek to make our good of our late spanish enemy and fear as little the hurt of his tongue as the dint of his sword again we within these sixty years have incorporated so many latin and french words as the third part of our tongue consists now in them and ascham in his scholemaster informs us that not only the language but the manners of italy had totally infected his countrymen where he is describing the italianizd englishman the same author acquains us that about this time an infinite number of italian books were translated into english among the rest were many italian novels the translations of which shakespere manifestly made use of for some of his plots those who have undertaken to point out the books from whence shakespere borrowed his plots have not i think been able to discover the source from whence he drew the story of his merchant of venice which in all probability is founded upon the following ancient ballad which i met with in a large collection  a song showing the cruelty of gernutus a jewe who lending to a merchant an hundred crowns would have a pound of his flesh because he could not pay him at the time appointed in venice town not long ago a cruel jewe did dwell which lived all on usurie as italian writers tell gernutus called was the jewe etc the whole song would be too prolix for this place i shall transcribe only the close of the story having premised that the cunning and rapacious jew is represented in our ballad to have lent an eminent merchant of venice an hundred crowns upon a bond in which promise of payment is made within a year and a day under the forfeiture of a pound of the merchants flesh in case of nonpayment that the merchant on account of his ships being detained by adverse winds was unable to perform his contract at the time appointed that the affair was referred to a judge that the friends of the merchant offered ten thousand crowns to absolve him but that the jew obstinately persisted in his demand of the forfeited pound of flesh then said the judge yet good my friend let me of you desire to take the flesh from such a place as yet you let him live do so and lo an hundred crowns to thee here i will give no no quoth he etc       for i will have my pound of flesh from under his right side        the bloody jewe now ready is with whetted blade in hand to spoil the blood of innocent by forfeit of his bond and as he was about to strike in him the deadly blow stay quoth the judge thy cruelty i charge thee to do so since needs thou will thy forfeit have which is of flesh a pound see that thou shed no drop of blood nor yet the man confound for if thou do like murderer thou here shall hanged be likewise of flesh see that thou cut no more than longs to thee for if thou take or more or less to value of a mite thou shall be hanged presently as is both law and right gernutus now waxt frantic mad and wot not what to say quoth he at last ten thousand crowns i will that he shall pay and so i grant to set him free the judge does answer make you shall not have a penny given your forfeiture now take at the last he does demand but for to have his own no quoth the judge do as you li thy judgment shall be shown either take your pound of flesh quoth he or cancel me your bond o cruel judge then quoth the jewe that does against me stand and so with griped grieved mind he bids them farewell all the people prayed the lord that ever this heard tell after which follows a moral exhortation resulting from the subject  it may be objected that this ballad might have been written after and copied from shakesperes play but if that had been the case it is most likely that the author would have preserved shakesperes name of shylock for the jew and nothing is more likely than that shakespere in copying from this ballad should alter the name from gernutus to one more jewish and by the alteration of the name his imitation was the better disguised another argument which would have appeared much more convincing had the whole song been transcribed but which perhaps will be allowed from this extract is that our ballad has the air of a narrative written before shakesperes play i mean that if it had been written after the play it would have been much more full and circumstantial at present it has too much the nakedness of an original besides the first stanza informs us that the story was taken from some italian novel thus much therefore is certain that is shakespere either copied from that italian novel or from this ballad now we have no translation i presume of such a novel into english if then it be granted that shakespere generally took his italian stories from their english translations and that the arguments above concerning the prior antiquity of this ballad are true it will follow that shakespere copied from this ballad  i shall only add that it appears from s gossons school of abuse printed      that the character of a cruel and covetous jewe had been exhibited with good applause before shakesperes shylock appeared the author is commending some plays and among the rest the jewe and ptolome shown at the bull the one representing the greediness of wordly chusers and bloody minds of usurers the other etc     our authors disapprobation of this practice may be made to appear more fully from his own words where he hints that chaucers language which he so closely copied was the pure english  dan chaucer well of english undefilde        a learned lexicographer gives a very different account of the purity of chaucers style chaucerus pessimo exemplo integris vocum plaustris ex eadem gallia in nostram linguam invectis eam nimis antea a normannorum victoria adulteratam omni fere nativa gratia and nitore spoliavit pro genuinis coloribus sucum illinens pro vera facie larvam induens skinner praefat ad etymolog ling anglic page   but though spenser disapproved of this corrupt adulteration of style so fashionable in is age yet we find him notwithstanding frequently introducing words from a foreign tongue such as visnomie amenance arret mespise sovenance afrap aguise amenage abase and the like but these words the frequent return of his rhyme obliged him to introduce and accordingly they will generally be found at the end of his lines thus the poverty of our tongue or rather the unfrequency of identical terminations in it often compelled him for the sake of rhyme to coin new english words such as damnifyd unmercifyd wonderment warriment unruliment habitaunce hazardrie etc etc to this cause his many latinisms may likewise be attributed which like the rest are substituted to make out the necessary jingle  the censure of b johnson upon our authors style is perhaps unreasonable spenser in affecting the ancients writ no language discoveries the groundwork and substance of his style is the language of the age in which he lived this indeed is seasoned with various expressions deduced from a remote age but in such a manner that the language of his age was rather strengthened and dignified than debased or disguised by such a practice in truth the affectation of spenser in this point is by no means so striking and visible as johnson has insinuated nor is our author so obsolete in his style as he is generally thought or represented to be for many stanzas together we may frequently read him with as much facility as we can the same number of lines in shakespere but though i cannot subscribe to the opinion of the lastquoted critic concerning our authors recourse to the ancients yet i must confess that the following sentiments relating to the same subject are admirable words borrowed of antiquity do lend a kind of majesty to style and are not without their delight sometimes for they have the authority of years and out of their intermission do lend a kind of gracelike newness but the eldest of the present and newness of the past language is the best ibid   sect v of spensers imitations from chaucer it has been before observed in general that spenser copied the language of chaucer it may with equal truth be affirmed that he has likewise in many passages imitated the sentiment of chaucer and i shall now proceed to give some specimens of his imitation in both these particulars b i c i s viii much can they praise the trees so straight and hie the sailing pine the cedar proud and tall the vineprop elm the poplar never dry the builder oak sole king of forests all the aspine good for staves the cypress funeral ix the laurel meed of mighty conquerours and poets sage the fur that weepeth still the willow worn of forlorn paramours the eugh obedient to the benders will the birch for shafts the sallow for the mill the myrrh sweetbleeding in the bitter wound the warlike beech the ash for nothing ill the fruitful olive and the platane round the carver holme the maple sildom inward sound met  0  0 ovid oedip     seneca     0 lucan theb      statius and r proserp    0  the passages are alleged by mr jortin remarks on spensers poems p     claudian have all left us a description of trees but spenser in this before us seems more immediately to have had his favorite chaucer in his eye he has however much improved upon the brevity and simplicity of our ancient bard the bilder oak and eke the hardy asshe the pillar elm the coffir unto caraine the box pipetree holme to whips lasshe the sailing fur the cipres death to plain the shooter ewe the aspe for shaftes plain the olive of peace and eke the dronken vine the victor palm the laurer to divine the assemble of fowls v      in chaucers complaint of the black knight we meet with another description of trees from which spenser seems also to have drawn one or two circumstances the mirre also that wepith ever of kind the cedris hie as upright as a line v     spenser perhaps in having given us this minute and particular enumeration of various trees has incurred a smaller share of censure than some of the roman authors mentioned above in some of them indeed such a description will be found superfluous and impertinent but upon this occasion it is highly consistent and indeed expedient that the poet should dwell for some time on the beauty of this grove in describing its variety of trees as that circumstance tends to draw the redcross knight and his companion farther and farther into the shade till at length they are imperceptibly invited to the cave of error which stood in the thickest part of it in short this description is so far from being puerile or illplaced that it serves to improve and help out the allegory but notwithstanding this may be affirmed in commendation of spenser yet i am apt to think that the impropriety of introducing such a description would not have appeared a sufficient reason to our poet why he should not have admitted it for his judgment was so greatly overwhelmed by his imagination that he could never neglect the opportunity of a good description whenever it presented itself the reader will excuse my producing another passage from chaucer in which he ridicules with no less humor than judgment the particular detail of trees and of the circumstances which followed upon their being felled given us by one of the abovementioned ancient poets he is speaking of arcites funeral but how the fire was maken up on height and eke the names how all the trees hight as oak fur beech aspe elder elm popelere willow holme plane box chesten and laurere maple thorn beech ewe hasell whipultree how they were feld shall not be told for me ne how the gods runnen up and down disherited of her habitatioun in which they wonned in rest and pees nymphs faunies amadriades ne how the beasts ne how the birds all fledden for fear when the trees was fall ne how the groun aghast was of the light that was not wont to see the son bright ne how the fire etc knights tale v         b i c xii s xivthe poet is speaking of the magnificent feasting after the redcrosse knight had conquered the dragon what needs me tell their feast and goodly guise in which was nothing riotous nor vain what needs of dainty dishes to devise of comely services or courtly train my narrow leaves cannot in them contain the large discourse of royal princes state to this i shall beg leave to subjoin another passage of the same kind in which he is describing the wedding of florimel to tell the glory of the feast that day the goodly service the devisefull sights the bridegroomes state the brides most rich array the pride of ladies and the worth of knights the royal banquetts and the rare delights were work fit for an herald not for me       after this indirect and comprehensive manner chaucer expresses the pomp of cambuscans feast of which shall i tell all the array then would it occupy a sommers day and eke it needs not to devise at every course the order of service i wol not tellen as now of her strange sewes ne of her swans ne of her heronsewes eke in that land as tellen knights old there is some meat that is fully dainty hold that in this land men retch of it but small there is no man that may reporten all squires tale v     thus also when lady custance is married to the sowdan of surrie what should i tellen of the rialte of that wedding or which course goth beforn who blowith in a trompe or in a horn the man of lawes tale v  0   in these passages it is very evident that chaucer intended a burlesque upon the tedious and elaborate descriptions of such unimportant circumstances to be met with in books of chivalry in the last verse the burlesque is very strong b i c xii s xxiv he is speaking of a grand assembly which is held in the hall of the palace of unas father with flying speed and seeming great pretense came running in much like a man dismayed a messenger with letters which his message said xxv all in the open hall amazed stood at suddenness of that unwarie sight and wondered at his breathless hasty mood but he for naught would stay his passage right till fast before the king he did alight where falling flat great humblesse he did make and kissed the ground whereon his foot was pight he seems to have copied this surprise occasioned in the hall by the sudden and unexpected entrance of this messenger together with some of the attending circumstances from a similar but more noble surprise in chaucer which happened at cambuscans annual birthday festival and so befell that aftir the third course while that the king sat thus in his noblay herkning his minstrelis their thingis play beforn him at his board deliciously in at the halle door full sodeinly there came a knight upon a stead of brass and in his hond etc etc            and up he rides to the hie board in all the hall ne was there spoke a word for marveile of this knight him to behold full besily they waiten young and old this strange knight etc        salved the king and queen and lordis all by ordir as they sittin in the hall with so hie reverence and obeisaunce as well in speech as in countinaunce that etc etc     and aftir this beforn the hie board he with a manly voice said his message squiers tale v     b ii c xii s li thereto the heavens always joviall looked on them lovely still in steadfast state ne suffered storm nor frost on them to fall their tender buds or leaves to violate nor scorching heat nor cold intemperate to afflict the creatures which therein did dwell but the mild air with season moderate gently attempred and disposed so well that still it breathed forth sweet spirit and wholesome smell chaucer in the assemble of fowls the air of the place so attempre was that never was there grevance of hot ne cold there was eke every wholesome spice and gras ne no man may there wax sick ne old v  0   as a proof of this imitation it may be observed that spenser has not only here borrowed some of chaucers thoughts but some of his words he might nevertheless have some passages from the claudian n hon and mar v    lucret   v    hom odyss   v    sidon car   v  0  classics in his eye cited by mr jortin remarks p         b iii c ii s xixthe poet among other rare qualities of merlins wondrous mirror mentions the following whatever foe had wrought or friend had faynd therein discovered was  and afterward st    such was the glassie globe that merlin made and gave unto king ryence for his guard that never foes his kingdom might invade but he it knew at home before he hard tidings thereof and so them still debard it was a famous present for a prince and worthy work of infinite reward that treasons could bewray and foes convince from whence it is plain that spenser drew the idea of this mirror from that which is presented by the strange knight to cambuscan in chaucer this mirror eke which i have in my hond has soche a might that men may in it se when there shall fall any adversite unto your reign or to yourself also and opin se who is your friend or fo and ovir all if any lady bright has set her heart on any manir wight if he be false she shall the tresoun se his new love and all his subtilte so opinly that there shall nothing hide squiers tale v      spenser likewise feigns that his mirror was of service in the purposes of love and as such it is consulted by britomartis but upon an occasion different from that which is here mentioned by chaucer she looks in it to discover who was destined to be her husband whom fortune for her husband would allott st    as the uses of this mirror were of so important a nature spenser ought not to have first mentioned it to us by that light appellation venus looking glass where he is speaking of britomarts love for arthegall whose image she had seen in venus lookingglass       b iii c ix s xxviii she sent at him one fiery dart whose head empoysned was with privy lust and jelous dred xxix he from that deadly throw made no defense but to the wound his weak heart opened wide the wicked engine through false influence past through his eyes and secretly did glyde into his heart which it did sorely gryde which seem to resemble these of chaucer he is speaking of cupid he took an arrow full sharply whet and in his bow when it was set he straight up to his ear drough the strong bow that was so tough and shot at me so wonder smert that through mine eye unto mine heart the takell smote and deep it went romans of rosc v       the thought of the heart being wounded through the eye occurs again in chaucer so that this arrow anon right throughout eye as it was found into mine heart has made a wound ibid v       thus also palamon speaks after he had seen emely but i was hurt right now through mine eye into mine heart  knights tale v  0    the thought likewise occurrs again in our poets hymn in honor of beauty has white and red in it such wondrous power that it can pierce through the eyes unto the heart b iv c ii s xxxii whylome as antique stories tellen us those two etc       though now their acts be no where to be found as that renowned poet them compiled with warlike numbers and heroic sound dan chaucer well of english undefiled on fames eternal beadroll worthy to be filed the squiers tale of chaucer being imperfect not unfinished for a very good reason offered by the judicious mr upton who says i hardly think that a story promising so fair in the beginning should be left halftold letter to g west esquire p  0 our poet thus introduces his story of the battle of the three brethren for canace which he builds upon the following hint of chaucer and after woll i speak of camballo that fought in listis with the brethren two for canace er that they might her winn but with these lines the story breaks off  mr upton ubi supra p  0 calls this addition of spenser to chaucers fragment a completion of the squiers tale but it is certainly nothing more than a completion of one part or division of chaucers poem for besides what chaucer proposed to speak of in the verses abovequoted concerning the contest for canace he intended likewise to tell us how that this falcon got her love again repentant as the story tellith us by mediation of camballus squiers tale v      also first woll i tell you of king cambuscan that in his time many a cite wan how that he wan thedora to his wife and after woll i speak of algarsife for whom full often in great peril he was ne had been holpin but by the horse of bras ibid v      it is no less amusing to the imagination to bewilder itself in various conjectures concerning the expedients by which the particular events here hinted at were severally brought about and to wander into a romantic disquisition concerning the miracles wrought by the means of this wonderful steed than it is matter of concern to reflect that chaucers description of them is utterly lost especially as we may reasonably conclude from the remaining parts of this tale that those which are perished must have discovered no less striking efforts of the imagination it appears that milton was particularly fond of this poem and that he was not a little desirous of knowing the end of a story which promised so many beauties in his il penseroso he invokes melancholy to  call up him that left halftold the story of cambuscan bold il pens v  0   but for what reason are we to suppose that he desired him to be called up was it not for this reason that he might tell that part of the halftold tale which remained untold as before he requests that orpheus might be raised to sing such notes as warbled to the string drew iron tears down plutos cheek ibid v  0   so he does not desire that chaucer should be called up for nothing but that this author of the imperfect tale of cambuscan should likewise tell of camball and of algarsife and who had canace to wife that owned the virtuous ring and glass and of the wondrous horse of brass on which the tartar king did ride  ibid v      circumstances and events which are not in the halftold story which chaucer has left us but which are only proposed to be told in the verses above cited and are the subject of the sequel lydgate in his temple of glass seems to speak as if he had seen a completed copy of this tale and uppermore men depeinten might see how with her ring goodly canace of every foul the leden and the song could understand as she hem walked among and how her brother so often helped was in his mischefe by the stead of bras that part of the story which is hinted at in the two last lines is lost which however might have been remaining in the age of lydgate  in the ashmolean musaeum at oxford there is a completion of this tale by john lane in ms it is numbered in the catalogue and in the first leaf      but on the back    quarto the title of this ms is as follows chaucers pillar being his masterpiece called the squiers tale which has binn given for lost for almost these three hundred years but now found out and brought to light by john lane    0 i conceived great expectations of this manuscript on reading the following passage in philips john lane a fine old queen elizabeths gentleman who was living within my remembrance and whose several poems had they not had the ill luck to remain unpublishd when much better meriting than many that are in print might possibly have gained him a name not inferior if not equal to drayton and others of the next rank to spenser but they are all to be produced in mss namely his poetical vision his alarm to poets his twelve months his guy of warwick an heroic poem at least as much as many others that are so entitled and lastly his supplement to chaucers squires tale theat poet mod poets page     but i was greatly disappointed for lanes performance upon perusal appeared to be not only a very inartificial imitation of chaucer but a very weak effort of imagination     i cannot omit this opportunity of lamenting with equal regret the loss of great part of a noble old scottish poem entitled hardyknute which exhibits a striking representation of our ancient martial manners that prevailed before the convenience and civilities of refined life had yet rendered all men fashionably uniform and lulled them into that tranquil security which naturally excludes all those hazardous incidents and glorious dangers so suitable to the character and genius of the heroic muse b iv c ii s xxxiii but wicked time that all good thoughts does waste and works of

a more vague sense  how best he mote darraine that enterprise        but we are told in the glossary to chaucer urrys edit that this word among other senses signifies to dare to attempt thus by a gradual detortion and by an imperceptible progression from one kindred sense to another a word at length attains a meaning entirely foreign to its original etymology  spensers frequent use of darraine

her lowest heel        also  her golden locks that were upbound still in a knott unto her heels down traced        this mention of golden hair puts me in mind of a correction which mr upton has made in the following verse of chaucer her gilded heris with a golden thread iboundin were assemble of fowls v        mr letter to g west esquire p    upton thinks that here is a transposition occasioned by the transcribers haste and that we should apply gilded to threde and goldin to heris viz her goldin heris with a gilded threde iboundin were  the alteration appears at first sight to be very just but it is perhaps unnecessary if we consider that gilte or gilded is often used by chaucer and applied to hair thus his gilt here was ycrounid with a son leg of g women v   0  and in the same poem

manner although it must be confessed that most of our old english writers frequently join two negatives when no affirmation is intended hickes after observing that a negation is often expressed in the anglosaxonic by two negatives has these words  editor chauceri nihil antiqui sapiens dicit it is his manner likewise imitating the greeks by two negatives to cause a greater negation as i ne said none ill speghts advertisement to the readers prefixed to his second edition of chaucers works london printed by adam islip   0  but the labors of this editor ought by no means to be slighted in general as he is the first that ever gave to the public a tolerably complete edition of chaucer and though he is censured as one antiqui nihil sapiens yet it must be confessed that his glossary to chaucer as being the first of that kind was a very laudable undertaking and though it was the first that it is notwithstanding so well executed as to have supplied very valuable materials to some more modern glossographers upon our ancient bard ipsum imitatum fuisse graecos in vehementius negando per duo negativa tametsi chaucerus literarum graecarum ignarus more sui temporis in quo saxonismus non penicus exoleverat duobus negativis est usus linguarum vett septentrional thesaurus cap    page     after which he produces some instances in the saxon where not only two but three and four negatives are put together with a negative signification  it is not pretended that all the obsolete words and phrases to be met in our author are here set down but those only which carry with them a more certain and undoubted evidence of their being immediately derived from chaucer thus here are several old old words unnoticed which appear likewise in chaucer but which are no more the property of him than they are of lidgate of gower and of the author of piers plowman so that it would be difficult in some cases to ascertain and mark out the particular source from which our author drew however it is manifest that he had the most frequent recourse to and drew the largest draughts from chaucer  the well of english undefilde   i cannot dismiss this section without a wish that this neglected author whom spenser proposed in some measure as the pattern of his language and to whom he is not a little indebted for many noble strokes of poetry should be more universally and attentively studied chaucer seems to be regarded rather as an old poet than as a good one and that he wrote english verses four hundred years ago seems more frequently to be urged in his commendation than that he wrote four hundred years ago with taste and judgment we look upon his poems rather as venerable relics than as finished patterns as pieces calculated rather to gratify the antiquarian than the critic when i sat down to read chaucer with the curiosity of knowing how the first english poet wrote i left him with the satisfaction of having found what later and more refined ages could hardly equal in true humor pathos or sublimity it must be confessed that his uncouth or rather unfamiliar language has deterred many from perusing him but at the same time it must be allowed that nothing has more contributed to his being little looked into than the convenient opportunity of reading him with facility in modern imitations thus when translation for such may imitations from chaucer be called becomes substituted as the means of attaining the knowledge of any difficult and ancient author the original not only begins to be neglected and excluded as less easy but also to be despised as less ornamental and elegant and thus though mr popes translation of homer is perhaps the best that ever was made of any author yet it has so far indulged the laziness or illiteracy of many readers as to tempt them to acquiesce in the knowledge of homer acquired by it as sufficient and thus many have preferred that translation to the grecian text in proportion as the former contains more frequent and more shining metaphors more lively descriptions and in general appears to be more full elaborate and various  sect vi of spensers imitations from ariosto b i c i s xxix this circumstance of the redcross knight and

a fictitious una to the redcross knight in the embraces of a young squire seems to be imitated from the deceptions carried on in the enchanted castle of atlanta where many of the guests are imposed upon by false representations of the persons of their friends or mistresses and more particularly from that passage where orlando after having been cheated with the appearance of a fictitious angelica is made to hear her cry out for his assistance as if some villain was ravishing her etc dum que in presentia del mio caro orlando da questo ladro mi sara rapita c    s     piu etc etc help now or

renaldo drinks and from the other angelica e questo hanno causato duo fontane che di diverso effetto hanno liquore ambe in ardenna e non sono lontane d amoroso disio l una empie il core che be dell

shall mislike renaldo drank of one and love much pained him the other drank this damsel and disdained him harrington by spensers account of this water of ardenne it might be concluded that rinaldo drank of that fountain which turned love into hate but it appears from this passage in ariosto that he drank of that fountain which produced the contrary effect however it is manifest that our author alludes to another place in ariosto where renaldo drinks of that fountain which produced the effect here described by spenser c    s    b v c ii s iv  here beyond a cursed cruel sarazin does won that

occasions many combats in the water one of which sort is here described between sir arthegall and the saracen s     in morte arthur we find an account of a knight who kept a bridge b   c      in which a circumstance is mentioned not in ariosto which spenser seems to have copied from thence in the passage under consideration on the third day he rode over a long bridge and there start upon him suddenly a passing foul chorle and he smote his horse and asked him why he rode over that bridge without his license so spenser who as they to the passage began to draw a villain came to them with

a cave in order to be sold for a slave c    s    etc  it has been before remarked that spenser in his blatant beast had some reference to the story of the questing beast mentioned in the romance of morte arthur yet notwithstanding i am apt to think that spenser in representing scandal under the shape of a monstrous and unnatural beast imitated or rather vyed with ariosto who has represented avarice and jealousy under the picture of two hideous beasts the first of which like the blatant beast attacks all estates alike enters the palace as well the cottage but vents his rage in a more particular manner against the clergy sparing not even the pope himself she is at last supposed to be bound by leo the tenth as jealousy is supposed to be driven to her den by renaldo it is not improbable that ariosto in adumbrating these violent passions under the figure of beasts formed of many unnatural combinations might have an eye to the beast in the revelations which rose out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion revel c    v     etc see f q         etc and orl furios c    s    and c    s    etc  the reader will excuse my adding in this place a passage which spenser has drawn from his favorite italian poet in the mourning muse of thestylis the blinded archerboy like lark in shower of rain sat bathing of his wings and glad the time did spend under those crystal drops which fall from her fair eyes and at their brightest beams him proynd in lovely wise cosi a le belle lagrime le piume si bagna amore e good al chiaro lume c    s     so the blind god whose force no man can shun sits in her eyes and thence his darts does fling bathing his wings in her clear crystal streams and sunning them in her rare beauties beams harrington though it must be confessed that spensers verses bear a stronger resemblance to these of nic archias of a lady weeping tam suavi in pluvia nitens cupido insidebat uti solet volucris ramo vere novo ad novos tepores post solemn accipere aetheris liquores gestire and pluviae ore blandiendo   i had almost forget to take notice that our author in his radegunde with her city of females probably had an eye upon ariostos land of amazons  but although spenser appears to have imitated and consequently to have admired ariosto from a survey of the preceding instances and to have been ambitious of rivalling the orlando furioso in composing a poem upon a kindred and similar plan yet it may be affirmed that they were both of a genius entirely different spenser amidst all his absurdities abounds with beautiful and sublime representations while ariostos strokes of true poetry bear a very signal disproportion in their number to his sallies of romantic imagination he gives us the grotesque for the graceful and extravagance for majesty he frequently moves our laughter and surprise by the whimsical figures of a callot but seldom awakens our admiration by the just portraits of a raphael to confess the truth ariostos vein is so far different from spensers that it is absolutely comic and infinitely better suited to scenes of humor than to serious and solemn description he so greatly excels in painting the familiar manners that what are called his tales are by far the most shining passages in his poem many of his similes are likewise the strongest indications of his turn for burlesque thus the magician disclosing his enchanted shield to dazzle the fight of bradamante is compared to a cat wantonly playing with a mouse and at last killing it c   s    rogero fighting with the orc a sea monster is compared to a fly attacking a mastiff and attempting to sting him in various parts of his body c  0 s  0  alzirdo being slain by orlando his soldiers are said to make a noise like that of a herd of swine when a wolf has seized one of their little pigs un tener porco c    s    zerbino having first insulted gabrina and afterward addressing her in a gentle manner is compared to a dog who at first furiously assaults a stranger but afterward a crust being thrown to him fawns upon him c  0 s     orlando and mandricard fighting together their weapons being broke to pieces are compared to two peasants who are drubbing each other having quarreled about a watercourse or boundary of land c    s    other examples of this sort are obvious to a reader of ariosto   but if there should be any readers who from some of the fictions in orlando would prove that its author was possessed of an extensive and magnificent invention let them remember that these are commonly borrowed from romances and adapted occasionally by the poet to the tenor of his allegory and if it should be granted that some or the greatest part of these were derived from his own fancy yet these as they so enormously transgress the bounds of nature and probability ought by no means to be admitted as genuine marks of the true poet  sect vii of spensers inaccuracies few poets will appear to have written with greater rapidity than spenser hurried on by the vehemence of imagination he frequently cannot find time to attend to the niceties of construction or to stand still and revise what he has before written in order to prevent contradiction inconsistency or repetition hence it is that he not only fails in the connection of single words but of circumstances and not only violates the rules of grammar but those of truth probability and propriety he was more sollicitous about giving bold than exact touches to his figures and was so earnestly intent of forming what was great that he forgot to produce that which was correct so that if with these inaccuracies we consider the irregularity of spensers plan in general we may venture to conclude that no poet ever showed more imagigination with less judgment than the author of the faerie queen it may be looked upon as a very officious piece of ill nature to draw together these inferior and subordinate faults and  seek slight faults to find where nature moves and rapture warms the mind   but a review of them will tend to explain many passages in particular in our author and to bring us acquainted with his manner in general  i shall begin with his elleipses in which the reader will find his omission of the relative to be frequent b i c vi s x as when a greedy wolf through hunger fell a silly lamb far from the flock does take of whom he means his bloody feast to make a lion spies fast running toward him he should have said a greedy wolf who through hunger fell b i c vii s xxxvii a gentle youth his dearly loved squire his spear of heben wood behind him bare a goodly person and could menage fair his stubborn steed etc who is omitted before could menage fair b i c x s xlii whose face he made all beasts to fear and gave all in his hand  that is into whose hand he gave all b i c xi s xxi he cryde as raging seas are wont to roar when wintry storm his wrathful wreck does threat the roaring billows beat the rugged shore as they the earth would shoulder from her seat and greedy gulf devour  some such word as while is to be understood before the roaring billows etc b i c x s li whose staggering steps thy steadie hand does lead and shows the way his sinful soul to save he should have said and to which it shows the way b iii c ii s xlv which lovst the shadow of a warlike knight no shadow but a body has in power no shadow but which a body etc b ii c viii s xxxviii with that he struck and the other struck withal that nothing seemd mote bear so monstrous might the one upon his covered shield did fall and glauncing down did not his owner bite but the other did upon his troncheon smite the one upon his etc that is the stroke or sword of the one etc and afterward but the other i e the stroke of the other etc so again        so sorely he her struck that thence it glaunct adowne her back  that is the weapon glaunct etc b iv c vi s xxxvii ne in his face nor blood or life appeared but senseless stood etc that is he senseless stood b iv c vii s vii but certes was with milk of wolves and tigers fed but certes he was etc b i introduct s ii whom that most noble briton prince so long sought through the world and suffered so much ill he should have said and for whom he suffered etc b i c x s xii the eldest  like sunny beams threw from her crystal face that could have dazd the rash beholders sight and round about her head did shine like heavens light   that could have dazd i e that which etc that put for that which occurs in other places and may mislead a reader not acquainted with spensers manner  thus again that erst him goodly armed now most of all him harmed         that one did reach the other pusht away        he should not have omitted which in the last verse and which round about her etc b i c x s xliii had charge the tender orphans of the dead and widows aid  that is widows to aid b i c xii s ix the sight with idle fear did them dismay ne durst approach him nigh  ne durst they approach him nigh etc b ii c ii s xxxviii as gentle hind whose sides with cruel steel through lanced forth her bleeding life does rain whiles the sad pang approaching she does feel brayes out her latest breath  she should have been inserted before brayes out etc b ii c ii s xvii stern melancholy did his courage pass and was for terror more all armed in shining brass he means and he was for etc b ii c iv s ix and eke that hag with many a bitter threat still called upon to kill him in the place that is still called upon him to etc b v c iii s xiii which when he had performed then back again to bragadocchio did his shield restore to bragadocchio he did etc b i c iii s v soon as the royal virgin he did spy with gaping mouth at her ran greedily that is he ran etc b i c i s iv seemed in heart some hidden care she had for it seemed etc so st    now said the lady draws toward night that is it draws so again so easy was to quench his flamed mind      for so easy it was etc b i c x s lxii as for loose loves are vain and vanish into naught as for loose loves they are vain etc in these lines was underneath enveloped with gold whose glistring gloss darkened with filthy dust       says mr jortin darkened is put for was darkened and among other instances of spensers elleipses produces the following in the tears of the muses and all the sisters rent their golden hairs and their fair faces with salt humor steep steep for did steep  of this sort there is an elleipsis in these lines of miltons epitaph on the marchioness of winchester her high birth and graces sweet quickly found a lover meet the virginquire for her request the god that sits at marriage feast the poet when he wrote request had forgot that his former preterimperfect tense found was formed without the sign did it may not be impertinent to remark that the marchioness lamented in this epitaph of milton is probably the same with that celebrated by b johnson in an elegy on the lady anne pawlett marchioness of winton the beginning of which pope seems to have thought of when he wrote his verses to the memory of an unfortunate lady johnson begins his elegy what gentle ghost besprent with april dew hayles me so solemnly to yonder yew and beckning wooes me etc in the underwood in which strain mr pope beautifully breaks out what beckning ghost along the moonlight shade invites my steps and points to yonder glade it is she  warb edit vol    as johnson now lies before me i may perhaps be pardoned for pointing out another passage in him which mr pope probably remembered when he wrote the following from shelves to shelves see greedy vulcan roll and lick up all their physic of the soul dunciad b   v    thus johnson speaking of a parcel of books these had thou pleased either to dine or sup had made a meal for vulcan to lick up an execration upon vulcane in the underwood     i shall now produce some instances of his confused construction b i c iii s xii till seeing by her side the lion stand with sudden fearee her pitcher down she threw and fled away for never in that land face of fair lady did she ever view and that dread lions look her cast in deadly hew   after having told us that seeing the lion stand by her she fled away for fear he adds that this was because he never had seen a lady before which certainly was no reason why she should fly from the lion what our author intended to express here was that at seeing the lion and so beautiful a lady an object never seen before in that country she was affrighted and fled b i c vi s v  he began the fort assail whereof he weend possessed soon to be and with rich spoil of ransackt chastity of which he weend soon to be possessed is not improper but to be possessed with rich spoil etc is very inaccurate here seems to be likewise somewhat of an elleipsis and i think he should have said rich spoil of its ransackt chastity b i c x s xl the fourth appointed by his office was poor prisoners to relieve with gracious aid and captives to redeem with price of brass from turks and sarazins which them had staid and though they faulty were yet well he waid that god to us forgiveth every hour much more than that why they in bands were laid   the poet says that his office was to relieve prisoners and to redeem captives with money from turkish slavery who though guilty of crimes yet he considered that god every hour pardons crimes much greater than those for which they were imprisoned  by this it should seem that those enslaved by the turks were guilty of crimes etc but the poet would signify by they faulty were the prisoners first mentioned who were deservedly imprisoned on account of their crimes  another instance of our authors inaccuracy is his tautology or repetition of the same circumstances b iv c xii s i for much more eath to tell the stars on hy albe they endless seem etc then to recount the seas posterity the difficulty of numbering the deities present at the marriage of thames and medway he expresses in the same manner in the stanza immediately preceding the which more eath it were for mortal wight to tell the sands or count the stars on hye b vi c vi s iv for whylome he had been a doughty knight as any one that lived in his days and proved often in many a perilous fight in which he grace and glory won always and in all battles bore away the bays but being now attackt with timely age and weary of this worlds unquiet ways he took himself unto this hermitage all this we were told a few lines before and soothly it was said by common fame so long as age enabled him thereto that he had been a man of mickle name renouned much in arms and derring do but being aged now and weary too of wars delights and worlds contentious toil the name of knighthood he did disavow and hanging up his arms and warlike spoil from all the worlds encumbrance did himself assoile c v s    to this head we may refer the redundancies of a word b iii c vi s xi it fortuned fair venus having lost her little son the winged god of love         xii him for to seek she left her heavenly house she is unnecessary in the last line as fair venus is the nominative case other instances of this fault might be produced  i shall now cite some instances in which he contradicts himself and runs into other absurdities on account of his forgetting or not reviewing what he had before written and in general from an hasty manner of composition b i c iv s viiispeaking of pride he says she  shone as titans ray and in the following stanza he compares her to phaeton where he says she exceeding shone like phoebus fairest child s   this is a very striking anticlimax b i c xi s xlvii another fair like tree eke grew thereby whereof whosoever did eat eftsoons did know both good and evil o mournful memory that tree through one mans fault has done us all to die here he tells us that the tree of knowledge occacasiond the fall of man in the stanza before he affirms the same of the tree of life  the tree of life the crime of our first fathers fall s    b ii c i s xxvi xxvii in these stanzas sir guyon suddenly abases his spear and begs pardon of the redcrosse knight for having attacked him as if he had just now discovered him to be the redcrosse knight whereas he knew him to be so st    and after that resolves to fight with him b iv c v s xxxviispeaking of care he like a monstrous giant seemd in sight far passing brontes and pyracmon great   if care was so monstrous a giant how could he dwell with his six servants in the little cottage abovementioned they spide a little cottage like some poor mans nest s    b iv c i s live the aged dame him seeing so enraged was dead with fear etc   the aged dame glauce might have easily pacified sir scudamore in this place by telling him that britomartis was a woman and as she was so much terrified it was highly natural that she should assure him of it though this would have prevented an entertaining surprise which the poet reserved for        b i c ix s vi aread prince arthur    arthur and una have been hitherto represented as entire strangers to each other and it does not appear how una became acquainted with the name of this new knight  b i c viii s xliii etc it is unnatural that the redcrosse knight should be so suddenly reconciled to una after he had forsaken her for her supposed infidelity and impurity the poet should certainly have expressed an eclaircissement between them  b vi c xi s li it was an instance of sir calidores courage to restore to coridon his flocks but not of his courtesy to carry away his love pastorella the poet should have managed the character of his patron of courtesy with more art  as spenser has drawn the character of his hero prince arthur from history he has limited himself to a particular period of time in which all the events of his poem however fictitious or imaginary are supposed to have happened upon this account all discoveries made since that particular period of time are improperly specified and the mention of them may be justly termed an anachronism our author has been guilty of one or two faults of this kind which we shall lay before the reader and evermore their hideous ordinance upon the bulwarks cruelly did play          spenser should have spared this circumstance of firearms ariosto was more cautious in this matter for though he has supposed the use of them upon a particular occasion in the age of charlemagne yet notwithstanding he hints that they were soon afterward destroyed and that the use of them was not revived till many years after and as the invention so the revival of them is attributed to the devil c    s    it has been observed that milton copied the invention of firearms from ariosto and it may further be observed that milton in the speech which one of the evil angels makes upon them  they shall fear we have disarmed the thunderer of his only dreaded bolt par l     0  has copied from himself in one of his latin epigrams there are other strokes likewise in miltons lesser poems which he has transferred into his great work thus in samson agonistes thrice she assayed with flattering prayers and sighs and amorous reproaches to win from me my capital secret etc thrice i deluded her  v     this form he has exactly repeated in paradise lost thrice he assayed and thrice in spite of scorn tears such as angels weep burst forth        in comus  a perpetual feast of nectard sweets where no crude surfeit reigns in paradise lost quaff immortality and joy secure of surfeit        in comus a thousand liveried angels lackey her the following in paradise lost is a kindred image about her as a guard angelic placed       among miltons imitations of himself i think the following have been unobserved in il penseroso sometimes let gorgeous tragedy in sceptered pall come sweeping by presenting thebes or pelops line or the tale of troy divine it appears that the greek tragedies founded upon these stories made an early and consequently a lasting impression upon milton in his first elegy to diodatus written before he was arrived at his twentieth year he particularises them where as in the lines just cited he is speaking of tragedy in general seu maeret pelopea domus sen nobilis ili seu luit incestos aula creontis avos b   el   in l allegro  lydian aires married to immortal verse thus at a solemn music  voice and verse wed your divine sounds  in comus plucking ripe clusters from the tender shoots of a vine in the translation of psalm  0  make their food her grapes and tender shoots in paradise regained tall stripling youths richclad of fairer hue than ganymed or hylas       it singles out these as two very beautiful youths in one of his latin elegies talis in aeterno juvenis sigeius olympo miscet amatori pocula plena jovi aut qui formosas pellexit ad oscula nymphas thiodomanteus naiade raptus hylas b   el   in the first of which verses he had eye to this of tibullus talis in aeterno faelix vertumnus olympo b      it has been before remarked that milton takes all opportunities of illustrating the power of music and of expressing his extreme fondness for it these verses in comus relating to that subject  sylla wept and chid her barking waves into attention and fell charybdis murmurd hoarse applause strongly resemble what silius italicus describes of a sicilian shepherd playing on his reed scyllaei tacuere canes stetit atra charybdis        but shall we suspect milton of plagiarism because the roman poet wrote first was it not natural for either poet in expressing the force of music in the isle of sicily to mention it is influence on two most implacable objects which the situation of the musician in both cases suggested  the fable of the garden of the hesperides seems to have affected the imagination of milton in a very particular manner as his allusions to it are most remarkably frequent viz and ladies of the hesperides  par reg       but beauty like the fair hesperian tree laden with blooming gold  comus all amidst the gardens fair of hesperus and his daughters three that sing about the golden tree ibid like those hesperian gardens famed of old par lost        hesperian fables true if true here only etc ibid     0  and verdant isles hesperian ibid       and in the original draught of the spirits prologue to comus he has painted these delicious islands with the utmost luxuriancy of fancy in lycidas weep no more woeful shepherds weep no more for lycidas your sorrow is not dead          lycidas sunk low but mounted high         where other groves and other streams along with nectar pure his oozy locks he laves and hears the unexpressive nuptial song in the blessed kingdoms meek of joy and love there entertain him all the saints above in solemn troops and sweet societies who sing and singing in their glory move           henceforth thou art the genius of the shore the same genius dictated similar sentiments on a similar occasion nec te lethaeo fas

mista beatis epitaphium damonis  i shall conclude this tedious note with observing that miltons genius for describing divine things which shines with so distinguished a luster in the paradise lost discovered itself in some of his most early productions in the juvenile poems we meet with frequent descriptions of the bliss and splendour of heaven of the glory of celestial beings of angelic music and of other objects placed beyond the visible diurnal sphere of this a passage cited above as is the ode on the nativity on the circumcision at a solemn music etc etc are testimonies even at the age of seventeen we find that a disposition to conceive images of this sort began to dawn in his imagination donec nitentes ad fores ventum est olympi and regiam crystallinam et stratum smaragdis atrium in ob praesul eliensis   at mihi major erit qui lurida creditur arma et trifidum fulmen surripuisse jovi in inventorem bombardae  chaucer in his account of the battle of anthony and cleopatra with

ambiguities  b i c vii s xlvi bred in the loathly lakes of tartary the poet should not have used tartary here for tartarus as the reader might mistake it for the country of that name he has committed

munio and facio this is a word very injudiciously coined by spenser as the same word in our language signifies quite another thing milton perhaps is more blameable for a fault of this kind now had

pains to point out those passages which their respective authors have imitated from others the curious reader is more particularly referred to that extensive and elaborate series of quotation entitled virgilius collatione scriptorum graecorum illustratus opera and industria fulvii ursini this enquiry is executed with a modest reserve and extended no farther than to those passages which are distinguished with more indubitable evidences of transcription or imitation might it should seem prove equally instructive and entertaining as it would the better enable us to regulate our idea of the merit and character of an author by ascertaining what degree of genuine invention is to be allowed him and by showing how far he has improved the materials of another by his own art and manner of application at the same time that it must necessarily gratify the inquisitive disposition of every reader but where there are even the most apparent traces of likeness how very seldom can it be affirmed with any truth as a late very sagacious critic see a discourse on poetical imitation has amply proved that an imitation was intended and how few of the commentators abovementioned are there who do not to use his own words mistake resemblances for thefts it is true in general that parallellists mistake resemblances for thefts but this assertion by no means affects the instances which i have given in two former sections of spensers imitations from chaucer and ariosto spenser is universally acknowledged to have been an attentive reader and professed admirer of both those poets his imitations from the former are most commonly literal and what he has copied from the latter are artificial fictions which consisting of unnatural combinations could not on account of their singularity be fallen upon by both poets accidentally as natural appearances might be which lie exposed and obvious to all at all times so that we may safely pronounce the resemblances produced in the sections abovementioned to have been intended as this then is a business which proceeds upon an uncertain foundation affording the amusement of conjecture rather than the satisfaction of truth it may perhaps be a more serviceable undertaking to produce an authors imitations of himself and this will be more particularly useful in the three following respects viz it will discover the favorite images of an author it will teach us how variously he expresses the same thought and it will often explain difficult passages and words b i introduct s   fair venus son that with thy cruel dart at that good knight

miltons lycidas where the pointing seems to be wrong  there entertain him all the saints above in solemn troops and sweet societies who sing and singing in their glory move according to the present pointing the sense is the saints who are in solemn troops and sweet societies entertain him or entertain him in among their solemn troops and sweet societies but if the comma was struck off after societies another and more beautiful meaning would be introduced viz the saints who sing in solemn troops and sweet societies entertain him etc b ii c iii s xxivof belphaebe speaking and twixt the

that had espide infernal furies with their chains untide spenser often expresses fear or surprise in this manner  as one affright with hellish fiends or furies mad uprore         the stony fear ran to his heart and all his sense dismayed ne thenceforth life ne courage did appear but as a man whom hellish fiends have frayd trembling long time he stood         often out of her bed she did astart as one with view of ghastly fiends affright        ne wist he what to think or to devise but like as one whom fiends have made afraid he long astonished stood ne ought he said ne ought he did but with fastfixed eyes he gazed still upon that snowy maid         from the passages already alleged and from some some others which i shall produce it will appear that spenser particularly excells in painting affright confusion and astonishment abessas affright at seeing the lion and una        full fast she fled ne ever looked behind        and home she came where as her mother blind sat in eternal night naught could she say but sudden catching hold did her dismay with quaking hands and other signs of fear who full of ghastly fright and cold dismay began shut the door         the

point through his heart did pearce and in his conscience made a secret breach wellknowing true all that he did rehearse and to his fresh remembrance did reverse the uglie hue of his deformed crimes that all his manly powers it did disperse as he were charmed with enchanted rimes that oftentimes he quakt and fainted oftentimes xlix in which amazement when the miscreant perceived him to waver weak and frail whiles trembling horror did his conscience dart and hellish anguish did his soul assail to drive him to despair and quite to quail he showed him painted in a table plain the damned ghosts

his eyes he saw and everburning wrath before him laid by righteous sentence of the almighties law then gan the villain him to overawe and brought unto him swords ropes poison fire and all that might

keen and gave it him in hand his hand did quake and tremble like a leaf of aspine green and troubled blood through his pale face was seen to come and go with tidings from the heart as it a running messenger had been at last resolved to work his final smart he lifted up his hand that back again did start   it is a trite observation that we paint that best which we have felt most spensers whole life seems to have consisted of disappointments and distress so that he probably was not unacquainted with the bitter agonies of a despairing mind which the warmth of his imagination and what was its consequence his sensibility of temper contributed to render doubly severe unmerited and unpitied indigence ever struggles hardest with true genius and a good taste for the same reasons that it enhances the pleasures of life sustains with uncommon torture the miseries of that state in which says an incomparable moralist every virtue is obscured and in which no conduct can avoid reproach a state in which cheerfulness is insensibility and dejection fullenness of which the hardships are without honor and the labors without reward to these may be added his personage fear next him was fear all armed from top to toe yet thought himself not safe enough thereby but feared each shadow moving to and fro and his own arms when glittering he did spy or clashing heard he fast away did fly as ashes pale of hew and wingyheeld and evermore on danger fixed his eye against whom he always bent a brazen shield which his right hand unarmed fearfully did wield         again when scudamour those heavy tidings heard his heart was thrild with point of deadly fear ne in his face or blood or life appeared but senseless stood like to amazed steare that yet of mortal stroke the stound does bear        a priest of isis after having heard the dream of britomart like to a weak faintharted man he fared through great astonishment of that strange sight and with long locks upstanding stiffly stared like one adawed with some dreadful spright      0  other instances of this sort might be cited but these are the most striking  it is proper to remark in this place that spenser has given three large descriptions much of the same nature viz the bower of bliss      the gardens of adonis     and the gardens of the temple of venus    0 all which though in general the same his invention has diversified with many new circumstances as it has likewise his mornings and perhaps we meet with no poet who has more requently or more minutely at the same time delineated the morning than spenser he has introduced two historical genealogies of future kings and princes of england     and    0 beside two or three other shorter sketches of english history he often repeatedly introduces his allegorical figures which he sometimes describes with very little variation from his first representation particularly disdain fear envy and danger in this poem we likewise meet with two hells        and         it may not be foreign to the purpose of this section to lay before the reader some uncommon words and expressions of which spenser by his frequent use seems particularly fond b ii c v s xxxii that round about him dissolute did play their wanton follies and light merriment   spenser often uses the verb play in this sense with an accusative case a multitude of babes about her hong playing their sports     0     the fry of children young their wanton sports and childish mirth did play        then do the salvage beasts begin to play their pleasant friskes     0    but like to angels playing heavenly toys    0     playing his childish sport      how mutability in them does play her cruel sports        and in an hymn of love there with thy daughter pleasure they do play

     misgotten        miscreated        i have been the more prolix in collecting these instances in order to justify a very happy conjecture of mr jortin remarks page     without which it will be difficult to make sense of a passage in our author viz some like to hounds some like to apes dismayed         mr jortin proposes to read mismade i e illshaped an alteration which we cannot reject when we consider the liberties spenser took in adding mis to a word he probably sent it to the press mismayd that it might rhyme more exactly and that spenser was very exact in this point i have before

very loathsome and horrible to our author in virgils gnat he applies it to horror nor those same mournful kingdoms compassed with rustie horror    i will hence take occasion to correct a passage in chaucer in the character of the reve and by his side he bare a rustie blade prolog v   0    i do not perceive the consistency of the reves wearing a rustie sword i should rather be inclined to think that the poet wrote trusty blade and by his side he bare a trusty blade b iii c i s lxii and to her weapon ran in mind to gride the loathed leachour  spenser frequently uses gride which signifies to pierce this word as e k remarks in the pastoral of february is often used by lidgate but never once by chaucer spenser was very well versed in all our ancient english bards but i do not remember that he pays a compliment to any of them chaucer excepted passim  and the epilogue to the aeglogues author of pierce plowman gride is found in the following passages  whose love has gryde my feeble breast

frequently used by spenser in some places it signifies ready or quick in others it seems to be used adverbially for quickly immediately it is plainly the old french word priest quick or nimble which sometimes is used adverbially mr jortin derives it from praesto adesse  for what art thou that makst thyself his dayesman to prolong the vengeance pressed         that is instant or present vengeance who him affronting soon to fight was ready pressed        that is ready quickly in which his work he had six servants pressed        that is six ready or nimble servants or perhaps present so hard

    i e your whole company or multitude shall be slain the septuagint render it   but it is time to relinquish a disquisition which will be discussed with so much superior learning and penetration by one who intends shortly to oblige his country with a dictionary of its language a work for which its author is admirably qualified as he has already given us a specimen of his abilities regarding such a subject if we may judge from a series of essays in which not only criticism and morality have appeared with new luster but from which the english language has received new grace and dignity  sect ix mr uptons opinion concerning several passages in spenser examined as that part of criticism which consists in rectifying the doubtful readings and explaining the more obscure passages of an ancient author necessarily deals much in conjecture and from its nature can seldom afford demonstration and as those who are employed in this province are too frequently compelled to deduce their positions not from what is but from that which seems to be the truth no science perhaps produces a greater diversity of opinions concerning the same point than this that which appears a lucky correction or alteration to one commentator is rejected by another as absolutely improbable and absurd and indeed the difference of sentiment in this case is dictated by the different manner of conceiving things which nature has implanted in the minds of different persons at the same time it must be acknowledged that the pride of appearing more sagacious than our predecessors often occasions the variation here insisted upon and sometimes mere caprice and obstinacy though in examining some of the ensuing passages i may be deceived as the rest of my brethren have been by the appearance of truth which i have assigned above as one of the causes of difference of opinion among the critics i can promise the reader that i will not suffer myself to be voluntarily misled by any of the lastmentiond corrupt principles and prejudices and upon this account i shall be ready to give up any point which in this section i shall be proved to have mistaken hoping to find mr upton a no less candid man than an ingenious critic  b i c i s xliii a fit false dream that can delude the sleepers sent mr upton proposes to read sleepers shent i e sleepers illtreated or abused but i rather think that we should preserve the common reading sent which is the proper and original spelling of scent sent says skinner which we falsely write scent is derived a sentiendo thus the meaning of this verse is a false dream that could deceive or impose upon the sleepers perception so that sent if we consider its radix sentio is here plainly made to signify perception in general scent is often thus spelt in our author  at sent of strangerguest         through his perfect sent         of sundry sent and hew      0 scent is often thus written by milton and as dr newton observes with great propriety the season prime for sweetest sents and airs    00   the sent of that alluring fruit         such a sent i drew of carnage   0       with sent of living carcasses  0      i confess that sent is somewhat harsh in this sense but what will not rhyme oblige the poet to say b i c ii s xix and at his haughty helmet making mark so hugely struck that it the steel did rive and rent his head he tumbling down alive with bloody mouth his mother earth did kiss greeting his grave his grudging ghost did strive with the frail flesh at last it flitted is whither the souls etc mr upton would alter alive in the third verse to bilive i e immediately for says he did he tumble down alive after his head was cleft asunder such a disquisition would remind one of burmannuss note on the gemitu of the dying turnus in the last verse of the aeneid  illustrat hunc gemitum r titius and de illo sono and rauco murmr quod ex occlusa vocali arteria editur explicat without entering into an anatomical disquisition concerning the possibility of living after such a blow we may remark that the poet himself intimates to us that he fell down alive and did not die till after his fall in these lines  his grudging ghost did strive with the frail flesh at last it flitted is mr upton would enforce and confirm the justness of his correction by remarking that the poet in these verses copied from virgil procubuit moriens and humum semel ore momordit where the word moriens does not imply that the man who fell down was dead i must confess that alive is superfluous but spenser has run into many other superfluities on account of the frequency of his rhyme mr upton proposes likewise to write earth  his mother earth with an initial capital supposing it a person however we had perhaps better suppose it a thing for if we understand it to be a person what an absurd mixture arises  his mother earth did kiss greeting his grave  grave cannot be referred to earth as a person but it may be to earth as a thing however it must be confessed that this is such an absurd mixture as spenser was very likely to have fallen into and we have numberless instances of this fault in his account of the rivers which attended the marriage of thames and medway      where god and river that is person and thing are often indiscriminately put the one for the other b xxiii c iv s i and a dry dropsy through his flesh did flow how can a dropsy flow says mr upton if it be dry he proposes to remove this contradiction by reading dire dropsy the dirus hydrops of horace but it is plain that dry dropsy is the species of the dropsy so called the dry dropsy or tympanites which spenser has inaccurately confounded with the other species of the dropsy which may not improperly be said to flow through the flesh not considering the inconsistency of making a dry thing flow as to mr uptons correction dire i cannot perceive how dire could ever be mistaken by the printers for dry mr upton might with equal propriety have objected to the following words dry drops and with dry drops congealed in her eye        by the way it will be difficult also to determine what spenser means by congealed which occurs again in the same sense and on the same occasion  in whose fair eye the crystal humor stood congealed round        but upon supposition that the tears were actually frozen in her eye we should think dry a very odd epithet for ice  to return by dry dropsy may not the poet also mean a dropsy which is the cause of thirst b i c iv s xlii him little answered the angry elfin knight mr upton reads him angry  him angry says mr upton means the paynim who is said to be enraged above pardon the error of enraged wight s    but because the paynim is angry does it necessarily follow that the elfin knight should not be so too he certainly has reason to be enraged and angry after that bitter taunt which provokes him to throw down his gauntlet as a challenge it is surely wrong to alter the text when there is neither necessity to require nor authority to support the correction b i c v s v on the other side in all mens open view duessa placed is and on a tree sans foy his shield is hanged with bloody hew both those the laurel garlands to the victor dew mr upton thus reads the last line both those and the laurel garlands to the victor due but surely duessa and sans foy his shield are the laurel garlands that is the rewards to be given to the conqueror laurel garlands are metaphorically used and put in apposition with duessa and sans foy his shield it may be urged as another objection to mr uptons alteration that spenser never cuts off the vowel in the before a consonant upon which account i would reject hughess reading of the following line the nemaean forest till the amphitryonide         that editor reads the nemaean  hughess reading indeed restores the true accent to nemaean but spenser frequently violates the accent of names of ancient places etc b ii c v s xxii  a flaming fierbrond which she in stygian lake aye burning bright had kindled  mr upton upon supposition that we refer aye burning to fierbrond does not approve of reading ayeburning but yburning he is unwilling to join ay or y burning to stygian lake for says he the lake of brimstone burnt not bright but only served to make darkness visible i allow that miltons idea of this lake was that it served to make darkness visible par lost   v    but might not spensers idea of the stygian lake be different from miltons besides why was the weapon carried to this lake to be kindled unless the lake was burning  the poet has given us the same image and allegory in another place firebrand of hell first tind in phlegethon by thousand furies        b iii c ii s iii but ah my rimes too rude and rugged are when in so high an object they do light and striving fit to make i fear do mar mr upton remarks that make in this passage signifies to verfify poiein versus facere but there is reason to think that make is here opposed to mar in the same sense as it is in the following lines likewise unequal were her hands twain that one did reach the other pusht away that one did make the other mard again        make and mar were thus used together as it were proverbially in our authors age thus harrington in his ariosto in vain i seek my dukes love to expound the more i seek to make the more i mard       yes answered guidon be i made or mard  0     ten years will hardly make that he would mar  0    thus also g tuberville to the countess of warwick ann    0 should make or mar as she saw cause and in these lines from an old translation of ovid quoted by the author of the art of english poesy medea of her children was i able to make them i pray you tell and am i not able to mar them as well   c     again in an old bombast play ridiculed by shakespere and make and mar the foolish fates midn dr       thus then the meaning of the lines before us is my verses are quite unpolished for so sublime a subject so that i spoil or destroy instead of producing or executing any thing good or perfect  in the pastoral june make is manifestly used in the sense versify and for this we have moreover the testimony of e k the god of shepherds tityrus is dead who taught me homely as i can to make again in colin clouts come home again besides her peerlesse skill in making well and all the ornaments of wondrous wit that is q elizabeth whom in another place he calls colin clout etc a peerlesse poetesse again and has he skill to make so excellent yet has so little skill to bridle love april    the author of the art of english poesy generally uses maker for poet poits and if we believe sir j harrington it was that author who first brought this expression the significancy of which is much commended by sir p sydney and b johnson into fashion about the age of q elizabeth nor to dispute how high and supernatural the name of a maker is so christened in english by that unknown godfather that this last year save one viz      set forth a book called the art of english poesy apology for poesy before ariosto b i c vii s xxxiii but all of diamond perfect pure and cleene mr upton proposes to read sheene instead of cleene but if this alteration is necessary here is it not likewise equally so in the following verses and that bright tower all built of crystal cleene        again in sonnet    leave lady in your glass of crystal cleene harrington in a translation of an epigram of james i on sir philip sidneys death uses clean as an epithet to venuss carknet i e a necklace she threw away her rings and carknet cleene notes on b    of orl fur  b v c vii s xiv and swearing faith to either on his blade mr upton observes that we have here an instance of spensers learning and that he makes his knights swear by their swords agreeable to that custom among the goths and hunns as related by jornandes and amm marcellinus but i am inclined to believe that our author drew this circumstance from books that he was probably much better acquainted with old romances in morte arthur we have frequent instances of knights swearing in this manner the same ceremony occurs again  he made him swear by his own sword         in another place one of the knights swears by his knighthood an oath which we likewise frequently meet with in romance  as he did on his knighthood swear        b ii c vi s v more swift than swallow sheres the liquid sky mr upton  produces the expression of sheres the liquid sky as one of spensers latinisms from radit iter liquidum and adds that milton has likewise used the same latin metaphor i suppose the passage hinted at by mr upton is where satan  shaves with level wings the deep par lost   b     but shave and shear are perhaps as different as rado and tondeo and tondet iter liquidum would i believe be hardly allowed as synonymous to radit iter liquidum my opinion is therefore that spenser here intended no metaphor but that he used shere for share to cut or divide as he has manifestly in these instances cymochles sword on guyons shield yglaunst and thereof nigh one quarter sheard away        cut away nigh one quarter in the following instances for the reason above assigned we ought to interpret sheare shere to cut or divide which with their finny oars the swelling sea did sheare        and through the brackish waves their passage sheare        i e cut their way or passage thus likewise an eagle that with plumy wings does sheare the subtle air         in another place we have share of arthegalls sword but wheresoever it did light it thoroughly shard      0 so milton of michaels sword   deepentring shared all his right side par lost         sect x of spensers allegorical character in reading the works of an author who lived in a remote age it is necessary that we should look back upon the customs and manners which prevailed in his age that we should place ourselves in his situation and circumstances that so we may be the better enabled to judge and discern how his turn of thinking and manner of composing were biased influenced and as it were tinctured by very familiar and reigning appearances which are utterly different from those with which we are at present surrounded for want of this caution too many readers view the knights and damsels the tournaments and enchantments of spenser with modern eyes never considering that the encounters of chivalry subsisted in our authors age as has been before hinted sect ii  that romances were then most eagerly and universally read and that thus spenser from the fashion of his age was naturally disposed to undertake a recital of chivalrous achievements and to become in short a romantic poet  nor is it sufficiently considered that a prevalent practice of spensers age contributed in a very considerable degree to make him an allegorical poet it should be remembered that in the age of which we are speaking allegory was the subject and foundation of public shows and spectacles which were then exhibited with a magnificence superior to that of former times that the vices and virtues personifyd and represented by living actors distinguished with their respective emblematical types were generally introduced to constitute pageantries which were then the principal entertainments and shown not only in private and upon the stage but very frequently in the open streets for solemnising any public occasion as a proof of what is here advanced i would refer the reader to hollinsheds and to keep that show company but yet far off stood the show of manhood and desert as first to be presented and that show was as well furnished as the other men all saving one boy called beauty for the which manhood favor and desert did strive or should have contended but good fortune as victor of all conquests was to come in and overthrow manhood etc hollingsheds chron v   p      description of the show of manhood and desert exhibited at norwich before queen elizabeth and more particularly to his account of a exhibited before the queen at westminster ibid page      and seq see also many other descriptions of this sort in the same author  it is not improbable that milton in il penseroso took his thought of hearing music from the earth produced by some spirit or genius and as i wake sweet music breath above about or underneath  from some machinery of inigo jones in his masks hollinshed mentions something like this in a very curious devise presented before queen elizabeth speaking of the music of some fictitious nymphs he adds which sure had been a noble hearing and the more melodious for the variety thereof because it should come secretly and strangely out of the earth ubi supr p       it may perhaps be readily admitted that milton drew the whole from what had been represented in a masque   turney performed by fulke grevile the lords arundell and windsor and sir philip sydney who are feigned to be the children of desire attempting to win the fortress of beauty in which last spectacle much poetical invention is discovered  in the mean time i do not deny that our author was in great measure induced from the practice of ariosto to write a poem partaking much of allegory yet it must still be granted that spensers manner of allegorizing seems to have rather resulted from some of the spectacles just mentioned than from what he had red in ariosto in fact ariostos allegory does not so much consist in personifying the virtues vices and affections of the mind as it does in adumbrating moral doctrine it is affirmed by plutarch that allegory is that in which one thing is related and another understood thus ariosto relates the adventures of orlando rogero bradamante etc by which is understood the conquest of the passions the excellence of virtue and other moral doctrines on which account we may term the orlando a moral poem but can we term the faerie queen upon the whole a moral poem is it not equally an historical or political poem for though it be according to its authors words an allegory or dark conceit yet that which is couched or understood under this allegory is the history and intrigues of queen elizabeths courtiers which however are introduced with a moral design under the actions of men and women in such an adumbration spensers allegory sometimes consists as in the first book where the redcrosse knight or a true christian attended by una or truth defeats the wiles of archimago or the devil etc etc yet he has shown himself a much more ingenious allegorist where his imagination bodies forth unsubstantial things turns them to shape and marks out the nature powers and effects of that which is ideal and abstracted by visible and external symbols as in his delineations of fear envy fancy despair and the like ariosto gives us but few of these symbolical beings in comparison of spenser and those which he has given us are by no means drawn with that fullness and distinctness with which they are painted by the latter and that spenser painted these figures so fully and distinctly may we not reasonably attribute it to his being frequently habituated to the sight of these symbolical beings distinguished with their proper emblems and actually endued with speech motion and life  as a more convincing argument in confirmation of what has been asserted upon this head it may be remarked that spenser denominates his most exquisite groupe of allegorical figures the mask of cupid thus without recurring to conjecture his own words indubitably demonstrate that he had sometimes representations of this sort in his eye he tells us that these figures were  a jolly company in manner of a mask enranged orderly        and in his introduction to this groupe it is manifest that he drew from another allegoric spectacle of age called the dumb show this consisted of dumb actors who by their dress and action prepared the spectators for the matter and substance of each ensuing act respectively as also of much hieroglyphical scenery calculated for the same purpose see gordobucke a tragedy written by t sackville      lately reprinted by mr spence jocasta a tragedy written by g gascoyne and f kinwelmarshe and acted at graies inn      and the introduction to s   act   of shakesperes hamlet  which was wont to be exhibited before every act of a tragedy st   and forth issewd as on the ready flore of some theater a grave personage that in his hand a branch of laurel bore with comely haveour and countnance sage yclad in costly garments fit for tragic stage iv proceeding to the midst he still did stand as if in mind he somewhat had to say and to the vulgar becking with his hand in sign of silence as to hear a play by lively actions he began bewray some argument of matter passioned which done he back retired soft away and passing by his name discovered ease on his robe in golden letters cyphered he afterward styles these figures maskers st   the whiles the maskers marched forth in trim array vii the first was fancy like a lovely boy of rare aspect etc   from what has been said i would not have it objected that i have intended to arraign the natural fertility of our authors invention and to prove that he minutely copied after these representations all that i have endeavored to inculcate is that spenser was not only better qualified to delineate fictions of this sort because they were  oculis subjecta fidelibus  hor art poet      because they were the real objects of his sight but that as all men are influenced by what they see he was prompted and induced to delineate them because he saw them especially as they were so much the delight of his age  instead of entering into an examination of spensers manner of allegorising and of the conduct of his allegories in particular which has been done with an equally judicious and ingenious discernment by mr spense polymet b  0 d   to mr spenses examination it may be added that our author frequently introduces an allegory under which no meaning is couched viz        alma is the mind and her castle the body the tongue is the porter of this castle the nose the portcullis and the mouth the porch about the inside of which are placed twice sixteen warders clad in white which are the teeth these alma passes by who rise up and do obeisance to her st    but how can the teeth be said to rise up and bow to the mind spenser here forgot that he was allegorising and speaks as if he was describing without any latent meaning a real queen with twice sixteen real warders who as such might with no impropriety be said to rise and bow to their queen many instances of his confounding allegory with reality occur through this whole canto and the two next particularly where he is describing the kitchen of this castle which is the belly he gives us a formal description of such a kitchen as was to be seen in his time in castles and great houses by no means expressive of the thing intended again the occult meaning of his bringing scudamore to the house of care        clashes with what he had before told us by this allegory of scudamore coming to cares house it should be understood that scudamore from a happy passed into a miserable state for we may reasonable suppose that before he came to cares house he was unacquainted with care whereas the poet had before represented him as involved in extreme misery it would be tedious by an allegation of particular examples to demonstrate how frequently his allegories are mere descriptions and that taken in their literal sense they have an improper or no signification veiled under them i shall however mention one the blatant beast is said to break into the monasteries to rob their chancels cast down the desks of the monks deface the altars and destroy the images found in their churches by the blatant beast is understood scandal and by the havoc just mentioned as effected by it is implied the suppression of religious houses and popish superstition but how can this be properly said to have been brought about by scandal and how could spenser in partilar say this who was as it appears by his pastorals a friend to the reformation as was his heroine queen elizabeth i shall mention one capital fault committed by the poet in this point which does not immediately fall under the rules of criticism  painters says a french writer ought to employ their allegories in religious pictures with much greater reserve than in profane pieces they may indeed in such subjects as do not represent the mysteries and miracles of our religion make use of an allegorical composition the action whereof shall be expressive of some truth that cannot be represented otherwise either in painting or sculpture i agree therefore to let them draw faith and hope supporting a dying person and religion in deep affliction at the feet of a deceased prelate but i am of opinion that artists who treat of the miracles and dogmas of our religion are allowed no kind of allegorical composition  the facts whereon our religion is built and the doctrine it delivers us are subjects in which the painters imagination has no liberty to sport abbe du bos reflections etc tom i c xxiv  the conduct which this author condemns is practiced by spenser with this difference only that the painters here condemned are supposed to adapt human allegory to divine mystery whereas spenser has adopted divine mystery to human allegory such a practice as this is not only to confound sacred and profane matters but to place the licentious sallies of imagination upon a level with the dictates of divine inspiration to debase the truth and dignity of heavenly things by making christian allegory subservient to the purposes of romantic fiction  this fault our author has most glaringly committed throughout his whole first book where the imaginary instruments and expedients of romance are perpetually interwoven with the mysteries contained in the book of revelations duessa who is formed upon the idea of a romantic enchantress is gorgeously arrayed in gold and purple and presented with a by the triple crown he plainly glances at popery triple crown by the giant orgoglio and seated by him on a monstrous sevenheaded dragon i      whose tail reaches to the skies and throws down the stars st    she bearing a golden cup in her hand        this is the scarlet whore and the red dragon in the revelations behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to earth c    v      again i saw a woman sit upon a scarletcolourd beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hands full of abomination and filthiness of her fornication c    v       in orgoglios castle which is described as very magnificent prince arthur discovers an altar carved with cunning imagery on which true christians blood was often spilt and holy martyrs often done to die with cruel malice and strong tyranny whose blessed sprites from underneath the stone to god for vengeance cride continually        the inspired author of the abovenamed sacred book mentions the same of what he saw in heaven i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice how long o lord holy and true do thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on earth c   v    0   a hermit points out to the redcrosse knight the new jerusalem    0    which an angel discovers to st john c     0 etc this prospect is taken says the poet from a mountain more lofty then either the mount of olives or parnassus these two comparisons thus impertinently linked together strongly remind us of the absurdity we are now speaking of the mixture of divine truth with profane invention and naturally lead us to reflect on the difference between the oracles frequently uttered from the former and the fictions of those who dreamt on the latter  spenser in the visionary dominions of unas father has planted the tree of life and knowledge from the first of the trees he says a well flowed whose waters contained a most salutary virtue and which the dragon could not approach thus in the same scripture he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life c    v      the circumstance in particular of the dragon not being able to approach this water is literally adopted from romance as has been before observed sect ii  thus also by the steps and expedients of romance we are led to the death of the dragon who besieged the parents of una by which is figured the destruction of the old serpent mentioned in the apocalypse  the extravagancies of pagan mythology are not improperly introduced into a poem of this sort as they are acknowledged falsities or at best if expressive of any moral truth no more than the inventions of men but he that applies the visions of god in such a manner is guilty of an impropriety which i fear amounts to an impiety  if we look back from spensers age through the state of poesy in this kingdom we shall find that it principally consisted in the allegoric species but that this species never received its absolute consummation till it appeared with new luster in the faerie queen there are indeed the works of some english poets now remaining who wrote before gower and chaucer but these are chiefly chroniclers in rhyme and seem to have left us the last dregs of that kind of composition which was practiced by the british bards as for instance the that laborious antiquary thomas hearne first printed this author at oxford      in his preface he tells us p  0 how he was first tempted to publish this rare piece when i first saw a ms of this author which was even when i was a young undergraduate in the bodleian library being one of the first mss i had ever perused there i was wonderfully delighted with it he afterward informs us with no small degree of triumph p    as the acts of the apostles that i published from archbishop lauds mss is the first entire book that was ever printed in england in capital letters so this chronicle of robert of gloucester is the first entire book that was ever printed in this kingdom it may be in the whole world in the manner i have done it that is in the black letter with a mixture of some saxon characters in the next page he proceeds to enter into a warm defense of the old black letter as it is a reproach to us that the saxon language should be so forgot as to have but few comparatively speaking that are able to read it so it is a greater reproach that the black letter which was the character so much in use in our grandfathers days should be now as it were disused and rejected especially when we know the best editions of our english bibles and common prayer to say nothing of other books are printed in it i shall cite one more instance of our antiquarys extreme thirst after ancient things p    but though i have taken so much pleasure in perusing the english bible of the year      yet it is nothing equal to that i should take in turning over that of the year      chronicle of robert of gloucester who wrote according to his own account about the year    0 and hence we may observe that gower and chaucer were reputed the first english poets because they first introduced invention into our poetry they moralized their song and strove to render virtue more amiable by clothing her in the veil of fiction chaucer it must be acknowledged deserves to be ranked as one of the first english poets on another account his admirable artifice in painting the manners which none before him had ever attempted even in the most imperfect degree and it should be remembered to his honor that he was the first who gave the english nation in its own language an idea of humor with these flourished the author of pierce plowmans visions of which i have given an occasional sketch above to these succeeded lydgate who from his principal performances the fall of princes and story of thebes might more properly be styled a legendary than allegorical poet although the first of these is in great measure a series of visions the book on which it is founded viz boccace de casibus virorum illustrium is a plain historical narrative  and the latter contains a groupe of imaginary personages which his master chaucer cannot surpass he is describing the company present at the marriage of oedipus and jocasta but at this wedding plainly for to tell was cerberus chief porter of hell and herebus father to hatred was there present with his holle kindred his wife also with her brows black and her daughters sorrow for to make hidiously chered and ugly for to see megera and thesiphonee alecto eke with labor and envy dread frawde and false treachery treason povert indigence and need and cruel death in his rent wede wretchedness compleint and eke rage fearful pale dronkenesse and age cruel mars and many a tigre wood brenning ire and unkind blood fraternall hate etc the first part speghts chaucer edit   fol        we have of this author two poems viz the this was never printed temple of glass and the dance of death or dance of machabree one machabree a french poet wrote a description in verse of a procession painted on the walls of st innocents cloister at paris called the dance of death this piece was translated by lydgate who tells us in the prologue st   the which dance at st innocents portraied is  stow mentions this dance of death in his survey of london speaking of the cloisters which anciently belonged to st pauls church about this cloister was artificially and richly painted the dance of machabray or dance of death commonly called the dance of pauls the like whereof was painted about st innocents cloister at paris the metres or poesy of this dance were translated out of french into english by john lidgate monk of bury and with the picture of death leading all estates painted round the cloister page     this picture is a woodcut and prefixed to the poem we are speaking of in tottells edition of lydgate      and is i suppose an exact representation of what was painted in st pauls cloisters it was afterward engraved by hollar in dugdales monast vol   p     in all probability this painting at st pauls or that which was the same at st innocents gave hans holbein the hint for composing his famous piece called the dance of death now to be seen in the townhouse at basil  it is commonly supposed that the woodcuts from whence hollar engraved his exquisite set of prints entitled the dance of death were executed by holbein but i am apt to think this a mistake which arose from confounding holbeins picture abovementioned with these woodcuts for it will appear that holbeins manner of cutting in wood is entirely different from that in which these are finished by comparing them with holbeins scriptural woodcuts in one of which his name is engraved at full length inserted in archbishop cranmers catechism an      in the cuts of this catechism there is a delicacy of handling by no means to be found in those of the dance of death which however have an inimitable expression and are most probably the work of albert durer i am not ignorant that rubens who had copied this dance of death recommended them to sandrart as the performance of holbein of which sandrart himself informs us  sic memini etc  i also well remember that in the year      when paul rubens came to utrecht to visit handorst being escorted both coming from and returning to amsterdam by several artists as we were in the boat the conversation fell upon holbeins book of cuts representing the dance of death that rubens gave them the highest encomiums advising me who was then a young man to set the highest value upon them informing me at the same time that he in his youth had copied them joach sandrart academ pict part   lib   cap   p     but if rubens styled these prints holbeins in familiar conversation it was but calling them by the name which the world had given them and which they generally went by in another place sandrart evidently confounds these woodcuts with holbeins picture at basil  sed in foro etc but in the fishmarket there at basil may be seen his holbeins admirable dance of peasants where also in the same public manner is shown his dance of death where by a variety of figures it is demonstrated that death spares neither popes emperors princes etc as may be seen in his most elegant woodencuts of the same work ibid page     now the cuts of which at present i am treating are fiftythree in number every one of which has an unity and is entirely detached from the rest so that how could they be representations of one picture but if it be granted that they were engraved from this picture which moreover from their dissimilitude they could not be how does it follow they were done by holbein  the book from which hollar copied these cuts is printed at basil      and is thus entitled icones mortis duodecim imaginibus praeter priores totidemque inscriptionibus praeter epigrammata e gallicis a georgio aemylio in latinum versa cumulatae the earliest edition i could meet with is one in which the inscriptions etc are in italian printed at lions      with this title  simolachri history e figure de la morte etc in this there are not so many cuts by twelve as in the lastmentiond edition and in the preface of this it is said that this book had been before printed with french and latin inscriptions etc and from the french edition i suppose aemylius spoken of before translated spurious editions of these cuts soon afterward appeared particularly one at cologn dated      in which the forgery is pretty discernible it may not be improper to take leave of this subject by remarking that spenser alludes to some of these representations which in his age were fashionable and familiar  all music sleeps where death does lead the dance  november which are both professedly written in the species of which i am at present speaking lidgate has received numberless encomiums from our old english poets to which his language entitled him rather than his imagination for though he is a very unaminated writer yet he made very considerable improvements in the original state of our english versification by writing in so polite a style and it ought not to be denied that lydgate is the first english poet who can be red without hesitation and difficulty to lydgate succeeded john harding who wrote a chronicle in verse of all our english kings from brutus to the reign of king edward iv in which he lived this piece is often commended and quoted by some of our best antiquaries but his merit as an historian naturally excludes him from that which he should arrogate as a poet accuracy in collecting and fidelity in relating events may be perhaps justly allowed him but not the least effort of invention so that from the specimen produced by harding at this time there was some reason to presage that poesy was relapsing into its primaeval barbarism and that the rudeness of robert of gloucester would be reinstated in the place of chaucers taste judgment and imagination  however in the reign of henry vii ample amends were made for this interval of darkness by stephen hawes a name generally unknown and not mentioned by any english compiler of the lives of english poets but by the accurate wood fast oxon  this author i look upon to be the restorer of invention in our poetry whose streams had flowed in a current still more polluted and sluggish ever since the time of chaucer he not only revived but highly improved the ancient allegoric vein which the rhyming chronicle of the last mentioned poet had as i before hinted now totally expelled instead of that dryness and harshness of description which are so remarkably disgusting in his predecessors we are by this author often entertained with the fullness and luxuriancy of spenserhawes refined lydgates versification and gave it what it wanted sentiment and invention added new graces to the sevenlined stanza which gower and chaucer first introduced into our tongue from the italian and to sum up all was the first of our poets who taught fertile fancy and highwrought fiction to wear the garb of perspicuous and harmonious numbers the title of his poem is almost as universally unknown as his name and is as follows the history of graunde amoure and la bell pucel called the pastime of pleasure containing the knowledge of the seven sciences and the course of mans life in this world invented by stephen hawes grome of king henry the seventh his chamber in a note after the contents it is said to be written in the twentyfirst year of henry vii which is in the year   0   in the reign of king henry viii learning appeared with new luster in this island and this age is perhaps the first which england ever saw that may with propriety be styled classical as it was dignified with the great names of sir thomas more colet dean of st pauls cheke ascham together with many more illustrious rivals in genius and erudition nor is it the most inconsiderable honor of this age that erasmus was now entertained and patronized in england and that the greek language in which are reposited the treasures of true learning now began to be taught and admired in this age flourished john skeleton who notwithstanding the great and new lights with which he was surrounded contributed not the least share of improvement to what his ancestors had left him nor do i perceive that his versification is in any degree more polished than that of his immediate predecessor hawes his best pieces are written in the allegorical manner and are his crown of laurel and bowge of court but the genius of this author seems little better qualified for picturesque than for satirical poetry in the former he wants invention grace and dignity in the latter wit and good manners  i should be guilty of injustice to merit in particular and to a nation in general which amidst a variety of disadvantages has kept a constant pace with england in the progress of literature were i here to omit the mention of two scottish poets who flourished about this time sir david lyndesay and william dunbar the former of which in his dream and other pieces and the latter in his golden terce or shield and in the thistle and rose has discovered a genuine spirit of allegorising soon afterward appeared a series of poems entitled the mirror of magistrates formed upon a every person is introduced speaking richard ii is thus introduced suppose you see the corpse of this prince all to be mangled with blewe wounds lying pale and wan all naked upon the stones in st pauls church the people standing round about him and making his complaynt in manner as follows etc  lydgatess fall of princes gave rise to the mirror of magistrates in the year      r baldwin was requested to continue lydgates series of the great unfortunate but he chose rather to confine himself entirely to our english story and began with robert tresilian      and ended with lord hastings      in this work he was assisted by others and particularly by john sackville who wrote the life of the duke of buckingham together with this induction intending at the same time to write all those remarkable lives which occurred from the conquest to tresilian with whom baldwin originally began and to have printed his additional part together with all that baldwine and his friends had already done in one volume and to have prefixed this induction as a general preface to the whole but this was never executed afterward another collection was published under the same title by w higgins        dramatic plan and capable of admitting some of the most affecting pathetical strokes but these however honored with the commendation of sir philip sydney are little better than a biographical detail there is one piece indeed among the rest which exhibits a train of imaginary personages so beautifully drawn that in all probability they contributed to stimulate and awaken the imagination of spenser in forming the like descriptions this however may be affirmed from demonstration that sackvilles induction approaches nearer to the faerie queen in allegoric representation than any previous or succeeding poem  after the faerie queen allegory began to decline and by degrees gave place to a see donnes works and davies on the immortality of the soul lord brookes treatise of human learning etc etc species of composition in which the perplexed subtilities of metaphysical disquisition strongly prevailed and which perhaps took it is rise from the taste and influence of that pacific prince and profound scholastic james i then una fair gan drop her princely mien mr masons musaeus    allegory notwithstanding abruptly discovered itself once more with somewhat of it native splendour in the printed in the year      the principal fault of this poem is that the author has discovered too much of the anatomist the purple island is the isle of man whose parts and construction the poet has described in an allegorical manner viz the bones are the foundation of it the veins it is brooks etc afterward the intellectual faculties are represented as persons but he principally shines where he personifies the passions or evil concupiscencies of the heart who attack the good qualities of the heart alike personified which under the conduct of their leader intellect rout the former in this poem there is too somewhat of a metaphysical turn as the whole is supposed to be sung by two shepherds the poet has found an opportunity of adorning the beginnings and endings of his cantos with some very pleasing pastoral touches purple island of fletcher with whom it almost as soon disappeared when a poetry succeeded in which imagination gave way to correctness sublimity of description to delicacy of sentiment and striking imagery to conceit and epigram poets began now to be more attentive to words than things and objects and a manner of expressing a thought prettily was more regarded than that of conceiving one nobly the muses this seems to have been the the case in france when voltaire read his henriade to m malezieux that learned man assured him his work would not be tasted for says he  les francois n ont pas la tete epique that is in a more extensive interpretation the present age is too fond of mannerd poetry to relish fiction and fable the satires of boileau will be preferred to an epic poem may we not say the same of the taste of the present age and that it is too much the consequence of that which began to prevail in the reign of charles ii that we now sacrifice to reason more frequently than to fancy on this occasion another question put by brumoy might not improperly be asked si la raison a deaucoup gagne ne peuton pas dire que le gout a un peu perdu tom       were debauched at court and life and manners became their themes insomuch that the simplicity and true sublime of the paradise lost was by these triflers either totally disregarded or else mistaken for insipidity and bombast even dryden blinded by the beauties of versification only seems not to have had a just idea of miltons greatness it is odd that in praising milton he should insist on these circumstances no man has so copiously translated homers graecisms and the latin elegancies of virgil by what follows it appears that he had no notion of miltons simple dignity he runs into a flat thought sometimes for a hundred lines together but it is when he is got into a track of scripture he afterward strangely misrepresents miltons reason for writing in blankverse neither will i justify milton for his writing in blankverse for whatever causes he alleges for the abolishing of rhyme which i have not now the leisure to examine his own particular reason is plainly this that rhyme was not his talent whether or no rhyme was miltons talent or not i shall not determine but shall infer from this reason assigned by dryden that had dryden composed the paradise lost he would have written it in rhyme and that consequently he judged the want of it an imperfection in miltons poem see dedication to drydens juvenal   without conducting the reader any farther through the succeeding stages and revolutions of the poetical republic in this kingdom i shall beg his pardon for having proceeded thus far in an enquiry that may seem a deviation from the subject of this section which i shall conclude with the sentiments of the abbe du bos on allegorical action which though applied by him to dramatic poets are equally applicable to the action of the faerie queen it is impossible for a piece whose subject is an allegorical action to interest us very much those which writers of approved wit and talents have hazarded in this kind have not succeeded so well as others where they have been disposed to be less ingenious and to treat historically their subject  our heart requires truth even in fiction itself and when it is presented with an allegorical action it cannot determine itself if i may be allowed the expression to enter into the sentiments of those chimerical personages it considers them as enigmas and symbols that envelop some precepts of morality or satirical strokes which properly belong to the jurisdiction of the mind now a theatrical piece were it to speak only to the mind would never be capable of engaging our attention through the whole performance we may therefore apply the words of lactantius upon this occasion reflections tom   c    poetic

golden oriental gate of greatest heaven began to open fair and phoebus fresh as bridegroom to his mate came dancing forth shaking his dewy hair spenser as mr jortin observes plainly alluded to this text in the psalms psalm      in them has he set a tabernacle for the sun which comes forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber and rejoices as a giant to run his course but our author has strangely inverted the circumstances the psalmist alludes to the jewish custom of the bridegroom being conducted from his chamber at midnight with great pomp and preceded by a great number of torches this is the illustration of the admirable dr jackson and without it the comparison is of no force or propriety the idea which our author would convey is that phoebus came forth fresh and vigorous as a bridegroom when he goes to his bride the circumstance of phoebus came dancing forth seems to have been copied by milton in his elegant song on may morning now the bright morning star days harbinger comes dancing from the east  but probably milton drew it from an old poem called the cuckoo by r niccols   0  who speaking of the east says from whence the days bright king came dancing out especially as milton has two thoughts in that song which are likewise in the cuckoo milton calls the morning star  days harbinger niccols calls the cock  days harbinger milton says of may  who from her green lap throws the yellow cowslip etc niccols of may and from her fruitful lap each day she threw the choicest flowers  milton i suppose had been reading this poem of the cuckoo just before he wrote his song and so imperceptibly adopted some of its thoughts and expressions and here it may be observed that in criticizing upon milton johnson spenser and some other of our elder poets not only a competent knowledge of all ancient classical learning is requisite but also an acquaintance with those books which though now forgotten and lost were yet in repute about the time in which each author

many authors before milton have described angels in which they have insisted only upon the graces of youth and beauty but it must be granted that our great countryman was the first that ever attempted to give or who at the same time gave with becoming majesty the idea of an armed angel he probably received some hints in this respect from painting swhich he had seen in italy particularly from one by

where gryllus one of the companions of ulysses transformed into a hog by circe holds a discourse with ulysses and refuses to be restored to his human shape  not many years before the faerie queen was written viz      gelli published his circe which is declared in the preface to be founded upon the dialogue of plutarch mentioned by mr jortin circe soon became a very popular book and was translated into english as likewise into other languages in the year      by one henry iden so that probably spenser had red it and might be induced to consult that dialogue from its mention in the preface b iii c i s xiv save bears lions and bulls which romed them around this verse would be improved in its harmony by reading save lions bears and bulls etc as would the following also yet was admired much of fools women and boys      0 if we were to read yet was admired much of women fools and boys but these corrections are made by the critic upon a supposition that his author must infallibly have written what was best it may be laid down as a general rule that an alexandrine cannot be harmonious without a full pause after the third foot thus that spear enchanted was  which laid thee on the green consequently the sixth syllable must necessarily be a monosyllable or the last syllable of a word for we cannot make a full pause in the middle of a word upon which account such alexandrines as these are necessarily inharmonious so in his angry cour  age fairly pacified that bore a lion pass  ant in a golden field but that he must do batt  el with the seanymphs son and to her watery cham  ber swiftly carry him and because a full pause must be made on the last syllable of the third foot the third foot should never consist of a trochee for then we should be obliged to lay the greater stress upon the short syllable as if the third foot was to be beauty courage greedy flowery or the like  and it may be further remarked that an iambus for the third foot will make the verse more musical as the pause will be more strong after a short syllable thus fit to adorn th dead  and deck the dreary tomb that art thus foully fled  from famous enemy for the same reason an iambic foot at the end of any english verse has a good effect  an alexandrine entirely consisting of iambic feet answers precisely to a pure iambic verse of the ancients thus th gentl eve awakes rfreshfull airs around eques sonant verbrabt ungula   in reading this kind of measure the ancients did not probably huddle the syllables together as we do but it would be difficult to point out the places at which they made their pauses why should the following pure iambic of sophocles elect v      be red like mere prose without any certain pause or division and this verse of anacreon od   v    be red with these rests  may we not suppose that the iambic of sophocles was red with some such divisions as these  which are not very unlike those which we make use of in reading the above english alexandrine or iambic verse the gentle eveawakesrefreshfull airsaround   it may be observed that a latin hexameter is essentially distinguished from a prose sentence only by being ended with a dactyle preceding a spondee upon which account our manner of reading the endings of such hexameters as these procumbit humi bos oceano nox amica luto sus etc is probably wrong according to our present manner of reading them the whole verse does not differ in sound from an oration prosaica contrary therefore to our present practice we should take care to express the dactyle and spondee thus  ocean  o nox and so of the rest and that this was the practice of the ancients may be farther inferred from these words of quintilian on reading verses sit lectio virilis et cum severitate quadam gravis et non quidem prosae similis quia carmen est instit orat l   c   b iii c i s xvi all as a blazing star does far outcast his hairie beams and flaming locks disspred   hairie seems to be an odd epithet for beams i once thought that spenser

flaming and locks b iii c i s lvi and every knight and every gentle squire began choose his dame with bascio mani gay   with bascio mani ital with kissing her hands a phrase perhaps common in our

homely wise and walled with sods around in which a witch did dwell in loathely weeds and wilful want all careless of her needs   witches were thought really to exist in the age of queen elizabeth and our author had probably been struck with seeing such a cottage as this in which a witch was supposed to live those who have perused mr blackwalls enquiry into the life and writings of homer will be best qualified to judge how much better enabled that poet is to describe who copies from living objects than he who describes in a later age from tradition b iii c vii s ix wiping the tears from her

outlandish gardens of euripides ovid petrarke ariosto and others and partly by invention out of our own fruitful orchardes in england yielding sundry sweet savours of tragical comicall and moral discourses both pleasant and profitable to the wellsmellyng noses of learned readers this was followed by another edition an      this author was well esteemed by his cotemporary writers as appears by their testimonies of him and it must be confessed that he has much exceeded all the poets of his age in smoothness and harmony of versification would it not extend this note too far as a specimen of his talent for loveverses i would produce his ode in praise of lady bridges now lady sands on a scar on her forehead in which the reader would be surpised to discover a delicacy rarely if ever to be found in that early state of our poetry  but the reader will probably be still more entertained with some passages in jocasta a tragedy before mentioned written ten years before the poem just quoted and acted at grays inn      in which he will not only perceive the strength and harmony but likewise the poetical spirit of spenser who did not publish any one of his pieces till fourteen years afterward the story is taken and in some measure translated from the phoenissae of euripides it is written in blank verse with chorusses none of which are copied from those in the phoenissae and before each act according to the practice of that age the dumb show is introduced in act     combat is likely to ensue between eteocles and polynices on which occasion the chorus consisting of four theban dames sing an ode which thus begins o fierce and furious god whose harmefull heart rejoices most to shed the giltlesse blood whose headie will does all the world subvert and does envy the pleasant merry mood of our estate that erst in quiet stood why do thou thus our harmless town annoy which mighty bacchus governed in joye father of war and death that do remove with wrathful wrecke from woeful mothers breast the trusty pledges of her tender love so grant the gods that for our final rest dame venus pleasant looks may charm thee best whereby when thou shall all amazed stand the sword may fall out of thy trembling hand and thou may prove some other way full well the bloody prowess of thy mighty spear wherewith thou raisest from the depths of hell the wrathful sprites of all the furies there who when they wake do wander every where and never rest to raunge about the coasts to enrich their pit with spoil of damned ghostes and when thou have our fields forsaken thus let cruel discord bear thee company engirt with snakes and serpents venomous even she that can with red vermilion dye the gladsome green that florishd pleasantly and make the greedy ground a drinking cup to sup the blood of murdered bodies up yet thou return o joye etc etc   there are other passages equally striking which it would be no less tedious than impertinent to transcribe   virelayes and verses vain   virelayes are often mentioned by chaucer and our old poets g gascoigne in his defense of rhyme gives this account of virelayes there is an old kind of rhyme called verlayes derived as i have read of the word verde which betokens green and lay which betokens a song as if you would say green songs but i must tell you by the way that i never read any verse which i saw by authority called verlay but one and that was a long discourse in verses of ten sillabeles whereof the four first did rhyme across and the fyfth did answer to the first and third breaking off there and so going

sack of her own seat      daniel here alludes to a circumstance related of nero and waller seems to have imitated daniels application of it thus nero with his harp in hand surveyed his burning rome

from this the reader passes over the expression tapestryhalls without feeling any idea conveyed to him by it because the object from whence it is drawn does not at present exist and we may observe from this passage how much of their force and propriety both expressions and descriptions must necessarily lose when the objects or customs or manners to which they allude are out of use and forgotten

pretenses to the contrary are here likewise fully answered and the unlawfullness of acting of beholding academical enterludes briefly discussed besides sundry other particulars concerning dancing dicing healthdrinking etc london       this extravagant and absurd spirit of puritanical enthusiasm proved at last in its effects as pernicious to polite learning and the fine arts as to the liberties and constitution of our country while every species of elegance was represented by these austere and melancholy zealots as damnable luxury and every degree of decent adoration as popish idolatry in short it is not sufficiently considered what a rapid and national progress we were at that time making in knowledge and how sudden a stop was put to it by the inundation of presbyterianism and ignorance which circumstance alone exclusive of its other attendant evils gives us ample cause to detest the promoters of that malignant i wish i could add unprovoked rebellion which no good man can remember without horror  it may not perhaps be impertinent to remark here that milton who was inclined to puritanism had good reason to think that the publication of his samson agonistes would be very offensive to his brethren who held poetry and particularly that of the dramatic kind in such abhorrence and upon this account it is probable that in order to excuse himself for having engaged in this proscribed and forbidden species of writing he thought it expedient to prefix to his play a formal defense of tragedy in which he endeavors to prove that some of the gravest writers did not scruple to illustrate their discourses from the works of tragic poets and that many of the wisest philosophers and of the primitive fathers were not ashamed to write tragedies  the subsequent remarks are thrown

all wild beasts do rest and every river eke his course forbeares then does this wicked evil thee infest   these verses which at first sight seem to be drawn rom didos i cannot forbear taking this opportunity of checking the petulance and confuting the weakness of the redoubted mr rymers criticism on the night of medea in apollonius          b   v      night drew her shade over the earth the mariners contemplated from their ships helice and orion the traveller and doorkeeper were drowsy the sleeping mother forgott her dead children there was no barking of dogs heard through the city nor any loud sound and silence attended upon the black darkness  but sweet sleep did not seize medea upon the propriety of these images mr rymer thus expatiates  he would say that all the world is fast asleep but only medea and then his mariners who are gazing from their ships on helice and orion can serve but little for his purpose unless they may be supposed to sleep with their eyes open neither dares he say that the porter and traveller are yet taking a nap but only that they have a good mind to it and after all we find none but the good woman who had lost her child and she indeed is fast asleep unless the dogs may likewise be supposed so because they had left off barking and these methinks were scarce worthy to be taken notice of in an heroic poem except we may believe that in the old time or that in greek they bark heroically our critic here unfortunately sets on upon a supposition absolutely false viz that the poet is representing all the world as fast asleep so that every argument which he draws from this supposition must necessarily fall to the ground apollonius ushers in his nightpiece by telling us night covered the earth with her shade and afterward selects such objects and circumstances the repose and tranquillity of which produce the most striking contrast to and consequently most strongly exaggerate the distraction and inquietude of medea hence he tells us that the mariner was contemplating with calm attention the constellations of helice and orion or that now it was the time according to virgils translation cum medio volvuntur sydera lapsu or that it was a still and consequently a silent night that even the traveller and doorkeeper whom he singles out as their employment implies watching and wakefullness were now about to fall asleep that even the mother whom we might expect to find awake had now forgot her dead babes in slumber that the dogs had ceased barking through the city a circumstance highly natural and picturesque of a still night that every sound etc but that amidst this situation of things medea could not sleep but what can we expect from a critic who confesses himself to be struck with this choice representation of the night in drydens conquest of mexico all things are hushed as natures self lay dead the mountains seem to nod their drowsy head the little birds in dreams their songs repeat and sleeping flowers beneath the nightdew sweat even lust and envy sleep    these lines are no bad burlesque but it is their misfortune that they are written without the least intention of producing a smile nor are mr rymers sentiments upon them a worse specimen of burlesque criticism which however are dictated with the most serious and unaffected gravity  in this description four lines yield greater variety of matter and more choice thoughts than twice the number of any other language here is something more fortunate than the boldest fancy has yet reached and something more just than the severest reason has observed here are the flights of statius and marino tempered with a more discerning judgment and the judgment of virgil and tasso animated with a more sprightly wit nothing has been said so expressive and so home in any other language as the first verse in this description the second is statius improved et simulant fessos curvata cacumina somnos   says statius where simulant is a bold word in comparison of our english word seem being of an active signification and cacumina may as well be taken for the tops of trees as the tops of mountains which doubtful meaning does not so well content the reader as the certainty  in the third verse it is not said that the birds sleep but what is more new and more poetical their sleep is implied by their dreams somewhat like to the fourth we have in marino   e languidetti i fiori giaceano a lherba genitrice in seno adonis cant  0 which is a pretty image but has not so near a resemblance with truth nor can so generally be applied to all flowers our author here dares not say directly that the flowers sleep which might sound a little harsh but slurs it over in the participle as taken for granted and affirms only that they sweat which the nightdew makes very easy  in the last halfverse we may see how far our author has outdone apollonius twas no such strange thing in the sorrowful woman when she had spent her tears for sleep to close her eyes but here we have the most raging and watchful passions lust and envy and these too instead of the lustful and the envious for the greater force and emphasis in the abstract  some may object that the third verse does contradict the first how can all things be hushed if birds in dreams repeat their songs is not this like the indiscretion of marino who says that the winds and all things are hushed and the seas so fast asleep that they snore cant  0  it may be answered that in this place it is not the poet that speaks but another person and that the poet here truly represents the nature of man whose first thoughts break out in bold and more general terms which by the second thoughts are more correct and limited as if one should say all things are silent or asleep however if there is any noise it is still but the effect of sleep as the dreams of birds etc this comparison might be much further improved to our advantage and more observations made which are left to the readers ingenuity pref to

entertainment and the dame has syrinx grace   these little traits of likeness just lead us to conclude that milton before he sat down to write his arcades had recourse to johnson who was the most eminent masquewriter then extant for the form and manner proper to this species of composition and that in the course of writing it he naturally fell upon some of johnsons expressions b vi c ix s xxix

words well added to obviate the incredibility of casting anchor in this manner  it is likely that milton never heard this improbable circumstance of mistaking the whale for an island from the seamen but that he drew it from that passage in his favorite ariosto where astolpho dudon and renaldo are said to have seen so large a whale in the sea near aclynas castle that they took it for an island

these observations would have been rendered more useful and convenient had they been printed together with spensers text arrangd in their respective places at least it may be urged that such a plan

general heads appear to be so many distinct essays on spenser and thus methodized are intended to form a kind of systematical critcism on the faerie queen the second is that a formal edition of this poem with notes would have been impertinent as such a work is at present expected from the hands of two learned and ingenious critics  as to particular ejections too many i am sensible must occur one of which will probably be that i have been more diligent in pointing out the faults than the beauties of this author that i have been deficient in encomiums on particular passages did not proceed from a want of perceiving or acknowledging beauties but from a persuasion that nothing is more absurd or useless than the panegyrical comments of those who criticize from the imagination rather than from the judgment who exert their admiration instead of their reason and discover more of enthusiasm than discernment and this must necessarily it will however most commonly be the case of those who undertake to point out beauties which as they will naturally approve themselves to the reader by their own force so no reason can often be given why they please the same cannot always be said of faults which i have frequently displayed without palliation see more particularly sect   it being my chief aim together with that of particular illustration to give an impartial estimate of the merit
