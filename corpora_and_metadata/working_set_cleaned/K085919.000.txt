in the strand and c etherington at york mdcclxxiii  to the right honorable countess of hertford madam as i flatter myself the public will agree in my opinion that a burlesque of affected gentility can be no where better addressed than to a lady whose elegant and liberal ideas of life ornament even nobility i have ventured this intrusion which as it proceeds from a profound respect for your ladyships very distinguished character will i hope be considered in a favorable light  i am with all possible deference madam your ladyships most obedient and very devoted servant the author  advertisement the author of this dramatic scrap having from a fatal and irreparable event in his family labored under a gloom of mind exceedingly disadvantageous to comic ideas has reason to fear it wants much of that spirit which a happier state of imagination would have produced but having promised a piece of this kind to mr as mr foot kindly conferred an unexpected favor on mr weston which rendered a new piece unnecessary the author is happy in transferring it to mr jewel as a very valuable member of society weston as a performer of singular merit he encountered a task rather irksome and to get the subject out of his way pursued it with uncommon rapidity however from the favorable opinion of some judicious friends hopes it will not be deemed unworthy existence on the stage or in the closet  dramatis personae sir francis fairlove dan drugger mr weston farmer tilwell mr bannister tim tilwell mr fearon skinflint mr gentleman frizeau mr jacobs dickey drugger miss francis servant mr francis mrs deborah drugger mrs williams anna miss platt lisini miss craven scene london  the pantheonites act the first scene i enter tilwell and skinflint meeting skinflint ha honest farmer well met   tilwell honest farmer hey day what are all you london folks flatterers though by the bye i believe i am as honest as most of my neighbors tom tilwell can lay his hand upon his heart and say he never belied providence nor wished a rise of provisions in his life   skinflint hoity toity if many farmers were of this way of thinking we cornfactors and salesmen should be soon as thin as pharoahs lean kine  a parcel of poor devils indeed the finest scheme in the world except clipping and coining would be totally ruined no no heaven send the landlords to raise their rents and the farmers to keep pace with them  ah you dont know the pleasure and profit we enjoy   tilwell pleasure what in starving your fellow creatures   skinflint starving  no no mercy forbid not so bad as that only lock their jaws a little   tilwell you dont by appearance master skinflint seem as if your jaws were much locked   skinflint me why you would not put me on a footing with ragged weavers in spittlefields or slipshod tailors in clement danes  you dont see into the bottom of things  we are friends to government as well as ourselves the english master tilwell londoners particularly are with full bellies insolent grumbling politicians they pretend to think for themselves  now weaken the beer when you raise the price clip short their beef and pudding keep provisions high and wages low  you have em as tame as so many pet pigeons   tilwell at this rate your business is of great use   skinflint the greatest importance i assure you  we are on the changealley plan exactly as they have at all times letters ready from dantzig hamburgh the hague or an express from india over land to influence stock so we have accounts from every shire in england to keep up the markets   tilwell what then you have correspondents in all parts of the kingdom   skinflint not one on that account  we dont care how things really are we can make them as we please  why i have burned the uplands with sunshine and drowned the lowlands with rain a thousand times i was the means of lifting up the peck loaf twopence last week and have another petition from the bakers to the court of aldermen in my pocket it is penned in such a lamentable style that i dont doubt with one or two more working up to a shilling   tilwell what when there is a fine crop fine weather for harvest and new corn coming in   skinflint no matter for that  did not you see a paragraph of mine in the papers last week that all the old was gone yet would you think it now for all i take so much pains and make it so fine a time for gentlemen of the crust i was obliged to arrest one of the fraternity yesterday for a hundred and fifty   tilwell he must be a bad manager indeed   skinflint apes quality  as most of our tradespeople do nowadays  keeps a country house a phaeton and for ought i know a mistress but i dont so much blame him for this if he had any brains why the blockhead in five years trade for himself never had sense enough to make a loaf two or three ounces short and is so plaguey conscientious as not to use any alum because its unwholesome  time for me to look sharp master tilwell   tilwell but after all friend skinflint though i am a farmer and may gain by it i think it hard that there should be plenty and scarcity at the same time   skinflint politic politic  if all the fish that is caught was brought to market and all the meat that is killed sold both would soon be a drug there is one instance among many  mat marrowbone of honeylane market as pretty a fellow as ever whetted a knife will frequently rather than take a halfpenny a pound under the fixed price on saturday night tip ten guineas worth into the thames on sunday morning he has showed me his thames register and a sweet pretty collection of drowned joints there is however i advised him for the future to bury all because you know in the water it may feed and increase the stock of fish which might hurt the flesh trade mat took the hint  ah he is a sensible spirited fellow as ever sold thirteen ounces for a pound and can afford to live genteelly   tilwell well notwithstanding what you say i am for peace and plenty you shall hear my thoughts on that subject in a song taught me by our vicar as hearty an old blade as ever wore black or used a tobaccostopper  song let me never know the man with pipe and full can whose prayers and study will cease that all the good things which providence brings may crown us with plenty and peace of this let our songs never cease of peace and of plenty of plenty and peace let a cup of strong beer each free briton cheer with plenty of pudding and beef to france well resign soup meagre and wine and at home find out perfect relief of this let our songs never cease of peace and of plenty of plenty and peace when a kind season sends for the best of all ends to mankind a plentiful store may they who for gain would render it vain never taste its indulgences more of this let our songs never cease of peace and of plenty of plenty and peace  skinflint i like the tune and your singing master tilwell but the words are horribly against trade i would not have them sung in one of our committees for ten quarters of wheat   tilwell committees   skinflint yes we have seven every week the forestalling one meets sunday afternoon at islington to tax mondays market at smithfield on

madam which never admits a cloud to hang on it   anna i am tolerably at ease sir francis and strive to keep myself so there is no occasion to pursue care it too often falls in our way unsought   sir francis perfectly right  but you are philosophical on every occasion the calmness or rather pleasure with which you heard your sisters good fortune is a peculiar instance   anna as i had formed o expectations the disappointment of my chance was easily borne   sir francis not so easily madam though you have given me but very distant expectation of being made happy by your fair hand yet i should be much more unsatisfied if hope was turned up a positive blank   anna sir francis the world calls you a man of honor and i believe you one believe your professions are sincere however beyond what i can merit but sir that father who brought me up with the utmost tenderness claims a share in the disposal especially as i am sure he will never do it against my inclinations   sir francis far be it from me to infringe upon his just and natural authority had i your leave his opinion should be soon consulted   anna i have often told you sir the difference of birth and fortune   sir francis virtue and good sense are far above them   anna i am not like my sister fond of the splendour of life   sir francis therefore the more wory to enjoy it splendour is but a rattle to weak minds its dignity rises from due application   anna a rattle i think indeed for the very notion of it seems to have rattled our family out of their senses but as my father is every day expected in town i hope his prudence will set them to rights a little   sir francis your father madam so soon expected may i be indulged with liberty to ask his opinion of the proposals i have made for you to share my fortune and my heart   anna what seems so far proper to you sir i can have no objection to   sir francis you make me happy  remember you are to be a shepherdess at the pantheon masquerade tonight and i am to
