the sincerity of the dissenters vindicated from the scandal of occasional conformity with some considerations on a late book entitled moderation a virtue  london printed in the year mdcciii  the introduction the defenders of occasional conformity are at last come to a point they have given up the cause so far as ever the first opposer pusht it at them the author of a book called moderation a virtue has very ingenuously acknowledged all that was desired  and indeed a man of his candor could do no less since he is of too penetrating a judgment not to know and of too much honesty of principles not to own that it is impossible to be defended  wherefore i think it cannot give offense either to him or to any body else to publish the conclusion of the argument in his own words and to let all men know  that it is granted by the dissenters  that to conform to the church of england and receive the sacrament merely to qualify for a civil employment is a scandalous practice a reproach to religion and offensive to all good christians  if therefore for the future any dissenter shall be guilty of this scandalous reproachful practice let no man reflect upon the body of the dissenters for an error of a single member he is to bear the burden himself for his mistake is his own the party disowns the practice  but the defenders of this occasional license are like a resolute garrison who being beaten out of a town retire to the castle the open and scandalous conformity of such people who too notoriously used it as a qualification for civil employments appearing too low a step to bear a defense they have politickly drawn in a great many honest wellmeaning gentlemen to side with the thing on account of a general charity and its being lawful in its own nature  the meaning is that having brought people to be reconciled to the thing in it self it may look the less odious in the other circumstances of it  but for what yet appears this shift will fail too and all that has been yet said does not seem to me to clear it up  god forbid that i should say conforming to the church of england abstractedly and singly considered is a sin but i cannot see the least argument to prove what i allege to be untrue viz that it is a sin in a dissenter to conform to the church of england or else his dissenting is a sin and he ought to repent of one or of the other  this i think will appear when all the authorities for this occasional compliance are examined and as i trust they shall be fairly confuted  this is what none of our opponents have yet replied to but continue to fetch a compass round it and reply to things which really are not of so much consequence in the case  the sincerity of the dissenters vindicated etc in the argument against occasional conformity it is not improper to observe there are two sorts of people blame the dissenters   their brethren dissenters who cannot satisfy themselves in the same latitude of principles   the strict conformist   to me it seems as necessary to examine the different reasons of these opponents as it is to examine the lawfulness of the fact and as it is a part of the dispute which has not yet been brought upon the stage it may be very useful to bring parties to a right understanding  it is most certain that these two parties do not cavil at the occasional conformity of the dissenters from the same principle nor with the same end and design  the stricter dissenter argues against it from a conscientious dislike of the practice the militant churchman from a dislike of the consequence the dissenter is against the communicating as a religious error the churchman as a politic one the dissenter explodes it as a sin against the reputation and interest of the dissenter the churchman as a sin against the interest of the church the dissenter as it weakens the dissenters and prepares their members to fall off and posterity to conform totally to what their fathers conformed to occasionally the churchman dislikes it as it lets the whigs into places and state employments and weakens the party that are to carry on other designs  as the difference of design is manifest so the arguments on both sides exceedingly differ  the dissenter charges the occasionalman with breach of his relative engagements to church societies deserting his first principles condemning his first dissent and the like but the churchman with hypocrisy tricking and undermining the government defeating the laws and the like  as to the last i cannot but blame the heat of these men who cry out upon the dissenters as cheats and hypocrites though at the same time i cannot approve the practice of occasional conformity as such  as to the trick put upon the state by the dissenters it is either an unjust charge or it is but a return in kind since it is plain that the test was it self a trick being pretended to be not against them but the papists and is by a strain of words bent at the dissenters to serve a turn and allow it had been the sense of the law it is plain by the consequence it was not made to bring the dissenters to church but to keep them out of the government which since the dissenters have prevented by complying they are angry the trick is discovered  the author of these sheets freely owns himself an opposer of occasional conformity but it is because he would have the dissenters preserve what he has often advanced in their favor viz that they are really dissenters for conscience sake and this he conceives cannot be reconciled to an occasional complying with that from which they had before dissented and on account whereof they could justify a separation from the established church  this being premised the defenders of this practice are manifestly in an error in their manner of justifying it since they seem to bend the strength of their replies against the friendly opposer and not against the furious assaults made upon their integrity though the last will appear the much easier enemy to be overcome  this seems to be observed in the late author of a book entitled moderation a virtue and i cannot but let that gentleman know that from his title the world expected an answer to those hot gentlemen who rally the dissenters with hypocrisy and state tricks in this case while the principal part of his argument lies only against the stricter dissenter as such though pointed at the churchman lessening the difference between them and the church in order to make conformity seem a thing of less moment than it is forgetting that the less the difference is the less the reasons for a schismatical separation will appear and the grounds and reasons by which their dissenting is to be defended appear the less justifiable  of seven heads of his arguments i am therefore ready to leave the last four for some body else to answer and only observe a little on the first three what the arguments amount to which vindicate the occasional communion of a dissenter as in its self lawful  and first as to his precedents he is pleased to prove that this occasional conformity is no new thing but has the warrants of uncontestable precedents  nor indeed is his argument new any more than the communion but what has been before started and lately very happily answered but as this author is far from being unworthy an answer so as he writes both strenuously and yet modestly he deserves an answer of respect  i have already noted a very honest concession granted by this author that he does not justify such as conform merely for a place but owns it as a scandalous practice  this is granting all the real ground of the dispute for as strictly speaking it may be possible that a man may really conform occasionally to the church without offense to his conscience yet to run it up to the extremest nicety and avoid the real offense taken at the practice is waving the argument and falling upon another never proposed  before therefore we come to the argument i must observe that a man may do a thing without offense to his conscience which may be really sinful and his conscience not being duly informed does not make the thing lawful in practice what ever it may be to him  but as the first occasion of this dispute was chiefly bent at such who really conform to qualify themselves for state employments it remains to examine whether these gentlemen charged have really done so or no and since naming of names is very improper and not absolutely necessary in this case i shall only lay down one case in which i think without breach of charity a man may be allowed to guess that a conforming is merely for the qualification  when a man who is a professed dissenter joined in communion with a separate congregation and either never or not for a long time did communicate with the church but upon some prospect of preferment some election place profit or perquisit shall conform to the church of a sudden and so very remarkably as to time viz the eve of an election or the like that all men must guess at the reason of doing it and after this the person never to conform again but upon like occasion  shall any man be judged for believing such a man conforms for the place shall this be called the moderate conscientious dissenter who this character will distinguish from others let them find out among his neighbors who know him i shall go no farther  to justify this conformity much time has been spent and labor lost for i must account it lost and this author has granted me the clause which is a token of his honesty for really it is not to be defended but here seems to lie an opportunity now to cover this scandalous practice with the pretense of conscience and it is but being a little wary as to circumstances and we may all for the future be conscientious occasional conformists and conscientious dissenters both together  and to make way for this endeavors are used first to prove the general practice lawful i confess the particular practice above named was always the principal design but since it is come so far as that one must be defended or at least concealed by the other i shall endeavor to show this covering will be too short for the bed and the shame and nakedness will appear and as the particular conformity we are upon is fairly suppressed i shall enquire if the general will hold water by it self and first for precedents i cannot but wonder at those which our author present us with john the baptist and our savior  john the baptist says he was an occasional conformist to the jewish church he went to jerusalem thrice a year to worship but held separate assemblies in the wilderness and taught and baptized  it is plain john the baptist was no dissenter at all he was a preacher of righteousness and the jews approved him for all men held him for a prophet but held all the parts of the established worship entire he preached in the wilderness but what did he say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand he neither dissented from the jewish worship nor taught others to do so but as a forerunner who went to prepare the way told them the gospel the messiah and savior was at hand the finishing of the old worship was at the door and the son of god coming to erect his kingdom in the world what was all this to dissenting he preached neither aagainst their doctrine nor ceremonies he conformed to them all himself only such as would receive his baptism which was only a token of their faith in the blessed tidings he brought them received it but they were not taught in the least to dissent from the established worship  with what reason can it be concluded from hence that christianity had its rise in occasional conformity the conclusion of this argument savours of more levity than this author any where else discovers and seems a little too much a sophism for a man of his judgment to offer in reasoning upon a subject so serious  our lord jesus christ says he the author of our holy religion was also an occasional conformist god forbid i should dare to write so our lord was a strict complete conformist to the ceremonial institution in every part of it that was divine but abhorred the innovations of the jews and he continued conforming even to the last passover which he eat with his disciples and not only was so himself but he instructed his disciples in the like they sit in moses seat whatsoever therefore they bid ye do that do ye think not i am come to destroy the law i am not come to destroy the law but to fulfill it is true our blessed lord did preach against the innovations which the traditions of the elders and the several divided sects had brought into their religion he reproached them with making his holy house of prayer a den of thieves with teaching for doctrine the commandments of men and the like but this was no more dissenting from the legal institution which was the established worship than the prophet elijahs overturning the altars of baal and slaying their priests was a dissenting for if purging the church from idols be dissenting such it was our savior taught but all his teachings were full of expositions of the law and comments upon the prophets and quoting them where they led unto himself nor did he omit the worship of their temple and synagogues though he took all other opportunities indeed to teach the people in all places but he submitted to circumcision eat the passover at the appointed time and his mother performed her proper offerings of purification  at the death of our lord he pronounced the great work of redemption finished the law was thence resolved into the gospel the veil of the temple rent in twain and the levitical institution began to cease i do not say entirely ceased  our blessed lord having offered up himself a sacrifice once for all the apostles never were found seeking to any propitiation but that of faith in his blood  but in the interval between the establishing christianity and the entire dissolution of the jewish rites as a religion the apostles as jews born are found in a promiscuous occasional exercise of both but what is to be gathered from it only this that it remains to examine whether the law expired at once or by gradations if it expired at once when that time was if gradually when it arrived to a total demise  if the levitical institution expired at once and that point of time was when our lord said it is finished then it is as lawful to conform to the jewish worship on occasion now as it was then  if not at this time but gradually then the first institution being all of divine original and one only a shadow of the other the gospel being the thing typified and the law the type it was neither a dissent nor a conforming for the jews to exercise religious worship in either because the religion was but the same thing and the ceremonies of the new were not yet settled but i do not say so of the christians who were gentiles  but our author who has said all this comes off again with this caution i am not concerned to prove the case of our dissenters to be parallel with these but it appears that occasional communion may in some cases be lawful  but in my opinion if our case is not parallel any one might be allowed to ask what is this to us if the cases are not alike the arguments are not alike  i cannot think it is just to infer that because occasional conformity may in some cases be lawful therefore it is lawful in our case unless our case and those some cases agree for if so then it is as lawful for us occasionally to conform to the romish church or to the jewish church for by our authors argument a christian has nothing to do but to examine whether he thinks it lawful in his case or no  but not one man has yet attempted to explain this question how the dissenting can be justified when we can so easily conform the making a breach in the established church a schism in the general union the breaking off from a general communion the erecting private churches a separate discipline and all this for things which occasionally we can comply with  if any occasion can justify a conformity no occasion can be of greater moment than peace union charity order obedience to princes laws and the like if we have not thought these sufficient occasions let us see which are greater  but after all pray let us examine this great article of conformity in the apostles and i am of opinion it shall come out fairly that really the apostles were not occasional conformists at all  and first in general i affirm none of the apostles are ever found conforming to any thing which they had declared their dissent from before but let us examine wherein they did actually conform and why  if any man will but give himself leave to distinguish a little in the case he may arrive at the truth of this matter with a small difficulty he need only distinguish between the practice of the apostles as jews born under the obligation of the levitical law and continuing still under more obligations than christian proselytes and observe that as jews they found themselves under some legal duties which the gentile christians were absolutely free from and therefore all that we call occasional conformity was only doing what they were bound in conscience to do and had never dissented from  the circumcising of timothy and the several parts of the law st paul conformed to were nothing but what as jews they were obliged to and their faith in the savior did not at all take off the obligation from those who were hebrews born and were then alive they were still zealous of the law acts    0 and the obligation to be so continued to them for this reason the circumcision of timothy is justified because his mother and grandmother were hebrews whereas it is expressly said st paul refused to circumcise titus because his father was a greek  by this it appears that circumcision was administered in timothy not as an occasional conformity but as a duty and a thing which timothy as a son of jewish parents ought to do and it rather seems strange it was not done before  to prove this see what is in the same case said to the christians who were gentiles by birth even the same apostle says if they were circumcised christ should profit them nothing  the matter therefore rested upon such a conformity as was required of them as jews and which the death of christ could not dissolve the obligation of to them who were then alive because the force of them began in their being born of the stock of abraham  but if the opponent in this matter can show me one instance in the whole scripture of any christian whether apostle or elder who being born a gentile did by this authority conform to the jewish ceremonies even in the least article then i will throw up this point and if not then i should be glad to meet with the same candor either to have my argument answered or granted  this matter will further appear if any man will but take the pains to examine the scriptures in the case the history of the apostles coming to jerusalem seems to me to make it plain in the    st of the acts v  0 the brethren come to st paul and tell him that the multitude of converted hebrews had entertained a scandal at his conversation from reports raised upon him that he taught the jews to forsake mosess law  now it appears that this was really a false report by the care taken to convince the jewish believers of it verse the      do therefore this that we say unto thee we have four men which have a vow on them them take and purify thy self with them and be at charges with them that they may shave their heads  it remains to enquire what was all this for it was not as is pretended a conforming on occasion to prevent giving offense but it was a practicing that which was still lawful that the scandalous report might be confuted and the next words make it out viz that all may know that those things whereof they are informed concerning thee are nothing that is that it is all false and scandalous and that those jews who believed were still to walk orderly and to keep the law  that therefore the christians who were converted from the jews were thus obliged to keep the law is plain and it is clear the keeping the law could be no sin because of its divine original  but let us look to the gentiles and let them show me one act of occasional conformity among them verse the   th as concerning the gentiles who believe we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing and at the same time that the apostle circumcised timothy because his mother was a hebrew as is noted before he refused to circumcise titus because his parents were greeks having said of the gentiles that if they are circumcised christ shall be to them of no effect  thus i think this mighty difficulty is over the occasional conformity of the apostles at an end and the uniformity of the christian church in its first institution vindicated  our commentators say god indulged the jews the liberty of using or not using the ceremoniale of the law as a thing wholly indifferent and as what upon the general revolution which religion came under at the death of our lord was necessary to reconcile the jews to the change  others are of opinion it was a burden on the jewish believers which the gentiles were freed from but they obliged to  and this seems plain from acts      it seemed good to the holy ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than this that ye abstain from meats offered to idols and from blood this was to the gentiles but the keeping of the law was a burden yet lest on the jews who were turned christians and then in being  but be which of these opinions we will in the right both allow that it only respected the jews and them no further than those then alive and that the gentile converts were not allowed the least shadow of a compliance or occasional conformity no not to the least and most indifferent ceremony and though the connection between circumcision and baptism was plain and they were equally seals of the covenant yet for a gentile christian to have accepted circumcision had been to make the death of christ of no effect to him  and indeed as the death of christ had a positive effect upon the law to abrogate and disannul it the jews then in being might be under vows and orders which their embracing the faith of christ did not destroy but if after the death of christ any christian who was not a jew born might on occasion conform to the old law of moses it can never be answered why it is less lawful now  the inference therefore drawn by the author p   that by this it appears occasional communion in some case may be lawful where constant communion would be a sin cannot be true that is it cannot be true from those premises because the fact of those premises does not appear to be true either that john the baptist our lord jesus christ or any of the apostles were occasional conformists  as to the sacrifices and supplications offered up at the temple for foreign princes or heathen emperors and powers first i am not satisfied that it was not an innovation or tradition many of which crept into the jewish worship till they became of equal authority to the law it self  but if it were true it seems no more an instance of occasional conformity than it would be in the dissenters of england on a formal request from the emperor of germany or the pope to keep a solemn fast to pray for them this might be occasional conformity in the emperor to us but not in us to him it was a public acknowledgment in the romans and a testimony to the verity of the jews religion but it was no conforming to the romans in offering sacrifices to god for the welfare of their emperors and i cannot but admire for what use in this argument this case is brought being in my humble opinion nothing at all to the matter  from hence i must lay down that occasional conformity is not sufficiently proved by precedents and authorities of scripture  our authors second head is to prove that the principles of the conscientious occasional conformist are christian and catholic and will justify him before god and man  this argument i think lies a little unfair for the man is not rightly described who is this conscientious occasional conformist  the question before me seems to lie thus whether a thing that would otherwise be unlawful is justifiable because the person acting it is not reproved in it by his conscience  the man is brought in with extraordinary qualifications not of a mercenary spirit or sinister intention to the established church he believes it a true church owns her ministry acknowledges her liturgy to be sound for substance  but because he conceives the dissenting churches to be true churches and their ministers generally men of real piety he thinks himself obliged to hold communion with them now where shall we find this man this is not the dissenter we are upon  with submission this man never was a dissenter he who in his conscience believes all the abovesaid of the church of england and has no more to say why he dissents may very well justify conforming to the church but i am sure he can never justify dissenting from them shall we make a schism in the established church only because we believe the dissenting churches to be true churches and their ministers good men this will never justify us  but our author goes one p    to enumerate the things for which the dissenter quits the church communion as   a defective discipline   a promiscuous communion contrary to the rules of the gospel and the primitive practice of the church   an imposed liturgy to an entire loss of the gift of prayer   human mixtures in the ministration as the cross surplice etc   the obligation on a christian to seek the best guides for his soul this is a satyr upon the church of england and the true and real grounds of a dissenters separation and he that dissents on these grounds can never conform upon occasion if he does how he can at the same time justify his dissenting remains with me a question yet unanswered  all the instances brought from dr bates mr baxter mr corbett mr tallents have some particular exceptions at first the great dispute in their cases is between lay conformity and conformity as clergymen as laymen they could conform as clergymen they could not and preached in separate churches only because the church having shut the door against them they thought themselves obliged as they were lawful ordained ministers not to desist from the work of their office though man had imposed some things on them which they could not comply with but that they were under an indispensible necessity to preach the gospel and to exercise their duty though they were silenced by the law  i think the third head is something of kin to the second for this is to show that the difference between the church of england and the dissenter is but little  i solemnly appeal to the searcher of all hearts that i am none of those who are for making the difference greater than it really is  and with the same sincerity i protest i wish it was not so great as it is and heartily wish i could conform wholly to the church  and i wish the church to try the sincerity of the dissenters would come to a temper abate us what without prejudice to doctrine or discipline might be abated and condescend so far to the tender consciences of us their weaker brethren that all the dissenters of a catholic spirit might come in and join with them  but as i would not make the difference wider so i cannot make it less i cannot bring my dissenting reasons to such punctilios and reduce them all to trifles without reproaching my self with a needless and unchristian separation for i cannot but say god forbid i should be found making or keeping up a breach in the christian union and charity of the church for little matters and divide in communion for trifles  our author says we agree in all the essentials of christianity and differ only in accidentals and the great things in which we agree should be more powerful to unite us than the lesser in which we differ should be to divide  i cannot think i do the author injustice if i say if this be true no man can justify dissenting from the church and if it be any thing but a strong argument for a constant conformity then i am at a loss to understand plain english  we agree in all the great things and differ only in small the great things in which we agree ought to be more powerful to make us conform than the small things should be to make us dissent that is we ought to conform  if this be true why do we not conform how can we justify our dissenting  they agree and none of them scruple a moderate episcopacy says our author  this i refer to the whole church of scotland who are all presbyterians and have suffered as much for a dissenting from prelacy as ever the church of england did for dissenting from popery if the english dissenters do not scruple episcopacy then i confess i am at a loss to know why we dissent  but then we are led to this argument by the word moderate dissenter and moderate episcopacy either this moderate dissenter is no dissenter or this moderate episcopacy is no episcopacy indeed the churchmen do look on archbishop ushers model to be no episcopacy at all  they agree in their public worship their prayers and praises are for substance the same says this author  witness say i their cathedral worship their choristers music singing their prayers their ecclesiastical jurisdictions chapters dignities vestments bowings to the altar and at the name of jesus their responses anthems exorcisms and a numberless variety of things the dissenter has no concern about in his worship  i wonder any gentleman of so much learning and candor can say our praises and prayers are the same for substance  nay even this very author employs very good reasons for our not complying with the liturgy nor thinking it lawful to impose forms upon the ministry and tie them up to them  the difference about ordination of ministers which this author is pleased to say is inconsiderable is the next and i cannot agree that this is a small difference and all he says on this head seems to me to be a good reason why the church should agree to allow an ordination by presbyters but no reason to satisfy the dissenter with episcopal ordination  i believe there are five reasons to be given why the church of england should allow and accept of an ordination by presbyters to one why the dissenter should submit to episcopal ordination  and if it be only this one it is a great one which even our author has quoted viz that ordination by presbyters without the diocesan is owned by the church of england to be orthodox in that great act of parliament by which the reformation was established in england in queen elizabeths time    eliz cap     what has been since has been imposed by the craft and for the private designs of states men in the church whose designs have been not to have the dissenters conform but to keep them rather the farther from conforming  as to the rest of this book i leave the churchmen to answer it if they can  as about the multitude of broils parties and contentions the church has within her self how inconsistent with her own canon and prescribed rules many of her members act these are most true and all the rest of his heads i readily grant as his fourth head that employing dissenters is so far from weakening that it strengthens the church  this he may more easily persuade me to believe than he will the churchmen of the high party who rail at it  fifth that occasional conformity is an advantage to the church and weakens the dissenters the latter i believe and therefore would not have the dissenter be concerned in it and wonder if the author believes so how he that is a dissenter can argue for the practice the dissenters ought to thank him for it  i doubt not but this occasional conforming of the dissenters in this age is a prologue to a total conformity in the next and leads our posterity to quit that dissenting wholly which they saw their fathers could quit as they found occasion and i desire him in his next to tell us what advantage it is any way to the dissenters  sixth that the late bill against occasional conformity would have been highly prejudicial to the church  i believe so and to the dissenters too and therefore the lords dismissed it as not proper by any means to pass into a law  his last argument that dissenters from national established churches have always been employed by most nations and governments i grant and he has effectually made it appear  but all this leaves the matter where we found it  that conforming to the church of england as it has been lately practiced by the dissenters for the qualifying themselves for places and employments in the government is a practice unwarrantable from the scripture pernicious to the dissenters themselves and will be fatal both to their reputation and interest  and though really occasional communion does not seem clear to me on any score whatever  yet this is out of doubt and the author i have been naming readily grants it me that though occasional conformity abstracted might be justified yet this is no justifiable occasion  since then the dispute will end as to this occasion those who are willing to be concerned in any further debate of it would do well to lay down what occasions are sufficient to justify conforming to the church and what circumstances are required to such an occasion that the honest conscientious occasional conformist if such a man can be may be distinguished from the hypocrite and the whole party may not bear the reproach  and because this point has never been yielded before i cannot dismiss it without some remarks which i judge natural from the premises and necessary to the circumstance  as first it is apparent many of the dissenters who have thus conformed have never in the whole course of their lives conformed before no not when persecuted by the church of england have suffered imprisonment confiscation of goods and several other public oppressions and never would conform but when invited to places of honor or profit have complied thinking the obtaining a good place a sufficient occasion to invite them when neither the laws nor the persecution it self could be thought an occasion to compel  now if as is owned moderation a virtue p   this be a reproach to religion and offensive to all good christians then they ought to avoid the practice or to regulate it so as that it may not appear to be done merely as a qualification  another remark i cannot but make that if occasional conformity be lawful then it cannot be true as too many have said that this dispute will bring persecution upon the dissenters  for it is no breach of charity to say none of those gentlemen who can voluntarily conform will ever suffer persecution for not conforming and this confirms the ill actings of those who did suffer before and conformed afterward for it is plain by their suffering their consciences were against it before and it is as plain by their complying that the advantage smothered the scruple  a man can by no possible arguing justify suffering persecution for that which he can with a satisfied conscience comply with if thereforo a hot persecution should come on the dissenters which god forbid occasional communion secures all those who can comply for if to avoid persecution be not a justifiable occasion i know very few occasions which can be justified  and it is for this reason i would entreat those gentlemen to let us know what are justifiable occasions and what are not  now as our author has furnished us out of history with a great many excellent precedents for the employing dissenters both in the governments and armies of those nations where they dwelt  i wish with all my heart he had pleased to examine history for all those glorious instances of the confessors and martyrs of all ages who have sacrificed their lives even for the rejecting the most minute articles of conformity upon the most pressing and extraordinary occasions  i shall rather recommend my reader to the histories where such instances are to be found than trouble him with a long transcription of the particulars  let them who are curious in this search examine the martyrologies of the church from its first institution and first let him but view the young maccabees and their wonderful mother and when the tortures they endured are considered let them also consider what was the occasion only refusing to eat a bit of swines flesh nay they would have excused them if they would but have suffered them to put it into their mouths by force which they would not endure but as soon as it was attempted spit it out in the very faces of their tormentors and died rather than be guilty of occasional conformity  let such men remember origin who having been guilty of occasional conformity only in the most passive manner he possibly could as but suffering the heathen priest to put a little frankincense into his hand and dropping it into the fire not so much as owning it to be a sacrifice much less owning the idol to be a god and see his repentance how many years was he left in the agonies of despair and how does he bemoan himself on that account calling himself apostate from christ and unworthy of martyrdom  the primitive history of the church gives us innumerable instances of the constancy and exactness of the christians in this point  and i only forbear to enumerate them because they are to be found in the first vol of foxs acts and monuments of the church in eusebius and in all the historians of those times  but it may be answered that this was a conformity to what was absolutely unlawful idolatrous and abominable which is not to be alleged here  to this i rejoin he that dissents from the church of england does it because he cannot in conscience comply or else he can have no justifiable reason for dissenting now all things are unlawful to him which his conscience is not satisfied about and though not equally abominable are so much so as that no man can comply with them safely but to obviate the objection wholly we will come nearer to the present case  the church of england to her glory be it spoken is founded in the numerous throng of blessed martyrs and confessors who have left their memory and example as a lasting testimony against occasional conformity even in the small and some of them indifferent things  blessed bishop hooper when he came to the stake to seal with his blood the testimony of his faith and when in the last agonies of his life the queens pardon was offered upon terms very much short of a total conformity only to set his hand to an acknowledgement cried out before it was read if you love my soul away with it  let us now look abroad in times more modern and within our memory and what are all the new converts as they are called in france but occasional conformist  the fire of persecution having burnt up the protestant church all those who could not stand the brunt not make their escape or such whose religion had not force enough with them to make them suffer the loss of all what did they do they fly to this very refuge occasional conformity and if the arguments are examined they are much the same with ours  the protestants do not deny but it is possible to be saved in the roman church and they may upon occasion therefore conform in some things while at the same time they reserve their minds and hearts entirely to the true worship and naaman the syrian say they was such an occasional conformist to whom the prophet gave a tacit license when upon the proposal he replied go in peace  here is the only instance of occasional conformity which exactly reaches our case that i remember and i see nothing can be said to justify ours which may not justify theirs only that indeed the difference is not so great between protestant and protestant as between protestant and roman catholic  but if the difference here be great enough to justify a dissenting for conscience sake the argument is the same  the case of kneeling in the street when the roman processions come by is as parallel to our imposed ceremonies as any thing in two different religions can be and yet thus they occasionally conform and please themselves with fancying that they do not do it as an act of worship but our martyrs in queen marys time frequently sacrificed their blood on more minute circumstances than that as not suffering a child to be baptized though by force in the case of mr glover mrs lane john field throwing down the rood of dover court and the like  now let any man examine the occasional conformity of the hugonots in france and tell me if the consequence is not very probable to be this that one age may make all their posterity roman catholics vice versa  and what is the opinion their brethren who are in banishment have of them come les persons qu on avez vendue leur religion as persons that have sold their religion people who have tainted their principles and testified that they cannot part with their estates to preserve their consciences  they are still protestants on their inclination and they please themselves that this conformity is justified by the occasion of it and let them that like it follow their example  i am not concerned here to prove that the church of rome is no true church that popery is idolatry and that the cases therefore do not agree the dissenting in both cases is for conscience sake and therein the cases are parallel we were once all of the roman church and had never removed from thence but from scruples of conscience and we are now dissenters from the church of england from scruple of conscience we own the church of england to be a true church and we do not deny salvation to the members of the roman there are things in the church of england we cannot comply with and there are some things in the church of rome which we could comply with but there are things in both we dissent from and occasional conformity to those very things can be justified from very few reasons on one side which will not hold good on the other  this in short then is the plain conclusion of this matter occasional conformity to a church from which we have separated and in those things for which we separated viz communion does not appear to be lawful or justifiable in a dissenter nor are there any precedents for it in the scripture  but occasional conformity being practiced as a qualification for civil employments is a reproach to religion and scandalous to the dissenters  the last is fairly acknowledged by the author of moderation a virtue and i think the first is made plain in these sheets  of the whole argument then this is the sum    those dissenters who are yet of the opinion it is not unlawful in it self should take care to practice it so as that those circumstances of qualification may not be suspected    they should state what are sufficient occasions to justifye our conforming to what at other times we have dissented from and give us scripture authorities to prove them    they ought to let us see how they can justifye dissenting at all if they can defend conforming again    they ought to prove that the conformity or occasional conformity as they call it of christ and the apostles was to such things as were merely of mans appointment or purely to such as were divine or whether they conformed to any thing they dissented from before  but till some of these points are settled i cannot but think the whole practice of it a scandal to the dissenters ruinous to their interest and tends to the reducing them all or their posterity at least to an absolute total conformity or at best a general indifferency in matters of religion  finis
