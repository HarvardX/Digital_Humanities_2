three shillings and fourpence a bushel  an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations book iv of systems of political economy introduction political economy considered as a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator proposes two distinct objects first to provide a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people or more properly to enable them to provide such a revenue or subsistence for themselves and secondly to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue sufficient for the public services it proposes to enrich both the people and the sovereign  the different progress of opulence in different ages and nations has given occasion to two different systems of political economy with regard to enriching the people the one may be called the system of commerce the other that of agriculture i shall endeavor to explain both as fully and distinctly as i can and shall begin with the system of commerce it is the modern system and is best understood in our own country and in our own times  chap i of the principle of the commercial or mercantile system that wealth consists in money or in gold and silver is a popular notion which naturally arises from the double function of money as the instrument of commerce and as the measure of value in consequence of its being the instrument of commerce when we have money we can more readily obtain whatever else we have occasion for than by means of any other commodity the great affair we always find is to get money when that is obtained there is no difficulty in making any subsequent purchase in consequence of its being the measure of value we estimate that of all other commodities by the quantity of money which they will exchange for we say of a rich man that he is worth a great deal and of a poor man that he is worth very little money a frugal man or a man eager to be rich is said to love money and a careless a generous or a profuse man is said to be indifferent about it to grow rich is to get money and wealth and money in short are in common language considered as in every respect synonymous  a rich country in the same manner as a rich man is supposed to be a country abounding in money and to heap up gold and silver in any country is supposed to be the readiest way to enrich it for some time after the discovery of america the first enquiry of the spaniards when they arrived upon any unknown coast used to be if there was any gold or silver to be found in the neighborhood by the information which they received they judged whether it was worth while to make a settlement there or if the country was worth the conquering plano carpino a monk sent ambassador from the king of france to one of the sons of the famous gengis khan says that the tartars used frequently to ask him if there was plenty of sheep and oxen in the kingdom of france their enquiry had the same object with that of the spaniards they wanted to know if the country was rich enough to be worth the conquering among the tartars as among all other nations of shepherds who are generally ignorant of the use of money cattle are the instruments of commerce and the measures of value wealth therefore according to them consisted in cattle as according to the spaniards it consisted in gold and silver of the two the tartar notion perhaps was the nearest to the truth  mr lock remarks a distinction between money and other moveable goods all other moveable goods he says are of so consumable a nature that the wealth which consists in them cannot be much depended on and a nation which abounds in them one year may without any exportation but merely by their own waste and extravagance be in great want of them the next money on the contrary is a steady friend which though it may travel about from hand to hand yet if it can be kept from going out of the country is not very liable to be wasted and consumed gold and silver therefore are according to him the most solid and substantial part of the moveable wealth of a nation and to multiply those metals ought he thinks upon that account to be the great object of its political economy  others admit that if a nation could be separated from all the world it would be of no consequence how much or how little money circulated in it the consumable goods which were circulated by means of this money would only be exchanged for a greater or a smaller number of pieces but the real wealth or poverty of the country they allow would depend altogether upon the abundance or scarcity of those consumable goods but it is otherwise they think with countries which have connections with foreign nations and which are obliged to carry on foreign wars and to maintain fleets and armies in distant countries this they say cannot be done but by sending abroad money to pay them with and a nation cannot send much money abroad unless it has a good deal at home every such nation therefore must endeavor in time of peace to accumulate gold and silver that when occasion requires it may have wherewithal to carry on foreign wars  in consequence of these popular notions all the different nations of europe have studied though to little purpose every possible means of accumulating gold and silver in their respective countries spain and portugal the proprietors of the principal mines which supply europe with those metals have either prohibited their exportation under the severest penalties or subjected it to a considerable duty the like prohibition seems anciently to have made a part of the policy of most other european nations it is even to be found where we should expect least of all to find it in some old scotch acts of parliament which forbid under heavy penalties the carrying gold or silver forth of the kingdom the like policy anciently took place both in france and england  when those countries became commercial the merchants found this prohibition upon many occasions extremely inconvenient they could frequently buy more advantageously with gold and silver than with any other commodity the foreign goods which they wanted either to import into their own or to carry to some other foreign country they remonstrated therefore against this prohibition as hurtful to trade  they represented first that the exportation of gold and silver in order to purchase foreign goods did not always diminish the quantity of those metals in the kingdom that on the contrary it might frequently increase it because if the consumption of foreign goods was not thereby increased in the country those goods might be reexported to foreign countries and being there sold for a large profit might bring back much more treasure than was originally sent out to purchase them mr mun compares this operation of foreign trade to the seed time and harvest of agriculture if we only behold says he the actions of the husbandman in the seed time when he casts away much good corn into the ground we shall account him rather a madman than a husbandman but when we consider his labors in the harvest which is the end of his endeavors we shall find the worth and plentiful increase of his actions  they represented secondly that this prohibition could not hinder the exportation of gold and silver which on account of the smallness of their bulk in proportion to their value could easily be smuggled abroad that this exportation could only be prevented by a proper attention to what they called the balance of trade that when the country exported to a greater value than it imported a balance became due to it from foreign nations which was necessarily paid to it in gold and silver and thereby increased the quantity of those metals in the kingdom but that when it imported to a greater value than it exported a contrary balance became due to foreign nations which was necessarily paid to them in the same manner and thereby diminished that quantity that in this case to prohibit the exportation of those metals could not prevent it but only by making it more dangerous render it more expensive that the exchange was thereby turned more against the country which owed the balance than it otherwise might have been the merchant who purchased a bill upon the foreign country being obliged to pay the banker who sold it not only for the natural risk trouble and expense of sending the money thither but for the extraordinary risk arising from the prohibition but that the more the exchange was against any country the more the balance of trade became necessarily against it the money of that country becoming necessarily of so much less value in comparison with that of the country to which the balance was due that if the exchange between england and holland for example was five per cent against england it would require a hundred and five ounces of silver in england to purchase a bill for a hundred ounces of silver in holland that a hundred and five ounces of silver in england therefore would be worth only a hundred ounces of silver in holland and would purchase only a proportionable quantity of dutch goods but that a hundred ounces of silver in holland on the contrary would be worth a hundred and five ounces in england and would purchase a proportionable quantity of english goods that the english goods which were sold to holland would be sold so much cheaper and the dutch goods which were sold to england so much dearer by the difference of the exchange that the one would draw so much less dutch money to england and the other so much more english money to holland as this difference amounted to and that the balance of trade therefore would necessarily be so much more against england and would require a greater balance of gold and silver to be exported to holland  those arguments were partly solid and partly sophistical they were solid so far as they asserted that the exportation of gold and silver in trade might frequently be advantageous to the country they were solid too in asserting that no prohibition could prevent their exportation when private people found any advantage in exporting them but they were sophistical in supposing that either to preserve or to augment the quantity of those metals required more the attention of government than to preserve or to augment the quantity of any other useful commodities which the freedom of trade without any such attention never fails to supply in the proper quantity they were sophistical too perhaps in asserting that the high price of exchange necessarily increased what they called the unfavourable balance of trade or occasioned the exportation of a greater quantity of gold and silver that high price indeed was extremely disadvantageous to the merchants who had any money to pay in foreign countries they paid so much dearer for the bills which their bankers granted them upon those countries but though the risk arising from the prohibition might occasion some extraordinary expense to the bankers it would not necessarily carry any more money out of the country this expense would generally be all laid out in the country in smuggling the money out of it and could seldom occasion the exportation of a single sixpence beyond the precise sum drawn for the high price of exchange too would naturally dispose the merchants to endeavor to make their exports nearly balance their imports in order that they might have this high exchange to pay upon as small a sum as possible the high price of exchange therefore would tend not to increase but to diminish what they called the unfavourable balance of trade and consequently the exportation of gold and silver  such as they were however those arguments convinced the people to whom they were addressed they were addressed by merchants to parliaments and to the councils of princes to nobles and to country gentlemen by those who were supposed to understand trade to those who were conscious to themselves that they knew nothing about the matter that foreign trade enriched the country experience demonstrated to the nobles and country gentlemen as well as to the merchants but how or in what manner none of them well knew the merchants knew perfectly in what manner it enriched themselves it was their business to know it but to know in what manner it enriched the country was no part of their business this subject never came into their consideration but when they had occasion to apply to their country for some change in the laws relating to foreign trade it then became necessary to say something about the beneficial effects of foreign trade and the manner in which those effects were obstructed by the laws as they then stood to the judges who were to decide the business it appeared a most satisfactory account of the matter when they were told that foreign trade brought money into the country but that the laws in question hindered it from bringing so much as it otherwise would do those arguments therefore produced the wishedfor effect the prohibition of exporting gold and silver was in france and england confined to the coin of those respective countries the exportation of foreign coin and of bullion was made free in holland and in some other places this liberty was extended even to the coin of the country the attention of government was turned away from guarding against the exportation of gold and silver to watch over the balance of trade as the only cause which could occasion any augmentation or diminution of those metals from one fruitless care it was turned away to another care much more intricate much more embarrassing and just equally fruitless the title of muns book englands treasure in foreign trade became a fundamental maxim in the political economy not of england only but of all other commercial countries the inland or home trade the most important of all the trade in which an equal capital affords the greatest revenue and creates the greatest employment to the people of the country was considered as subsidiary only to foreign trade it neither brought money into the country it was said nor carried any out of it the country therefore could never become either richer or poorer by means of it except so far as its prosperity or decay might indirectly influence the state of foreign trade  a country that has no mines of its own must undoubtedly draw its gold and silver from foreign countries in the same manner as one that has no vineyards of its own must draw its wines it does not seem necessary however that the attention of government should be more turned toward the one than toward the other object a country that has wherewithal to buy wine will always get the wine which it has occasion for and a country that has wherewithal to buy gold and silver will never be in want of those metals they are to be bought for a certain price like all other commodities and as they are the price of all other commodities so all other commodities are the price of those metals we trust with perfect security that the freedom of trade without any attention of government will always supply us with the wine which we have occasion for and we may trust with equal security that it will always supply us with all the gold and silver which we can afford to purchase or to employ either in circulating our commodities or in other uses  the quantity of every commodity which human industry can either purchase or produce naturally regulates itself in every country according to the effectual demand or according to the demand of those who are willing to pay the whole rent labor and profits which must be paid in order to prepare and bring it to market but no commodities regulate themselves more easily or more exactly according to this effectual demand than gold and silver because on account of the small bulk and great value of those metals no commodities can be more easily transported from one place to another from the places where they are cheap to those where they are dear from the places where they exceed to those where they fall short of this effectual demand if there was in england for example an effectual demand for an additional quantity of gold a packetboat could bring from lisbon or from wherever else it was to be had fifty tuns of gold which could be coined into more than five millions of guineas but if there was an effectual demand for grain to the same value to import it would require at five guineas a tun a million of tuns of shipping or a thousand ships of a thousand tuns each the navy of england would not be sufficient  when the quantity of gold and silver imported into any country exceeds the effectual demand no vigilance of government can prevent their exportation all the sanguinary laws of spain and portugal are not able to keep their gold and silver at home the continual importations from peru and brazil exceed the effectual demand of those countries and sink the price of those metals there below that in the neighboring countries if on the contrary in any particular country their quantity fell short of the effectual demand so as to raise their price above that in the neighboring countries the government would have no occasion to take any pains to import them if it was even to take pains to prevent their importation it would not be able to effectuate it those metals when the spartans had got wherewithal to purchase them broke through all the barriers which the laws of lycurgus opposed to their entrance into lacedemon all the sanguinary laws of the customs are not able to prevent the importation of the teas of the dutch and gottenburg east india companies because somewhat cheaper than those of the british company a pound of tea however is about a hundred times the bulk of one of the highest prices sixteen shillings that is commonly paid for it in silver and more than two thousand times the bulk of the same price in gold and consequently just so many times more difficult to smuggle  it is partly owing to the easy transportation of gold and silver from the places where they abound to those where they are wanted that the price of those metals does not fluctuate continually like that of the greater part of other commodities which are hindered by their bulk from shifting their situation when the market happens to be either over or understocked with them the price of those metals indeed is not altogether exempted from variation but the changes to which it is liable are generally slow gradual and uniform in europe for example it is supposed without much foundation perhaps that during the course of the present and preceding century they have been constantly but gradually sinking in their value on account of the continual importations from the spanish west indies but to make any sudden change in the price of gold and silver so as to raise or lower at once sensibly and remarkably the money price of all other commodities requires such a revolution in commerce as that occasioned by the discovery of america  if notwithstanding all this gold and silver should at any time fall short in a country which has wherewithal to purchase them there are more expedients for supplying their place than that of almost any other commodity if the materials of manufacture are wanted industry must stop if provisions are wanted the people must starve but if money is wanted barter will supply its place though with a good deal of inconveniency buying and selling upon credit and the different dealers compensating their credits with one another once a month or once a year will supply it with less inconveniency a well regulated paper money will supply it not only without any inconveniency but with very great advantages upon every account therefore the attention of government never was so unnecessarily employed as when directed to watch over the preservation or increase of the quantity of money in any country  no complaint however is more common than that of a scarcity of money money like wine must always be scarce with those who have neither wherewithal to buy it nor credit to borrow it those who have either will seldom be in want either of the money or of the wine which they have occasion for this complaint however of the scarcity of money is not always confined to improvident spendthrifts it is sometimes general through a whole mercantile town and the country in its neighborhood overtrading is the common cause of it sober men whose projects have been disproportioned to their capitals are as likely to have neither wherewithal to buy money nor credit to borrow it as prodigals whose expense has been disproportioned to their revenue before their projects can be brought to bear their stock is gone and their credit with it they run about everywhere to borrow money and every body tells them that they have none to lend even such general complaints of the scarcity of money do not always prove that the usual number of gold and silver pieces are not circulating in the country but that many people want those pieces who have nothing to give for them when the profits of trade happen to be greater than ordinary overtrading becomes a general error both among great and small dealers they do not always send more money abroad than usual but they buy upon credit both at home and abroad an unusual quantity of goods which they send to some distant market in hopes that the returns will come in before the demand for payment the demand comes before the returns and they have nothing at hand with which they can either purchase money or give solid security for borrowing it is not any scarcity of gold and silver but the difficulty which such people find in borrowing and which their creditors find in getting payment that occasions the general complaint of the scarcity of money  it would be too ridiculous to go about seriously to prove that wealth does not consist in money or in gold and silver but in what money purchases and is valuable only for purchasing money no doubt makes always a part of the national capital but it has already been shown that it generally makes but a small part and always the most unprofitable part of it  it is not because wealth consists more essentially in money than in goods that the merchant finds it generally more easy to buy goods with money than to buy money with goods but because money is the known and established instrument of commerce for which every thing is readily given in exchange but which is not always with equal readiness to be got in exchange for every thing the greater part of goods besides are more perishable than money and he may frequently sustain a much greater loss by keeping them when his goods are upon hand too he is more liable to such demands for money as he may not be able to answer than when he has got their price in his coffers over and above all this his profit arises more directly from selling than from buying and he is upon all these accounts generally much more anxious to exchange his goods for money than his money for goods but though a particular merchant with abundance of goods in his warehouse may sometimes be ruined by not being able to sell them in time a nation or country is not liable to the same accident the whole capital of a merchant frequently consists in perishable goods destined for purchasing money but it is but a very small part of the annual produce of the land and labor of a country which can ever be destined for purchasing gold and silver from their neighbors the far greater part is circulated and consumed among themselves and even of the surplus which is sent abroad the greater part is generally destined for the purchase of other foreign goods though gold and silver therefore could not be had in exchange for the goods destined to purchase them the nation would not be ruined it might indeed suffer some loss and inconveniency and be forced upon some of those expedients which are necessary for supplying the place of money the annual produce of its land and labor however would be the same or very nearly the same as usual because the same or very nearly the same consumable capital would be employed in maintaining it and though goods do not always draw money so readily as money draws goods in the longrun they draw it more necessarily than even it draws them goods can serve many other purposes besides purchasing money but money can serve no other purpose besides purchasing goods money therefore necessarily runs after goods but goods do not always or necessarily run after money the man who buys does not always mean to sell again but frequently to use or to consume whereas he who sells always means to buy again the one may frequently have done the whole but the other can never have done more than the onehalf of his business it is not for its own sake that men desire money but for the sake of what they can purchase with it  consumable commodities it is said are soon destroyed whereas gold and silver are of a more durable nature and were it not for this continual exportation might be accumulated for ages together to the incredible augmentation of the real wealth of the country nothing therefore it is pretended can be more disadvantageous to any country than the trade which consists in the exchange of such lasting for such perishable commodities we do not however reckon that trade disadvantageous which consists in the exchange of the hardware of england for the wines of france and yet hardware is a very durable commodity and was it not for this continual exportation might too be accumulated for ages together to the incredible augmentation of the pots and pans of the country but it readily occurs that the number of such utensils is in every country necessarily limited by the use which there is for them that it would be absurd to have more pots and pans than were necessary for cooking the victuals usually consumed there and that if the quantity of victuals were to increase the number of pots and pans would readily increase along with it a part of the increased quantity of victuals being employed in purchasing them or in maintaining an additional number of workmen whose business it was to make them it should as readily occur that the quantity of gold and silver is in every country limited by the use which there is for those metals that their use consists in circulating commodities as coin and in affording a species of household furniture as plate that the quantity of coin in every country is regulated by the value of the commodities which are to be circulated by it increase that value and immediately a part of it will be sent abroad to purchase wherever it is to be had the additional quantity of coin requisite for circulating them that the quantity of plate is regulated by the number and wealth of those private families who choose to indulge themselves in that sort of magnificence increase the number and wealth of such families and a part of this increased wealth will most probably be employed in purchasing wherever it is to be found an additional quantity of plate that to attempt to increase the wealth of any country either by introducing or by detaining in it an unnecessary quantity of gold and silver is as absurd as it would be to attempt to increase the good cheer of private families by obliging them to keep an unnecessary number of kitchen utensils as the expense of purchasing those unnecessary utensils would diminish instead of increasing either the quantity or goodness of the family provisions so the expense of purchasing an unnecessary quantity of gold and silver must in every country as necessarily diminish the wealth which feeds clothes and lodges which maintains and employs the people gold and silver whether in the shape of coin or of plate are utensils it must be remembered as much as the furniture of the kitchen increase the use for them increase the consumable commodities which are to be circulated managed and prepared by means of them and you will infallibly increase the quantity but if you attempt by extraordinary means to increase the quantity you will as infallibly diminish the use and even the quantity too which in those metals can never be greater than what the use requires were they ever to be accumulated beyond this quantity their transportation is so easy and the loss which attends their lying idle and unemployed so great that no law could prevent their being immediately sent out of the country  it is not always necessary to accumulate gold and silver in order to enable a country to carry on foreign wars and to maintain fleets and armies in distant countries fleets and armies are maintained not with gold and silver but with consumable goods the nation which from the annual produce of its domestic industry from the annual revenue arising out of its lands labor and consumable stock has wherewithal to purchase those consumable goods in distant countries can maintain foreign wars there  a nation may purchase the pay and provisions of an army in a distant country three different ways by sending abroad either first some part of its accumulated gold and silver or secondly some part of the annual produce of its manufactures or last of all some part of its annual rude produce  the gold and silver which can properly be considered as accumulated or stored up in any country may be distinguished into three parts first the circulating money secondly the plate of private families and last of all the money which may have been collected by many years parsimony and laid up in the treasury of the prince  it can seldom happen that much can be spared from the circulating money of the country because in that there can seldom be much redundancy the value of goods annually bought and sold in any country requires a certain quantity of money to circulate and distribute them to their proper consumers and can give employment to no more the channel of circulation necessarily draws to itself a sum sufficient to fill it and never admits any more something however is generally withdrawn from this channel in the case of foreign war by the great number of people who are maintained abroad fewer are maintained at home fewer goods are circulated there and less money becomes necessary to circulate them an extraordinary quantity of paper money of some sort or other too such as exchequer notes navy bills and bank bills in england is generally issued upon such occasions and by supplying the place of circulating gold and silver gives an opportunity of sending a greater quantity of it abroad all this however could afford but a poor resource for maintaining a foreign war of great expense and several years duration  the melting down the plate of private families has upon every occasion been found a still more insignificant one the french in the beginning of the last war did not derive so much advantage from this expedient as to compensate the loss of the fashion  the accumulated treasures of the prince have in former times afforded a much greater and more lasting resource in the present times if you except the king of prussia to accumulate treasure seems to be no part of the policy of european princes  the funds which maintained the foreign wars of the present century the most expensive perhaps which history records seem to have had little dependency upon the exportation either of the circulating money or of the plate of private families or of the treasure of the prince the last french war cost great britain upwards of ninety millions including not only the seventyfive millions of new debt that was contracted but the additional two shillings in the pound land tax and what was annually borrowed of the sinking fund more than twothirds of this expense was laid out in distant countries in germany portugal america in the ports of the mediterranean in the east and west indies the kings of england had no accumulated treasure we never heard of any extraordinary quantity of plate being melted down the circulating gold and silver of the country had not been supposed to exceed eighteen millions since the late recoinage of the gold however it is believed to have been a good deal underrated let us suppose therefore according to the exaggerated computation of mr horsely that gold and silver together it amounted to thirty millions had the war been carried on by means of our money the whole of it must even according to this computation have been sent out and returned again at least twice in a period of between six and seven years should this be supposed it would afford the most decisive argument to demonstrate how unnecessary it is for government to watch over the preservation of money since upon this supposition the whole money of the country must have gone from it and returned to it again two different times in so short a period without any bodys knowing any thing of the matter the channel of circulation however never appeared more empty than usual during any part of this period few people wanted money who had wherewithal to pay for it the profits of foreign trade indeed were greater than usual during the whole war but especially toward the end of it this occasioned what it always occasions a general overtrading in all the ports of great britain and this again occasioned the usual complaint of the scarcity of money which always follows overtrading many people wanted it who had neither wherewithal to buy it nor credit to borrow it and because the debtors found it difficult to borrow the creditors found it difficult to get payment gold and silver however were generally to be had for their value by those who had that value to give for them  the enormous expense of the late war therefore must have been chiefly defrayed not by the exportation of gold and silver but by that of british commodities of some kind or other when the government or those who acted under them contracted with a merchant for a remittance to some foreign country he would naturally endeavor to pay his foreign correspondent upon whom he had granted a bill by sending abroad rather commodities than gold and silver if the commodities of great britain were not in demand in that country he would endeavor to send them to some other country in which he could purchase a bill upon that country the transportation of commodities when properly fuited to the market is always attended with a considerable profit whereas that of gold and silver is scarce ever attended with any when those metals are sent abroad in order to purchase foreign commodities the merchants profit arises not from the purchase but from the sale of the returns but when they are sent abroad merely to pay a debt he gets no returns and consequently no profit he naturally therefore exerts his invention to find out a way of paying his foreign debts rather by the exportation of commodities than by that of gold and silver the great quantity of british goods exported during the course of the late war without bringing back any returns is accordingly remarked by the author of the present state of the nation  besides the three sorts of gold and silver above mentioned there is in all great commercial countries a good deal of bullion alternately imported and exported for the purposes of foreign trade this bullion as it circulates among different commercial countries in the same manner as the national coin circulates in every particular country may be considered as the money of the great mercantile republic the national coin receives its movement and direction from the commodities circulated within the precincts of each particular country the money of the mercantile republic from those circulated between different countries both are employed in facilitating exchanges the one between different individuals of the same the other between those of different nations part of this money of the great mercantile republic may have been and probably was employed in carrying on the late war in time of a general war it is natural to suppose that a movement and direction should be impressed upon it different from what it usually follows in profound peace that it should circulate more about the seat of the war and be more employed in purchasing there and in the neighboring countries the pay and provisions of the different armies but whatever part of this money of the mercantile republic great britain may have annually employed in this manner it must have been annually purchased either with british commodities or with something else that had been purchased with them which still brings us back to commodities to the annual produce of the land and labor of the country as the ultimate resources which enabled us to carry on the war it is natural indeed to suppose that so great an annual expense must have been defrayed from a great annual produce the expense of      for example amounted to more than nineteen millions no accumulation could have supported so great an annual profusion there is no annual produce even of gold and silver which could have supported it the whole gold and silver annually imported into both spain and portugal according to the best accounts does not commonly much exceed six millions sterling which in some years would scarce have paid four months expense of the late war  the commodities most proper for being transported to distant countries in order to purchase there either the pay and provisions of an army or some part of the money of the mercantile republic to be employed in purchasing them seem to be the finer and more improved manufactures such as contain a great value in a small bulk and can therefore be exported to a great distance at little expense a country whose industry produces a great annual surplus of such manufactures which are usually exported to foreign countries may carry on for many years a very expensive foreign war without either exporting any considerable quantity of gold and silver or even having any such quantity to export a considerable part of the annual surplus of its manufactures must indeed in this case be exported without bringing back any returns some part of it however may still continue to bring back a return the manufacturers during the war will have a double demand upon them and be called upon first to work up goods to be sent abroad for paying the bills drawn upon foreign countries for the pay and provisions of the army and secondly to work up such as are necessary for purchasing the common returns that had usually been consumed in the country in the midst of the most destructive foreign war therefore the greater part of manufactures may frequently flourish greatly and on the contrary they may decline on the return of the peace they may flourish amidst the ruin of their country and begin to decay upon the return of its prosperity the different state of many different branches of the british manufactures during the late war and for some time after the peace may serve as an illustration of what has been just now said  no foreign war of great expense or duration could conveniently be carried on by the exportation of the rude produce of the soil the expense of sending such a quantity of it to a foreign country as might purchase the pay and provisions of an army would be too great few countries too produce much more rude produce than what is sufficient for the subsistence of their own inhabitants to send abroad any great quantity of it therefore would be to send abroad a part of the necessary subsistence of the people it is otherwise with the exportation of manufactures the maintenance of the people employed in them is kept at home and only the surplus part of their work is exported mr hume frequently takes notice of the inability of the ancient kings of england to carry on without interruption any foreign war of long duration the english in those days had nothing wherewithal to purchase the pay and provisions of their armies in foreign countries but either the rude produce of the soil of which no considerable part could be spared from the home consumption or a few manufactures of the coarsest kind of which as well as of the rude produce the transportation was too expensive this inability did not arise from the want of money but of the finer and more improved manufactures buying and selling was transacted by means of money in england then as well as now the quantity of circulating money must have borne the same proportion to the number and value of purchases and sales usually transacted at that time which it does to those transacted at present or rather it must have borne a greater proportion because there was then no paper which now occupies a great part of the employment of gold and silver among nations to whom commerce and manufactures are little known the sovereign upon extraordinary occasions can seldom draw any considerable aid from his subjects for reasons which shall be explained hereafter it is in such countries therefore that he generally endeavors to accumulate a treasure as the only resource against such emergencies independent of this necessity he is in such a situation naturally disposed to the parsimony requisite for accumulation in that simple state the expense even of a sovereign is not directed by the vanity which delights in the gaudy finery of a court but is employed in bounty to his tenants and hospitality to his retainers but bounty and hospitality very seldom lead to extravagance though vanity almost always does every tartar chief accordingly has a treasure the treasures of mazepa chief of the cossacks in the ukraine the famous ally of charles the xiith are said to have been very great the french kings of the merovingian race had all treasures when they divided their kingdom among their different children they divided their treasure too the saxon princes and the first kings after the conquest seem likewise to have accumulated treasures the first exploit of every new reign was commonly to seize the treasure of the preceding king as the most essential measure for securing the succession the sovereigns of improved and commercial countries are not under the same necessity of accumulating treasures because they can generally draw from their subjects extraordinary aids upon extraordinary occasions they are likewise less disposed to do so they naturally perhaps necessarily follow the mode of the times and their expense comes to be regulated by the same extravagant vanity which directs that of all the other great proprietors in their dominions the insignificant pageantry of their court becomes every day more brilliant and the expense of it not only prevents accumulation but frequently encroaches upon the funds destined for more necessary expenses what dercyllidas said of the court of persia may be applied to that of several european princes that he saw there much splendour but little strength and many servants but few soldiers  the importation of gold and silver is not the principal much less the sole benefit which a nation derives from its foreign trade between whatever places foreign trade is carried on they all of them derive two distinct benefits from it it carries out that surplus part of the produce of their land and labor for which there is no demand among them and brings back in return for it something else for which there is a demand it gives a value to their superfluities by exchanging them for something else which may satisfy a part of their wants and increase their enjoyments by means of it the narrowness of the home market does not hinder the division of labor in any particular branch of art or manufacture from being carried to the highest perfection by opening a more extensive market for whatever part of the produce of their labor may exceed the home consumption it encourages them to improve its productive powers and to augment its annual produce to the utmost and thereby increase the real revenue and wealth of the society these great and important services foreign trade is continually occupied in performing to all the different countries between which it is carried on they all derive great benefit from it though that in which the merchant resides generally derives the greatest as he is generally more employed in supplying the wants and carrying out the superfluities of his own than of any other particular country to import the gold and silver which may be wanted into the countries which have no mines is no doubt a part of the business of foreign commerce it is however a most insignificant part of it a country which carried on foreign trade merely upon this account could scarce have occasion to freight a ship in a century  it is not by the importation of gold and silver that the discovery of america has enriched europe by the abundance of the american mines those metals have become cheaper a service of plate can now be purchased for about a third part of the corn or a third part of the labor which it would have cost in the fifteenth century with the same annual expense of labor and commodities europe can annually purchase about three times the quantity of plate which it could have purchased at that time but when a commodity comes to be sold for a third part of what had been its usual price not only those who purchased it before can purchase three times their former quantity but it is brought down to the level of a much greater number of purchasers perhaps to more than ten perhaps to more than twenty times the former number so that there may be in europe at present not only more than three times but more than twenty or thirty times the quantity of plate which would have been in it even in its present state of improvement had the discovery of the american mines never been made so far europe has no doubt gained a real convenience though surely a very trifling one the cheapness of gold and silver renders those metals rather less fit for the purposes of money than they were before in order to make the same purchases we must load ourselves with a greater quantity of them and carry about a shilling in our pocket where a groat would have done before it is difficult to say which is most trifling this inconveniency or the opposite convenience neither the one nor the other could have made any very essential change in the state of europe the discovery of america however certainly made a most essential one by opening a new and inexhaustible market to all the commodities of europe it gave occasion to new divisions of labor and improvements of art which in the narrow circle of the ancient commerce could never have taken place for want of a market to take off the greater part of their produce the productive powers of labor were improved and its produce increased in all the different countries of europe and together with it the real revenue and wealth of the inhabitants the commodities of europe were almost all new to america and many of those of america were new to europe a new set of exchanges therefore began to take place which had never been thought of before and which should naturally have proved as advantageous to the new as it certainly did to the old continent the savage injustice of the europeans rendered an event which ought to have been beneficial to all ruinous and destructive to several of those unfortunate countries  the discovery of a passage to the east indies by the cape of good hope which happened much about the same time opened perhaps a still more extensive range to foreign commerce than even that of america notwithstanding the greater distance there were but two nations in america in any respect superior to savages and these were destroyed almost as soon as discovered the rest were mere savages but the empires of china indostan japan as well as several others in the east indies without having richer mines of gold or silver were in every other respect much richer better cultivated and more advanced in all arts and manufactures than either mexico or peru even though we should credit what plainly deserves no credit the exaggerated accounts of the spanish writers concerning the ancient state of those empires but rich and civilized nations can always exchange to a much greater value with one another than with savages and barbarians europe however has hitherto derived much less advantage from its commerce with the east indies than from that with america the portuguese monopolised the east india trade to themselves for about a century and it was only indirectly and through them that the other nations of europe could either send out or receive any goods from that country when the dutch in the beginning of the last century began to encroach upon them they vested their whole east india commerce in an exclusive company the english french swedes and danes have all followed their example so that no great nation in europe has ever yet had the benefit of a free commerce to the east indies no other reason need be assigned why it has never been so advantageous as the trade to america which between almost every nation of europe and its own colonies is free to all its subjects the exclusive privileges of those east india companies their great riches the great favor and protection which these have prooured them from their respective governments have excited much envy against them this envy has frequently represented their trade as altogether pernicious on account of the great quantities of silver which it every year exports from the countries from which it is carried on the parties concerned have replied that their trade by this continual exportation of silver might indeed tend to impoverish europe in general but not the particular country from which it was carried on because by the exportation of a part of the returns to other european countries it annually brought home a much greater quantity of that metal than it carried out both the objection and the reply are founded in the popular notion which i have been just now examining it is therefore unnecessary to say any thing further about either by the annual exportation of silver to the east indies plate is probably somewhat dearer in europe than it otherwise might have been and coined silver probably purchases a larger quantity both of labor and commodities the former of these two effects is a very small loss the latter a very small advantage both too insignificant to deserve any part of the public attention the trade to the east indies by opening a market to the commodities of europe or what comes nearly to the same thing to the gold and silver which is purchased with those commodities must necessarily tend to increase the annual production of european commodities and consequently the real wealth and revenue of europe that it has hitherto increased them so little is probably owing to the restraints which it every where labors under  i thought it necessary though at the hazard of being tedious to examine at full length this popular notion that wealth consists in money or in gold and silver money in common language as i have already observed frequently signifies wealth and this ambiguity of expression has rendered this popular notion so familiar to us that even they who are convinced of its absurdity are very apt to forget their own principles and in the course of their reasonings to take it for granted as a certain and undeniable truth some of the best english writers upon commerce set out with observing that the wealth of a country consists not in its gold and silver only but in its lands houses and consumable goods of all different kinds in the course of their reasonings however the lands houses and consumable goods seem to slip out of their memory and the strain of their argument frequently supposes that all wealth consists in gold and silver and that to multiply those metals is the great object of national industry and commerce  the two principles being established however that wealth consisted in gold and silver and that those metals could be brought into a country which had no mines only by the balance of trade or by exporting to a greater value than it imported it necessarily became the great object of political economy to diminish as much as possible the importation of foreign goods for homeconsumption and to increase as much as possible the exportation of the produce of domestic industry its two great engines for enriching the country therefore were restraints upon importation and encouragements to exportation  the restraints upon importation were of two kinds  first restraints upon the importation of such foreign goods for homeconsumption as could be produced at home from whatever country they were imported  secondly restraints upon the importation of goods of almost all kinds from those particular countries with which the balance of trade was supposed to be disadvantageous  those different restraints consisted sometimes in high duties and sometimes in absolute prohibitions  exportation was encouraged sometimes by drawbacks sometimes by bounties sometimes by advantageous treaties of commerce with foreign states and sometimes by the establishment of colonies in distant countries  drawbacks were given upon two different occasions when the homemanufactures were subject to any duty or excise either the whole or a part of it was frequently drawn back upon their exportation and when foreign goods liable to a duty were imported in order to be exported again either the whole or a part of this duty was sometimes given back upon such exportation  bounties were given for the encouragement either of some beginning manufactures or of such sorts of industry of other kinds as were supposed to deserve particular favor  by advantageous treaties of commerce particular privileges were procured in some foreign state for the goods and merchants of the country beyond what were granted to those of other countries  by the establishment of colonies in distant countries not only particular privileges but a monopoly was frequently procured for the goods and merchants of the country which established them  the two sorts of restraints upon importation above mentioned together with these four encouragements to exportation constitute the six principal means by which the commercial system proposes to increase the quantity of gold and silver in any country by turning the balance of trade in its favor i shall consider each of them in a particular chapter and without taking much further notice of their supposed tendency to bring money into the country i shall examine chiefly what are likely to be the effects of each of them upon the annual produce of its industry according as they tend either to increase or diminish the value of this annual produce they must evidently tend either to increase or diminish the real wealth and revenue of the country  chap ii of restraints upon the importation of such goods from foreign countries as can be produced at home by restraining either by high duties or by absolute prohibitions the importation of such goods from foreign countries as can be produced at home the monopoly of the homemarket is more of less secured to the domestic industry employed in producing them thus the prohibition of importing either live cattle or salt provisions from foreign countries secures to the graziers of great britain the monopoly of the homemarket for butchersmeat the high duties upon the importation of corn which in times of moderate plenty amount to a prohibition give a like advantage to the growers of that commodity the prohibition of the importation of foreign woollens is equally favorable to the woollen manufacturers the silk manufacture though altogether employed upon foreign materials has lately obtained the same advantage the linen manufacture has not yet obtained it but is making great strides toward it many other sorts of manufacturers have in the same manner obtained in great britain either altogether or very nearly a monopoly against their countrymen  that this monopoly of the homemarket frequently gives great encouragement to that particular species of industry which enjoys it and frequently turns toward that employment a greater share of both the labor and stock of the society than would otherwise have gone to it cannot be doubted but whether it tends either to increase the general industry of the society or to give it the most advantageous direction is not perhaps altogether so certain  the general industry of the society never can exceed what the capital of the society can employ as the number of workmen that can be kept in employment by any particular person must bear a certain proportion to his capital so the number of those that can be continually employed by all the members of a great society must bear a certain proportion to the whole capital of that society and never can exceed that proportion no regulation of commerce can increase the quantity of industry in any society beyond what its capital can maintain it can only divert a part of it into a direction into which it might not otherwise have gone and it is by no means certain that this artificial direction is likely to be more advantageous to the society than that into which it would have gone of its own accord  every individual is continually exerting himself to find out the most advantageous employment for whatever capital he can command it is his own advantage indeed and not that of the society which he has in view but the study of his own advantage naturally or rather necessarily leads him to prefer that employment which is most advantageous to the society  first every individual endeavors to employ his capital as near home as he can and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock  thus upon equal or nearly equal profits every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the hometrade to the foreign trade of consumption and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade in the hometrade his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption he can know better the character and situation of the persons whom he trusts and if he should happen to be deceived he knows better the laws of the country from which he must seek redress in the carrying trade the capital of the merchant is as it were divided between two foreign countries and no part of it is ever necessarily brought home or placed under his own immediate view and command the capital which an amsterdam merchant employs in carrying corn from konnigsberg to lisbon and fruit and wine from lisbon to konnigsberg must generally be the onehalf of it at konnigsberg and the other half at lisbon no part of it need ever come to amsterdam the natural residence of such a merchant should either be at konnigsberg or lisbon and it can only be some very particular circumstances which can make him prefer the residence of amsterdam the uneasiness however which he feels at being separated so far from his capital generally determines him to bring part both of the konnigsberg goods which he destines for the market of lisbon and of the lisbon goods which he destines for that of konnigsberg to amsterdam and though this necessarily subjects him to a double charge of loading and unloading as well as to the payment of some duties and customs yet for the sake of having some part of his capital always under his own view and command he willingly submits to this extraordinary charge and it is in this manner that every country which has any considerable share of the carrying trade becomes always the emporium or general market for the goods of all the different countries whose trade it carries on the merchant in order to save a second loading and unloading endeavors always to sell in the homemarket as much of the goods of all those different countries as he can and thus so far as he can to convert his carrying trade into a foreign trade of consumption a merchant in the same manner who is engaged in the foreign trade of consumption when he collects goods for foreign markets will always be glad upon equal or nearly equal profits to sell as great a part of them at home as he can he saves himself the risk and trouble of exportation when so far as he can he thus converts his foreign trade of consumption into a hometrade home is in this manner the center if i may say so round which the capitals of the inhabitants of every country are continually circulating and toward which they are always tending though by particular causes they may sometimes be driven off and repelled from it toward more distant employments but a capital employed in the hometrade it has already been shown necessarily puts into motion a greater quantity of domestic industry and gives revenue and employment to a greater number of the inhabitants of the country than an equal capital employed in the foreign trade of consumption and one employed in the foreign trade of consumption has the same advantage over an equal capital employed in the carrying trade upon equal or only nearly equal profits therefore every individual naturally inclines to employ his capital in the manner in which it is likely to afford the greatest support to domestic industry and to give revenue and employment to the greatest number of the people of his own country  secondly every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry necessarily endeavors so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest possible value  the produce of industry is what it adds to the subject or materials upon which it is employed in proportion as the value of this produce is great or small so will likewise be the profits of the employer but it is only for the sake of profit that any man employs a capital in the support of industry and he will always therefore endeavor to employ it in the support of that industry of which the produce is likely to be of the greatest value or to exchange for the greatest quantity either of money or of other goods  but the annual revenue of every society is always precisely equal to the exchangeable value of the whole annual produce of its industry or rather is precisely the same thing with that exchangeable value as every individual therefore endeavors as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value every individual necessarily labors to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can he generally indeed neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it by preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry he intends only his own security and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value he intends only his own gain and he is in this as in many other cases led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it by pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it i have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good it is an affectation indeed not very common among merchants and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it  what is the species of domestic industry which his capital can employ and of which the produce is likely to be of the greatest value every individual it is evident can in his local situation judge much better than any statesman or lawgiver can do for him the statesman who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals would not only load himself with a most unnecessary attention but assume an authority which could safely be trusted not only to no single person but to no council or senate whatever and which would no where be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it  to give the monopoly of the homemarket to the produce of domestic industry in any particular art or manufacture is in some measure to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals and must in almost all cases be either a useless or a hurtful regulation if the produce of domestic can be brought there as cheap as that of foreign industry the regulation is evidently useless if it cannot it must generally be hurtful it is the maxim of every prudent master of a family never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy the tailor does not attempt to make his own shoes but buys them of the shoemaker the shoemaker does not attempt to make his own clothes but employs a tailor the farmer attempts to make neither the one nor the other but employs those different artificers all of them find it for their interest to employ their whole industry in a way in which they have some advantage over their neighbors and to purchase with a part of its produce or what is the same thing with the price of a part of it whatever else they have occasion for  what is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom if a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry employed in a way in which we have some advantage the general industry of the country being always in proportion to the capital which employs it will not thereby be diminished no more than that of the abovementioned artificers but only left to find out the way in which it can be employed with the greatest advantage it is certainly not employed to the greatest advantage when it is thus directed toward an object which it can buy cheaper than it can make the value of its annual produce is certainly more or less diminished when it is thus turned away from producing commodities evidently of more value than the commodity which it is directed to produce according to the supposition that commodity could be purchased from foreign countries cheaper than it can be made at home it could therefore have been purchased with a part only of the commodities or what is the same thing with a part only of the price of the commodities which the industry employed by an equal capital would have produced at home had it been left to follow its natural course the industry of the country therefore is thus turned away from a more to a less advantageous employment and the exchangeable value of its annual produce instead of being increased according to the intention of the lawgiver must necessarily be diminished by every such regulation  by means of such regulations indeed a particular manufacture may sometimes be acquired sooner than it could have been otherwise and after a certain time may be made at home as cheap or cheaper than in the foreign country but though the industry of the society may be thus carried with advantage into a particular channel sooner than it could have been otherwise it will by no means follow that the sum total either of its industry or of its revenue can ever be augmented by any such regulation the industry of the society can augment only in proportion as its capital augments and its capital can augment only in proportion to what can be gradually saved out of its revenue but the immediate effect of every such regulation is to diminish its revenue and what diminishes its revenue is certainly not very likely to augment its capital faster than it would have augmented of its own accord had both capital and industry been left to find out their natural employments  though for want of such regulations the society should never acquire the proposed manufacture it would not upon that account necessarily be the poorer in any one period of its duration in every period of its duration its whole capital and industry might still have been employed though upon different objects in the manner that was most advantageous at the time in every period its revenue might have been the greatest which its capital could afford and both capital and revenue might have been augmenting with the greatest possible rapidity  the natural advantages which one country has over another in producing particular commodities are sometimes so great that it is acknowledged by all the world to be in vain to struggle with them by means of glasses hotbeds and hotwalls very good grapes can be raised in scotland and very good wine too can be made of them at about thirty times the expense for which at least equally good can be brought from foreign countries would it be a reasonable law to prohibit the importation of all foreign wines merely to encourage the making of claret and burgundy in scotland but if there would be a manifest absurdity in turning toward any employment thirty times more of the capital and industry of the country than would be necessary to purchase from foreign countries an equal quantity of the commodities wanted there must be an absurdity though not altogether so glaring yet exactly of the same kind in turning toward any such employment a thirtieth or even a three hundredth part more of either whether the advantages which one country has over another be natural or acquired is in this respect of no consequence as long as the one country has those advantages and the other wants them it will always be more advantageous for the latter rather to buy of the former than to make it is an acquired advantage only which one artificer has over his neighbor who exercises another trade and yet they both find it more advantageous to buy of one another than to make what does not belong to their particular trades  merchants and manufacturers are the people who derive the greatest advantage from this monopoly of the home market the prohibition of the importation of foreign cattle and of salt provisions together with the high duties upon foreign corn which in times of moderate plenty amount to a prohibition are not near so advantageous to the graziers and farmers of great britain as other regulations of the same kind are to its merchants and manufacturers manufactures those of the finer kind especially are more easily transported from one country to another than corn or cattle it is in the fetching and carrying manufactures accordingly that foreign trade is chiefly employed in manufactures a very small advantage will enable foreigners to undersell our own workmen even in the home market it will require a very great one to enable them to do so in the rude produce of the soil if the free importation of foreign manufactures was permitted several of the home manufactures would probably suffer and some of of them perhaps go to ruin altogether and a considerable part of the stock and industry at present employed in them would be forced to find out some other employment but the freest importation of the rude produce of the soil could have no such effect upon the agriculture of the country  if the importation of foreign cattle for example was made ever so free so few could be imported that the grazing trade of great britain could be little affected by it live cattle are perhaps the only commodity of which the transportation is more expensive by sea than by land by land they carry themselves to market by sea not only the cattle but their food and their water too must be carried at no small expense and inconveniency the short sea between ireland and great britain indeed renders the importation of irish cattle more easy but thought the free importation of them which was lately permitted only for a limited time were rendered perpetual it could have no considerable effect upon the interest of the graziers of great britain those parts of great britain which border upon the irish sea are all grazing countries irish cattle could never be imported for their use but must be drove through those very extensive countries at no small expense and inconveniency before they could arrive at their proper market fat cattle could not be drove so far lean cattle therefore only could be imported and such importation could interfere not with the interest of the feeding or fattening countries to which by reducing the price of lean cattle it would rather be advantageous but with that of the breeding countries only the small number of irish cattle imported since their importation was permitted together with the good price at which lean cattle still continue to sell seem to demonstrate that even the breeding countries of great britain are never likely to be much affected by the free importation of irish cattle the common people of ireland indeed are said to have sometimes opposed with violence the exportation of their cattle but if the exporters had found any great advantage in continuing the trade they could easily when the law was on their side have conquered this mobbish opposition  feeding and fattening countries besides must always be highly improved whereas breeding countries are generally uncultivated the high price of lean cattle by augmenting the value of uncultivated land is like a bounty against improvement to any country which was highly improved throughout it would be more advantageous to import its lean cattle than to breed them the province of holland accordingly is said to follow this maxim at present the mountains of scotland wales and northumberland indeed are countries not capable of much improvement and seem destined by nature to be the breeding countries of great britain the freest importation of foreign cattle could have no other effect than to hinder those breeding countries from taking advantage of the increasing population and improvement of the rest of the kingdom from raising their price to an exorbitant height and from laying a real tax upon all the more improved and cultivated parts of the country  the freest importation of salt provisions in the same manner could have as little effect upon the interest of the graziers of great britain as that of live cattle salt provisions are not only a very bulky commodity but when compared with fresh meat they are a commodity both of worse quality and as they cost more labor and expense of higher price they could never therefore come into competition with the fresh meat though they might with the salt provisions of the country they might be used for victualling ships for distant voyages and such like uses but could never make any considerable part of the food of the people the small quantity of salt provisions imported from ireland since their importation was rendered free is an experimental proof that our graziers have nothing to apprehend from it it does not appear that the price of butchersmeat has ever been sensibly affected by it  even the free importation of foreign corn could very little affect the interest of the farmers of great britain corn is a much more bulky commodity than butchersmeat a pound of wheat at a penny is as dear as a pound of butchersmeat at fourpence the small quantity of foreign corn imported even in times of the greatest scarcity may satisfy our farmers that they can have nothing to fear from the freest importation the average quantity imported one year with another amounts only according to the very well informed author of the tracts upon the corn trade to twentythree thousand seven hundred and twentyeight quarters of all sorts of grain and does not exceed the five hundredth and seventyone part of the annual consumption but as the bounty upon corn occasions a greater exportation in years of plenty so it must of consequence occasion a greater importation in years of scarcity than would otherwise take place by means of it the plenty of one year does not compensate the scarcity of another and as the average quantity exported is necessarily augmented by it so must likewise in the actual state of tillage the average quantity imported if there was no bounty as less corn would be exported so it is probable that one year with another less would be imported than at present the corn merchants the fetchers and carriers of corn between great britain and foreign countries would have much less employment and might suffer considerably but the country gentlemen and farmers could suffer very little it is in the corn merchants accordingly rather than in the country gentlemen and farmers that i have observed the greatest anxiety for the renewal and continuation of the bounty  country gentlemen and farmers are to their great honor of all people the least subject to the wretched spirit of monopoly the undertaker of a great manufactory is sometimes alarmed if another work of the same kind is established within twenty miles of him the dutch undertaker of the woollen manufacture at abbeville stipulated that no work of the same kind should be established within thirty leagues of that city farmers and country gentlemen on the contrary are generally disposed rather to promote than to obstruct the cultivation and improvement of their neighbors farms and estates they have no secrets such as those of the greater part of manufacturers but are generally rather fond of communicating to their neighbors and of extending as far as possible any new practice which they have found to be advantageous pius questus says old cato stabilissimusque minimeque invidiosus minimeque male cogitantes sunt qui in eo studio occupati sunt country gentleman and farmers dispersed in different parts of the country cannot so easily combine as merchants and manufacturers who being collected into towns and accustomed to that exclusive corporation spirit which prevails in them naturally endeavor to obtain against all their countrymen the same exclusive privilege which they generally possess against the inhabitants of their respective towns they accordingly seem to have been the original inventors of those restraints upon the importation of foreign goods which secure to them the monopoly of the home market it was probably in imitation of them and to put themselves upon a level with those who they found were disposed to oppress them that the country gentlemen and farmers of great britain so far forgot the generosity which is natural to their station as to demand the exclusive privilege of supplying their countrymen with corn and butchersmeat they did not perhaps take time to consider how much less their interest could be affected by the freedom of trade than that of the people whose example they followed  to prohibit by a perpetual law the importation of foreign corn and cattle is in reality to enact that the population and industry of the country shall at no time exceed what the rude produce of its own soil can maintain  there seem however to be two cases in which it will generally be advantageous to lay some burden upon foreign for the encouragement of domestic industry  the first is when some particular sort of industry is necessary for the defense of the country the defense of great britain for example depends very much upon the number of its sailors and shipping the act of navigation therefore very properly endeavors to give the sailors and shipping of great britain the monopoly of the trade of their own country in some cases by absolute prohibitions and in others by heavy burdens upon the shipping of foreign countries the following are the principal dispositions of this act  first all ships of which the owners masters and threefourths of the mariners are not british subjects are prohibited upon pain of forfeiting ship and cargo from trading to the british settlements and plantations or from being employed in the coasting trade of great britain  secondly a great variety of the most bulky articles of importation can be brought into great britain only either in such ships as are above described or in ships of the country where those goods are produced and of which the owners masters and threefourths of the mariners are of that particular country and when imported even in ships of this latter kind they are subject to double aliens duty if imported in ships of any other country the penalty is forfeiture of ship and cargo when this act was made the dutch were what they still are the great carriers of europe and by this regulation they were entirely excluded from being the carriers to great britain or from importing to us the goods of any other european country  thirdly a great variety of the most bulky articles of importation are prohibited from being imported even in british ships from any country but that in which they are produced under pain of forfeiting ship and cargo this regulation too was probably intended against the dutch holland was then as now the great emporium for all european goods and by this regulation british ships were hindered from loading in holland the goods of any other european country  fourthly salt fish of all kinds whalefins whalebone oil and blubber not caught by and cured on board british vessels when imported into great britain are subjected to double aliens duty the dutch as they are still the principal were then the only fishers in europe that attempted to supply foreign nations with fish by this regulation a very heavy burden was laid upon their supplying great britain  when the act of navigation was made though england and holland were not actually at war the most violent animosity subsisted between the two nations it had begun during the government of the long parliament which first framed this act and it broke out soon after in the dutch wars during that of the protector and of charles the iid it is not impossible therefore that some of the regulations of this famous act may have proceeded from national animosity they are as wise however as if they had all been dictated by the most deliberate wisdom national animosity at that particular time aimed at the very same object which the most deliberate wisdom would have recommended the diminution of the naval power of holland the only naval power which could endanger the security of england  the act of navigation is not favorable to foreign commerce or to the growth of that opulence which can arise from it the interest of a nation in its commercial relations to foreign nations is like that of a merchant with regard to the different people with whom he deals to buy as cheap and to sell as dear as possible but it will be most likely to buy cheap when by the most perfect freedom of trade it encourages all nations to bring to it the goods which it has occasion to purchase and for the same reason it will be most likely to sell dear when its markets are thus filled with the greatest number of buyers the act of navigation it is true lays no burden upon foreign ships that come to export the produce of british industry even the ancient aliens duty which used to be paid upon all goods exported as well as imported has by several subsequent acts been taken off from the greater part of the articles of exportation but if foreigners either by prohibitions or high duties are hindered from coming to sell they cannot always afford to come to buy because coming without a cargo they must lose the freight from their own country to great britain by diminishing the number of sellers therefore we necessarily diminish that of buyers and are thus likely not only to buy foreign goods dearer but to sell our own cheaper than if there was a more perfect freedom of trade as defense however is of much more importance than opulence the act of navigation is perhaps the wisest of all the commercial regulations of england  the second case in which it will generally be advantageous to lay some burden upon foreign for the encouragement of domestic industry is when some tax is imposed at home upon the produce of the latter in this case it seems reasonable that an equal tax should be imposed upon the like produce of the former this would not give the monopoly of the home market to domestic industry nor turn toward a particular employment a greater share of the stock and labor of the country than what would naturally go to it it would only hinder any part of what would naturally go to it from being turned away by the tax into a less natural direction and would leave the competition between foreign and domestic industry after the tax as nearly as possible upon the same footing as before it in great britain when any such tax is laid upon the produce of domestic industry it is usual at the same time in order to stop the clamorous complaints of our merchants and manufacturers that they will be undersold at home to lay a much heavier duty upon the importation of all foreign goods of the same kind  this second limitation of the freedom of trade according to some people should upon some occasions be extended much further than to the precise foreign commodities which could come into competition with those which had been taxed at home when the necessaries of life have been taxed in any country it becomes proper they pretend to tax not only the like necessaries of life imported from other countries but all sorts of foreign goods which can come into competition with any thing that is the produce of domestic industry subsistence they say becomes necessarily dearer in consequence of such taxes and the price of labor must always rise with the price of the laborers subsistence every commodity therefore which is the produce of domestic industry though not immediately taxed itself becomes dearer in consequence of such taxes because the labor which produces it becomes so such taxes therefore are really equivalent they say to a tax upon every particular commodity produced at home in order to put domestic upon the same footing with foreign industry therefore it becomes necessary they think to lay some duty upon every foreign commodity equal to this enhancement of the price of the home commodities with which it can come into competition  whether taxes upon the necessaries of life such as those in great britain upon malt beer soap salt leather candles etc necessarily raise the price of labor and consequently that of all other commodities i shall consider hereafter when i come to treat of taxes supposing however in the mean time that they have this effect and they have it undoubtedly this general enhancement of the price of all commodities in consequence of that of labor is a case which differs in the two following respects from that of a particular commodity of which the price was enhanced by a particular tax immediately imposed upon it  first it might always be known with great exactness how far the price of such a commodity could be enhanced by such a tax but how far the general enhancement of the price of labor might affect that of every different commodity about which labor was employed could never be known with any tolerable exactness it would be impossible therefore to proportion with any tolerable exactness the tax upon every foreign to this enhancement of the price of every home commodity  secondly taxes upon the necessaries of life have nearly the same effect upon the circumstances of the people as a poor soil and a bad climate provisions are thereby rendered dearer in the same manner as if it required extraordinary labor and expense to raise them as in the natural scarcity arising from soil and climate it would be absurd to direct the people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals and industry so it is likewise in the artificial scarcity arising from such taxes to be left to accommodate as well as they could their industry to their situation and to find out those employments in which notwithstanding their unfavourable circumstances they might have some advantage either in the home or in the foreign market is what in both cases would evidently be most for their advantage to lay a new tax upon them because they are already overburdened with taxes and because they already pay too dear for the necessaries of life to make them likewise pay too dear for the greater part of other commodities is certainly a most absurd way of making amends  such taxes when they have grown up to a certain height are a curse equal to the barrenness of the earth and the inclemency of the heavens and yet it is in the richest and most industrious countries that they have been most generally imposed no other countries could support so great a disorder as the strongest bodies only can live and enjoy health under an unwholesome regimen so the nations only that in every sort of industry have the greatest natural and acquired advantages can subsist and prosper under such taxes holland is the country in europe in which they abound most and which from peculiar circumstances continues to prosper not by means of them as has been most absurdly supposed but in spite of them  as there are two cases in which it will generally be advantageous to lay some burden upon foreign for the encouragement of domestic industry so there are two others in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation in the one how far it is proper to continue the free importation of certain foreign goods and in the other how far or in what manner it may be proper to restore that free importation after it has been for some time interrupted  the case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation how far it is proper to continue the free importation of certain foreign goods is when some foreign nation restrains by high duties or prohibitions the importation of someof our manufactures into their country revenge in this case naturally dictates retaliation and that we should impose the like duties and prohibitions upon the importation of some or all of their manufactures into ours nations accordingly seldom fail to retaliate in this manner the french have been particularly forward to favor their own manufactures by restraining the importation of such foreign goods as could come into competition with them in this consisted a great part of the policy of mr colbert who notwithstanding his great abilities seems in this case to have been imposed upon by the sophistry of merchants and manufacturers who are always demanding a monopoly against their countrymen it is at present the opinion of the most intelligent men in france that his operations of this kind have not been beneficial to his country that minister by the tarif of      imposed very high duties upon a great number of foreign manufactures upon his refusing to moderate them in favor of the dutch they in      prohibited the importation of the wines brandies and manufactures of france the war of      seems to have been in part occasioned by this commercial dispute the peace of nimeguen put an end to it in      by moderating some of those duties in favor of the dutch who in consequence took off their prohibition it was about the same time that the french and english began mutually to oppress each others industry by the like duties and prohibitions of which the french however seem to have set the first example the spirit of hostility which has subsisted between the two nations ever since has hitherto hindered them from being moderated on either side in      the english prohibited the importation of bonelace the manufacture of flanders the government of that country at that time under the dominion of spain prohibited in return the importation of english woollens in   00 the prohibition of importing bonelace into england was taken off upon condition that the importation of english woollens into flanders should be put on the same footing as before  there may be good policy in retaliations of this kind when there is a probability that they will procure the repeal of the high duties or prohibitions complained of the recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconveniency of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods to judge whether such retaliations are likely to produce such an effect does not perhaps belong so much to the science of a legislator whose deliberations ought to be governed by general principles which are always the same as to the skill of that insidious and crafty animal vulgarly called a statesman or politician whose councils are directed by the momentary fluctuations of affairs when there is no probability that any such repeal can be procured it seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people to do another injury ourselves both to those classes and to almost all the other classes of them when our neighbors prohibit some manufacture of ours we generally prohibit not only the same for that alone would seldom affect them considerably but some other manufacture of theirs this may no doubt give encouragement to some particular class of workmen among ourselves and by excluding some of their rivals may enable them to raise their price in the home market those workmen however who suffered by our neighbors prohibition will not be benefited by ours on the contrary they and almost all the other classes of our citizens will thereby be obliged to pay dearer than before for certain goods every such law therefore imposes a real tax upon the whole country not in favor of that particular class of workmen who were injured by our neighbors prohibition but of some other class  the case in which it may sometimes be a matter of deliberation how far or in what manner it is proper to restore the free importation of foreign goods after it has been for some time interrupted is when particular manufactures by means of high duties or prohibitions upon all foreign goods which can come into competition with them have been so far extended as to employ a great multitude of hands humanity may in this case require that the freedom of trade should be restored only by slow gradations and with a good deal of reserve and circumspection were those high duties and prohibitions taken away all at once cheaper foreign goods of the same kind might be poured so fast into the home market as to deprive all at once many thousands of our people of their ordinary employment and means of subsistence the disorder which this would occasion might no doubt be very considerable it would in all probability however be much less than is commonly imagined for the two following reasons  first all those manufactures of which any part is commonly exported to other european countries without a bounty could be very little affected by the freest importation of foreign goods such manufactures must be sold as cheap abroad as any other foreign goods of the same quality and kind and consequently must be sold cheaper at home they would still therefore keep possession of the home market and though a capricious man of fashion might sometimes prefer foreign wares merely because they were foreign to cheaper and better goods of the same kind that were made at home this folly could from the nature of things extend to so few that it could make no sensible impression upon the general employment of the people but a great part of all the different branches of our woollen manufacture of our tanned leather and of our hardware are annually exported to other european countries without any bounty and these are the manufactures which employ the greatest number of hands the silk perhaps is the manufacture which would suffer the most by this freedom of trade and after it the linen though the latter much less than the former  secondly though a great number of people should by thus restoring the freedom of trade be thrown all at once out of their ordinary employment and common method of subsistence it would by no means follow that they would thereby be deprived either of employment or subsistence by the reduction of the army and navy at the end of the late war more than a hundred thousand soldiers and seamen a number equal to what is employed in the greatest manufactures were all at once thrown out of their ordinary employment but though they no doubt suffered some inconveniency they were not thereby deprived of all employment and subsistence the greater part of the seamen it is probable gradually betook themselves to the merchants service as they could find occasion and in the mean time both they and the soldiers were absorbed in the great mass of the people and employed in a great variety of occupations not only no great convulsion but no sensible disorder arose from so great a change in the situation of more than a hundred thousand men all accustomed to the use of arms and many of them to rapine and plunder the number of vagrants was scarce anywhere sensibly increased by it even the wages of labor were not reduced by it in any occupation so far as i have been able to learn except in that of seamen in the merchant service but if we compare together the habits of a soldier and of any sort of manufacturer we shall find that those of the latter do not tend so much to disqualify him from being employed in a new trade as those of the former from being employed in any the manufacturer has always been accustomed to look for his subsistence from his labor only the soldier to expect it from his pay application and industry have been familiar to the one idleness and dissipation to the other but it is surely much easier to change the direction of industry from one sort of labor to another than to turn idleness and dissipation to any to the greater part of manufactures besides it has already been observed there are other collateral manufactures of so similar a nature that a workman can easily transfer his industry from one of them to another the greater part of such workmen too are occasionally employed in country labor the stock which employed them in a particular manufacture before will still remain in the country to employ an equal number of people in some other way the capital of the country remaining the same the demand for labor will likewise be the same or very nearly the same though it may be exerted in different places and for different occupations soldiers and seamen indeed when discharged from the kings service are at liberty to exercise any trade within any town or place of great britain or ireland let the same natural liberty of exercising what species of industry they please be restored to all his majestys subjects in the same manner as to soldiers and seamen that is break down the exclusive privileges of corporations and repeal the statute of apprenticeship both which are real encroachments upon natural liberty and add to these the repeal of the law of settlements so that a poor workman when thrown out of employment either in one trade or in one place may seek for it in another trade or in another place without the fear either of a prosecution or of a removal and neither the public nor the individuals will suffer much more from the occasional disbanding some particular classes of manufacturers than from that of soldiers our manufacturers have no doubt great merit with their country but they cannot have more than those who defend it with their blood nor deserve to be treated with more delicacy  to expect indeed that the freedom of trade should ever be entirely restored in great britain is as absurd as to expect that an oceana or utopea should ever be established in it not only the prejudices of the public but what is much more unconquerable the private interests of many individuals irresistably oppose it were the officers of the army to oppose with the same zeal and unanimity any reduction in the number of forces with which master manufacturers set themselves against every law that is likely to increase the number of their rivals in the home market were the former to animate their soldiers in the same manner as the latter inflame their workmen to attack with violence and outrage the proposers of any such regulation to attempt to reduce the army would be as dangerous as it has now become to attempt to diminish in any respect the monopoly which our manufacturers have obtained against us this monopoly has so much increased the number of some particular tribes of them that like an overgrown standing army they have become formidable to the government and upon many occasions intimidate the legislature the member of parliament who supports every proposal for strongthening this monopoly is sure to acquire not only the reputation of understanding trade but great popularity and influence with an order of men whose numbers and wealth render them of great importance if he opposes them on the contrary and still more if he has authority enough to be able to thwart them neither the most acknowledged probity nor the highest rank nor the greatest public services can protect him from the most infamous abuse and detraction from personal insults nor sometimes from real danger arising from the insolent outrage of furious and disappointed monopolists  the undertaker of a great manufacture who by the home markets being suddenly laid open to the competition of foreigners should be obliged to abandon his trade would no doubt suffer very considerably that part of his capital which had usually been employed in purchasing materials and in paying his workmen might without much difficulty perhaps find another employment but that part of it which was fixed in workhouses and in the instruments of trade could scarce be disposed of without considerable loss the equitable regard therefore to his interest requires that changes of this kind should never be introduced suddenly but slowly gradually and after a very long warning the legislature were it possible that its deliberations could be always directed not by the clamorous importunity of partial interests but by an extensive view of the general good ought upon this very account perhaps to be particularly careful neither to establish any new monopolies of this kind nor to extend further those which are already established every such regulation introduces some degree of real disorder into the constitution of the state which it will be difficult afterward to cure without occasioning another disorder  how far it may be proper to impose taxes upon the importation of foreign goods in order not to prevent their importation but to raise a revenue for government i shall consider hereafter when i come to treat of taxes taxes imposed with a view to prevent or even to diminish importation are evidently as destructive of the revenue of the customs as of the freedom of trade  chap iii of the extraordinary restraints upon the importation of goods of almost all kinds from those countries with which the balance is supposed to be disadvantageous to lay extraordinary restraints upon the importation of goods of almost all kinds from those particular countries with which the balance of trade is supposed to be disadvantageous is the second expedient by which the commercial system proposes to increase the quantity of gold and silver thus in great britain higher duties are laid upon the wines of france than upon those of portugal german linen may be imported upon paying certain duties but french linen is altogether prohibited the principles which i have been examining took their origin from private interest and the spirit of monopoly those which i am going to examine from national prejudice and animosity they are accordingly as might well be expected still more unreasonable they are so even upon the principles of the commercial system  first though it were certain that in the case of a free trade between france and england for example the balance would be in favor of france it would by no means follow that such a trade would be disadvantageous to england or that the general balance of its whole trade would thereby be turned more against it if the wines of france are better and cheaper than those of portugal or its linens than those of germany it would be more advantageous for great britain to purchase both the wine and the foreign linen which it had occasion for of france than of portugal and germany though the value of the annual importations from france would thereby be greatly augmented the value of the whole annual importations would be diminished in proportion as the french goods of the same quality were cheaper than those of the other two countries this would be the case even upon the supposition that the whole french goods imported were to be consumed in great britain  but secondly a great part of them might be reexported to other countries where being sold with profit they might bring back a return equal in value perhaps to the prime cost of the whole french goods imported what has frequently been said of the east india trade might possibly be true of the french that though the greater part of east india goods were bought with gold and silver the reexportation of a part of them to other countries brought back more gold and silver to that which carried on the trade than the prime cost of the whole amounted to one of the most important branches of the dutch trade at present consists in the carriage of french goods to other european countries a great part even of the french wine drank in great britain is clandestinely imported from holland and zealand if there was either a free trade between france and england or if french goods could be imported upon paying only the same duties as those of other european nations to be drawn back upon exportation england might have some share of a trade which is found so advantageous to holland  thirdly and lastly there is no certain criterion by which we can determine on which side what is called the balance between any two countries lies or which of them exports to the greatest value national prejudice and animosity prompted always by the private interest of particular traders are the principles which generally direct our judgment upon all questions concerning it there are two criterions however which have frequently been appealed to upon such occasions the customhouse books and the course of exchange the customhouse books i think it is now generally acknowledged are a very uncertain criterion on account of the inaccuracy of the valuation at which the greater part of goods are rated in them the course of exchange at least as it has hitherto been estimated is perhaps almost equally so  when the exchange between two places such as london and paris is at par it is said to be a sign that the debts due from london to paris are compensated by those due from paris to london on the contrary when a premium is paid at london for a bill upon paris it is said to be a sign that the debts due from london to paris are not compensated by those due from paris to london but that a balance in money must be sent out from the latter place for the risk trouble and expense of exporting which the premium is both demanded and given but the ordinary state of debt and credit between those two cities must necessarily be regulated it is said by the ordinary course of their dealings with one another when neither of them imports from the other to a greater amount than it exports to it the debts and credits of each may compensate one another but when one of them imports from the other to a greater value than it exports to it the former necessarily becomes indebted to the latter in a greater sum than the latter becomes indebted to it the debts and credits of each do not compensate one another and money must be sent out from that place of which the debts overbalance the credits the common course of exchange therefore being an indication of the ordinary state of debt and credit between two places must likewise be an indication of the ordinary course of their exports and imports as these necessarily regulate that state  but though this doctrine of which some part is perhaps not a little doubtful were supposed ever so certain the manner in which the par of exchange has hitherto been computed renders uncertain every conclusion that has ever yet been drawn from it  when for a sum of money paid in england containing according to the standard of the english mint a certain number of ounces of pure silver you receive a bill for a sum of money to be paid in france containing according to the standard of the french mint an equal number of ounces of pure silver exchange is said to be at par between england and france when you pay more you are supposed to give a premium and exchange is said to be against england and in favor of france when you pay less you are supposed to get a premium and exchange is said to be against france and in favor of england  but first we cannot always judge of the value of the current money of different countries by the standards of their respective mints in some it is more in others it is less worn clipped and otherwise degenerated from that standard but the value of the current coin of every country compared with that of any other country is in proportion not to the quantity of pure silver which it ought to contain but to that which it actually does contain before the reformation of the silver coin in king williams time exchange between england and holland computed in the usual manner according to the standards of their respective mints was five and twenty per cent against england but the value of the current coin of england as we learn from mr lowndes was at that time rather more than five and twenty per cent below its standard value the real exchange therefore may even at that time have been in favor of england notwithstanding the computed exchange was so much against it a smaller number of ounces of pure silver actually paid in england may have purchased a bill for a greater number of ounces of pure silver to be paid in holland and the man who was supposed to give may in reality have got the premium the french coin was before the late reformation of the english gold coin much less worn than the english and was perhaps two or three per cent nearer its standard if the computed exchange with france therefore was not more than two or three per cent against england the real exchange might have been in its favor since the reformation of the gold coin the exchange has been constantly in favor of england and against france  secondly in some countries the expense of coinage is defrayed by the government in others it is defrayed by the private people who carry their bullion to the mint and the government even derives some revenue from the coinage in england it is defrayed by the government and if you carry a pound weight of standard silver to the mint you get back sixtytwo shillings containing a pound weight of the like standard silver in france a duty of eight per cent is deducted for the coinage which not only defrays the expense of it but affords a small revenue to the government in england as the coinage costs nothing the current coin can never be much more valuable than the quantity of bullion which it actually contains in france the workmanship as you pay for it adds to the value in the same manner as to that of wrought plate a sum of french money therefore containing a certain weight of pure silver is more valuable than a sum of english money containing an equal weight of pure silver and must require more bullion or other commodities to purchase it though the current coin of the two countries therefore were equally near the standards of their respective mints a sum of english money could not well purchase a sum of french money containing an equal number of ounces of pure silver nor consequently a bill upon france for such a sum if for such a bill no more additional money was paid than what was sufficient to compensate the expense of the french coinage the real exchange might be at par between the two countries their debts and credits might mutually compensate one another while the computed exchange was considerably in favor of france if less than this was paid the real exchange might be in favor of england while the computed was in favor of france  thirdly and lastly in some places as at amsterdam hamburgh venice etc foreign bills of exchange are paid in what they call bank money while in others as at london lisbon antwerp leghorn etc they are paid in the common currency of the country what is called bank money is always of more value than the same nominal sum of common currency a thousand guilders in the bank of amsterdam for example are of more value than a thousand guilders of amsterdam currency the difference between them is called the agio of the bank which at amsterdam is generally about five per cent supposing the current money of two countries equally near to the standard of their respective mints and that the one pays foreign bills in this common currency while the other pays them in bank money it is evident that the computed exchange may be in favor of that which pays in bank money though the real exchange should be in favor of that which pays in current money for the same reason that the computed exchange may be in favor of that which pays in better money or in money nearer to its own standard though the real exchange should be in favor of that which pays in worse the computed exchange before the late reformation of the gold coin was generally against london with amsterdam hamburgh venice and i believe with all other places which pay in what is called bank money it will by no means follow however that the real exchange was against it since the reformation of the gold coin it has been in favor of london even with those places the computed exchange has generally been in favor of london with lisbon antwerp leghorn and if you except france i believe with most other parts of europe that pay in common currency and it is not improbable that the real exchange was so too  digression concerning banks of deposit particularly concerning that of amsterdam the currency of a great state such as france or england generally consists almost entirely of its own coin should this currency therefore be at any time worn elipt or otherwise degraded below its standard value the state by a reformation of its coin can effectually reestablish its currency but the currency of a small state such as genoa or hamburgh can seldom consist altogether in its own coin but must be made up in a great measure of the coins of all the neighboring states with which its inhabitants have a continual intercourse such a state therefore by reforming its coin will not always be able to reform its currency if foreign bills of exchange are paid in this currency the uncertain value of any sum of what is in its own nature so uncertain must render the exchange always very much against such a state its currency being in all foreign states necessarily valued even below what it is worth  in order to remedy the inconvenience to which this disadvantageous exchange must have subjected their merchants such small states when they began to attend to the interest of trade have frequently enacted that foreign bills of exchange of a certain value should be paid not in common currency but by an order upon or by a transfer in the books of a certain bank established upon the credit and under the protection of the state this bank being always obliged to pay in good and true money exactly according to the standard of the state the banks of venice genoa amsterdam hamburgh and nuremberg seem to have been all originally established with this view though some of them may have afterward been made subservient to other purposes the money of such banks being better than the common currency of the country necessarily bore an agio which was greater or smaller according as the currency was supposed to be more or less degraded below the standard of the state the agio of the bank of hamburgh for example which is said to be commonly about fourteen per cent is the supposed difference between the good standard money of the state and the clipped worn and diminished currency poured into it from all the neighboring states  before   0  the great quantity of clipped and worn foreign coin which the extensive trade of amsterdam brought from all parts of europe reduced the value of its currency about nine per cent below that of good money fresh from the mint such money no sooner appeared than it was melted down or carried away as it always is in such circumstances the merchants with plenty of currency could not always find a sufficient quantity of good money to pay their bills of exchange and the value of those bills in spite of several regulations which were made to prevent it became in a great measure uncertain  in order to remedy these inconveniences a bank was established in   0  under the guarantee of the city this bank received both foreign coin and the light and worn coin of the country at its real intrinsic value in the good standard money of the country deducting only so much as was necessary for defraying the expense of coinage and the other necessary expense of management for the value which remained after this small deduction was made it gave a credit in its books this credit was called bank money which as it represented money exactly according to the standard of the mint was always of the same real value and intrinsically worth more than current money it was at the same time enacted that all bills drawn upon or negociated at amsterdam of the value of fix hundred gilders and upwards should be paid in bank money which at once took away all uncertainty in the value of those bills every merchant in consequence of this regulation was obliged to keep an account with the bank in order to pay his foreign bills of exchange which necessarily occasioned a certain demand for bank money  bank money over and above both its intrinsic superiority to currency and the additional value which this demand necessarily gives it has likewise some other advantages it is secure from fire robbery and other accidents the city of amsterdam is bound for it it can be paid away by a simple transfer without the trouble of counting or the risk of transporting it from one place to another in consequence of those different advantages it seems from the beginning to have borne an agio and it is generally believed that all the money originally deposited in the bank was allowed to remain there nobody caring to demand payment of a debt which he could sell for a premium in the market by demanding payment of the bank the owner of a bank credit would lose this premium as a shilling fresh from the mint will buy no more goods in the market than one of our common worn shillings so the good and true money which might be brought from the coffers of the bank into those of a private person being mixed and confounded with the common currency of the country would be of no more value than that currency from which it could no longer be readily distinguished while it remained in the coffers of the bank its superiority was known and ascertained when it had come into those of a private person its superiority could not well be ascertained without more trouble than perhaps the difference was worth by being brought from the coffers of the bank besides it lost all the other advantages of bank money its security its easy and safe transferability its use in paying foreign bills of exchange over and above all this it could not be brought from those coffers as it will appear by and by without previously paying for the keeping  those deposits of coin or which the bank was bound to restore in coin constituted the original capital of the bank or the whole value of what was represented by what is called bank money at present they are supposed to constitute but a very small part of it in order to facilitate the trade in bullion the bank has been for these many years in the practice of giving credit in its books upon deposits of gold and silver bullion this credit is generally about five per cent below the mint price of such bullion the bank grants at the same time what is called a recipice or receipt intitling the person who makes the deposit or the bearer to take out the bullion again at any time within six months upon retransferring to the bank a quantity of bank money equal to that for which credit had been given in its books when the deposit was made and upon paying onefourth per cent for the keeping if the deposit was in silver and onehalf per cent if it was in gold but at the same time declaring that in default of such payment and upon the expiration of this term the deposit should belong to the bank at the price at which it had been received or for which credit had been given in the transfer books what is thus paid for the keeping of the deposit may be considered as a sort of warehouse rent and why this warehouse rent should be so much dearer for gold than for silver several different reasons have been assigned the fineness of gold it has been said is more difficult to be ascertained than that of silver frauds are more easily practiced and occasion a greater loss in the more precious metal silver besides being the standard metal the state it has been said wishes to encourage more the making of deposits of silver than of those of gold  deposits of bullion are most commonly made when the price is somewhat lower than ordinary and they are taken out again when it happens to rise in holland the market price of bullion is generally above the mint price for the same reason that it was so in england before the late reformation of the gold coin the difference is said to be commonly from about six to sixteen stivers upon the mark or eight ounces of silver of eleven parts fine and one part alloy the bank price or the credit which the bank gives for deposits of such silver when made in foreign coin of which the fineness is well known and ascertained such as mexico dollars is twentytwo gilders the mark the mint price is about twentythree gilders and the market price is from twentythree gilders six to twentythree gilders sixteen stivers or from two to three per cent above the mintprice the following are the prices at which the bank of amsterdam at present september      receives bullion and coin of different kinds  silver mexico dollars gilders b     per mark french crowns english silver coin mexico dollars new coin     0 ducatoons   rix dollars     bar silver containing      fine silver    per mark and in this proportion down to fine on which   gilders are given  fine bars    per mark  gold portugal coin b    0 per mark guineas louis dors new ditto old  00 new ducats        per ducat bar or ingot gold is received in proportion to its fineness compared with the above foreign gold coin upon fine bars the bank gives   0 per mark in general however something more is given upon coin of a known fineness than upon gold and silver bars of which the fineness cannot be ascertained but by a process of melting and assaying   the proportions between the bank price the mint price and the market price of gold bullion arenearly the same a person can generally sell his receipt for the difference between the mint price of bullion and the market price a receipt for bullion is almost always worth something and it very seldom happens therefore that any body suffers his receipt to expire or allows his bullion to fall to the bank at the price at which it had been received either by not taking it out before the end of the six months or by neglecting to pay the onefourth or onehalf per cent in order to obtain a new receipt for another six months this however though it happens seldom is said to happen sometimes and more frequently with regard to gold than with regard to silver on account of the higher warehouserent which is paid for the keeping of the more precious metal  the person who by making a deposit of bullion obtains both a bank credit and a receipt pays his bills of exchange as they become due with his bank credit and either sells or keeps his receipt according as he judges that the price of bullion is likely to rise or to fall the receipt and the bank credit seldom keep long together and there is no occasion that they should the person who has a receipt and who wants to take out bullion finds always plenty of bank credits or bank money to buy at the ordinary price and the person who has bank money and wants to take out bullion finds receipts always in equal abundance  the owners of bank credits and the holders of receipts constitute two different sorts of creditors against the bank the holder of a receipt cannot draw out the bullion for which it is granted without reassigning to the bank a sum of bank money equal to the price at which the bullion had been received if he has no bank money of his own he must purchase it of those who have it the owner of bank money cannot draw out bullion without producing to the bank receipts for the quantity which he wants if he has none of his own he must buy them of those who have them the holder of a receipt when he purchases bank money purchases the power of taking out a quantity of bullion of which the mint price is five per cent above the bank price the agio of five per cent therefore which he commonly pays for it is paid not for an imaginary but for a real value the owner of bank money when he purchases a receipt purchases the power of taking out a quantity of bullion of which the market price is commonly from two to three per cent above the mint price the price which he pays for it therefore is paid likewise for a real value the price of the receipt and the price of the bank money compound or make up between them the full value or price of the bullion  upon deposits of the coin current in the country the bank grants receipts likewise as well as bank credits but those receipts are frequently of no value and will bring no price in the market upon ducatoons for example which in the currency pass for three gilders three stivers each the bank gives a credit of three gilders only or five per cent below their current value it grants a receipt likewise intitling the bearer to take out the number of ducatoons deposited at any time within six months upon paying onefourth per cent for the keeping this receipt will frequently bring no price in the market three gilders bank money generally sell in the market for three gilders three stivers the full value of the decatoons if they were taken out of the bank and before they can be taken out onefourth per cent must be paid for the keeping which would be mere loss to the holder of the receipt if the agio of the bank however should at any time fall to three per cent such receipts might bring some price in the market and might sell for one and threefourths per cent but the agio of the bank being now generally about five per cent such receipts are frequently allowed to expire or as they express it to fall to the bank the receipts which are given for deposits of gold ducats fall to it yet more frequently because a higher warehouserent or onehalf per cent must be paid for the keeping of them before they can be taken out again the five per cent which the bank gains when deposits either of coin or bullion are allowed to fall to it may be considered as the warehouserent for the perpetual keeping of such deposits  the sum of bank money for which the receipts are expired must be very considerable it must comprehend the whole original capital of the bank which it is generally supposed has been allowed to remain there from the time it was first deposited nobody caring either to renew his receipt or to take out his deposit as for the reasons already assigned neither the one nor the other could be done without loss but whatever may be the amount of this sum the proportion which it bears to the whole mass of bank money is supposed to be very small the bank of amsterdam has for these many years past been the great warehouse of europe for bullion for which the receipts are very seldom allowed to expire or as they express it to fall to the bank the far greater part of the bank money or of the credits upon the books of the bank is supposed to have been created for these many years past by such deposits which the dealers in bullion are continually both making and withdrawing  no demand can be made upon the bank but by means of a recipice or receipt the smaller mass of bank money for which the receipts are expired is mixed and confounded with the much greater mass for which they are still in force so that though there may be a considerable sum of bank money for which there are no receipts there is no specific sum or portion of it which may not at any time be demanded by one the bank cannot be debtor to two persons for the same thing and the owner of bank money who has no receipt cannot demand payment of the bank till he buys one in ordinary and quiet times he can find no difficulty in getting one to buy at the market price which generally corresponds with the price at which he can sell the coin or bullion it in titles him to take out of the bank  it might be otherwise during a public calamity an invasion for example such as that of the french in      the owners of bank money being then all eager to draw it out of the bank in order to have it in their own keeping the demand for receipts might raise their price to an exorbitant height the holders of them might form extravagant expectations and instead of two or three per cent demand half the bank money for which credit had been given upon the deposits that the receipts had respectively been granted for the enemy informed of the constitution of the bank might even buy them up in order to prevent the carrying away of the treasure in such emergencies the bank it is supposed would break through its ordinary rule of making payment only to the holders of receipts the holders of receipts who had no bank money must have received within two or three per cent of the value of the deposit for which their respective receipts had been granted the bank therefore it is said would in this case make no scruple of paying either with money or bullion the full value of what the owners of bank money who could get no receipts were credited for in its books paying at the same time two or three per cent to such holders of receipts as had no bank money that being the whole value which in this state of things could justly be supposed due to them  even in ordinary and quiet times it is the interest of the holders of receipts to depress the agio in order either to buy bank money and consequently the bullion which their receipts would then enable them to take out of the bank so much cheaper or to sell their receipts to those who have bank money and who want to take out bullion so much dearer the price of a receipt being generally equal to the difference between the market price of bank money and that of the coin or bullion for which the receipt had been granted it is the interest of the owners of bank money on the contrary to raise the agio in order either to sell their bank money so much dearer or to buy a receipt so much cheaper to prevent the stock jobbing tricks which those opposite interests might sometimes occasion the bank has of late years come to the resolution to sell at all times bank money for currency at five per cent agio and to buy it in again at four per cent agio in consequence of this resolution the agio can never either rise above five or sink below four per cent and the proportion between the market price of bank and that of current money is kept at all times very near to the proportion between their intrinsic values before this resolution was taken the market price of bank money used sometimes to rise so high as nine per cent agio and sometimes to sink so low as par according as opposite interests happened to influence the market  the bank of amsterdam professes to lend out no part of what is deposited with it but for every gilder for which it gives credit in its books to keep in its repositories the value of a gilder either in money or bullion that it keeps in its repositories all the money or bullion for which there are receipts in force for which it is at all times liable to be called upon and which in reality is continually going from it and returning to it again cannot well be doubted but whether it does so likewise with regard to that part of its capital for which the receipts are long ago expired for which in ordinary and quiet times it cannot be called upon and which in reality is very likely to remain with it for ever or as long as the states of the united provinces subsist may perhaps appear more uncertain at amsterdam however no point of faith is better established than that for every gilder circulated as bank money there is a correspondent gilder in gold or silver to be found in the treasure of the bank the city is guarantee that it should be so the bank is under the direction of the four reigning burgomasters who are changed every year each new set of burgomasters visits the treasure compares it with the books receives it upon oath and delivers it over with the same awful solemnity to the set which succeeds it and in that sober and religious country oaths are not yet disregarded a rotation of this kind seems alone a sufficient security against any practices which cannot be avowed amidst all the revolutions which faction has ever occasioned in the government of amsterdam the prevailing party has at no time accused their predecessors of infidelity in the administration of the bank no accusation could have affected more deeply the reputation and fortune of the disgraced party and if such an accusation could have been supported we may be assured that it would have been brought in      when the french king was at utrecht the bank of amsterdam paid so readily as left no doubt of the fidelity with which it had observed its engagements some of the pieces which were then brought from its repositories appeared to have been scorched with the fire which happened in the townhouse soon after the bank was established those pieces therefore must have lain there from that time  what may be the amount of the treasure in the bank is a question which has long employed the speculations of the curious nothing but conjecture can be offered concerning it it is generally reckoned that there are about two thousand people who keep accounts with the bank and allowing them to have one with another the value of fifteen hundred pounds sterling lying upon their respective accounts a very large allowance the whole quantity of bank money and consequently of treasure in the bank will amount to about three millions sterling or at eleven gilders the pound sterling thirtythree millions of gilders a great sum and sufficient to carry on a very extensive circulation but vastly below the extravagant ideas which some people have formed of this treasure  the city of amsterdam derives a considerable revenue from the bank besides what may be called the warehouserent abovementioned each person upon first opening an account with the bank pays a fee of ten gilders and for every new account three gilders three stivers for every transfer two stivers and if the transfer is for less than three hundred gilders six stivers in order to discourage the multiplicity of small transactions the person who neglects to balance his account twice in the year forfeits twentyfive gilders the person who orders a transfer for more than is upon his account is obliged to pay three per cent for the sum overdrawn and his order is set aside into the bargain the bank is supposed too to make a considerable profit by the sale of the foreign coin or bullion which sometimes falls to it by the expiring of receipts and which is always kept till it can be sold with advantage it makes a profit likewise by selling bank money at five per cent agio and buying it in at four these different emoluments amount to a good deal more than what is necessary for paying the salaries of officers and defraying the expense of management what is paid for the keeping of bullion upon receipts is alone supposed to amount to a neat annual revenue of between one hundred and fifty thousand and two hundred thousand gilders public utility however and not revenue was the original object of this institution its object was to relieve the merchants from the inconvenience of a disadvantageous exchange the revenue which has arisen from it was unforeseen and may be considered as accidental but it is now time to return from this long digression into which i have been insensibly led in endeavoring to explain the reasons why the exchange between the countries which pay in what is called bank money and those which pay in common currency should generally appear to be in favor of the former and against the latter the former pay in a species of money of which the intrinsic value is always the same and exactly agreeable to the standard of their respective mints the latter in a species of money of which the intrinsic value is continually varying and is almost always more or less below that standard but though the computed exchange must generally be in favor of the former the real exchange may frequently be in favor of the latter  end of the digression concerning banks of deposit though the computed exchange between any two places were in every respect the same with the real it would not always follow that what is called the balance of trade was in favor of that place which had the ordinary course of exchange in its favor the ordinary course of exchange might indeed in this case be a tolerable indication of the ordinary state of debt and credit between them and show which of the two countries usually had occasion to send out money to the other but the ordinary state of debt and credit between any two places is not always entirely regulated by the ordinary course of their dealings with one another but is influenced by that of the dealings of both with many other countries if it was usual for example for the merchants of england to pay the goods which they buy from hamburgh dantzick riga etc by bills upon holland the ordinary state of debt and credit between england and holland would not be entirely regulated by the ordinary course of the dealings of those two countries with one another but would be influenced by that of england with those other places england might in this case be annually obliged to send out money to holland though its annual exports to that country exceeded the annual value of its imports from it and though what is called the balance of trade was very much in favor of england  hitherto i have been endeavoring to show even upon the principles of the commercial system how unnecesary it is to lay extraordinary restraints upon the importation of goods from those countries with which the balance of trade is supposed to be disadvantageous  nothing however can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the balance of trade upon which not only these restraints but almost all the other regulations of commerce are founded when two places trade with one another this doctrine supposes that if the balance be even neither of them either loses or gains but if it leans in any degree to one side that one of them loses and the other gains in proportion to its declension from the exact equilibrium both suppositions are false a trade which is forced by means of bounties and monopolies may be and commonly is disadvantageous to the country in whose favor it is meant to be established as i shall endeavor to show hereafter but that trade which without force or constraint is naturally and regularly carried on between any two places is always advantageous though not always equally so to both  by advantage or gain i understand not the increase of the quantity of gold and silver but that of the exchangeable value of the annual produce of the land and labor of the country or the increase of the annual revenue of its inhabitants  if the balance be even and if the trade between the two places consist altogether in the exchange of their native commodities they will upon most occasions not only both gain but they will gain equally or very near equally each will in this case afford a market for a part of the surplus produce of the other each will replace a capital which had been employed in raising this part of the surplus produce of the other and which had been distributed among and given revenue and maintenance to a certain number of its inhabitants some part of the inhabitants of each therefore will indirectly derive their revenue and maintenance from the other as the commodities exchanged too are supposed to be of equal value so the two capitals employed in the trade will upon most occasions be equal or very nearly equal and both being employed in raising the native commodities of the two countries the revenue and maintenance which their distribution will afford to the inhabitants of each will be equal or very nearly equal this revenue and maintenance thus mutually afforded will be greater or smaller in proportion to the extent of their dealings if these should annually amount to an hundred thousand pounds for example or to a million on each side each of them would afford an annual revenue in the one case of an hundred thousand pounds in the other of a million to the inhabitants of the other  if their trade should be of such a nature that one of them exported to the other nothing but native commodities while the returns of that other consisted altogether in foreign goods the balance in this case would still be supposed even commodities being paid for with commodities they would in this case too both gain but they would not gain equally and the inhabitants of the country which exported nothing but native commodities would derive the greatest revenue from the trade if england for example should import from france nothing but the native commodities of that country and not having such commodities of its own as were in demand there should annually repay them by sending thither a large quantity of foreign goods tobacco we shall suppose and east india goods this trade though it would give some revenue to the inhabitants of both countries would give more to those of france than to those of england the whole french capital annually employed in it would annually be distributed among the people of france but that part of the english capital only which was employed in producing the english commodities with which those foreign goods were purchased would be annually distributed among the people of england the greater part of it would replace the capitals which had been employed in virginia indostan and china and which had given revenue and maintenance to the inhabitants of those distant countries if the capitals were equal or nearly equal therefore this employment of the french capital would augment much more the revenue of the people of france than that of the english capital would the revenue of the people of england france would in this case carry on a direct foreign trade of consumption with england whereas england would carry on a roundabout trade of the same kind with france the different effects of a capital employed in the direct and of one employed in the roundabout foreign trade of consumption have already been fully explained  there is not probably between any two countries a trade which consists altogether in the exchange either of native commodities on both sides or of native commodities on one side and of foreign goods on the other almost all countries exchange with one another partly native and partly foreign goods that country however in whose cargoes there is the greatest proportion of native and the least of foreign goods will always be the principal gainer if it was not with tobacco and east india goods but with gold and silver that england paid for the commodities annually imported from france the balance in this case would be supposed uneven commodities not being paid for with commodities but with gold and silver the trade however would in this case as in the foregoing give some revenue to the inhabitants of both countries but more to those of france than to those of england it would give some revenue to those of england the capital which had been employed in producing the english goods that purchased this gold and silver the capital which had been distributed among and given revenue to certain inhabitants of england would thereby be replaced and enabled to continue that employment the whole capital of england would no more be diminished by this exportation of gold and silver than by the exportation of an equal value of any other goods on the contrary it would in most cases be augmented no goods are sent abroad but those for which the demand is supposed to be greater abroad than at home and of which the returns consequently it is expected will be of more value at home than the commodities exported if the tobacco which in england is worth only a hundred thousand pounds when sent to france will purchase wine which is in england worth a hundred and ten thousand pounds the exchange will augment the capital of england by ten thousand pounds if a hundred thousand pounds of english gold in the same manner purchase french wine which in england is worth a hundred and ten thousand this exchange will equally augment the capital of england by ten thousand pounds as a merchant who has a hundred and ten thousand pounds worth of wine in his cellar is a richer man than he who has only a hundred thousand pounds worth of tobacco in his warehouse so is he likewise a richer man than he who has only a hundred thousand pounds worth of gold in his coffers he can put into motion a greater quantity of industry and give revenue maintenance and employment to a greater number of people than either of the other two but the capital of the country is equal to the capitals of all its different inhabitants and the quantity of industry which can be annually maintained in it is equal to what all those different capitals can maintain both the capital of the country therefore and the quantity of industry which can be annually maintained in it must generally be augmented by this exchange it would indeed be more advantageous for england that it could purchase the wines of france with its own hardware and broadcloth than with either the tobacco of virginia or the gold and silver of brazil and peru a direct foreign trade of consumption is always more advantageous than a roundabout one but a roundabout foreign trade of consumption which is carried on with gold and silver does not seem to be less advantageous than any other equally roundabout one neither is a country which has no mines more likely to be exhausted of gold and silver by this annual exportation of those metals than one which does not grow tobacco by the like annual exportation of that plant as a country which has wherewithal to buy tobacco will never be long in want of it so neither will one be long in want of gold and silver which has wherewithal to purchase those metals  it is a losing trade it is said which a workman carries on with the alehouse and the trade which a manufacturing nation would naturally carry on with a wine country may be considered as a trade of the same nature i answer that the trade with the alehouse is not necessarily a losing trade in its own nature it is just as advantageous as any other though perhaps somewhat more liable to be abused the employment of a brewer and even that of a retailer of fermented liquors are as necessary divisions of labor as any other it will generally be more advantageous for a workman to buy of the brewer the quantity he has occasion for than to make it himself and if he is a poor workman it will generally be more advantageous for him to buy it by little and little of the retailer than a large quantity of the brewer he may no doubt buy too much of either as he may of any other dealers in his neighborhood of the butcher if he is a glutton or of the draper if he affects to be a beau among his companions it is advantageous to the great body of workmen notwithstanding that all these trades should be free though this freedom may be abused in all of them and is more likely to be so perhaps in some than in others though individuals besides may sometimes ruin their fortunes by an excessive consumption of fermented liquors there seems to be no risk that a nation should do so though in every country there are many people who spend upon such liquors more than they can afford there are always many more who spend less it deserves to be remarked too that if we consult experience the cheapness of wine seems to be a cause not of drunkenness but of sobriety the inhabitants of the wine countries are in general the soberest people in europe witness the spaniards the italians and the inhabitants of the southern provinces of france people are seldom guilty of excess in what is their daily fare nobody affects the character of liberality and good fellowship by being profuse of a liquor which is as cheap as small beer on the contrary in the countries which from either excessive heat or cold produce no grapes and where wine consequently is dear and a rarity drunkenness is a common vice as among the northern nations and all those who live between the tropicks the negroes for example on the coast of guinea when a french regiment comes from some of the northern provinces of france where wine is somewhat dear to be quartered in the southern where it is very cheap the soldiers i have frequently heard it observed are at first debauched by the cheapness and novelty of good wine but after a few months residence the greater part of them become as sober as the rest of the inhabitants were the duties upon foreign wines and the excises upon malt beer and ale to be taken away all at once it might in the same manner occasion in great britain a pretty general and temporary drunkenness among the middling and inferior ranks of people which would probably be soon followed by a permanent and almost universal sobriety at present drunkenness is by no means the vice of people of fashion or of those who can easily afford the most expensive liquors a gentleman drunk with ale has scarce ever been seen among us the restraints upon the wine trade in great britain besides do not so much seem calculated to hinder the people from going if i may say so to the alehouse as from going where they can buy the best and cheapest liquor they favor the wine trade of portugal and discourage that of france the portuguese it is said indeed are better customers for our manufactures than the french and should therefore be encouraged in preference to them as they give us their custom it is pretended we should give them ours the sneaking arts of underling tradesmen are thus erected into political maxims for the conduct of a great empire for it is the most underling tradesmen only who make it a rule to employ chiefly their own customers a great trader purchases his goods always where they are cheapest and best without regard to any little interest of this kind  by such maxims as these however nations have been taught that their interest consisted in beggaring all their neighbors each nation has been made to look with an invidious eye upon the prosperity of all the nations with which it trades and to consider their gain as its own loss commerce which ought naturally to be among nations as among individuals a bond of union and friendship has become the most fertile source of discord and animosity the capricious ambition of kings and ministers has not during the present and the preceding century been more fatal to the repose of europe than the impertinent jealousy of merchants and manufacturers the violence and injustice of the rulers of mankind is an ancient evil for which i am afraid the nature of human affairs can scarce admit of a remedy but the mean rapacity the monopolizing spirit of merchants and manufacturers who neither are nor ought to be the rulers of mankind though it cannot perhaps be corrected may very easily be prevented from disturbing the tranquillity of any body but themselves  that it was the spirit of monopoly which originally both invented and propagated this doctrine cannot be doubted and they who first taught it were by no means such fools as they who believed it in every country it always is and must be the interest of the great body of the people to buy whatever they want of those who sell it cheapest the proposition is so very manifest that it seems ridiculous to take any pains to prove it nor could it ever have been called in question had not the interested sophistry of merchants and manufacturers confounded the common sense of mankind their interest is in this directly opposite to that of the great body of the people as it is interest of the freemen of a corporation to hinder the rest of the inhabitants from employing any workmen but themselves so it is the interest of the merchants and manufacturers of every country to secure to themselves the monopoly of the home market hence in great britain and in most other european countries the extraordinary duties upon almost all goods imported by alien merchants hence the high duties and prohibitions upon all those foreign manufactures which can come into competition with our own hence too the extraordinary restraints upon the importation of almost all sorts of goods from those countries with which the balance of trade is supposed to be disadvantageous that is from those against whom national animosity happens to be most violently inflamed  the wealth of a neighboring nation however though dangerous in war and politics is certainly advantageous in trade in a state of hostility it may enable our enemies to maintain fleets and armies superior to our own but in a state of peace and commerce it must likewise enable them to exchange with us to a greater value and to afford a better market either for the immediate produce of our own industry or for whatever is purchased with that produce as a rich man is likely to be a better customer to the industrious people in his neighborhood than a poor so is likewise a rich nation a rich man indeed who is himself a manufacturer is a very dangerous neighbor to all those who deal in the same way all the rest of the neighborhood however by far the greatest number profit by the good market which his expense affords them they even profit by his underselling the poorer workmen who deal in the same way with him the manufacturers of a rich nation in the same manner may no doubt be very dangerous rivals to those of their neighbors this very competition however is advantageous to the great body of the people who profit greatly besides by the good market which the great expense of such a nation affords them in every other way private people who want to make a fortune never think of retiring to the remote and poor provinces of the country but resort either to the capital or to some of the great commercial towns they know that where little wealth circulates there is little to be got but that where a great deal is in motion some share of it may fall to them the same maxims which would in this manner direct the common sense of one or ten or twenty individuals should regulate the judgment of one or ten or twenty millions and should make a whole nation regard the riches of its neighbors as a probable cause and occasion for itself to acquire riches a nation that would enrich itself by foreign trade is certainly most likely to do so when its neighbors are all rich industrious and commercial nations a great nation surrounded on all sides by wandering savages and poor barbarians might no doubt acquire riches by the cultivation of its own lands and by its own interior commerce but not by foreign trade it seems to have been in this manner that the ancient egyptians and the modern chinese acquired their great wealth the ancient egyptians it is said neglected foreign commerce and the modern chinese it is known hold it in the utmost contempt and scarce deign to afford it the decent protection of the laws the modern maxims of foreign commerce by aiming at the impoverishment of all our neighbors so far as they are capable of producing their intended effect tend to render that very commerce insignificant and contemptible  there is no commercial country in europe of which the approaching ruin has not frequently been foretold by the pretended doctors of this system from an unfavourable balance of trade after all the anxiety however which they have excited about this after all the vain attempts of almost all trading nations to turn that balance in their own favor and against their neighbors it does not appear that any one nation in europe has been in any respect impoverished by this cause every town and country on the contrary in proportion as they have opened their ports to all nations instead of being ruined by this free trade as the principles of the commercial system would lead us to expect have been enriched by it though there are in europe indeed a few towns which in some respects deserve the name of free ports there is no country which does so holland perhaps approaches the nearest to this character of any though still very remote from it and holland it is acknowledged not only derives its whole wealth but a great part of its necessary subsistence from foreign trade  there is another balance indeed which has already been explained very different from the balance of trade and which according as it happens to be either favorable or unfavourable necessarily occasions the prosperity or decay of every nation this is the balance of the annual produce and consumption if the exchangeable value of the annual produce it has already been observed exceeds that of the annual consumption the capital of the society must annually increase in proportion to this excess the society in this case lives within its revenue and what is annually saved out of its revenue is naturally added to its capital and employed so as to increase still further the annual produce if the exchangeable value of the annual produce on the contrary fall short of the annual consumption the capital of the society must annually decay in proportion to this deficiency the expense of the society in this case exceeds its revenue and necessarily encroaches upon its capital its capital therefore must necessarily decay and together with it the exchangeable value of the annual produce of its industry  this balance of produce and consumption is entirely different from what is called the balance of trade it might take place in a nation which had no foreign trade but which was entirely separated from all the world it may take place in the whole globe of the earth of which the wealth population and improvement may be either gradually increasing or gradually decaying  the balance of produce and consumption may be constantly in favor of a nation though what is called the balance of trade be generally against it a nation may import to a greater value than it exports for half a century perhaps together the gold and silver which comes into it during all this time may be all immediately sent out of it its circulating coin may gradually decay different sorts of paper money being substituted in its place and even the debts too which it contracts in the principal nations with whom it deals may be gradually increasing and yet its real wealth the exchangeable value of the annual produce of its lands and labor may during the same period have been increasing in a much greater proportion the state of our north american colonies and the trade which they carried on with great britain before the commencement of the late disturbances may serve as a proof that this is by no means an impossible supposition  chap iv of drawbacks merchants and manufacturers are not contented with the monopoly of the home market but desire likewise the most extensive foreign sale for their goods their country has no jurisdiction in foreign nations and therefore can seldom procure them any monopoly there they are generally obliged therefore to content themselves with petitioning for certain encouragements to exportation  of these encouragements what are called drawbacks seem to be the most reasonable to allow the merchant to draw back upon exportation either the whole or a part of whatever excise or inland duty is imposed upon domestic industry can never occasion the exportation of a greater quantity of goods than what would have been exported had no duty been imposed such encouragements do not tend to turn toward any particular employment a greater share of the capital of the country than what would go to it of its own accord but only to hinder the duty from driving away any part of that share to other employments they tend not to overturn that balance which naturally establishes itself among all the various employments of the society but to hinder it from being overturned by the duty they tend not to destroy but to preserve what it is in most cases advantageous to preserve the natural division and distribution of labor in the society  the same thing may be said of the drawacks upon the reexportation of foreign goods imported which in great britain generally amount to by much the largest part of the duty upon importation half the duties imposed by what is called the old subsidy are drawn back universally except upon goods exported to the british plantations and frequently the whole almost always a part of those imposed by later subsidies and imposts drawbacks were perhaps originally granted for the encouragement of the carrying trade which as the freight of the ships is frequently paid by foreigners in money was supposed to be peculiarly fitted for bringing gold and silver into the country but though the carrying trade certainly deserves no peculiar encouragement though the motive of the institution was perhaps abundantly foolish the institution itself seems reasonable enough such drawbacks cannot force into this trade a greater share of the capital of the country than what would have gone to it of its own accord had there been no duties upon importation they only prevent its being excluded altogether by those duties the carrying trade though it deserves no preference ought not to be precluded but to be left free like all other trades it is a necessary resource for those capitals which cannot find employment either in the agriculture or in the manufactures of the country either in its home trade or in its foreign trade of consumption  the revenue of the customs instead of suffering profits from such drawbacks by that part of the duty which is retained if the whole duties had been retained the foreign goods upon which they are paid could seldom have been exported nor consequently imported for want of a market the duties therefore of which a part is retained would never have been paid  these reasons seem sufficiently to justify drawbacks and would justify them though the whole duties whether upon the produce of domestic industry or upon foreign goods were always drawn back upon exportation the revenue of excise would in this case indeed suffer a little and that of the customs a good deal more but the natural balance of industry the natural division and distribution of labor which is always more or less disturbed by such duties would be more nearly reestablished by such a regulation  these reasons however will justify drawbacks only upon exporting goods to those countries which are altogether foreign and independent not to those in which our merchants and manufacturers enjoy a monopoly a drawback for example upon the exportation of european goods to our american colonies will not always occasion a greater exportation than what would have taken place without it by means of the monopoly which our merchants and manufacturers enjoy there the same quantity might frequently perhaps be sent thither though the whole duties were retained the drawback therefore may frequently be pure loss to the revenue of excise and customs without altering the state of the trade or rendering it in any respect more extensive how far such drawbacks can be justified as a proper encouragement to the industry of our colonies or how far it is advantageous to the mother country that they should be exempted from taxes which are paid by all the rest of their fellow subjects will appear hereafter when i come to treat of colonies  drawbacks however it must always be understood are useful only in those cases in which the goods for the exportation of which they are given are really exported to some foreign country and not clandestinely reimported into our own that some drawbacks particularly those upon tobacco have frequently been abused in this manner and have given occasion to many frauds equally hurtful both to the revenue and to the fair trader is well known  chap v of bounties bounties upon exportation are in great britain frequently petitioned for and sometimes granted to the produce of particular branches of domestic industry by means of them our merchants and manufacturers it is pretended will be enabled to sell their goods as cheap or cheaper than their rivals in the foreign market a greater quantity it is said will thus be exported and the balance of trade consequently turned more in favor of our own country we cannot give our workmen a monopoly in the foreign as we have done in the home market we cannot force foreigners to buy their goods as we have done our own countrymen the next best expedient it has been thought therefore is to pay them for buying it is in this manner that the mercantile system proposes to enrich the whole country and to put money into all our pockets by means of the balance of trade  bounties it is allowed ought to be given to those branches of trade only which cannot be carried on without them but every branch of trade in which the merchant can sell his goods for a price which replaces to him with the ordinary profits of stock the whole capital employed in preparing and sending them to market can be carried on without a bounty every such branch is evidently upon a level with all the other branches of trade which are carried on without bounties and cannot therefore require one more than they those trades only require bounties in which the merchant is obliged to sell his goods for a price which does not replace to him his capital together with the ordinary profit or in which he is obliged to sell them for less than it really costs him to send them to market the bounty is given in order to make up this loss and to encourage him to continue or perhaps to begin a trade of which the expense is supposed to be greater than the returns of which every operation eats up a part of the capital employed in it and which is of such a nature that if all other trades resembled it there would soon be no capital left in the country  the trades it is to be observed which are carried on by means of bounties are the only ones which can be carried on between two nations for any considerable time together in such a manner as that one of them shall always and regularly lose or sell its goods for less than it really costs to send them to market but if the bounty did not repay to the merchant what he would otherwise lose upon the price of his goods his own interest would soon oblige him to employ his stock in another way or to find out a trade in which the price of the goods would replace to him with the ordinary profit the capital employed in sending them to market the effect of bounties like that of all the other expedients of the mercantile system can only be to force the trade of a country into a channel much less advantageous than that in which it would naturally run of its own accord  the ingenious and well informed author of the tracts upon the corn trade has shown very clearly that since the bounty upon the exportation of corn was first established the price of the corn exported valued moderately enough has exceeded that of the corn imported valued very high by a much greater sum than the amount of the whole bounties which have been paid during that period this he imagines upon the true principles of the mercantile system is a clear proof that this forced corn trade is beneficial to the nation the value of the exportation exceeding that of the importation by a much greater sum than the whole extraordinary expense which the public has been at in order to get it exported he does not consider that this extraordinary expense or the bounty is the smallest part of the expense which the exportation of corn really costs the society the capital which the farmer employed in raising it must likewise be taken into the account unless the price of the corn when sold in the foreign markets replaces not only the bounty but this capital together with the ordinary profits of stock the society is a loser by the difference or the national stock is so much diminished but the very reason for which it has been thought necessary to grant a bounty is the supposed insufficiency of the price to do this  the average price of corn it has been said has fallen considerably since the establishment of the bounty that the average price of corn began to fall somewhat toward the end of the last century and has continued to do so during the course of the sixtyfour first years of the present i have already endeavored to show but this event supposing it to be as real as i believe it to be must have happened in spite of the bounty and cannot possibly have happened in consequence of it  in years of plenty it has already been observed the bounty by occasioning an extraordinary exportation necessarily keeps up the price of corn in the home market above what it would naturally fall to to do so was the avowed purpose of the institution in years of scarcity though the bounty is frequently suspended yet the great exportation which it occasions in years of plenty must frequently hinder more or less the plenty of one year from relieving the scarcity of another both in years of plenty and in years of scarcity therefore the bounty necessarily tends to raise the money price of corn somewhat higher than it otherwise would be in the home market  that in the actual state of tillage the bounty must necessarily have this tendency will not i apprehend be disputed by any reasonable person but it has been thought by many people that by securing to the farmer a better price than he could otherwise expect in the actual state of tillage it tends to encourage tillage and that the consequent increase of corn may in a long period of years lower its price more than the bounty can raise it in the actual state which tillage may at the end of that period happen to be in  i answer that this might be the case if the effect of the bounty was to raise the real price of corn or to enable the farmer with an equal quantity of it to maintain a greater number of laborers in the same manner whether liberal moderate or scanty that other laborers are commonly maintained in his neighborhood but neither the bounty it is evident nor any other human institution can have any such effect it is not the real but the nominal price of corn only which can be at all affected by the bounty  the real effect of the bounty is not so much to raise the real value of corn as to degrade the real value of silver or to make an equal quantity of it exchange for a smaller quantity not only of corn but of all other commodities for the money price of corn regulates that of all other commodities  it regulates the money price of labor which must always be such as to enable the labourer to purchase a quantity of corn sufficient to maintain him and his family either in the liberal moderate or scanty manner in which the advancing stationary or declining circumstances of the society oblige his employers to maintain him  it regulates the money price of all the other parts of the rude produce of land which in every period of improvement must bear a certain proportion to that of corn though this proportion is different in different periods it regulates for example the money price of grass and hay of butchers meat of horses and the maintenance of horses of land carriage consequently or of the greater part of the inland commerce of the country  by regulating the money price of all the other parts of the rude produce of land it regulates that of the materials of all manufactures by regulating the money price of labor it regulates that of manufacturing art and industry and by regulating both it regulates that of the complete manufacture the money price of labor and of every thing that is the produce either of land or labor must necessarily either rise or fall in proportion to the money price of corn  though in consequence of the bounty therefore the farmer should be enabled to sell his corn for four shillings the bushel instead of three and sixpence and to pay his landlord a money rent proportionable to this rise in the money price of his produce yet if in consequence of this rise in the price of corn four shillings will purchase no more goods of any other kind than three and sixpence would have done before neither the circumstances of the farmer nor those of the landlord will be in the smallest degree mended by this change the farmer will not be able to cultivate better the landlord will not be able to live better  that degradation in the value of silver which is the effect of the fertility of the mines and which operates equally or very near equally through the greater part of the commercial world is a matter of very little consequence to any particular country the consequent rise of all money prices though it does not make those who receive them really richer does not make them really poorer a service of plate becomes really cheaper and every thing else remains precisely of the same real value as before  but that degradation in the value of silver which being the effect either of the peculiar situation or of the political institutions of a particular country takes place only in that country is a matter of very great consequence which far from tending to make any body really richer tends to make every body really poorer the rise in the money price of all commodities which is in this case peculiar to that country tends to discourage more or less every sort of industry which is carried on within it and to enable foreign nations by furnishing almost all sorts of goods for a smaller quantity of silver than its own workmen can afford to do to undersell them not only in the foreign but even in the home market  it is the peculiar situation of spain and portugal as proprietors of the mines to be the distributors of gold and silver to all the other countries of europe those metals ought naturally therefore to be somewhat cheaper in spain and portugal than in any other part of europe the difference however should be no more than the amount of the freight and insurance and on account of the great value and small bulk of those metals their freight is no great matter and their insurance is the same as that of any other goods of equal value spain and portugal therefore could suffer very little from their peculiar situation if they did not aggravate its disadvantages by their political institutions  spain by taxing and portugal by prohibiting the exportation of gold and silver load that exportation with the expense of smuggling and raise the value of those metals in other countries so much more above what it is in their own by the whole amount of this expense when you dam up a stream of water as soon as the dam is full as much water must run over the damhead as if there was no dam at all the prohibition of exportation cannot detain a greater quantity of gold and silver in spain and portugal than what they can afford to employ than what the annual produce of their land and labor will allow them to employ in coin plate gilding and other ornaments of gold and silver when they have got this quantity the dam is full and the whole stream which flows in afterward must run over the annual exportation of gold and silver from spain and portugal accordingly is by all accounts notwithstanding these restraints very near equal to the whole annual importation as the water however must always be deeper behind the damhead than before it so the quantity of gold and silver which these restraints detain in spain and portugal must in proportion to the annual produce of their land and labor be greater that what is to be found in other countries the higher and stronger the damhead the greater must be the difference in the depth of water behind and before it the higher the tax the higher the penalties with which the prohibition is guarded the more vigilant and severe the police which looks after the execution of the law the greater must be the difference in the proportion of gold and silver to the annual produce of the land and labor of spain and portugal and to that of other countries it is said accordingly to be very considerable and that you frequently find there a profusion of plate in houses where there is nothing else which would in other countries be thought suitable or correspondent to this sort of magnificence the cheapness of gold and silver or what is the same thing the dearness of all commodities which is the necessary effect of this redundancy of the precious metals discourages both the agriculture and manufactures of spain and portugal and enables foreign nations to supply them with many sorts of rude and with almost all sorts of manufactured produce for a smaller quantity of gold and silver than what they themselves can either raise or make them for at home the tax and prohibition operate in two different ways they not only lower very much the value of the precious metals in spain and portugal but by detaining there a certain quantity of those metals which would otherwise flow over other countries they keep up their value in those other countries somewhat above what it otherwise would be and thereby give those countries a double advantage in their commerce with spain and portugal open the floodgates and there will presently be less water above and more below the damhead and it will soon come to a level in both places remove the tax and the prohibition and as the quantity of gold and silver will diminish considerably in spain and portugal so it will increase somewhat in other countries and the value of those metals their proportion to the annual produce of land and labor will soon come to a level or very near to a level in all the loss which spain and portugal could sustain by this exportation of their gold and silver would be altogether nominal and imaginary the nominal value of their goods and of the annual produce of their land and labor would fall and would be expressed or represented by a smaller quantity of silver than before but their real value would be the same as before and would be sufficient to maintain command and employ the same quantity of labor as the nominal value of their goods would fall the real value of what remained of their gold and silver would rise and a smaller quantity of those metals would answer all the same purposes of commerce and circulation which had employed a greater quantity before the gold and silver which would go abroad would not go abroad for nothing but would bring back an equal value of goods of some kind or another those goods too would not be all matters of mere luxury and expense to be consumed by idle people who produce nothing in return for their consumption as the real wealth and revenue of idle people would not be augmented by this extraordinary exportation of gold and silver so neither would their consumption be much augmented by it those goods would probably the greater part of them and certainly some part of them consist in materials tools and provisions for the employment and maintenance of industrious people who would reproduce with a profit the full value of their consumption a part of the dead stock of the society would thus be turned into active stock and would put into motion a greater quantity of industry than had been employed before the annual produce of their land and labor would immediately be augmented a little and in a few years would probably be augmented a great deal their industry being thus relieved from one of the most oppressive burdens which it at present labors under  the bounty upon the exportation of corn necessarily operates exactly in the same way as this absurd policy of spain and portugal whatever be the actual state of tillage it renders our corn somewhat dearer in the home market than it otherwise would be in that state and somewhat cheaper in the foreign and as the average money price of corn regulates more or less that of all other commodities it lowers the value of silver considerably in the one and tends to raise it a little in the other it enables foreigners the dutch in particular not only to eat our corn cheaper than they otherwise could do but sometimes to eat it cheaper than even our own people can do upon the same occasions as we are assured by an excellent authority that of sir matthew decker it hinders our own workmen from furnishing their goods for so small a quantity of silver as they otherwise might do and enables the dutch to furnish theirs for a smaller it tends to render our manufactures somewhat dearer in every market and theirs somewhat cheaper than they otherwise would be and consequently to give their industry a double advantage over our own  the bounty as it raises in the home market not the real but only the nominal price of our corn as it augments not the quantity of labor which a certain quantity of corn can maintain and employ but only the quantity of silver which it will exchange for it discourages our manufactures without rendering the smallest real service either to our farmers or country gentlemen it puts indeed a little more money into the pockets of both and it will perhaps be somewhat difficult to persuade the greater part of them that this is not rendering them a very real service but if this money sinks in its value in the quantity of labor provisions and commodities of all different kinds which it is capable of purchasing as much as it rises in its quantity the service will be merely nominal and imaginary  there is perhaps but one set of men in the whole commonwealth to whom the bounty either was or could be really serviceable these were the corn merchants the exporters and importers of corn in years of plenty the bounty necessarily occasioned a greater exportation than would otherwise have taken place and by hindering the plenty of one year from relieving the scarcity of another it occasioned in years of scarcity a greater importation than would otherwise have been necessary it increased the business of the corn merchant in both and in years of scarcity it not only enabled him to import a greater quantity but to sell it for a better price and consequently with a greater profit than he could otherwise have made if the plenty of one year had not been more or less hindered from relieving the scarcity of another it is in this set of men accordingly that i have observed the greatest zeal for the continuance or renewal of the bounty  our country gentlemen when they imposed the high duties upon the importation of foreign corn which in times of moderate plenty amount to a prohibition and when they established the bounty seem to have imitated the conduct of our manufacturers by the one institution they secured to themselves the monopoly of the home market and by the other they endeavored to prevent that market from ever being overstocked with their commodity by both they endeavored to raise its real value in the same manner as our manufacturers had by the like institutions raised the real value of many different sorts of manufactured goods they did not perhaps attend to the great and essential difference which nature has established between corn and almost every other sort of goods when either by the monopoly of the home market or by a bounty upon exportation you enable our woollen or linen manufacturers to sell their goods for somewhat a better price than they otherwise could get for them you raise not only the nominal but the real price of those goods you render them equivalent to a greater quantity of labor and subsistence you increase not only the nominal but the real profit the real wealth and revenue of those manufacturers and you enable them either to live better themselves or to employ a greater quantity of labor in those particular manufactures you really encourage those manufactures and direct toward them a greater quantity of the industry of the country than what would probably go to them of its own accord but when by the like institutions you raise the nominal or money price of corn you do not raise its real value you do not increase the real wealth the real revenue either of our farmers or country gentlemen you do not encourage the growth of corn because you do not enable them to maintain and employ more laborers in raising it the nature of things has stamped upon corn a real value which no human institution can alter no bounty upon exportation no monopoly of the home market can raise it the freest competition cannot lower it through the world in general that value is equal to the quantity of labor which it can maintain and in every particular place it is equal to the quantity of labor which it can maintain in the way whether liberal moderate or scanty in which labor is commonly maintained in that place woollen or linen cloth are not the regulating commodities by which the real value of all other commodities must be finally measured and determined corn is the real value of every other commodity is finally measured and determined by the proportion which its average money price bears to the average money price of corn the real value of corn does not vary with those variations in its average money price which sometimes occur from one century to another it is the real value of silver which varies with them  bounties upon the exportation of any homemade commodity are liable first to that general objection which may be made to all the different expedients of the mercantile system the objection of forcing some part of the industry of the country into a channel less advantageous than that in which it would run of its own accord and secondly to the particular objection of forcing it not only into a channel that is less advantageous but into one that is actually disadvantageous the trade which cannot be carried on but by means of a bounty being necessarily a losting trade the bounty upon the exportation of corn is liable to this further objection that it can in no respect promote the raising of that particular commodity of which it was meant to encourage the production when our country gentlemen therefore demanded the establishment of the bounty though they acted in imitation of our merchants and manufacturers they did not act with that complete comprehension of their own interest which commonly directs the conduct of those two other orders of people they loaded the public revenue with a very considerable expense but they did not in any respect increase the real value of their own commodity and by lowering somewhat the real value of silver they discouraged in some degree the general industry of the country and instead of advancing retarded more or less the improvement of their own lands which necessarily depends upon the general industry of the country  to encourage the production of any commodity a bounty upon production one should imagine would have a more direct operation than one upon exportation it has however been more rarely granted the prejudices established by the commercial system have taught us to believe that national wealth arises more immediately from exportation than from production it has been more favored accordingly as the more immediate means of bringing money into the country bounties upon production it has been said too have been found by experience more liable to frauds than those upon exportation how far this is true i know not that bounties upon exportation have been abused to many fraudulent purposes is very well known but it is not the interest of merchants and manufacturers the great inventors of all these expedients that the home market should be overstocked with their goods an event which a bounty upon production might sometimes occasion a bounty upon exportation by enabling them to send abroad the surplus part and to keep up the price of what remains in the home market effectually prevents this of all the expedients of the mercantile system accordingly it is the one of which they are the fondest i have known the different undertakers of some particular works agree privately among themselves to give a bounty out of their own pockets upon the exportation of a certain proportion of the goods which they dealt in this expedient succeeded so well that it more than doubled the price of their goods in the home market notwithstanding a very considerable increase in the produce the operation of the bounty upon corn must have been wonderfully different if it has lowered the money price of that commodity  something like a bounty upon production however has been granted upon some particular occasions the encouragements given to the whiteherring and whalefisheries may perhaps be considered as somewhat of this nature they tend directly to render the goods cheaper in the home market than they otherwise would be in the actual production in other respects their effects are the same as those of bounties upon exportation by means of them a part of the capital of the country is employed in bringing goods to market of which the price does not repay the cost together with the ordinary profits of stock but though the bounties to those fisheries do not contribute to the opulence of the nation they may perhaps be defended as conducing to its defense by augmenting the number of its sailors and shipping this may frequently be done by means of such bounties at a much smaller expense than by keeping up a great standing navy if i may use such an expression in time of peace in the same manner as a standing army  some other bounties may be vindicated perhaps upon the same principle it is of importance that the kingdom should depend as little as possible upon its neighbors for the manufactures necessary for its defense and if these cannot otherwise be maintained at home it is reasonable that all other branches of industry should be taxed in order to support them the bounties upon the importation of naval stores from america upon british made failcloth and upon british made gunpowder may perhaps all three be vindicated upon this principle the first is a bounty upon the production of america for the use of great britain the two others are bounties upon exportation  what is called a bounty is sometimes no more than a drawback and consequently is not liable to the same objections as what is properly a bounty the bounty for example upon refined sugar exported may be considered as a drawback of the duties upon the brown and muscovado sugars from which it is made the bounty upon wrought silk exported a drawback of the duties upon raw and thrown silk imported the bounty upon gunpowder exported a drawback of the duties upon brimstone and saltpetre imported in the language of the customs those allowances only are called drawbacks which are given upon goods exported in the same form in which they are imported when that form has been altered by manufacture of any kind they are called bounties  premiums given by the public to artists and manufacturers who excel in their particular occupations are not liable to the same objections as bounties by encouraging extraordinary dexterity and ingenuity they serve to keep up the emulation of the workmen actually employed in those respective occupations and are not considerable enough to turn toward any one of them a greater share of the capital of the country than what would go to it of its own accord their tendency is not to overturn the natural balance of employments but to render the work which is done in each as perfect and complete as possible the expense of premiums besides is very trifling that of bounties very great the bounty upon corn alone has sometimes cost the public in one year more than three hundred thousand pounds  bounties are sometimes called premiums as drawbacks are sometimes called bounties but we must in all cases attend to the nature of the thing without paying any regard to the word  i cannot conclude this chapter concerning bounties without observing that the praises which have been bestowed upon the law which establishes the bounty upon the exportation of corn and upon that system of regulations which is connected with it are altogether unmerited a particular examination of the nature of the corn trade and of the principal british laws which relate to it will sufficiently demonstrate the truth of this assertion the great importance of this subject must justify the length of the digression  the trade of the corn merchant is composed of four different branches which though they may sometimes be all carried on by the same person are in their own nature four separate and distinct trades these are first the trade of the inland dealer secondly that of the merchant importer for home consumption thirdly that of the merchant exporter of home produce for foreign consumption and fourthly that of the merchant carrier or of the importer of corn in order to export it again  i the interest of the inland dealer and that of the great body of the people how opposite soever they may at first sight appear are even in years of the greatest scarcity exactly the same it is his interest to raise the price of his corn as high as the real scarcity of the season requires and it can never be his interest to raise it higher by raising the price he discourages the consumption and puts every body more or less but particularly the inferior ranks of people upon thrift and good management if by raising it too high he discourages the consumption so much that the supply of the season is likely to go beyond the consumption of the season and to last for some time after the next crop begins to come in he runs the hazard not only of losing a considerable part of his corn by natural causes but of being obliged to sell what remains of it for much less than what he might have had for it several months before if by not raising the price high enough he discourages the consumption so little that the supply of the season is likely to fall short of the consumption of the season he not only loses a part of the profit which he might otherwise have made but he exposes the people to suffer before the end of the season instead of the hardships of a dearth the dreadful horrors of a famine it is the interest of the people that their daily weekly and monthly consumption should be proportioned as exactly as possible to the supply of the season the interest of the inland corn dealer is the same by supplying them as nearly as he can judge in this proportion he is likely to sell all his corn for the highest price and with the greatest profit and his knowledge of the state of the crop and of his daily weekly and monthly sales enable him to judge with more or less accuracy how far they really are supplied in this manner without intending the interest of the people he is necessarily led by a regard to his own interest to treat them even in years of scarcity pretty much in the same manner as the prudent master of a vessel is sometimes obliged to treat his crew when he foresees that provisions are likely to run short he puts them upon short allowance though from excess of caution he should sometimes do this without any real necessity yet all the inconveniences which his crew can thereby suffer are inconsiderable in comparison of the danger misery and ruin to which they might sometimes be exposed by a less provident conduct though from excess of avarice in the same manner the inland corn merchant should sometimes raise the price of his corn somewhat higher than the scarcity of the season requires yet all the inconveniences which the people can suffer from this conduct which effectually secures them from a famine in the end of the season are inconsiderable in comparison of what they might have been exposed to by a more liberal way of dealing in the beginning of it the corn merchant himself is likely to suffer the most by this excess of avarice not only from the indignation which it generally excites against him but though he should escape the effects of this indignation from the quantity of corn which it necessarily leaves upon his hands in the end of the season and which if the next season happens to prove favorable he must always fell for a much lower price than he might otherwise have had  were it possible indeed for one great company of merchants to possess themselves of the whole crop of an extensive country it might perhaps be their interest to deal with it as the dutch are said to do with the spiceries of the molluccas to destroy or throw away a considerable part of it in order to keep up the price of the rest but it is scarce possible even by the violence of law to establish such an extensive monopoly with regard to corn and wherever the law leaves the trade free it is of all commodities the least liable to be engrossed or monopolised by the force of a few large capitals which buy up the greater part of it not only its value far exceeds what the capitals of a few private men are capable of purchasing but supposing they were capable of purchasing it the manner in which it is produced renders this purchase altogether impracticable as in every civilized country it is the commodity of which the annual consumption is the greatest so a greater quantity of industry is annually employed in producing corn than in producing any other commodity when it first comes from the ground too it is necessarily divided among a greater number of owners than any other commodity and these owners can never be collected into one place like a number of independent manufacturers but are necessarily scattered through all the different corners of the country these first owners either immediately supply the consumers in their own neighborhood or they supply other inland dealers who supply those consumers the inland dealers in corn therefore including both the farmer and the baker are necessarily more numerous than the dealers in any other commodity and their dispersed situation renders it altogether impossible for them to enter into any general combination if in a year of scarcity therefore any of them should find that he had a good deal more corn upon hand than at the current price he could hope to dispose of before the end of the season he would never think of keeping up this price to his own loss and to the sole benefit of his rivals and competitors but would immediately lower it in order to get rid of his corn before the new crop began to come in the same motives the same interests which would thus regulate the conduct of any one dealer would regulate that of every other and oblige them all in general to fell their corn at the price which according to the best of their judgment was most suitable to the scarcity or plenty of the season  whoever examines with attention the history of the dearths and famines which have afflicted any part of europe during either the course of the present or that of the two preceding centuries of several of which we have pretty exact accounts will find i believe that a dearth never has arisen from any combination among the inland dealers in corn nor from any other cause but a real scarcity occasioned sometimes perhaps and in some particular places by the waste of war but in by far the greatest number of cases by the fault of the seasons and that a famine has never arisen from any other cause but the violence of government attempting by improper means to remedy the inconveniences of a dearth  in an extensive corn country between all the different parts of which there is a free commerce and communication the scarcity occasioned by the most unfavourable seasons can never be so great as to produce a famine and the scantiest crop if managed with frugality and economy will maintain through the year the same number of people that are commonly fed in a more affluent manner by one of moderate plenty the seasons most unfavourable to the crop are those of excessive drought or excessive rain but as corn grows equally upon high and low lands upon grounds that are disposed to be too wet and upon those that are disposed to be too dry either the drought or the rain which is hurtful to one part of the country is favorable to another and though both in the wet and in the dry season the crop is a good deal less than in one more properly tempered yet in both what is lost in one part of the country is in some measure compensated by what is gained in the other in rice countries where the crop not only requires a very moist soil but where in a certain period of its growing it must be laid under water the effects of a drought are much more dismal even in such countries however the drought is perhaps scarce ever so universal as necessarily to occasion a famine if the government would allow a free trade the drought in bengal a few years ago might probably have occasioned a very great dearth some improper regulations some injudicious restraints imposed by the servants of the east india company upon the rice trade contributed perhaps to turn that dearth into a famine  when the government in order to remedy the inconveniences of a dearth orders all the dealers to sell their corn at what it supposes a reasonable price it either hinders them from bringing it to market which may sometimes produce a famine even in the beginning of the season or if they bring it thither it enables the people and thereby encourages them to consume it so fast as must necessarily produce a famine before the end of the season the unlimited unrestrained freedom of the corn trade as it is the only effectual preventative of the miseries of a famine so it is the best palliative of the inconveniences of a dearth for the inconveniences of a real scarcity cannot be remedied they can only be palliated no trade deserves more the full protection of the law and no trade requires it so much because no trade is so much exposed to popular odium  in years of scarcity the inferior ranks of people impute their distress to the avarice of the corn merchant who becomes the object of their hatred and indignation instead of making profit upon such occasions therefore he is often in danger of being utterly ruined and of having his magazines plundered and destroyed by their violence it is in years of scarcity however when prices are high that the corn merchant expects to make his principal profit he is generally in contract with some farmers to furnish him for a certain number of years with a certain quantity of corn at a certain price this contract price is settled according to what is supposed to be the moderate and reasonable that is the ordinary or average price which before the late years of scarcity was commonly about eight and twenty shillings for the quarter of wheat and for that of other grain in proportion in years of scarcity therefore the corn merchant buys a great part of his corn for the ordinary price and sells it for a much higher that this extraordinary profit however is no more than sufficient to put his trade upon a fair level with other trades and to compensate the many losses which he sustains upon other occasions both from the perishable nature of the commodity itself and from the frequent and unforeseen fluctuations of its price seems evident enough from this single circumstance that great fortunes are as seldom made in this as in any other trade the popular odium however which attends it in years of scarcity the only years in which it can be very profitable renders people of character and fortune averse to enter into it it is abandoned to an inferior set of dealers and millers bakers mealmen and meal factors together with a number of wretched hucksters are almost the only middle people that in the home market come between the grower and the consumer  the ancient policy of europe instead of discountenancing this popular odium against a trade so beneficial to the public seems on the contrary to have authorized and encouraged it  by the  th and  th of edward vi cap    it was enacted that whoever should buy any corn or grain with intent to sell it again should be reputed an unlawful engrosser and should for the first fault suffer two months imprisonment and forfeit the value of the corn for the second suffer six months imprisonment and forfeit double the value and for the third be set in the pillory suffer imprisonment during the kings pleasure and forfeit all his goods and chattels the ancient policy of most other parts of europe was no better than that of england  our ancestors seem to have imagined that the people would buy their corn cheaper of the farmer than of the corn merchant who they were afraid would require over and above the price which he paid to the farmer an exorbitant profit to himself they endeavored therefore to annihilate his trade altogether they even endeavored to hinder as much as possible any middle man of any kind from coming in between the grower and the consumer and this was the meaning of the many restraints which they imposed upon the trade of those whom they called kidders or carries of corn a trade which nobody was allowed to exercise without a license ascertaining his qualifications as a man of probity and fair dealing the authority of three justices of the peace was by the statute of edward vi necessary in order to grant this license but even this restraint was afterward thought insufficient and by a statute of elizabeth the privilege of granting it was confined to the quarter sessions  the ancient policy of europe endeavored in this manner to regulate agriculture the great trade of the country by maxims quite different from those which it established with regard to manufactures the great trade of the towns by leaving the farmer no other customers but either the consumer or his immediate factors the kidders and carriers of corn it endeavored to force him to exercise the trade not only of a farmer but of a corn merchant or corn retailer on the contrary it in many cases prohibited the manufacturer from exercising the trade of a shopkeeper or from selling his own goods by retail it meant by the one law to promote the general interest of the country or to render corn cheap without perhaps its being well understood how this was to be done by the other it meant to promote that of a particular order of men the shopkeepers who would be so much undersold by the manufacturer it was supposed that their trade would be ruined if he was allowed to retail at all  the manufacturer however though he had been allowed to keep a shop and to sell his own goods by retail could not have undersold the common shopkeeper whatever part of his capital he might have placed in his shop he must have withdrawn it from his manufacture in order to carry on his business on a level with that of other people as he must have had the profit of a manufacturer on the one part so he must have had that of a shopkeeper upon the other let us suppose for example that in the particular town where he lived ten per cent was the ordinary profit both of manufacturing and shopkeeping stock he must in this case have charged upon every piece of his own goods which he sold in his shop a profit of twenty per cent when he carried them from his workhouse to his shop he must have valued them at the price for which he could have sold them to a dealer or shopkeeper who would have bought them by wholesale if he valued them lower he lost a part of the profit of his manufacturing capital when again he sold them from his shop unless he got the same price at which a shopkeeper would have sold them he lost a part of the profit of his shopkeeping capital though he might appear therefore to make a double profit upon the same piece of goods yet as these goods made successively a part of two distinct capitals he made but a single profit upon the whole capital employed about them and if he made less than this profit he was a loser or did not employ his whole capital with the same advantage as the greater part of his neighbors  what the manufacturer was prohibited to do the farmer was in some measure enjoined to do to divide his capital between two different employments to keep one part of it in his granaries and stack yard for supplying the occasional demands of the market and to employ the other in the cultivation of his land but as he could not afford to employ the latter for less than the ordinary profits of farming stock so he could as little afford to employ the former for less than the ordinary profits of mercantile stock whether the stock which really carried on the business of the corn merchant belonged to the person who was called a farmer or to the person who was called a corn merchant an equal profit was in both cases requisite in order to indemnify its owner for employing it in this manner in order to put his business upon a level with other trades and in order to hinder him from having an interest to change it as soon as possible for some other the farmer therefore who was thus forced to exercise the trade of a corn merchant could not afford to sell his corn cheaper than any other corn merchant would have been obliged to do in the case of a free competition  the dealer who can employ his whole stock in one single branch of business has an advantage of the same kind with the workman who can employ his whole labor in one single operation as the latter acquires a dexterity which enables him with the same two hands to perform a much greater quantity of work so the former acquires so easy and ready a method of transacting his business of buying and disposing of his goods that with the same capital he can transact a much greater quantity of business as the one can commonly afford his work a good deal cheaper so the other can commonly afford his goods somewhat cheaper than if his stock and attention were both employed about a greater variety of objects the greater part of manufacturers could not afford to retail their own goods so cheap as a vigilant and active shopkeeper whose sole business it was to buy them by wholesale and to retail them again the greater part of farmers could still less afford to retail their own corn or to supply the inhabitants of a town at perhaps four or five miles distance from the greater part of them so cheap as a vigilant and active corn merchant whose sole business it was to purchase corn by wholesale to collect it into a great magazine and to retail it again  the law which prohibited the manufacturer from exercising the trade of a shopkeeper endeavored to force this division in the employment of stock to go on faster than it might otherwise have done the law which obliged the farmer to exercife the trade of a corn merchant endeavored to hinder it from going on so fast both laws were evident violations of natural liberty and therefore unjust and they were both too as impolitick as they were unjust it is the interest of every society that things of this kind should never either be forced or obstructed the man who employs either his labor or his stock in a greater variety of ways than his situation renders necessary can never hurt his neighbor by underselling him he may hurt himself and he generally does so jack of all trades will never be rich says the proverb but the law ought always to trust people with the care of their own interest as in their local situations they must generally be able to judge better of it than the legislator can do the law however which obliged the farmer to exercise the trade of a corn merchant was by far the most pernicious of the two  it obstructed not only that division in the employment of stock which is so advantageous to every society but it obstructed likewise the improvement and cultivation of the land by obliging the farmer to carry on two trades instead of one it forced him to divide his capital into two parts of which one only could be employed in cultivation but if he had been at liberty to sell his whole crop to a corn merchant as fast as he could thresh it out his whole capital might have returned immediately to the land and have been employed in buying more cattle and hiring more servants in order to improve and cultivate it better but by being obliged to sell his corn by retail he was obliged to keep a great part of his capital in his granaries and stack yard through the year and could not therefore cultivate so well as with the same capital he might otherwise have done this law therefore necessarily obstructed the improvement of the land and instead of tending to render corn cheaper must have tended to render it scarcer and therefore dearer than it would otherwise have been  after the business of the farmer that of the corn merchant is in reality the trade which if properly protected and encouraged would contribute the most to the raising of corn it would support the trade of the farmer in the same manner as the trade of the wholesale dealer supports that of the manufacturer  the wholesale dealer by affording a ready market to the manufacturer by taking his goods off his hand as fast as he can make them and by sometimes even advancing their price to him before he has made them enables him to keep his whole capital and sometimes even more than his whole capital constantly employed in manufacturing and consequently to manufacture a much greater quantity of goods than if he was obliged to dispose of them himself to the immediate consumers or even to the retailers as the capital of the wholesale merchant too is generally sufficient to replace that of many manufacturers this intercourse between him and them interests the owner of a large capital to support the owners of a great number of small ones and to assist them in those losses and misfortunes which might otherwise prove ruinous to them  an intercourse of the same kind universally established between the farmers and the corn merchants would be attended with effects equally beneficial to the farmers they would be enabled to keep their whole capitals and even more than their whole capitals constantly employed in cultivation in case of any of those accidents to which no trade is more liable than theirs they would find in their ordinary customer the wealthy corn merchant a person who had both an interest to support them and the ability to do it and they would not as at present be entirely dependent upon the forbearance of their landlord or the mercy of his steward were it possible as perhaps it is not to establish this intercourse universally and all at once were it possible to turn all at once the whole farming stock of the kingdom to its proper business the cultivation of land withdrawing it from every other employment into which any part of it may be at present diverted and were it possible in order to support and assist upon occasion the operations of this great stock to provide all at once another stock almost equally great it is not perhaps very easy to imagine how great how extensive and how sudden would be the improvement which this change of circumstances would alone produce upon the whole face of the country  the statute of edward vi therefore by prohibiting as much as possible any middle man from coming in between the grower and the consumer endeavored to annihilate a trade of which the free exercise is not only the best palliative of the inconveniences of a dearth but the best preventative of that calamity after the trade of the farmer no trade contributing so much to the growing of corn as that of the corn merchant  the rigor of this law was afterward softened by several subsequent statutes which successively permitted the engrossing of corn when the price of wheat should not exceed twenty twentyfour thirtytwo and forty shillings the quarter at last by the   th of charles ii c   the engrossing or buying of corn in order to sell it again as long as the price of wheat did not exceed fortyeight shillings the quarter and that of other grain in proportion was declared lawful to all persons not being forestallers that is not selling again in the same market within three months all the freedom which the trade of the inland corn dealer has ever yet enjoyed was bestowed upon it by this statute the statute of the twelfth of the present king which repeals almost all the other ancient laws against engrossers and forestallers does not repeal the restrictions of this particular statute which therefore still continue in force  this statute however authorizes in some measure two very absurd popular prejudices  first it supposes that when the price of wheat has risen so high as fortyeight shillings the quarter and that of other grain in proportion corn is likely to be so engrossed as to hurt the people but from what has been already said it seems evident enough that corn can at no price be so engrossed by the inland dealers as to hurt the people and fortyeight shillings the quarter besides though it may be considered as a very high price yet in years of scarcity it is a price which frequently takes place immediately after harvest when scarce any part of the new crop can be sold off and when it is impossible even for ignorance to suppose that any part of it can be so engrossed as to hurt the people  secondly it supposes that there is a certain price at which corn is likely to be forestalled that is bought up in order to be sold again soon after in the same market so as to hurt the people but if a merchant ever buys up corn either going to a particular market or in a particular market in order to sell it again soon after in the same market it must be because he judges that the market cannot be so liberally supplied through the whole season as upon that particular occasion and that the price therefore must soon rise if he judges wrong in this and if the price does not rise he not only loses the whole profit of the stock which he employs in this manner but a part of the stock itself by the expense and loss which necessarily attends the storing and keeping of corn he hurts himself therefore much more essentially than he can hurt even the particular people whom he may hinder from supplying themselves upon that particular market day because they may afterward supply themselves just as cheap upon any other market day if he judges right instead of hurting the great body of the people he renders them a most important service by making them feel the inconveniences of a dearth somewhat earlier than they otherwise might do he prevents their feeling them afterward so severely as they certainly would do if the cheapness of price encouraged them to consume faster than suited the real scarcity of the season when the soarcity is real the best thing that can be done for the people is to divide the inconveniences of it as equally as possible through all the different months and weeks and days of the year the interest of the corn merchant makes him study to do this as exactly as he can and as no other person can have either the same interest or the same knowledge or the same abilities to do it so exactly as he this most important operation of commerce ought to be trusted entirely to him or in other words the corn trade so far at least as concerns the supply of the home market ought to be left perfectly free  the popular fear of engrossing and forestalling may be compared to the popular terrors and suspicions of witchcraft the unfortunate wretches accused of this latter crime were not more innocent of the misfortunes imputed to them than those who have been accused of the former the law which put an end to all prosecutions against witchcraft which put it out of any mans power to gratify his own malice by accusing his neighbor of that imaginary crime seems effectually to have put an end to those fears and suspicions by taking away the great cause which encouraged and supported them the law which should restore entire freedom to the inland trade of corn would probably prove as effectual to put an end to the popular fears of engrossing and forestalling  the   th of charles ii c   however with all its imperfections has perhaps contributed more both to the plentiful supply of the home market and to the increase of tillage than any other law in the statute book it is from this law that the inland corn trade has derived all the liberty and protection which it has ever yet enjoyed and both the supply of the home market and the interest of tillage are much more effectually promoted by the inland than either by the importation or exportation trade  the proportion of the average quantity of all sorts of grain imported into great britain to that of all sorts of grain consumed it has been computed by the author of the tracts upon the corn trade does not exceed that of one to five hundred and seventy for supplying the home market therefore the importance of the inland trade must be to that of the importation trade as five hundred and seventy to one  the average quantity of all sorts of grain exported from great britain does not according to the same author exceed the one and thirtieth part of the annual produce for the encouragement of tillage therefore by providing a market for the home produce the importance of the inland trade must be to that of the exportation trade as thirty to one  i have no great faith in political arithmetic and i mean not to warrant the exactness of either of these computations i mention them only in order to show of how much less consequence in the opinion of the most judicious and experienced persons the foreign trade of corn is than the home trade the great cheapness of corn in the years immediately preceding the establishment of the bounty may perhaps with reason be ascribed in some measure to the operation of this statute of charles ii which had been enacted about five and twenty years before and which had therefore full time to produce its effect  a very few words will sufficiently explain all that i have to say concerning the other three branches of the corn trade  ii the trade of the merchant importer of foreign corn for home consumption evidently contributes to the immediate supply of the home market and must so far be immediately beneficial to the great body of the people it tends indeed to lower somewhat the average money price of corn but not to diminish its real value or the quantity of labor which it is capable of maintaining if importation was at all times free our farmers and country gentlemen would probably one year with another get less money for their corn than they do at present when importation is at most times in effect prohibited but the money which they got would be of more value would buy more goods of all other kinds and would employ more labor their real wealth their real revenue therefore would be the same as at present though it might be expressed by a smaller quantity of silver and they would neither be disabled nor discouraged from cultivating corn as much as they do at present on the contrary as the rise in the real value of silver in consequence of lowering the money price of corn lowers somewhat the money price of all other commodities it gives the industry of the country where it takes place some advantage in all foreign markets and thereby tends to encourage and increase that industry but the extent of the home market for corn must be in proportion to the general industry of the country where it grows or to the number of those who produce something else and therefore have something else or what comes to the same thing the price of something else to give in exchange for corn but in every country the home market as it is the nearest and most convenient so is it likewise the greatest and most important market for corn that rise in the real value of silver therefore which is the effect of lowering the average money price of corn tends to enlarge the greatest and most important market for corn and thereby to encourage instead of discouraging its growth  by the   d of charles ii c    the importation of wheat whenever the price in the home market did not exceed fiftythree shillings and four pence the quarter was subjected to a duty of sixteen shillings the quarter and to a duty of eight shillings whenever the price did not exceed four pounds the former of these two prices has for more than a century past taken place only in times of very great scarcity and the latter has so far as i know not taken place at all yet till wheat had risen above this latter price it was by this statute subjected to a very high duty and till it had risen above the former to a duty which amounted to a prohibition the importation of other sorts of grain was restrained by duties proportionably high  the distress which in years of scarcity the strict execution of this statute might have brought upon the people would probably have been very great but upon such occasions its execution was generally suspended by temporary statutes which permitted for a limited time the importation of foreign corn the necessity of these temporary statutes sufficiently demonstrates the impropriety of this general one  these restraints upon importation though prior to the establishment of the bounty were dictated by the same spirit by the same principles which afterward enacted that regulation how hurtful soever in themselves these or some other restraints upon importation became necessary in consequence of that regulation if when wheat was either below fortyeight shillings the quarter or not much above it foreign corn could have been imported either duty free or upon paying only a small duty it might have been exported again with the benefit of the bounty to the great loss of the public revenue and to the entire perversion of the institution of which the object was to extend the market for the home growth not that for the growth of foreign countries  iii the trade of the merchant exporter of corn for foreign consumption certainly does not contribute directly to the plentiful supply of the home market it does so however indirectly from whatever source this supply may be usually drawn whether from home growth or from foreign importation unless more corn is either usually grown or usually imported into the country than what is usually consumed in it the supply of the home market can never be very plentiful but unless the surplus can in all ordinary cases be exported the growers will be careful never to grow more and the importers never to import more than what the bare consumption of the home market requires that market will very seldom be overstocked but it will generally be understocked the people whose business it is to supply it being generally afraid lest their goods should be left upon their hands the prohibition of exportation limits the improvement and cultivation of the country to what the supply of its own inhabitants requires the freedom of exportation enables it to extend its cultivation for the supply of foreign nations  by the   th of charles ii c   the exportation of corn was permitted whenever the price of wheat did not exceed forty shillings the quarter and that of other grain in proportion by the   th of the same prince this liberty was extended till the price of wheat exceeded fortyeight shillings the quarter and by the   d to all higher prices a poundage indeed was to be paid to the king upon such exportation but all grain was rated so low in the book of rates that this poundage amounted only upon wheat to a shilling upon oats to fourpence and upon all other grain to sixpence the quarter by the  st of william and mary the act which established the bounty this small duty was virtually taken off whenever the price of wheat did not exceed fortyeight shillings the quarter and by the   th and   th of william iii c  0 it was expressly taken off at all higher prices  the trade of the merchant exporter was in this manner not only encouraged by a bounty but rendered much more free than that of the inland dealer by the last of these statutes corn could be engrossed at any price for exportation but it could not be engrossed for inland sale except when the price did not exceed fortyeight shillings the quarter the interest of the inland dealer however it has already been shown can never be opposite to that of the great body of the people that of the merchant exporter may and in fact sometimes is if while his own country labors under a dearth a neighboring country should be afflicted with a famine it might be his interest to carry corn to the latter country in such quantities as might very much aggravate the calamities of the dearth the plentiful supply of the home market was not the direct object of those statutes but under the pretense of encouraging agriculture to raise the money price of corn as high as possible and thereby to occasion as much as possible a constant dearth in the home market by the discouragement of importation the supply of that market even in times of great scarcity was confined to the home growth and by the encouragement of exportation when the price was so high as fortyeight shillings the quarter that market was not even in times of considerable scarcity allowed to enjoy the whole of that growth the temporary laws prohibiting for a limited time the exportation of corn and taking off for a limited time the duties upon its importation expedients to which great britain has been obliged so frequently to have recourse sufficiently demonstrate the impropriety of her general system had that system been good she would not so frequently have been reduced to the necessity of departing from it  were all nations to follow the liberal system of free exportation and free importation the different states into which a great continent was divided would so far resemble the different provinces of a great empire as among the different provinces of a great empire the freedom of the inland trade appears both from reason and experience not only the best palliative of a dearth but the most effectual preventative of a famine so would the freedom of the exportation and importation trade be among the different states into which a great continent was divided the larger the continent the easier the communication through all the different parts of it both by land and by water the less would any one particular part of it ever be exposed to either of these calamities the scarcity of any one country being more likely to be relieved by the plenty of some other but very few countries have entirely adopted this liberal system the freedom of the corn trade is almost every where more or less restrained and in many countries is confined by such absurd regulations as frequently aggravate the unavoidable misfortune of a dearth into the dreadful calamity of a famine the demand of such countries for corn may frequently become so great and so urgent that a small state in their neighborhood which happened at the same time to be laboring under some degree of dearth could not venture to supply them without exposing itself to the like dreadful calamity the very bad policy of one country may thus render it in some measure dangerous and imprudent to establish what would otherwise be the best policy in another the unlimited freedom of exportation however would be much less dangerous in great states in which the growth being much greater the supply could seldom be much affected by any quantity of corn that was likely to be exported in a swiss canton or in some of the little states of italy it may perhaps sometimes be necessary to restrain the exportation of corn in such great countries as france or england it scarce ever can to hinder besides the farmer from sending his goods at all times to the best market is evidently to sacrifice the ordinary laws of justice to an idea of public utility to a sort of reasons of state an act of legislative authority which ought to be exercised only which can be pardoned only in cases of the most urgent necessity the price at which the exportation of corn is prohibited if it is ever to be prohibited ought always to be a very high price  the laws concerning corn may every where be compared to the laws concerning religion the people feel themselves so much interested in what relates either to their subsistence in this life or to their happiness in a life to come that government must yield to their prejudices and in order to preserve the public tranquillity establish that system which they approve of it is upon this account perhaps that we so seldom find a reasonable system established with regard to either of those two capital objects  iv the trade of the merchant carrier or of the importer of foreign corn in order to export it again contributes to the plentiful supply of the home market it is not indeed the direct purpose of his trade to sell his corn there but he will generally be willing to do so and even for a good deal less money than he might expect in a foreign market because he saves in this manner the expense of loading and unloading of freight and insurance the inhabitants of the country which by means of the carrying trade becomes the magazine and storehouse for the supply of other countries can very seldom be in want themselves though the carrying trade might thus contribute to reduce the average money price of corn in the home market it would not thereby lower its real value it would only raise somewhat the real value of silver  the carrying trade was in effect prohibited in great britain upon all ordinary occasions by the high duties upon the importation of foreign corn and upon extraordinary occasions when a scarcity made it necessary to suspend those duties by temporary statutes exportation was always prohibited by this system of laws therefore the carrying trade was in effect prohibited upon all occasions  that system of laws therefore which is connected with the establishment of the bounty seems to deserve no part of the praise which has been bestowed upon it the improvement and prosperity of great britain which has been so often ascribed to those laws may very easily be accounted for by other causes that security which the laws in great britain give to every man that he shall enjoy the fruits of his own labor is alone sufficient to make any country flourish notwithstanding these and twenty other absurd regulations of commerce and this security was perfected by the revolution much about the same time that the bounty was established the natural effort of every individual to better his own condition when suffered to exert itself with freedom and security is so powerful a principle that it is alone and without any assistance not only capable of carrying on the society to wealth and prosperity but of surmounting a hundred impertinent obstructions with which the folly of human laws too often incumbers its operations though the effect of these obstructions is always more or less either to encroach upon its freedom or to diminish its security in great britain industry is perfectly secure and though it is far from being perfectly free it is as free or freer than in any other part of europe  though the period of the greatest prosperity and improvement of great britain has been posterior to that system of laws which is connected with the bounty we must not upon that account impute it to those laws it has been posterior likewise to the national debt but the national debt has most assuredly not been the cause of it  though the system of laws which is connected with the bounty has exactly the same tendency with the police of spain and portugal to lower somewhat the value of the precious metals in the country where it takes place yet great britain is certainly one of the richest countries in europe while spain and portugal are perhaps among the most beggarly this difference of situation however may easily be accounted for from two different causes first the tax in spain the prohibition in portugal of exporting gold and silver and the vigilant police which watches over the execution of those laws must in two very poor countries which between them import annually upwards of six millions sterling operate not only more directly but much more forcibly in reducing the value of those metals there than the corn laws can do in great britain and secondly this bad policy is not in those countries counterbalanced by the general liberty and security of the people industry is there neither free nor secure and the civil and ecclesiastical governments of both spain and portugal are such as would alone be sufficient to perpetuate their present state of poverty even though their regulations of commerce were as wise as the greater part of them are absurd and foolish  the   th of the present king c    seems to have established a new system with regard to the corn laws in many respects better than the ancient one but in one respect perhaps not quite so good  by this statute the high duties upon importation for home consumption are taken off as soon as the price of wheat is so high as fortyeight shillings the quarter and instead of them a small duty is imposed of only sixpence upon the quarter of wheat and upon that of other grain in proportion the home market is in this manner not so totally excluded from foreign supplies as it was before  by the same statute the old bounty of five shillings upon the quarter of wheat ceases when the price rises so high as fortyfour shillings and upon that of other grain in proportion the bounties too upon the coarser sorts of grain are reduced somewhat lower than they were before even at the prices at which they take place if bounties are as improper as i have endeavored to prove them to be the sooner they cease and the lower they are so much the better  the same statute permits at all prices the importation of corn in order to be exported again duty free provided it is in the meantime lodged in the kings warehouse this liberty indeed extends to no more than twentyfive of the different ports of great britain they are however the principal ones and there may not perhaps be warehouses proper for this purpose in the greater part of the others some provision is thus made for the establishment of the carrying trade  so far this law seems evidently an improvement upon the ancient system  but by the same law exportation is prohibited as soon as the price of wheat rises to fortyfour shillings the quarter and that of other grain in proportion the price seems to be a good deal too low and there seems to be an impropriety besides in stopping exportation altogether at the very same price at which that bounty which was given in order to force it is withdrawn the bounty ought certainly either to have been withdrawn at a much lower price or exportation ought to have been allowed at a much higher so far therefore this law seems to be inferior to the ancient system  chap vi of treaties of commerce when a nation binds itself by treaty either to permit the entry of certain goods from one foreign country which it prohibits from all others or to exempt the goods of one country from duties to which it subjects those of all others the country or at least the merchants and manufacturers of the country whose commerce is so favored must necessarily derive great advantage from the treaty those merchants and manufacturers enjoy a sort of monopoly in the country which is so indulgent to them that country becomes a market both more extensive and more advantageous for their goods more extensive because the goods of other nations being either excluded or subjected to heavier duties it takes off a greater quantity of theirs more advantageous because the merchants of the favored country enjoying a sort of monopoly there will often sell their goods for a better price than if exposed to the free competition of all other nations  such treaties however though they may be advantageous to the merchants and manufacturers of the favored are necessarily disadvantageous to those of the favoring country a monopoly is thus granted against them to a foreign nation and they must frequently buy the foreign goods they have occasion for dearer than if the free competition of other nations was admitted that part of its own produce with which such a nation purchases foreign goods must consequently be sold cheaper because when two things are exchanged for one another the cheapness of the one is a necessary consequence or rather is the same thing with the dearness of the other the exchangeable value of its annual produce therefore is likely to be diminished by every such treaty this diminution however can scarce amount to any positive loss but only to a lessening of the gain which it might otherwise make though it sells its goods cheaper than it otherwise might do it will not probably sell them for less than they cost nor as in the case of bounties for a price which will not replace the capital employed in bringing them to market together with the ordinary profits of stock the trade could not go on long if it did even the favoring country therefore may still gain by the trade though less than if there was a free competition  some treaties of commerce however have been supposed advantageous upon principles very different from these and a commercial country has sometimes granted a monopoly of this kind against itself to certain goods of a foreign nation because it expected that in the whole commerce between them it would annually sell more than it would buy and that a balance in gold and silver would be annually returned to it it is upon this principle that the treaty of commerce between england and portugal concluded in   0  by mr methuen has been so much commended the following is a literal translation of that treaty which consists of three articles only  art i his sacred royal majesty of portugal promises both in his own name and that of his successors to admit for ever hereafter into portugal the woollen cloths and the rest of the woollen manufactures of the british as was accustomed till they were prohibited by the law nevertheless upon this condition  art ii that is to say that her sacred royal majesty of great britain shall in her own name and that of her successors be obliged for ever hereafter to admit the wines of the growth of portugal into britain so that at no time whether there shall be peace or war between the kingdoms of britain and france any thing more shall be demanded for these wines by the name of custom or duty or by whatsoever other title directly or indirectly whether they shall be imported into great britain in pipes or hogsheads or other casks than what shall be demanded for the like quantity or measure of french wine deducting or abating a thirdpart of the custom or duty but if at any time this deduction or abatement of customs which is to be made as aforesaid shall in any manner be attempted and prejudiced it shall be just and lawful for his sacred royal majesty of portugal again to prohibit the woollen cloths and the rest of the british woollen manufactures  art iii the most excellent lords the plenipotentiaries promise and take upon themselves that their abovenamed masters shall ratify this treaty and within the space of two months the ratifications shall be exchanged  by this treaty the crown of portugal becomes bound to admit the english woollens upon the same footing as before the prohibition that is not to raise the duties which had been paid before that time but it does not become bound to admit them upon any better terms than those of any other nation of france or holland for example the crown of great britain on the contrary becomes bound to admit the wines of portugal upon paying only twothirds of the duty which is paid for those of france the wines most likely to come into competition with them so far this treaty therefore is evidently advantageous to portugal and disadvantageous to great britain  it has been celebrated however as a masterpiece of the commercial policy of england portugal receives annually from the brazils a greater quantity of gold than can be employed in its domestic commerce whether in the shape of coin or of plate the surplus is too valuable to be allowed to lie idle and locked up in coffers and as it can find no advantageous market at home it must notwithstanding any prohibition be sent abroad and exchanged for something for which there is a more advantageous market at home a large share of it comes annually to england in return either for english goods or for those of other european nations that receive their returns through england mr baretti was informed that the weekly packetboat from lisbon brings one week with another more than fifty thousand pounds in gold to england the sum had probably been exaggerated it would amount to more than two millions six hundred thousand pounds a year which is more than the brazils are supposed to afford  our merchants were some years ago out of humor with the crown of portugal some privileges which had been granted them not by treaty but by the free grace of that crown at the solicitation indeed it is probable and in return for much greater favors defense and protection from the crown of great britain had been either infringed or revoked the people therefore usually most interested in celebrating the portugal trade were then rather disposed to represent it as less advantageous than it had commonly been imagined the far greater part almost the whole they pretended of this annual importation of gold was not on account of great britain but of other european nations the fruits and wines of portugal annually imported into great britain nearly compensating the value of the british goods sent thither  let us suppose however that the whole was on account of great britain and that it amounted to a still greater sum than mr baretti seems to imagine this trade would not upon that account be more advantageous than any other in which for the same value sent out we received an equal value of consumable goods in return  it is but a very small part of this importation which it can be supposed is employed as an annual addition either to the plate or to the coin of the kingdom the rest must all be sent abroad and exchanged for consumable goods of some kind or other but if those consumable goods were purchased directly with the produce of english industry it would be more for the advantage of england than first to purchase with that produce the gold of portugal and afterward to purchase with that gold those consumable goods a direct foreign trade of consumption is always more advantageous than a roundabout one and to bring the same value of foreign goods to the home market requires a much smaller capital in the one than in the other if a smaller share of its industry therefore had been employed in producing goods fit for the portugal market and a greater in producing those fit for the other markets where those consumable goods for which there is a demand in great britain are to be had it would have been more for the advantage of england to procure both the gold which it wants for its own use and the consumable goods would in this way employ a much smaller capital than at present there would be a spare capital therefore to be employed for other purposes in exciting an additional quantity of industry and in raising a greater annual produce  though britain were entirely excluded from the portugal trade it could find very little difficulty in procuring all the annual supplies of gold which it wants either for the purposes of plate or of coin or of foreign trade gold like every other commodity is always somewhere or another to be got for its value by those who have that value to give for it the annual surplus of gold in portugal besides would still be sent abroad and though not carried away by great britain would be carried away by some other nation which would be glad to sell it again for its price in the same manner as great britain does at present in buying gold of portugal indeed we buy it at the first hand whereas in buying it of any other nation except spain we should buy it at the second and might pay somewhat dearer this difference however would surely be too insignificant to deserve the public attention  almost all our gold it is said comes from portugal with other nations the balance of trade is either against us or not much in our favor but we should remember that the more gold we import from one country the less we must necessarily import from all others the effectual demand for gold like that for every other commodity is in every country limited to a certain quantity if ninetenths of this quantity are imported from one country there remains a tenth only to be imported from all others the more gold besides that is annually imported from some particular countries over and above what is requisite for plate and for coin the more must necessarily be exported to some others and the more that most insignificant object of modern policy the balance of trade appears to be in our favor with some particular countries the more it must necessarily appear to be against us with many others  it was upon this silly notion however that england could not subsist without the portugal trade that toward the end of the late war france and spain without pretending either offense or provocation required the king of portugal to exclude all british ships from his ports and for the security of this exclusion to receive into them french or spanish garrisons had the king of portugal submitted to those ignominious terms which his brotherinlaw the king of spain proposed to him britain would have been freed from a much greater inconveniency than the loss of the portugal trade the burden of supporting a very weak ally so unprovided of every thing for his own defense that the whole power of england had it been directed to that single purpose could scarce perhaps have defended him for another campaign the loss of the portugal trade would no doubt have occasioned a considerable embarrassment to the merchants at that time engaged in it who might not perhaps have found out for a year or two any other equally advantageous method of employing their capitals and in this would probably have consisted all the inconveniency which england could have suffered from this notable piece of commercial policy  the great annual importation of gold and silver is neither for the purpose of plate nor of coin but of foreign trade a roundabout foreign trade of consumption can be carried on more advantageously by means of these metals than of almost any other goods as they are the universal instruments of commerce they are more readily received in return for all commodities than any other goods and on account of their small bulk and great value it costs less to transport them backward and forwards from one place to another than almost any other sort of merchandise and they lose less of their value by being so transported of all the commodities therefore which are bought in one foreign country for no other purpose but to be sold or exchanged again for some other goods in another there are none so convenient as gold and silver in facilitating all the different roundabout foreign trades of consumption which are carried on in great britain consists the principal advantage of the portugal trade and though it is not a capital advantage it is no doubt a considerable one  that any annual addition which it can reasonably be supposed is made either to the plate or to the coin of the kingdom could require but a very small annual importation of gold and silver seems evident enough and though we had no direct trade with portugal this small quantity could always somewhere or another be very easily got  though the goldsmiths trade be very considerable in great britain the far greater part of the new plate which they annually sell is made from other old plate melted down so that the addition annually made to the whole plate of the kingdom cannot be very great and could require but a very small annual importation  it is the same case with the coin nobody imagines i believe that even the greater part of the annual coinage amounting for ten years together before the late reformation of the gold coin to upwards of eight hundred thousand pounds a year in gold was an annual addition to the money before current in the kingdom in a country where the expense of the coinage is defrayed by the government the value of the coin even when it contains its full standard weight of gold and silver can never be much greater than that of an equal quantity of those metals uncoined because it requires only the trouble of going to the mint and the delay perhaps of a few weeks to procure for any quantity of uncoined gold and silver an equal quantity of those metals in coin but in every country the greater part of the current coin is almost always more or less worn or otherwise degenerated from its standard in great britain it was before the late reformation a good deal so the gold being more than two per cent and the silver more than eight per cent below its standard weight but if fortyfour guineas and a half containing their full standard weight a pound weight of gold could purchase very little more than a pound weight of uncoined gold fortyfour guineas and a half wanting a part of their weight could not purchase a pound weight and something was to be added in order to make up the deficiency the current price of gold bullion at market therefore instead of being the same with the mint price or       s  d was then about       s and sometimes about fortyeight pounds when the greater part of the coin however was in this degenerate condition fortyfour guineas and a half fresh from the mint would purchase no more goods in the market than any other ordinary guineas because when they come into the coffers of the merchant being confounded with other money they could not afterward be distinguished without more trouble than the difference was worth like other guineas they were worth no more than       s  d if thrown into the melting pot however they produced without any sensible loss a pound weight of standard gold which could be sold at any time for between       s and     either in gold or silver as fit for all the purposes of coin as that which had been melted down there was an evident profit therefore in melting down new coined money and it was done so instantaneously that no precaution of government could prevent it the operations of the mint were upon this account somewhat like the web of penelope the work that was done in the day was undone in the night the mint was employed not so much in making daily additions to the coin as in replacing the very best part of it which was daily melted down  were the private people who carry their gold and silver to the mint to pay themselves for the coinage it would add to the value of those metals in the same manner as the fashion does to that of plate coined gold and silver would be more valuable than uncoined the seignorage if it was not exorbitant would add to the bullion the whole value of the duty because the government having every where the exclusive privilege of coining no coin can come to market cheaper than they think proper to afford it if the duty was exorbitant indeed that is if it was very much above the real value of the labor and expense requisite for coinage false coiners both at home and abroad might be encouraged by the great difference between the value of bullion and that of coin to pour in so great a quantity of counterfeit money as might reduce the value of the government money in france however though the seignorage is eight per cent no sensible inconveniency of this kind is found to arise from it the dangers to which a false coiner is every where exposed if he lives in the country of which he counterfeits the coin and to which his agents or correspondents are exposed if he lives in a foreign country are by far too great to be incurred for the sake of a profit of six or seven per cent  the seignorage in france raises the value of the coin higher than in proportion to the quantity of pure gold which it contains thus by the edict of january      see dictionaire des monnoies tom i article seigneurage p     par m abot de bazinghen conseillercomissaire en la cour des monnoies a paris the mint price of fine gold of twentyfour carats was fixed at seven hundred and forty livres nine sous and one denier oneeleventh the mark of eight paris ounces the gold coin of france making an allowance for the remedy of the mint contains twentyone carats and threefourths of fine gold and two carats onefourth of alloy the mark of standard gold therefore is worth no more than about six hundred and seventyone livres ten deniers but in france this mark of standard gold is coined into thirty louis d ors of twentyfour livres each or into seven hundred and twenty livres the coinage therefore increases the value of a mark of standard gold bullion by the difference between six hundred and seventyone livres ten deniers and seven hundred and twenty livres or by fortyeight livres nineteen sous and two deniers  a seignorage will in many cases take away altogether and will in all cases diminish the profit of melting down the new coin this profit always arises from the difference between the quantity of bullion which the common currency ought to contain and that which it actually does contain if this difference is less than the seignorage there will be loss instead of profit if it is equal to the seignorage there will neither be profit nor loss if it is greater than the seignorage there will indeed be some profit but less than if there was no seignorage if before the late reformation of the gold coin for example there had been a seignorage of five per cent upon the coinage there would have been a loss of three per cent upon the melting down of the gold coin if the seignorage had been two per cent there would have been neither profit nor loss if the seignorage had been one per cent there would have been a profit but of one per cent only instead of two per cent wherever money is received by tale therefore and not by weight a seignorage is the most effectual preventative of the melting down of the coin and for the same reason of its exportation it is the best and heaviest pieces that are commonly either melted down or exported because it is upon such that the largest profits are made  the law for the encouragement of the coinage by rendering it dutyfree was first enacted during the reign of charles ii for a limited time and afterward continued by different prolongations till      when it was rendered perpetual the bank of england in order to replenish their coffers with money are frequently obliged to carry bullion to the mint and it was more for their interest they probably imagined that the coinage should be at the expense of the government than at their own it was probably out of complaisance to this great company that the government agreed to render this law perpetual should the custom of weighing gold however come to be difused as it is very likely to be on account of its inconveniency should the gold coin of england come to be received by tale as it was before the late recoinage this great company may perhaps find that they have upon this as upon some other occasions mistaken their own interest not a little  before the late recoinage when the gold currency of england was two per cent below its standard weight as there was no seignorage it was two per cent below the value of that quantity of standard gold bullion which it ought to have contained when this great company therefore bought gold bullion in order to have it coined they were obliged to pay for it two per cent more than it was worth after the coinage but if there had been a seignorage of two per cent upon the coinage the common gold currency though two per cent below its standard weight would notwithstanding have been equal in value to the quantity of standard gold which it ought to have contained the value of the fashion compensating in this case the diminution of the weight they would indeed have had the seignorage to pay which being two per cent their loss upon the whole transaction would have been two per cent exactly the same but no greater than it actually was  if the seignorage had been five per cent and the gold currency only two per cent below its standard weight the bank would in this case have gained three per cent upon the price of the bullion but as they would have had a seignorage of five per cent to pay upon the coinage their loss upon the whole transaction would in the same manner have been exactly two per cent  in the seignorage had been only one per cent and the gold currency two per cent below its standard weight the bank would in this case have lost only one per cent upon the price of the bullion but as they would likewise have had a seignorage of one per cent to pay their loss upon the whole transaction would have been exactly two per cent in the same manner as in all other cases  if there was a reasonable seignorage while at the same time the coin contained its full standard weight as it has done very nearly since the late recoinage whatever the bank might lose by the seignorage they would gain upon the price of the bullion and whatever they might gain upon the price of the bullion they would lose by the seignorage they would neither lose nor gain therefore upon the whole transaction and they would in this as in all the foregoing cases be exactly in the same situation as if there was no seignorage  when the tax upon a commodity is so moderate as not to encourage smuggling the merchant who deals in it though he advances does not properly pay the tax as he gets it back in the price of the commodity the tax is finally paid by the last purchaser or consumer but money is a commodity with regard to which every man is a merchant nobody buys it but in order to sell it again and with regard to it there is in ordinary cases no last purchaser or consumer when the tax upon coinage therefore is so moderate as not to encourage false coining though every body advances the tax nobody finally pays it because every body gets it back in the advanced value of the coin  a moderate seignorage therefore would not in any case augment the expense of the bank or of any other private persons who carry their bullion to the mint in order to be coined and the want of a moderate seignorage does not in any case diminish it whether there is or is not a seignorage if the currency contains its full standard weight the coinage costs nothing to any body and if it is short of that weight the coinage must always cost the difference between the quantity of bullion which ought to be contained in it and that which actually is contained in it  the government therefore when it defrays the expense of coinage not only incurrs some small expense but loses some small revenue which it might get by a proper duty and neither the bank nor any other private persons are in the smallest degree benefited by this useless piece of public generosity  the directors of the bank however would probably be unwilling to agree to the imposition of a seignorage upon the authority of a speculation which promises them no gain but only pretends to insure them from any loss in the present state of the gold coin and as long as it continues to be received by weight they certainly would gain nothing by such a change but if the custom of weighing the gold coin should ever go into difuse as it is very likely to do and if the gold coin should ever fall into the same state of degradation in which it was before the late recoinage the gain or more properly the savings of the bank in consequence of the imposition of a seignorage would probably be very considerable the bank of england is the only company which sends any considerable quantity of bullion to the mint and the burden of the annual coinage falls entirely or almost entirely upon it if this annual coinage had nothing to do but to repair the unavoidable losses and necessary tear and wear of the coin it could seldom exceed fifty thousand or at most a hundred thousand pounds but when the coin is degraded below its standard weight the annual coinage must besides this fill up the large vacuities which exportation and the melting pot are continually making in the current coin it was upon this account that during the ten or twelve years immediately preceding the late reformation of the gold coin the annual coinage amounted at an average to more than eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds but if there had been a seignorage of four or five per cent upon the gold coin it would probably even in the state in which things then were have put an effectual stop to the business both of exportation and of the melting pot the bank instead of losing every year about two and a half per cent upon the bullion which was to be coined into more than eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds or incurring an annual loss of more than twenty one thousand two hundred and fifty pounds would not probably have incurred the tenth part of that loss  the revenue allotted by parliament for defraying the expense of the coinage is but fourteen thousand pounds a year and the real expense which it costs the government or the fees of the officers of the mint do not upon ordinary occasions i am assured exceed the half of that sum the saving of so very small a sum or even the gaining of another which could not well be much larger are objects too inconsiderable it may be thought to deserve the serious attention of government but the saving of eighteen or twenty thousand pounds a year in case of an event which is not improbable which has frequently happened before and which is very likely to happen again is surely an object which well deserves the serious attention even of so great a company as the bank of england  some of the foregoing reasonings and observations might perhaps have been more properly placed in those chapters of the first book which treat of the origin and use of money and of the difference between the real and the nominal price of commodities but as the law for the encouragement of coinage derives its origin from those vulgar prejudices which have been introduced by the mercantile system i judged it more proper to reserve them for this chapter nothing could be more agreeable to the spirit of that system than a sort of bounty upon the production of money the very thing which it supposes constitutes the wealth of every nation it is one of its many admirable expedients for enriching the country  chap vii of colonies part first of the motives for establishing new colonies the interest which occasioned the first settlement of the different european colonies in america and the west indies was not altogether so plain and distinct as that which directed the establishment of those of ancient greece and rome  all the different states of ancient greece possessed each of them but a very small territory and when the people in any one of them multiplied beyond what that territory could easily maintain a part of them were sent in quest of a new habitation in some remote and distant part of the world the warlike neighbors who surrounded them on all sides rendering it difficult for any of them to enlarge very much its territory at home the colonies of the dorians resorted chiefly to italy and sicily which in the times preceding the foundation of rome were inhabited by barbarous and uncivilized nations those of the ionians and eolians the two other great tribes of the greeks to asia minor and the islands of the egean sea of which the inhabitants seem at that time to have been pretty much in the same state as those of sicily and italy the mother city though she considered the colony as a child at all times entitled to great favor and assistance and owing in return much gratitude and respect yet considered it as an emancipated child over whom she pretended to claim no direct authority or jurisdiction the colony settled its own form of government enacted its own laws elected its own magistrates and made peace or war with its neighbors as an independent state which had no occasion to wait for the approbation or consent of the mother city nothing can be more plain and distinct than the interest which directed every such establishment  rome like most of the other ancient republics was originally founded upon an agrarian law which divided the public territory in a certain proportion among the different citizens who composed the state the course of human affairs by marriage by succession and by alienation necessarily deranged this original division and frequently threw the lands which had been allotted for the maintenance of many different families into the possession of a single person to remedy this disorder for such it was supposed to be a law was made restricting the quantity of land which any citizen could possess to five hundred jugera about three hundred and fifty english acres this law however though we read of its having been executed upon one or two occasions was either neglected or evaded and the inequality of fortunes went on continually increasing the greater part of the citizens had no land and without it the manners and customs of those times rendered it difficult for a freeman to maintain his independancy in the present times though a poor man has no land of his own if he has a little stock he may either farm the lands of another or he may carry on some little retail trade and if he has no stock he may find employment either as a country labourer or as an artificer but among the ancient romans the lands of the rich were all cultivated by slaves who wrought under an overseer who was likewise a slave so that a poor freeman had little chance of being employed either as a farmer or as a labourer all trades and manufactures too even the retail trade were carried on by the slaves of the rich for the benefit of their masters whose wealth authority and protection made it difficult for a poor freeman to maintain the competition against them the citizens therefore who had no land had scarce any other means of subsistence but the bounties of the candidates at the annual elections the tribunes when they had a mind to animate the people against the rich and the great put them in mind of the ancient division of lands and represented that law which restricted this sort of private property as the fundamental law of the republic the people became clamorous to get land and the rich and the great we may believe were perfectly determined not to give them any part of theirs to satisfy them in some measure therefore they frequently proposed to send out a new colony but conquering rome was even upon such occasions under no necessity of turning out her citizens to seek their fortune if one may say so through the wide world without knowing where they were to settle she assigned them lands generally in the conquered provinces of italy where being within the dominions of the republic they could never form any independent state but were at best but a sort of corporation which though it had the power of enacting byelaws for its own government was at all times subject to the correction jurisdiction and legislative authority of the mother city the sending out a colony of this kind not only gave some satisfaction to the people but often established a sort of garrison too in a newly conquered province of which the obedience might otherwise have been doubtful a roman colony therefore whether we consider the nature of the establishment itself or the motives for making it was altogether different from a greek one the words accordingly which in the original languages denote those different establishments have very different meanings the latin word colonia signifies simply a plantation the greek word  on the contrary signifies a separation of dwelling a departure from home a going out of the house but though the roman colonies were in many respects different from the greek ones the interest which prompted to establish them was equally plain and distinct both institutions derived their origin either from irresistible necessity or from clear and evident utility  the establishment of the european colonies in america and the west indies arose from no necessity and though the utility which has resulted from them has been very great it is not altogether so clear and evident it was not understood at their first establishment and was not the motive either of that establishment or of the discoveries which gave occasion to it and the nature extent and limits of that utility are not perhaps well understood at this day  the venetians during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries carried on a very advantageous commerce in spiceries and other east india goods which they distributed among the other nations of europe they purchased them in egypt at that time under the dominion of the mammeluks the enemies of the turks of whom the venetians were the enemies and this union of interest assisted by the money of venice formed such a connection as gave the venetians almost a monopoly of the trade  the great profits of the venetians tempted the avidity of the portugueze they had been endeavoring during the course of the fifteenth century to find out by sea a way to the countries from which the moors brought them ivory and gold dust across the desert they discovered the madeiras the canaries the azores the cape de verd islands the coast of guinea that of congo angola and loango and finally the cape of good hope they had long wished to share in the profitable traffic of the venetians and this last discovery opened to them a probable prospect of doing so in      vasco de gama sailed from the port of lisbon with a fleet of four ships and after a navigation of eleven months arrived upon the coast of indostan and thus completed a course of discoveries which had been pursued with great steadiness and with very little interruption for near a century together  some years before this while the expectations of europe were in suspense about the projects of the portugueze of which the success appeared yet to be doubtful a genoese pilot formed the yet more daring project of failing to the east indies by the west the situation of those countries was at that time very imperfectly known in europe the few european travelers who had been there had magnified the distance perhaps through simplicity and ignorance what was really very great appearing almost infinite to those who could not measure it or perhaps in order to increase somewhat more the mavelous of their own adventures in visiting regions so immensely remote from europe the longer the way was by the east columbus very justly concluded the shorter it would be by the west he proposed therefore to take that way as both the shortest and the surest and he had the good fortune to convince isabella of castile of the probability of his project he failed from the port of palos in august      near five years before the expedition of vasco de gama set out from portugal and after a voyage of between two and three months discovered first some of the small bahama or lucayan islands and afterward the great island of st domingo  but the countries which columbus discovered either in this or in any of his subsequent voyages had no resemblance to those which he had gone in quest of instead of the wealth cultivation and populousness of china and indostan he found in st domingo and in all the other parts of the new world which he ever visited nothing but a country quite covered with wood uncultivated and inhabited only by some tribes of naked and miserable savages he was not very willing however to believe that they were not the same with some of the countries described by marco polo the first european who had visited or at least had left behind him any description of china or the east indies and a very sight resemblance such as that which he found between the name of cibao a mountain in st domingo and that of cipango mentioned by marco polo was frequently sufficient to make him return to this favorite prepossession though contrary to the clearest evidence in his letters to ferdinand and isabella he called the countries which he had discovered the indies he entertained no doubt but that they were the extremity of those which had been described by marco polo and that they were not very distant from the ganges or from the countries which had been conquered by alexander even when at last convinced that they were different he still flattered himself that those rich countries were at no great distance and in a subsequent voyage accordingly went in quest of them along the coast of terra firma and toward the isthmus of darien  in consequence of this mistake of columbus the name of the indies has stuck to those unfortunate countries ever since and when it was at last clearly discovered that the new were altogether different from the old indies the former were called the west in contradistinction to the latter which were called the east indies  it was of importance to columbus however that the countries which he had discovered whatever they were should be represented to the court of spain as of very great consequence and in what constitutes the real riches of every country the animal and vegetable productions of the soil there was at that time nothing which could well justify such a representation of them  the cori something between a rat and a rabbit and supposed by mr buffon to be the same with the aperea of brazil was the largest viviparous quadruped in st domingo this species seems never to have been very numerous and the dogs and cats of the spaniards are said to have long ago almost entirely extirpated it as well as some other tribes of a still smaller size these however together with a pretty large lizard called the ivana or iguana constituted the principal part of the animal food which the land afforded  the vegetable food of the inhabitants though from their want of industry not very abundant was not altogether so scanty it consisted in indian corn yams potatoes bananes etc plants which were then altogether unknown in europe and which have never since been very much esteemed in it or supposed to yield a sustenance equal to what is drawn from the common sorts of grain and pulse which have been cultivated in this part of the world time out of mind  the cotton plant indeed afforded the material of a very important manufacture and was at that time to europeans undoubtedly the most valuable of all the vegetable productions of those islands but though in the end of the fifteenth century the muslins and other cotton goods of the east indies were much esteemed in every part of europe the cotton manufacture itself was not cultivated in any part of it even this production therefore could not at that time appear in the eyes of europeans to be of very great consequence  finding nothing either in the animals or vegetables of the newly discovered countries which could justify a very advantageous representation of them columbus turned his view toward their minerals and in the richness of the productions of this third kingdom he flattered himself he had found a full compensation for the insignificancy of those of the other two the little bits of gold with which the inhabitants ornamented their dress and which he was informed they frequently found in the rivulets and torrents that fell from the mountains were sufficient to satisfy him that those mountains abounded with the richest gold mines st domingo therefore was represented as a country abounding with gold and upon that account according to the prejudices not only of the present times but of those times an inexhaustible source of real wealth to the crown and kingdom of spain when columbus upon his return from his first voyage was introduced with a sort of triumphal honors to the sovereigns of castile and arragon the principal productions of the countries which he had discovered were carried in solemn procession before him the only valuable part of them consisted in some little fillets bracelets and other ornaments of gold and in some bales of cotton the rest were mere objects of vulgar wonder and curiosity some reeds of an extraordinary size some birds of a very beautiful plumage and some stuffed skins of the huge alligator and manati all of which were preceeded by six or seven of the wretched natives whose singular color and appearance added greatly to the novelty of the show  in consequence of the representations of columbus the council of castile determined to take possession of countries of which the inhabitants were plainly incapable of defending themselves the pious purpose of converting them to christianity sanctified the injustice of the project but the hope of finding treasures of gold there was the sole motive which prompted to undertake it and to give this motive the greater weight it was proposed by columbus that the half of all the gold and silver that should be found there should belong to the crown this proposal was approved of by the council  as long as the whole or the far greater part of the gold which the first adventurers importe into europe was got by so very easy a method as the plundering of the defenseless natives it was not perhaps very difficult to pay even this heavy tax but when the natives were once fairly stripped of all that they had which in st domingo and in all the other countries discovered by columbus was done completely in six or eight years and when in order to find more it had become necessary to dig for it in the mines there was no longer any possibility of paying this tax the rigorous exaction of it accordingly first occasioned it is said the total abandoning of the mines of st domingo which have never been wrought since it was soon reduced therefore to a third then to a fifth afterward to a tenth and at last to a twentieth part of the gross produce of the gold mines the tax upon silver indeed still continues to be a fifth of the gross produce but the first adventurers do not appear to have been much interested about silver nothing less precious than gold seemed worthy of their attention  all the other enterprises of the spaniards in the new world subsequent to those of columbus seem to have been prompted by the same motive it was the sacred thirst of gold that carried oieda nicuessa and vasco nugnes de balboa to the isthmus of darien that carried cortez to mexico and almagro and pizzarro to chili and peru when those adventurers arrived upon any unknown coast their first enquiry was always if there was any gold to be found there and according to the information which they received concerning this particular they determined either to quit the country or to settle in it  of all those expensive and uncertain projects however which bring bankruptcy upon the greater part of the people who engage in them there is none perhaps more perfectly ruinous than the search after new silver and gold mines it is perhaps the most disadvantageous lottery in the world or the one in which the gain of those who draw the prizes bears the least proportion to the loss of those who draw the blanks for though the prizes are few and the blanks many the common price of a ticket is the whole fortune of a very rich man projects of mining instead of replacing the capital employed in them together with the ordinary profits of stock commonly absorb both capital and profit they are the projects therefore to which of all others a prudent lawgiver who desired to increase the capital of his nation would least choose to give any extraordinary encouragement or to turn toward them a greater share of that capital than what would go to them of its own accord such in reality is the absurd confidence which almost all men have in their own good fortune that wherever there is the least probability of success too great a share of it is apt to go to them of its own accord  but though the judgment of sober reason and experience concerning such projects has always been extremely unfavourable that of human avidity has commonly been quite otherwise the same passion which has suggested to so many people the absurd idea of the philosophers stone has suggested to others the equally absurd one of immense rich mines of gold and silver they did not consider that the value of those metals has in all ages and nations arisen chiefly from their scarcity and that their scarcity has arisen from the very small quantities of them which nature has any where deposited in one place from the hard and intractable substances with which she has almost every where surrounded those small quantities and consequently from the labor and expense which are every where necessary in order to penetrate to and get at them they flattered themselves that veins of those metals might in many places be found as large and as abundant as those which are commonly found of lead or copper or tin or iron the dream of sir walter raleigh concerning the golden city and country of eldorado may satisfy us that even wise men are not always exempt from such strange delusions more than a hundred years after the death of that great man the jesuit gumila was still convinced of the reality of that wonderful country and expressed with great warmth and i dare to say with great sincerity how happy he should be to carry the light of the gospel to a people who could so well reward the pious labors of their missionary  in the countries first discovered by the spaniards no gold or silver mines are at present known which are supposed to be worth the working the quantities of those metals which the first adventurers are said to have found there had probably been very much magnified as well as the fertility of the mines which were wrought immediately after the first discovery what those adventurers were reported to have found however was sufficient to inflame the avidity of all their countrymen every spaniard who failed to america expected to find an eldorado fortune too did upon this what she has done upon very few other occasions she realized in some measure the extravagant hopes of her votaries and in the discovery and conquest of mexico and peru of which the one happened about thirty the other about forty years after the first expedition of columbus she presented them with something not very unlike that profusion of the precious metals which they sought for  a project of commerce to the east indies therefore gave occasion to the first discovery of the west a project of conquest gave occasion to all the establishments of the spaniards in those newly discovered countries the motive which excited them to this conquest was a project of gold and silver mines and a course of accidents which no human wisdom could foresee rendered this project much more successful than the undertakers had any reasonable grounds for expecting  the first adventurers of all the other nations of europe who attempted to make settlements in america were animated by the like chimerical views but they were not equally successful it was more than a hundred years after the first settlement of the brazils before any silver gold or diamond mines were discovered there in the english french dutch and danish colonies none have ever yet been discovered at least none that are at present supposed to be worth the working the first english settlers in north america however offered a fifth of all the gold and silver which should be found there to the king as a motive for granting them their patents in the patents to sir walter raleigh to the london and plymouth companies to the council of plymouth etc this fifth was accordingly reserved to the crown to the expectation of finding gold and silver mines those first settlers too joined that of discovering a north west passage to the east indies they have hitherto been disappointed in both  part second causes of the prosperity of new colonies the colony of a civilized nation which takes possession either of a waste country or of one so thinly inhabited that the natives easily give place to the new settlers advances more rapidly to wealth and greatness than any other human society  the colonists carry out with them a knowledge of agriculture and of other useful arts superior to what can grow up of its own accord in the course of many centuries among savage and harbarous nations they carry out with them too the habit of subordination some notion of the regular government which takes place in their own country of the system of laws which support it and of a regular administration of justice and they naturally establish something of the same kind in the new settlement but among savage and barbarous nations the natural progress of law and government is still slower than the natural progress of arts after law and government have been so far established as is necessary for their protection every colonist gets more land than he can possibly cultivate he has no rent and scarce any taxes to pay no landlord shares with him in its produce and the share of the sovereign is commonly but a trifle he has every motive to render as great as possible a produce which is thus to be almost entirely his own but his land is commonly so extensive that with all his own industry and with all the industry of other people whom he can get to employ he can seldom make it produce the tenth part of what it is capable of producing he is eager therefore to collect laborers from all quarters and to reward them with the most liberal wages but those liberal wages joined to the plenty and cheapness of land soon make those laborers leave him in order to become landlords themselves and to reward with equal liberality other laborers who soon leave them for the same reason that they left their first master the liberal reward of labor encourages marriage the children during the tender years of infancy are well fed and properly taken care of and when they are grown up the value of their labor greatly overpays their maintenance when arrived at maturity the high price of labor and the low price of land enable them to establish themselves in the same manner as their fathers did before them  in other countries rent and profit eat up wages and the two superior orders of people oppress the inferior one but in new colonies the interest of the two superior orders obliges them to treat the inferior one with more generosity and humanity at least where that inferior one is not in a state of slavery waste lands of the greatest natural fertility are to be had for a trifle the increase of revenue which the proprietor who is always the undertaker expects from their improvement constitutes his profit which in these circumstances is commonly very great but this great profit cannot be made without employing the labor of other people in clearing and cultivating the land and the disproportion between the great extent of the land and the small number of the people which commonly takes place in new colonies makes it difficult for him to get this labor he does not therefore dispute about wages but is willing to employ labor at any price the high wages of labor encourage population the cheapness and plenty of good land encourage improvement and enable the proprietor to pay those high wages in those wages consists almost the whole price of the land and though they are high considered as the wages of labor they are low considered as the price of what is so very valuable what encourages the progress of population and improvement encourages that of real wealth and greatness  the progress of many of the ancient greek colonies toward wealth and greatness seems accordingly to have been very rapid in the course of a century or two several of them appear to have rivalled and even to have surpassed their mother cities syracuse and aggrigentum in sicily tarentum and locri in italy ephesus and miletus in lesser asia appear by all accounts to have been at least equal to any of the cities of ancient greece though posterior in their establishment yet all the arts of refinement philosophy poetry and eloquence seem to have been cultivated as early and to have been improved as highly in them as in any part of the mother country the schools of the two oldest greek philosophers those of thales and pythagoras were established it is remarkable not in ancient greece but the one in an asiatick the other in an italian colony all those colonies had established themselves in countries inhabited by savage and barbarous nations who easily gave place to the new settlers they had plenty of good land and as they were altogether independent of the mother city they were at liberty to manage their own affairs in the way that they judged was most suitable to their own interest  the history of the roman colonies is by no means so brilliant some of them indeed such as florence have in the course of many ages and after the fall of the mother city grown up to be considerable states but the progress of no one of them seems ever to have been very rapid they were all established in conquered provinces which in most cases had been fully inhabited before the quantity of land assigned to each colonist was seldom very considerable and as the colony was not independent they were not always at liberty to manage their own affairs in the way that they judged was most suitable to their own interest  in the plenty of good land the european colonies established in america and the west indies resemble and even greatly surpass those of ancient greece in their dependency upon the mother state they resemble those of ancient rome but their great distance from europe has in all of them alleviated more or less the effects of this dependency their situation has placed them less in the view and less in the power of their mother country in pursuing their interest their own way their conduct has upon many occasions been overlooked either because not known or not understood in europe and upon some occasions it has been fairly suffered and submitted to because their distance rendered it difficult to restrain it even the violent and arbitrary government of spain has upon many occasions been obliged to recall or soften the orders which had been given for the government of its colonies for fear of a general insurrection the progress of all the european colonies in wealth population and improvement has accordingly been very great  the crown of spain by its share of the gold and silver derived some revenue from its colonies from the moment of their first establishment it was a revenue too of a nature to excite in human avidity the most extravagant expectations of still greater riches the spanish colonies therefore from the moment of their first establishment attracted very much the attention of their mother country while those of the other european nations were for a long time in a great measure neglected the former did not perhaps thrive the better in consequence of this attention nor the latter the worse in consequence of this neglect in proportion to the extent of the country which they in some measure possess the spanish colonies are considered as less populous and thriving than those of almost any other european nation the progress even of the spanish colonies however in population and improvement has certainly been very rapid and very great the city of lima founded since the conquest is represented by ulloa as containing fifty thousand inhabitants near thirty years ago quito which had been but a miserable hamlet of indians is represented by the same author as in his time equally populous gemelli carreri a pretended traveller it is said indeed but who seems every where to have written upon extreme good information represents the city of mexico as containing a hundred thousand inhabitants a number which in spite of all the exaggerations of the spanish writers is probably more than five times greater than what it contained in the time of montezuma these numbers exceed greatly those of boston new york and philadelphia the three greatest cities of the english colonies before the conquest of the spaniards there were no cattle fit for draught either in mexico or peru the lama was their only beast of burden and its strength seems to have been a good deal inferior to that of a common ass the plough was unknown among them they were ignorant of the use of iron they had no coined money nor any established instrument of commerce of any kind their commerce was carried on by barter a sort of wooden spade was their principal instrument of agriculture sharp stones served them for knives and hatchets to cut with fish bones and the hard sinews of certain animals served them for needles to sew with and these seem to have been their principal instruments of trade in this state of things it seems impossible that either of those empires could have been so much improved or so well cultivated as at present when they are plentifully furnished with all sorts of european cattle and when the use of iron of the plough and of many of the arts of europe has been introduced among them but the populousness of every country must be in proportion to the degree of its improvement and cultivation in spite of the cruel destruction of the natives which followed the conquest these two great empires are probably more populous now than they ever were before and the people are surely very different for we must acknowledge i apprehend that the spanish creoles are in many respects superior to the ancient indians  after the settlements of the spaniards that of the portugueze in brazil is the oldest of any european nation in america but as for a long time after the first discovery neither gold nor silver mines were found in it and as it afforded upon that account little or no revenue to the crown it was for a long time in a great measure neglected and during this state of neglect it grew up to be a great and powerful colony while portugal was under the dominion of spain brazil was attacked by the dutch who got possession of seven of the fourteen provinces into which it is divided they expected soon to conquer the other seven when portugal recovered its independency by the elevation of the family of braganza to the throne the dutch then as enemies to the spaniards became friends to the portugueze who were likewise the enemies of the spaniards they agreed therefore to leave that part of brazil which they had not conquered to the king of portugal who agreed to leave that part which they had conquered to them as a matter not worth disputing about with such good allies but the dutch government soon began to oppress the portugueze colonists who instead of amusing themselves with complaints took arms against their new masters and by their own valor and resolution with the connivance indeed but without any avowed assistance from the mother country drove them out of brazil the dutch therefore finding it impossible to keep any part of the country to themselves were contented that it should be entirely restored to the crown of portugal in this colony there are said to be more than six hundred thousand people either portugueze or descended from portugueze creoles mulattoes and a mixed race between portugueze and brazilians no one colony in america is supposed to contain so great a number of people of european extraction  toward the end of the fifteenth and during the greater part of the sixteenth century spain and portugal were the two great naval powers upon the ocean for though the commerce of venice extended to every part of europe its fleets had scarce ever sailed beyond the mediterranean the spaniards in virtue of the first discovery claimed all america as their own and though they could not hinder so great a naval power as that of portugal from settling in brazil such was at that time the terror of their name that the greater part of the other nations of europe were afraid to establish themselves in any other part of that great continent the french who attempted to settle in florida were all murdered by the spaniards but the declension of the naval power of this latter nation in consequence of the defeat of miscarriage of what they called their invincible armada which happened toward the end of the sixteenth century put it out of their power to obstruct any longer the settlements of the other european nations in the course of the seventeenth century therefore the english french dutch danes and swedes all the great nations who had any ports upon the ocean attempted to make some settlements in the new world  the swedes established themselves in new jersey and the number of swedish families still to be found there sufficiently demonstrates that this colony was very likely to prosper had it been protected by the mother country but being neglected by sweden it was soon swallowed up by the dutch colony of new york which again in      fell under the dominion of the english  the small islands of st thomas and santa cruz are the only countries in the new world that have ever been possessed by the danes these little settlements too were under the government of an exclusive company which had the sole right both of purchasing the surplus produce of the colonists and of supplying them with such goods of other countries as they wanted and which therefore both in its purchases and sales had not only the power of oppressing them but the greatest temptation to do so the government of an exclusive company of merchants is perhaps the worst of all governments for any country whatever it was not however able to stop altogether the progress of these colonies though it rendered it more slow and languid the late king of denmark dissolved this company and since that time the prosperity of these colonies has been very great  the dutch settlements in the west as well as those in the east indies were originally put under the government of an exclusive company the progress of some of them therefore though it has been considerable in comparison with that of almost any country that has been long peopled and established has been languid and slow in comparison with that of the greater part of new colonies the colony of surinam though very considerable is still inferior to the greater part of the sugar colonies of the other european nations the colony of nova belgia now divided into the two provinces of new york and new jersey would probably have soon become considerable too even though it had remained under the government of the dutch the plenty and cheapness of good land are such powerful causes of prosperity that the very worst government is scarce capable of checking altogether the efficacy of their operation the great distance too from the mother country would enable the colonists to evade more or less by smuggling the monopoly which the company enjoyed against them at present the company allows all dutch ships to trade to surinam upon paying two and a half per cent upon the value of their cargo for a license and only reserves to itself exclusively the direct trade from africa to america which consists almost entirely in the slave trade this relaxation in the exclusive privileges of the company is probably the principal cause of that degree of prosperity which that colony at present enjoys curacoa and eustatia the two principal islands belonging to the dutch are free ports open to the ships of all nations and this freedom in the midst of better colonies whose ports are open to those of one nation only has been the great cause of the prosperity of those two barren islands  the french colony of canada was during the greater part of the last century and some part of the present under the government of an exclusive company under so unfavourable an administration its progress was necessarily very slow in comparison with that of other new colonies but it became much more rapid when this company was dissolved after the fall of what is called the mississipi scheme when the english got possession of this country they found in it near double the number of inhabitants which father charlevoix had assigned to it between twenty and thirty years before that jesuit had traveled over the whole country and had no inclination to represent it as less considerable than it really was  the french colony of st domingo was established by pirates and freebooters who for a long time neither required the protection nor acknowledged the authority of france and when the race of banditti became so far citizens as to acknowledge this authority it was for a long time necessary to exercise it with very great gentleness during this period the population and improvement of this colony increased very fast even the oppression of the exclusive company to which it was for some time subjected with all the other colonies of france though it no doubt retarded had not been able to stop its progress altogether the course of its prosperity returned as soon as it was relieved from that oppression it is now the most important of the sugar colonies of the west indies and its produce is said to be greater than that of all the english sugar colonies put together the other sugar colonies of france are in general all very thriving  but there are no colonies of which the progress has been more rapid than that of the english in north america  plenty of good land and liberty to manage their own affairs their own way seem to be the two great causes of the prosperity of all new colonies  in the plenty of good land the english colonies of north america though no doubt very abundantly provided are however inferior to those of the spaniards and portugueze and not superior to some of those possessed by the french before the late war but the political institutions of the english colonies have been more favorable to the improvement and cultivation of this land than those of any of the other three nations  first the engrossing of uncultivated land though it has by no means been prevented altogether has been more restrained in the english colonies than in any other the colony law which imposes upon every proprietor the obligation of improving and cultivating within a limited time a certain proportion of his lands and which in case of failure declares those neglected lands grantable to any other person though it has not perhaps been very strictly executed has however had some effect  secondly in pensylvania there is no right of primogeniture and lands like movables are divided equally among all the children of the family in three of the provinces of new england the oldest has only a double share as in the mosaical law though in those provinces therefore too great a quantity of land should sometimes be engrossed by a particular individual it is likely in the course of a generation or two to be sufficiently divided again in the other english colonies indeed the right of primogeniture takes place as in the law of england but in all the english colonies the tenure of their lands which are all held by free socage facilitates alienation and the grantee of any extensive tract of land generally finds it for his interest to alienate as fast as he can the greater part of it reserving only a small quitrent in the spanish and portugueze colonies what is called the right of mayorazzo jus mayoratus takes place in the succession of all those great estates to which any title of honor is annexed such estates go all to one person and are in effect entailed and unalienable the french colonies indeed are subject to the custom of paris which in the inheritance of land is much more favorable to the younger children than the law of england but in the french colonies if any part of an estate held by the noble tenure of chivalry and homage is alienated it is for a limited time subject to the right of redemption either by the heir of the superior or by the heir of the family and all the largest estates of the country are held by such noble tenures which necessarily embarrass alienation but in a new colony a great uncultivated estate is likely to be much more speedily divided by alienation than by succession the engrossing however of uncultivated land it has already been observed is the greatest obstruction to its improvement and cultivation and the labor that is employed in the improvement and cultivation of land affords the greatest and most valuable produce to the society its produce in this case pays not only its own wages and the profit of the stock which employs it but the rent of the land too upon which it is employed the labor of the english colonists therefore being more employed in the improvement and cultivation of land is likely to afford a greater and more valuable produce than that of any of the other three nations which by the engrossing of land is more or less diverted toward other employments  thirdly the labor of the english colonists is not only likely to afford a greater and more valuable produce but in consequence of the moderation of their taxes a greater proportion of this produce belongs to themselves which they may store up and employ in putting into motion a still greater quantity of labor the english colonists have never yet contributed any thing toward the defense of the mother country or toward the support of its civil government they themselves on the contrary have hitherto been defended almost entirely at the expense of the mother country but the expense of fleets and armies is out of all proportion greater than the necessary expense of civil government the expense of their own civil government has always been very moderate it has generally been confined to what was necessary for paying competent salaries to the governor to the judges and to some other officers of police and for maintaining a few of the most useful public works the expense of the civil establishment of massachusetts bay before the commencement of the present disturbances used to be but about   000l a year that of new hampshire and rhode island   00l each that of connecticut  000l that of new york and pensilvania   00l each that of new jersey   00l that of virginia and south carolina  000l each the civil establishment of nova scotia and georgia are partly supported by an annual grant of parliament but nova scotia pays besides about  000l a year toward the public expenses of the colony and georgia about   00l a year all the different civil establishments in north america in short exclusive of those of maryland and north carolina of which no exact account has been got did not before the commencement of the present disturbances cost the inhabitants above    00l a year an ever memorable example at how small an expense three millions of people may not only be governed but well governed the most important part of the expense of government indeed that of defense and protection has constantly fallen upon the mother country the ceremonial too of the civil government in the colonies upon the reception of a new governor upon the opening of a new assembly etc though sufficiently decent is not accompanied with any expensive pomp or parade their ecclesiastical government is conducted upon a plan equally frugal tithes are unknown among them and their clergy who are far from being numerous are maintained either by moderate stipends or by the voluntary contributions of the people the power of spain and portugal on the contrary derives some support from the taxes levied upon their colonies france indeed has never drawn any considerable revenue from its colonies the taxes which it levies upon them being generally spent among them but the colony government of all these three nations is conducted upon a much more expensive plan and is accompanied with a much more expensive ceremonial the sums spent upon the reception of a new viceroy of peru for example have frequently been enormous such ceremonials are not only real taxes paid by the rich colonists upon those particular occasions but they serve to introduce among them the habit of vanity and expense upon all other occasions they are not only very grievous occasional taxes but they contribute to establish perpetual taxes of the same kind still more grievous the ruinous taxes of private luxury and extravagance in the colonies of all those three nations too the ecclesiastical government is extremely oppressive tithes take place in all of them and are levied with the utmost rigor in those of spain and portugal all of them besides are oppressed with a numerous race of mendicant friars whose beggary being not only licensed but consecrated by religion is a most grievous tax upon the poor people who are most carefully taught that it is a duty to give and a very great sin to refuse them their charity over and above all this the clergy are in all of them the greatest engrossers of land  fourthly in the disposal of their surplus produce or of what is over and above their own consumption the english colonies have been more favored and have been allowed a more extensive market than those of any other european nation every european nation has endeavored more or less to monopolize to itself the commerce of its colonies and upon that account has prohibited the ships of foreign nations from trading to them and has prohibited them from importing european goods from any foreign nation but the manner in which this monopoly has been exercised in different nations has been very different  some nations have given up the whole commerce of their colonies to an exclusive company of whom the colonists were obliged to buy all such european goods as they wanted and to whom they were obliged to sell the whole of their own surplus produce it was the interest of the company therefore not only to sell the former as dear and to buy the latter as cheap as possible but to buy no more of the latter even at this low price than what they could dispose of for a very high price in europe it was their interest not only to degrade in all cases the value of the surplus produce of the colony but in many cases to discourage and keep down the natural increase of its quantity of all the expedients that can well be contrived to stunt the natural growth of a new colony that of an exclusive company is undoubtedly the most effectual this however has been the policy of holland though their company in the course of the present century has given up in many respects the exertion of their exclusive privilege this too was the policy of denmark till the reign of the late king it has occasionally been the policy of france and of late since      after it had been abandoned by all other nations on account of its absurdity it has become the policy of portugal with regard at least to two of the principal provinces of brazil fernumbuco and marannon  other nations without establishing an exclusive company have confined the whole commerce of their colonies to a particular port of the mother country from whence no ship was allowed to sail but either in a fleet and at a particular seasorr or if single in consequence of a particular license which in most cases was very well paid for this policy opened indeed the trade of the colonies to all the natives of the mother country provided they traded from the proper port at the proper season and in the proper vessels but as all the different merchants who joined their stocks in order to fit out those licensed vessels would find it for their interest to act in concert the trade which was carried on in this manner would necessarily be conducted very nearly upon the same principles as that of an exclusive company the profit of those merchants would be almost equally exorbitant and oppressive the colonies would be ill supplied and would be obliged both to buy very dear and to sell very cheap this however has always been the policy of spain and the price of all european goods accordingly is said to be enormous in the spanish west indies at quito we are told by ulloa a pound of iron sells for about four and sixpence and a pound of steel for about six and ninepence sterling but it is chiefly in order to purchase european goods that the colonies part with their own produce the more therefore they pay for the one the less they really get for the other and the dearness of the one is the same thing with the cheapness of the other the policy of portugal is in this respect the same as that of spain with regard to all its colonies except fernambuco and marannon and with regard to these it has lately adopted a still worse  other nations leave the trade of their colonies free to all their subjects who may carry it on from all the different ports of the mother country and who have occasion for no other license than the common dispatches of the customhouse in this case the number and dispersed situation of the different traders renders it impossible for them to enter into any general combination and their competition is sufficient to hinder them from making very exorbitant profits under so liberal a policy the colonies are enabled both to sell their own produce and to buy the goods of europe at a reasonable price but since the dissolution of the plymouth company when our colonies were but in their infancy this has always been the policy of england it has generally too been that of france and it has been uniformly so since the dissolution of what in england is commonly called their missisippi company the profits of the trade therefore which france and england carry on with their colonies though no doubt somewhat higher than if the competition was free to all other nations are however by no means exorbitant and the price of european goods accordingly is not extravagantly high in the greater part of the colonies of either of those nations  in the exportation of their own surplus produce too it is only with regard to certain commodities that the colonies of great britain are confined to the market of the mother country these commodities having been enumerated in the act of navigation and in some other subsequent acts have upon that account been called enumerated commodities the rest are called nonenumerated and may be exported directly to other countries provided it is in british or plantation ships of which the owners and threefourths of the mariners are british subjects  among the nonenumerated commodities are some of the most important productions of america and the west indies grain of all sorts lumber salt provisions fish sugar and rum  grain is naturally the first and principal object of the culture of all new colonies by allowing them a very extensive market for it the law encourages them to extend this culture much beyond the consumption of a thinly inhabited country and thus to provide beforehand an ample subsistence for a continually increasing population  in a country quite covered with wood where timber consequently is of little or no value the expense of clearing the ground is the principal obstacle to improvement by allowing the colonies a very extensive market for their lumber the law endeavors to facilitate improvement by raising the price of a commodity which would otherwise be of little value and thereby enabling them to make some profit of what would otherwise be mere expense  in a country neither half peopled nor half cultivated cattle naturally multiply beyond the consumption of the inhabitants and are often upon that account of little or no value but it is necessary it has already been shown that the price of cattle should bear a certain proportion to that of corn before the greater part of the lands of any country can be improved by allowing to american cattle in all shapes dead and alive a very extensive market the law endeavors to raise the value of a commodity of which the high price is so very essential to improvement the good effects of this liberty however must be somewhat diminished by the  th of george iii c    which puts hides and skins among the enumerated commodities and thereby tends to reduce the value of american cattle  to increase the shipping and naval power of great britain by the extension of the fisheries of our colonies is an object which the legislature seems to have had almost constantly in view those fisheries upon this account have had all the encouragement which freedom can give them and they have flourished accordingly the new england fishery in particular was before the late disturbances one of the most important perhaps in the world the whalefishery which notwithstanding an extravagant bounty is in great britain carried on to so little purpose that in the opinion of many people which i do not however pretend to warrant the whole produce does not much exceed the value of the bounties which are annually paid for it is in new england carried on without any bounty to a very great extent fish is one of the principal articles with which the north americans trade to spain portugal and the mediterranean  sugar was originally an enumerated commodity which could be exported only to great britain but in      upon a representation of the sugar planters its exportation was permitted to all parts of the world the restrictions however with which this liberty was granted joined to the high price of sugar in great britain have rendered it in a great measure ineffectual great britain and her colonies still continue to be almost the sole market for all the sugar produced in the british plantations their consumption increases so fast that though in consequence of the increasing improvement of jamaica as well as of the ceded islands the importation of sugar has increased very greatly within these twenty years the exportation to foreign countries is said to be not much greater than before  rum is a very important article in the trade which the americans carry on to the coast of africa from which they bring back negroe slaves in return  if the whole surplus produce of america in grain of all sorts in salt provisions and in fish had been put into the enumeration and thereby forced into the market of great britain it would have interfered too much with the produce of the industry of our own people it was probably not so much from any regard to the interest of america as from a jealousy of this interference that those important commodities have not only been kept out of the enumeration but that the importation into great britain of all grain except rice and of salt provisions has in the ordinary state of the law been prohibited  the nonenumerated commodities could originally be exported to all parts of the world lumber and rice having been once put into the enumeration when they were afterward taken out of it were confined as to the european market to the countries that lie south of cape finisterre by the  th of george iii c    all nonenumerated commodities were subjected to the like restriction the parts of europe which lie south of cape finisterre are not manufacturing countries and we were less jealous of the colony ships carrying home from them any manufactures which could interfere with our own  the enumerated commodities are of two sorts first such as are either the peculiar produce of america or as cannot be produced or at least are not produced in the mother country of this kind are melasses coffee cacaonuts tobacco pimento ginger whalefins raw silk cottonwool beaver and other peltry of america indigo fustick and other dying woods secondly such as are not the peculiar produce of america but which are and may be produced in the mother country though not in such quantities as to supply the greater part of her demand which is principally supplied from foreign countries of this kind are all naval stores masts yards and bowsprits tar pitch and turpentine pig and bar iron copper ore hides and skins pot and pearl ashes the largest importation of commodities of the first kind could not discourage the growth or interfere with the sale of any part of the produce of the mother country by consining them to the home market our merchants it was expected would not only be enabled to buy them cheaper in the plantations and consequently to sell them with a better profit at home but to establish between the plantations and foreign countries an advantageous carrying trade of which great britain was necessarily to be the center or emporium as the european country into which those commodities were first to be imported the importation of commodities of the second kind might be so managed too it was supposed as to interfere not with the sale of those of the same kind which were produced at home but with that of those which were imported from foreign countries because by means of proper duties they might be rendered always somewhat dearer than the former and yet a good deal cheaper than the latter by confining such commodities to the home market therefore it was proposed to discourage the produce not of great britain but of some foreign countries with which the balance of trade was believed to be unfavourable to great britain  the prohibition of exporting from the colonies to any other country but great britain masts yards and bowsprits tar pitch and turpentine naturally tended to lower the price of timber in the colonies and consequently to increase the expense of clearing their lands the principal obstacle to their improvement but about the beginning of the present century in   0  the pitch and tar company of sweden endeavored to raise the price of their commodities to great britain by prohibiting their exportation except in their own ships at their own price and in such quantities as they thought proper in order to counteract this notable piece of mercantile policy and to render herself as much as possible independent not only of sweden but of all the other northern powers great britain gave a bounty upon the importation of naval stores from america and the effect of this bounty was to raise the price of timber in america much more than the consinement to the home market could lower it and as both regulations were enacted at the same time their joint effect was rather to encourage than to discourage the clearing of land in america  though pig and bar iron too have been put among the enumerated commodities yet as when imported from america they are exempted from considerable duties to which they are subject when imported from any other country the one part of the regulation contributes more to encourage the erection of furnaces in america than the other to discourage it there is no manufacture which occasions so great a consumption of wood as a furnace or which can contribute so much to the clearing of a country overgrown with it  the tendency of some of these regulations to raise the value of timber in america and thereby to facilitate the clearing of the land was neither perhaps intended nor understood by the legislature though their beneficial effects however have been in this respect accidental they have not upon that account been less real  the most perfect freedom of trade is permitted between the british colonies of america and the west indies both in the enumerated and in the nonenumerated commodities those colonies are now become so populous and thriving that each of them finds in some of the others a great and extensive market for every part of its produce all of them taken together they make a great internal market for the produce of one another  the liberality of england however toward the trade of her colonies has been confined chiefly to what concerns the market for their produce either in its rude state or in what may be called the very first stage of manufacture the more advanced or more refined manufactures even of the colony produce the merchants and manufacturers of great britain choose to reserve to themselves and have prevailed upon the legislature to prevent their establishment in the colonies sometimes by high duties and sometimes by absolute prohibitions  while for example muskovado sugars from the british plantations pay upon importation only  s  d the hundred weight white sugars pay  l  s  d and refined either double or single in loaves  l  s  d   0 when those high duties were imposed great britain was the sole and she still continues to be the principal market to which the sugars of the british colonies could be exported they amounted therefore to a prohibition at first of claying or refining sugar for any foreign market and at present of claying or refining it for the market which takes off perhaps more than ninetenths of the whole produce the manufacture of claying or refining sugar accordingly though it has flourished in all the sugar colonies of france has been little cultivated in any of those of england except for the market of the colonies themselves while grenada was in the hands of the french there was a refinery of sugar by claying at least upon almost every plantation since it fell into those of the english almost all works of this kind have been given up and there are at present october      i am assured not above two or three remaining in the island at present however by an indulgence of the customhouse clayed or refined sugar if reduced from loaves into powder is commonly imported as muskovado  while great britain encourages in america the manufactures of pig and bar iron by exempting them from duties to which the like commodities are subject when imported from any other country she imposes an absolute prohibition upon the erection of steel furnaces and slitmills in any of her american plantations she will not suffer her colonists to work in those more refined manufactures even for their own consumption but insists upon their purchasing of her merchants and manufacturers all goods of this kind which they have occasion for  she prohibits the exportation from one province to another by water and even the carriage by land upon horseback or in a cart of hats of wools and woollen goods of the produce of america a regulation which effectually prevents the establishment of any manufacture of such commodities for distant sale and confines the industry of her colonists in this way to such coarse and household manufactures as a private family commonly makes for its own use or for that of some of its neighbors in the same province  to prohibit a great people however from making all that they can of every part of their own produce or from employing their stock and industry in the way that they judge most advantageous to themselves is a manifest violation of the most sacred rights of mankind unjust however as such prohibitions may be they have not hitherto been very hurtful to the colonies land is still so cheap and consequently labor so dear among them that they can import from the mother country almost all the more refined or more advanced manufactures cheaper than they could make them for themselves though they had not therefore been prohibited from establishing such manufactures yet in their present state of improvement a regard to their own interest would probably have prevented them from doing so in their present state of improvement those prohibitions perhaps without cramping their industry or restraining it from any employment to which it would have gone of its own accord are only impertinent badges of slavery imposed upon them without any sufficient reason by the groundless jealousy of the merchants and manufacturers of the mother country in a more advanced state they might be really oppressive and insupportable  great britain too as she confines to her own market some of the most important productions of the colonies so in compensation she gives to some of them an advantage in that market sometimes by imposing higher duties upon the like productions when imported from other countries and sometimes by giving bounties upon their importation from the colonies in the first way she gives an advantage in the home market to the sugar tobacco and iron of her own colonies and in the second to their raw silk to their hemp and flax to their indigo to their naval stores and to their building timber this second way of encouraging the colony produce by bounties upon importation is so far as i have been able to learn peculiar to great britain the first is not portugal does not content herself with imposing higher duties upon the importation of tobacco from any other country but prohibits it under the severest penalties  with regard to the importation of goods from europe england has likewise dealt more liberally with her colonies than any other nation  great britain allows a part almost always the half generally a larger portion and sometimes the whole of the duty which is paid upon the importation of foreign goods to be drawn back upon their exportation to any foreign country no independent foreign country it was easy to foresee would receive them if they came to it loaded with the heavy duties to which almost all foreign goods are subjected on their importation into great britain unless therefore some part of those duties was drawn back upon exportation there was an end of the carrying trade a trade so much favored by the mercantile system  our colonies however are by no means independent foreign countries and great britain having assumed to herself the exclusive right of supplying them with all goods from europe might have forced them in the same manner as other countries have done their colonies to receive such goods loaded with all the same duties which they paid in the mother country but on the contrary till      the same drawbacks were paid upon the exportation of the greater part of foreign goods to our colonies as to any independent foreign country in      indeed by the  th of george iiid c    this indulgence was a good deal abated and it was enacted that no part of the duty called the old subsidy should be drawn back for any goods of the growth production or manufacture of europe or the east indies which should be exported from this kingdom to any british colony or plantation in america wines white callicoes and muslins excepted before this law many different sorts of foreign goods might have been bought cheaper in the plantations than in the mother country and some may still  of the greater part of the regulations concerning the colony trade the merchants who carry it on it must be observed have been the principal advisers we must not wonder therefore if in the greater part of them their interest has been more considered than either that of the colonies or that of the mother country in their exclusive privilege of supplying the colonies with all the goods which they wanted from europe and of purchasing all such parts of their surplus produce as could not interfere with any of the trades which they themselves carried on at home the interest of the colonies was sacrificed to the interest of those merchants in allowing the same drawbacks upon the reexportation of the greater part of european and east india goods to the colonies as upon their reexportation to any independent country the interest of the mother country was sacrificed to it even according to the mercantile ideas of that interest it was for the interest of the merchants to pay as little as possible for the foreign goods which they sent to the colonies and consequently to get back as much as possible of the duties which they advanced upon their importation into great britain they might thereby be enabled to sell in the colonies either the same quantity of goods with a greater profit or a greater quantity with the same profit and consequently to gain something either in the one way or the other it was likewise for the interest of the colonies to get all such goods as cheap and in as great abundance as possible but this might not always be for the interest of the mother country she might frequently suffer both in her revenue by giving back a great part of the duties which had been paid upon the importation of such goods and in her manufactures by being undersold in the colony market in consequence of the easy terms upon which foreign manufactures could be carried thither by means of those drawbacks the progress of the linen manufacture of great britain it is commonly said has been a good deal retarded by the drawbacks upon the reexportation of german linen to the american colonies  but though the policy of great britain with regard to the trade of her colonies has been dictated by the same mercantile spirit as that of other nations it has however upon the whole been less illiberal and oppressive than that of any of them  in every thing except their foreign trade the liberty of the english colonists to manage their own affairs their own way is complete it is in every respect equal to that of their fellow citizens at home and is secured in the same manner by an assembly of the representatives of the people who claim the sole right of imposing taxes for the support of the colony government the authority of this assembly overawes the executive power and neither the meanest nor the most obnoxious colonist as long as he obeys the law has any thing to fear from the resentment either of the governor or of any other civil or military officer in the province the colony assemblies though like the house of commons in england they are not always a very equal representation of the people yet as the executive power either has not the means to corrupt them or on account of the support which it receives from the mother country is not under the necessity of doing so they are perhaps in general more influenced by the inclinations of their constituents the councils which in the colony legislatures correspond to the house of lords in great britain are not composed of an hereditary nobility in some of the colonies as in three of the governments of new england those councils are not appointed by the king but chosen by the representatives of the people in none of the english colonies is there any hereditary nobility in all of them indeed as in all other free countries the descendant of an old colony family is more respected than an upstart of equal merit and fortune but he is only more respected and he has no privileges by which he can be troublesome to his neighbors before the commencement of the present disturbances the colony assemblies had not only the legislative but a part of the executive power in connecticut and rhode island they elected the governor in the other colonies they appointed the revenue officers who collected the taxes imposed by those respective assemblies to whom those officers were immediately responsible there is more equality therefore among the english colonists than among the inhabitants of the mother country their manners are more republican and their governments those of three of the provinces of new england in particular have hitherto been more republican too  the absolute governments of spain portugal and france on the contrary take place in their colonies and the discretionary powers which such governments commonly delegate to all their inferior officers are on account of the great distance naturally exercised there with more than ordinary violence under all absolute governments there is more liberty in the capital than in any other part of the country the sovereign himself can never have either interest or inclination to pervert the order of justice or to oppress the great body of the people in the capital his presence overawes more or less all his inferior officers who in the remoter provinces from whence the complaints of the people are less likely to reach him can exercise their tyranny with much more safety but the european colonies in america are more remote than the most distant provinces of the greatest empires which had ever been known before the government of the english colonies is perhaps the only one which since the world began could give perfect security to the inhabitants of so very distant a province the administration of the french colonies however has always been conducted with more gentleness and moderation than that of the spanish and portugueze this superiority of conduct is suitable both to the character of the french nation and to what forms the character of every nation the nature of their government which though arbitrary and violent in comparison with that of great britain is legal and free in comparison with those of spain and portugal  it is in the progress of the north american colonies however that the superiority of the english policy chiefly appears the progress of the sugar colonies of france has been at least equal perhaps superior to that of the greater part of those of england and yet the sugar colonies of england enjoy a free government nearly of the same kind with that which takes place in her colonies of north america but the sugar colonies of france are not discouraged like those of england from refining their own sugar and what is of still greater importance the genius of their government naturally introduces a better management of their negro slaves  in all european colonies the culture of the sugar cane is carried on by negro slaves the constitution of those who have been born in the temperate climate of europe could not it is supposed support the labor of digging the ground under the burning sun of the west indies and the culture of the sugar cane as it is managed at present is all hand labor though in the opinion of many the drill plough might be introduced into it with great advantage but as the profit and success of the cultivation which is carried on by means of cattle depend very much upon the good management of those cattle so the profit and success of that which is carried on by slaves must depend equally upon the good management of those slaves and in the good management of their slaves the french planters i think it is generally allowed are superior to the english the law so far as it gives some weak protection to the slave against the violence of his master is likely to be better executed in a colony where the government is in a great measure arbitrary than in one where it is altogether free in every country where the unfortunate law of slavery is established the magistrate when he protects the slave intermeddles in some measure in the management of the private property of the master and in a free country where the master is perhaps either a member of the colony assembly or an elector of such a member he dare not do this but with the greatest caution and circumspection the respect which he is obliged to pay to the master renders it more difficult for him to protect the slave but in a country where the government is in a great measure arbitrary where it is usual for the magistrate to intermeddle even in the management of the private property of individuals and to send them perhaps a lettre de cachet if they do not manage it according to his liking it is much easier for him to give some protection to the slave and common humanity naturally disposes him to do so the protection of the magistrate renders the slave less contemptible in the eyes of his master who is thereby induced to consider him with more regard and to treat him with more gentleness gentle usage renders the slave not only more faithful but more intelligent and therefore upon a double account more useful he approaches more to the condition of a free servant and may possess some degree of integrity and attachment to his masters interest virtues which frequently belong to free servants but which never can belong to a slave who is treated as slaves commonly are in countries where the master is perfectly free and secure  that the condition of a slave is better under an arbitrary than under a free government is i believe supported by the history of all ages and nations in the roman history the first time we read of the magistrate interposing to protect the slave from the violence of his master is under the emperors when vedius pollio in the presence of augustus ordered one of his slaves who had committed a slight fault to be cut into pieces and thrown into his fish pond in order to feed his fishes the emperor commanded him with indignation to emancipate immediately not only that slave but all the others that belonged to him under the republic no magistrate could have had authority enough to protect the slave much less to punish the master  the stock it is to be observed which has improved the sugar colonies of france particularly the great colony of st domingo has been raised almost entirely from the gradual improvement and cultivation of those colonies it has been almost altogether the produce of the soil and industry of the colonists or what comes to the same thing the price of that produce gradually accumulated by good management and employed in raising a still greater produce but the stock which has improved and cultivated the sugar colonies of england has a great part of it been sent out from england and has by no means been altogether the produce of the soil and industry of the colonists the prosperity of the english sugar colonies has been in a great measure owing to the great riches of england of which a part has overflowed if one may say so upon those colonies but the prosperity of the sugar colonies of france has been entirely owing to the good conduct of the colonists which must therefore have had some superiority over that of the english and this superiority has been remarked in nothing so much as in the good management of their slaves  such have been the general outlines of the policy of the different european nations with regard to their colonies  the policy of europe therefore has very little to boast of either in the original establishment or in the subsequent prosperity of the colonies of america  folly and injustice seem to have been the principles which presided over and directed the first project of establishing those colonies the folly of hunting after gold and silver mines and the injustice of coveting the possession of a country whose harmless natives far from having ever injured the people of europe had received the first adventurers with every mark of kindness and hospitality  the adventurers indeed who formed some of the later establishments joined to the chimerical project of finding gold and silver mines other motives more reasonable and more laudable but even these motives do very little honor to the policy of europe  the english puritans persecuted at home fled for freedom to america and established there the four governments of new england the english catholics treated with equal injustice established that of maryland the quakers that of pensylvania the portugueze jews persecuted by the inquisition stripped of their fortunes and banished to brazil introduced by their example some sort of order and industry among the transported felons and strumpets by whom that colony was originally peopled and taught them the culture of the sugar cane upon all these different occasions it was not the wisdom and policy but the disorder and injustice of the european governments which peopled and cultivated america  in effectuating some of the most important of these establishments the different governments of europe had as little merit as in projecting them the conquest of mexico was the project not of the council of spain but of a governor of cuba and it was effectuated by the spirit of the bold adventurer to whom it was entrusted in spite of every thing which that governor who soon repented of having trusted such a person could do to thwart it the conquerors of chili and peru and of almost all the other spanish settlements upon the continent of america carried out with them no other public encouragement but a general permission to make settlements and conquests in the name of the king of spain those adventures were all at the private risk and expense of the adventurers the government of spain contributed scarce any thing to any of them that of england contributed as little toward effectuating the establishment of some of its most important colonies in north america  when those establishments were effectuated and had become so considerable as to attract the attention of the mother country the first regulations which she made with regard to them had always in view to secure to herself the monopoly of their commerce to confine their market and to enlarge her own at their expense and consequently rather to damp and discourage than to quicken and forward the course of their prosperity in the different ways in which this monopoly has been exercised consists one of the most essential differences in the policy of the different european nations with regard to their colonies the best of them all that of england is only somewhat less illiberal and oppressive than that of any of the rest  in what way therefore has the policy of europe contributed either to the first establishment or to the present grandeur of the colonies of america in one way and in one way only it has contributed a good deal magna virum matter it bred and formed the men who were capable of atchieving such great actions and of laying the foundation of so great an empire and there is no other quarter of the world of which the policy is capable of forming or has ever actually and in fact formed such men the colonies owe to the policy of europe the education and great views of their active and enterprizing founders and some of the greatest and most important of them owe to it scarce any thing else  part third of the advantages which europe has derived from the discovery of america and from that of a passage to the east indies by the cape of good hope such are the advantages which the colonies of america have derived from the policy of europe  what are those which europe has derived from the discovery and colonization of america  those advantages may be divided first into the general advantages which europe considered as one great country has derived from those great events and secondly into the particular advantages which each colonizing country has derived from the colonies which particularly belong to it in consequence of the authority or dominion which it exercises over them  the general advantages which europe considered as one great country has derived from the discovery and colonization of america consist first in the increase of its enjoyments and secondly in the augmentation of its industry  the surplus produce of america imported into europe furnishes the inhabitants of this great continent with a variety of commodities which they could not otherwise have possessed some for convenience and use some for pleasure and some for ornament and thereby contributes to increase their enjoyments  the discovery and colonization of america it will readily be allowed have contributed to augment the industry first of all the countries which trade to it directly such as spain portugal france and england and secondly of all those which without trading to it directly send through the medium of other countries goods to it of their own produce such as austrian flanders and some provinces of germany which through the medium of the countries before mentioned send to it a considerable quantity of linen and other goods all such countries have evidently gained a more extensive market for their surplus produce and must consequently have been encouraged to increase its quantity  but that those great events should likewise have contributed to encourage the industry of countries such as hungary and poland which may never perhaps have sent a single commodity of their own produce to america is not perhaps altogether so evident that those events have done so however cannot be doubted some part of the produce of america is consumed in hungary and poland and there is some demand there for the sugar chocolate and tobacco of that new quarter of the world but those commodities must be purchased with something which is either the produce of the industry of hungary and poland or with something which had been purchased with some part of that produce those commodities of america are new values new equivalents introduced into hungary and poland to be exchanged there for the surplus produce of those countries by being carried thither they create a new and more extensive market for that surplus produce they raise its value and thereby contribute to encourage its increase though no part of it may ever be carried to america it may be carried to other countries which purchase it with a part of their share of the surplus produce of america and it may find a market by means of the circulation of that trade which was originally put into motion by the surplus produce of america  those great events may even have contributed to increase the enjoyments and to augment the industry of countries which not only never sent any commodities to america but never received any from it even such countries may have received a greater abundance of other commodities from countries of which the surplus produce had been augmented by means of the american trade this greater abundance as it must necessarily have increased their enjoyments so it must likewise have augmented their industry a greater number of new equivalents of some kind or other must have been presented to them to be exchanged for the surplus produce of that industry a more extensive market must have been created for that surplus produce so as to raise its value and thereby encourage its increase the mass of commodities annually thrown into the great circle of european commerce and by its various revolutions annually distributed among all the different nations comprehended within it must have been augmented by the whole surplus produce of america a greater share of this greater mass therefore is likely to have fallen to each of those nations to have increased their enjoyments and augmented their industry  the exclusive trade of the mother countries tends to diminish or at least to keep down below what they would otherwise rise to both the enjoyments and industry of all those nations in general and of the american colonies in particular it is a dead weight upon the action of one of the great springs which puts into motion a great part of the business of mankind by rendering the colony produce dearer in all other countries it lessens its consumption and thereby cramps the industry of the colonies and both the enjoyments and the industry of all other countries which both enjoy less when they pay more for what they enjoy and produce less when they get less for what they produce by rendering the produce of all other countries dearer in the colonies it cramps in the same manner the industry of all other countries and both the enjoyments and the industry of the colonies it is a clog which for the supposed benefit of some particular countries embarrasses the pleasures and encumbers the industry of all other countries but of the colonies more than of any other it only excludes as much as possible all other countries from one particular market but it confines as much as possible the colonies to one particular market and the difference is very great between being excluded from one particular market when all others are open and being confined to one particular market when all others are shut up the surplus produce of the colonies however is the original source of all that increase of enjoyments and industry which europe derives from the discovery and colonization of america and the exclusive trade of the mother countries tends to render this source much less abundant than it otherwise would be  the particular advantages which each colonizing country derives from the colonies which particularly belong to it are of two different kinds first those common advantages which every empire derives from the provinces subject to its dominion and secondly those peculiar advantages which are supposed to result from provinces of so very peculiar a nature as the european colonies of america  the common advantages which every empire derives from the provinces subject to its dominion consist first in the military force which they furnish for its defense and secondly in the revenue which they furnish for the support of its civil government the roman colonies furnished occasionally both the one and the other the greek colonies sometimes furnished a military force but seldom any revenue they seldom acknowledged themselves subject to the dominion of the mother city they were generally her allies in war but very seldom her subjects in peace  the european colonies of america have never yet furnished any military force for the defense of the mother country their military force has never yet been sufficient for their own defense and in the different wars in which the mother countries have been engaged the defense of their colonies has generally occasioned a very considerable distraction of the military force of those countries in this respect therefore all the european colonies have without exception been a cause rather of weakness than of strength to their respective mother countries  the colonies of spain and portugal only have contributed any revenue toward the defense of the mother country or the support of her civil government the taxes which have been levied upon those of other european nations upon those of england in particular have seldom been equal to the expense laid out upon them in time of peace and never sufficient to defray that which they occasioned in time of war such colonies therefore have been a source of expense and not of revenue to their respective mother countries  the advantages of such colonies to their respective mother countries consist altogether in those peculiar advantages which are supposed to result from provinces of so very peculiar a nature as the european colonies of america and the exclusive trade it is acknowledged is the sole source of all those peculiar advantages  in consequence of this exclusive trade all that part of the surplus produce of the english colonies for example which consists in what are called enumerated commodities can be sent to no other country but england other countries must afterward buy it of her it must be cheaper therefore in england than it can be in any other country and must contribute more to increase the enjoyments of england than those of any other country it must likewise contribute more to encourage her industry for all those parts of her own surplus produce which england exchanges for those enumerated commodities she must get a better price than any other country can get for the like parts of theirs when they exchange them for the same commodities the manufactures of england for example will purchase a greater quantity of the sugar and tobacco of her own colonies than the like manufactures of other countries can purchase of that sugar and tobacco so far therefore as the manufactures of england and those of other countries are both to be exchanged for the sugar and tobacco of the english colonies this superiority of price gives an encouragement to the former beyond what the latter can in these circumstances enjoy the exclusive trade of the colonies therefore as it diminishes or at least keeps down below what they would otherwise rise to both the enjoyments and the industry of the countries which do not possess it so it gives an evident advantage to the countries which do possess it over those other countries  this advantage however will perhaps be found to be rather what may be called a relative than an absolute advantage and to give a superiority to the country which enjoys it rather by depressing the industry and produce of other countries than by raising those of that particular country above what they would naturally rise to in the case of a free trade  the tobacco of maryland and virginia for example by means of the monopoly which england enjoys of it certainly comes cheaper to england than it can do to france to whom england commonly sells a considerable part of it but had france and all other european countries been at all times allowed a free trade to maryland and virginia the tobacco of those colonies might by this time have come cheaper than it actually does not only to all those other countries but likewise to england the produce of tobacco in consequence of a market so much more extensive than any which it has hitherto enjoyed might and probably would by this time have been so much increased as to reduce the profits of a tobacco plantation to their natural level with those of a corn plantation which it is supposed they are still somewhat above the price of tobacco might and probably would by this time have fallen somewhat lower than it is at present an equal quantity of the commodities either of england or of those other countries might have purchased in maryland and virginia a greater quantity of tobacco than it can do at present and consequently have been sold there for so much a better price so far as that weed therefore can by its cheapness and abundance increase the enjoyments or augment the industry either of england or of any other country it would probably in the case of a free trade have produced both these effects in somewhat a greater degree than it can do at present england indeed would not in this case have had any advantage over other countries she might have bought the tobacco of her colonies somewhat cheaper and consequently have sold some of her own commodities somewhat dearer than she actually does but she could neither have bought the one cheaper nor sold the other dearer than any other country might have done she might perhaps have gained an absolute but she would certainly have lost a relative advantage  in order however to obtain this relative advantage in the colony trade in order to execute the invidious and malignant project of excluding as much as possible other nations from any share in it england there are very probable reasons for believing has not only sacrificed a part of the absolute advantage which she as well as every other nation might have derived from that trade but has subjected herself both to an absolute and to a relative disadvantage in almost every other branch of trade  when by the act of navigation england assumed to herself the monopoly of the colony trade the foreign capitals which had before been employed in it were necessarily withdrawn from it the english capital which had before carried on but a part of it was now to carry on the whole the capital which had before supplied the colonies with but a part of the goods which they wanted from europe was now all that was employed to supply them with the whole but it could not supply them with the whole and the goods with which it did supply them were necessarily sold very dear the capital which had before bought but a part of the surplus produce of the colonies was now all that was employed to buy the whole but it could not buy the whole at any thing near the old price and therefore whatever it did buy it necessarily bought very cheap but in an employment of capital in which the merchant sold very dear and bought very cheap the profit must have been very great and much above the ordinary level of profit in other branches of trade this superiority of profit in the colony trade could not fail to draw from other branches of trade a part of the capital which had before been employed in them but this revulsion of capital as it must have gradually increased the competition of capitals in the colony trade so it must have gradually diminished that competition in all those other branches of trade as it must have gradually lowered the profits of the one so it must have gradually raised those of the other till the profits of all came to a new level different from and somewhat higher than that at which they had been before  this double effect of drawing capital from all other trades and of raising the rate of profit somewhat higher than it otherwise would have been in all trades was not only produced by this monopoly upon its first establishment but has continued to be produced by it ever since  first this monopoly has been continually drawing capital from all other trades to be employed in that of the colonies  though the wealth of great britain has increased very much since the establishment of the act of navigation it certainly has not increased in the same proportion as that of the colonies but the foreign trade of every country naturally increases in proportion to its wealth its surplus produce in proportion to its whole produce and great britain having engrossed to herself almost the whole of what may be called the foreign trade of the colonies and her capital not having increased in the same proportion as the extent of that trade she could not carry it on without continually withdrawing from other branches of trade some part of the capital which had before been employed in them as well as withholding from them a great deal more which would otherwise have gone to them since the establishment of the act of navigation accordingly the colony trade has been continually increasing while many other branches of foreign trade particularly of that to other parts of europe have been continually decaying our manufactures for foreign sale instead of being suited as before the act of navigation to the neighboring market of europe or to the more distant one of the countries which lie round the mediterranean sea have the greater part of them been accommodated to the still more distant one of the colonies to the market in which they have the monopoly rather than to that in which they have many competitors the causes of decay in other branches of foreign trade which by sir matthew decker and other writers have been sought for in the excess and improper mode of taxation in the high price of labor in the increase of luxury etc may all be found in the overgrowth of the colony trade the mercantile capital of great britain though very great yet not being infinite and though greatly increased since the act of navigation yet not being increased in the same proportion as the colony trade that trade could not possibly be carried on without withdrawing some part of that capital from other branches of trade nor consequently without some decay of those other branches  england it must be observed was a great trading country her mercantile capital was very great and likely to become still greater and greater every day not only before the act of navigation had established the monopoly of the colony trade but before that trade was very considerable in the dutch war during the government of cromwell her navy was superior to that of holland and in that which broke out in the beginning of the reign of charles ii it was at least equal perhaps superior to the united navies of france and holland its superiority perhaps would scarce appear greater in the present times at least if the dutch navy was to bear the same proportion to the dutch commerce now which it did then but this great naval power could not in either of those wars be owing to the act of navigation during the first of them the plan of that act had been but just formed and though before the breaking out of the second it had been fully enacted by legal authority yet no part of it could have had time to produce any considerable effect and least of all that part which established the exclusive trade to the colonies both the colonies and their trade were inconsiderable then in comparison of what they are now the island of jamaica was an unwholesome desert little inhabited and less cultivated new york and new jersey were in the possession of the dutch the half of st christophers in that of the french the island of antigua the two carolinas pensylvania georgia and nova scotia were not planted virginia maryland and new england were planted and though they were very thriving colonies yet there was not perhaps at that time either in europe or america a single person who foresaw or even suspected the rapid progress which they have since made in wealth population and improvement the island of barbados in short was the only british colony of any consequence of which the condition at that time bore any resemblance to what it is at present the trade of the colonies of which england even for some time after the act of navigation enjoyed but a part for the act of navigation was not very strictly executed till several years after it was enacted could not at that time be the cause of the great trade of england nor of the great naval power which was supported by that trade the trade which at that time supported that great naval power was the trade of europe and of the countries which lie round the mediterranean sea but the share which great britain at present enjoys of that trade could not support any such great naval power had the growing trade of the colonies been left free to all nations whatever share of it might have fallen to great britain and a very considerable share would probably have fallen to her must have been all an addition to this great trade of which she was before in possession in consequence of the monopoly the increase of the colony trade has not so much occasioned an addition to the trade which great britain had before as a total change in its direction  secondly this monopoly has necessarily contributed to keep up the rate of profit in all the different branches of british trade higher than it naturally would have been had all nations been allowed a free trade to the british colonies  the monopoly of the colony trade as it necessarily drew toward that trade a greater proportion of the capital of great britain than what would have gone to it of its own accord so by the expulsion of all foreign capitals it necessarily reduced the whole quantity of capital employed in that trade below what it naturally would have been in the case of a free trade but by lessening the competition of capitals in that branch of trade it necessarily raised the rate of the profit in that branch by lessening too the competition of british capitals in all other branches of trade it necessarily raised the rate of british profit in all those other branches whatever may have been at any particular period since the establishment of the act of navigation the state or extent of the mercantile capital of great britain the monopoly of the colony trade must during the continuance of that state have raised the ordinary rate of british profit higher than it otherwise would have been both in that and in all the other branches of british trade if since the establishment of the act of navigation the ordinary rate of british profit has fallen considerably as it certainly has it must have fallen still lower had not the monopoly established by that act contributed to keep it up  but whatever raises in any country the ordinary rate of profit higher than it otherwise would be necessarily subjects that country both to an absolute and to a relative disadvantage in every branch of trade of which she has not the monopoly  it subjects her to an absolute disadvantage because in such branches of trade her merchants cannot get this greater profit without selling dearer than they otherwise would do both the goods of foreign countries which they import into their own and the goods of their own country which they export to foreign countries their own country must both buy dearer and sell dearer must both buy less and sell less must both enjoy less and produce less than she otherwise would do  it subjects her to a relative disadvantage because in such branches of trade it sets other countries which are not subject to the same absolute disadvantage either more above her or less below her than they otherwise would be it enables them both to enjoy more and to produce more in proportion to what she enjoys and produces it renders their superiority greater or their inferiority less than it otherwise would be by raising the price of her produce above what it otherwise would be it enables the merchants of other countries to undersell her in foreign markets and thereby to justle her out of almost all those branches of trade of which she has not the monopoly  our merchants frequently complain of the high wages of british labor as the cause of their manufactures being undersold in foreign markets but they are silent about the high profits of stock they complain of the extravagant gain of other people but they say nothing of their own the high profits of british stock however may contribute toward raising the price of british manufactures in many cases as much and in some perhaps more than the high wages of british labor  it is in this manner that the capital of great britain one may justly say has partly been drawn and partly been driven from the greater part of the different branches of trade of which she has not the monopoly from the trade of europe in particular and from that of the countries which lie round the mediterranean sea  it has partly been drawn from those branches of trade by the attraction of superior profit in the colony trade in consequence of the continual increase of that trade and of the continual insufficiency of the capital which had carried it on one year to carry it on the next  it has partly been driven from them by the advantage which the high rate of profit established in great britain gives to other countries in all the different branches of trade of which great britain has not the monopoly  as the monopoly of the colony trade has drawn from those other branches a part of the british capital which would otherwise have been employed in them so it has forced into them many foreign capitals which would never have gone to them had they not been expelled from the colony trade in those other branches of trade it has diminished the competition of british capitals and thereby raised the rate of british profit higher than it otherwise would have been on the contrary it has increased the competition of foreign capitals and thereby sunk the rate of foreign profit lower than it otherwise would have been both in the one way and in the other it must evidently have subjected great britain to a relative disadvantage in all those other branches of trade  the colony trade however it may perhaps be said is more advantageous to great britain than any other and the monopoly by forcing into that trade a greater proportion of the capital of great britain than what would otherwise have gone to it has turned that capital into an employment more advantageous to the country than any other which it could have found  the most advantageous employment of any capital to the country to which it belongs is that which maintains there the greatest quantity of productive labor and increases the most the annual produce of the land and labor of that country but the quantity of productive labor which any capital employed in the foreign trade of consumption can maintain is exactly in proportion it has been shown in the second book to the frequency of its returns a capital of a thousand pounds for example employed in a foreign trade of consumption of which the returns are made regularly once in the year can keep in constant employment in the country to which it belongs a quantity of productive labor equal to what a thousand pounds can maintain there for a year if the returns are made twice or thrice in the year it can keep in constant employment a quantity of productive labor equal to what two or three thousand pounds can maintain there for a year a foreign trade of consumption carried on with a neighboring country is upon this account in general more advantageous than one carried on with a distant country and for the same reason a direct foreign trade of consumption as it has likewise been shown in the second book is in general more advantageous than a roundabout one  but the monopoly of the colony trade so far as it has operated upon the employment of the capital of great britain has in all cases forced some part of it from a foreign trade of consumption carried on with a neighboring country to one carried on with a more distant country and in many cases from a direct foreign trade of consumption to a roundabout one  first the monopoly of the colony trade has in all cases forced some part of the capital of great britain from a foreign trade of consumption carried on with a neighboring to one carried on with a more distant country  it has in all cases forced some part of that capital from the trade with europe and with the countries which lie round the mediterranean sea to that with the more distant regions of america and the west indies from which the returns are necessarily less frequent not only on account of the greater distance but on account of the peculiar circumstances of those countries new colonies it has already been observed are always understocked their capital is always much less than what they could employ with great profit and advantage in the improvement and cultivation of their land they have a constant demand therefore for more capital than they have of their own and in order to supply the deficiency of their own they endeavor to borrow as much as they can of the mother country to whom they are therefore always in debt the most common way in which the colonists contract this debt is not by borrowing upon bond of the rich people of the mother country though they sometimes do this too but by running as much in arrear to their correspondents who supply them with goods from europe as those correspondents will allow them their annual returns frequently do not amount to more than a third and sometimes not to so great a proportion of what they owe the whole capital therefore which their correspondents advance to them is seldom returned to britain in less than three and sometimes not in less than four or five years but a british capital of a thousand pounds for example which is returned to great britain only once in five years can keep in constant employment only onefifth part of the british industry which it could maintain if the whole was returned once in the year and instead of the quantity of industry which a thousand pounds could maintain for a year can keep in constant employment the quantity only which two hundred pounds can maintain for a year the planter no doubt by the high price which he pays for the goods from europe by the interest upon the bills which he grants at distant dates and by the commission upon the renewal of those which he grants at near dates makes up and probably more than makes up all the loss which his correspondent can sustain by this delay but though he may make up the loss of his correspondent he cannot make up that of great britain in a trade of which the returns are very distant the profit of the merchant may be as great or greater than in one in which they are very frequent and near but the advantage of the country in which he resides the quantity of productive labor constantly maintained there the annual produce of the land and labor must always be much less that the returns of the trade to america and still more those of that to the west indies are in general not only more distant but more irregular and more uncertain too than those of the trade to any part of europe or even of the countries which lie round the mediterranean sea will readily be allowed i imagine by every body who has any experience of those different branches of trade  secondly the monopoly of the colony trade has in many cases forced some part of the capital of great britain from a direct foreign trade of consumption into a roundabout one  among the enumerated commodities which can be sent to no other market but great britain there are several of which the quantity exceeds very much the consumption of great britain and of which a part therefore must be exported to other countries but this cannot be done without forcing some part of the capital of great britain into a roundabout foreign trade of consumption maryland and virginia for example send annually to great britain upwards of ninetysix thousand hogsheads of tobacco and the consumption of great britain is said not to exceed fourteen thousand upwards of eightytwo thousand hogsheads therefore must be exported to other countries to france to holland and to the countries which lie round the baltic and mediterranean seas but that part of the capital of great britain which brings those eightytwo thousand hogsheads to great britain which reexports them from thence to those other countries and which brings back from those other countries to great britain either goods or money in return is employed in a roundabout foreign trade of consumption and is necessarily forced into this employment in order to dispose of this great surplus if we would compute in how many years the whole of this capital is likely to come back to great britain we must add to the distance of the american returns that of the returns from those other countries if in the direct foreign trade of consumption which we carry on with america the whole capital employed frequently does not come back in less than three or four years the whole capital employed in this roundabout one is not likely to come back in less than four or five if the one can keep in constant employment but a third or a fourth part of the domestic industry which could be maintained by a capital returned once in the year the other can keep in constant employment but a fourth or a fifth part of that industry but had not the colonies been confined to the market of great britain for the sale of their tobacco very little more of it would probably have come to us than what was necessary for the home consumption the goods which great britain purchases at present for her own consumption with the great surplus of tobacco which she exports to other countries she would in this case probably have purchased with the immediate produce of her own industry or with some part of her own manufactures that produce those manufactures instead of being almost entirely suited to one great market as at present would probably have been fitted to a great number of smaller markets instead of one great roundabout foreign trade of consumption great britain would probably have carried on a great number of small direct foreign trades of the same kind on account of the frequency of the returns a part and probably but a small part perhaps not above a third or a fourth of the capital which at present carries on this great roundabout trade might have been sufficient to carry on all those small direct ones might have kept in constant employment an equal quantity of british industry and have equally supported the annual produce of the land and labor of great britain all the purposes of this trade being in this manner answered by a much smaller capital there would have been a large spare capital to apply to other purposes to improve the lands to increase the manufactures and to extend the commerce of great britain to come into competition at least with the other british capitals employed in all those different ways to reduce the rate of profit in them all and thereby to give to great britain in all of them a superiority over other countries still greater than what she at present possesses  the monopoly of the colony trade too has forced some part of the capital of great britain from all foreign trade of consumption to a carrying trade and consequently from supporting more or less the industry of great britain to be employed altogether in supporting partly that of the colonies and partly that of some other countries  the goods for example which are annually purchased with the great surplus of eightytwo thousand hogsheads of tobacco annually reexported from great britain are not all consumed in great britain part of them linen from germany and holland for example is returned to the colonies for their particular consumption but that part of the capital of great britain which buys the tobacco with which this linen is afterward bought is necessarily withdrawn from supporting the industry of great britain to be employed altogether in supporting partly that of the colonies and partly that of the particular countries who pay for this tobacco with the produce of their own industry  the monopoly of the colony trade besides by forcing toward it a much greater proportion of the capital of great britain than what would naturally have gone to it seems to have broken altogether that natural balance which would otherwise have taken place among all the different branches of british industry the industry of great britain instead of being accommodated to a great number of small markets has been principally suited to one great market her commerce instead of running in a great number of small channels has been taught to run principally in one great channel but the whole system of her industry and commerce has thereby been rendered less secure the whole state of her body politic less healthful than it otherwise would have been in her present condition great britain resembles one of those unwholesome bodies in which some of the vital parts are overgrown and which upon that account are liable to many dangerous disorders scarce incident to those in which all the parts are more properly proportioned a small stop in that great blood vessel which has been artificially swelled beyond its natural dimensions and through which an unnatural proportion of the industry and commerce of the country has been forced to circulate is very likely to bring on the most dangerous disorders upon the whole body politic the expectation of a rupture with the colonies accordingly has struck the people of great britain with more terror than they ever felt for a spanish armada or a french invasion it was this terror whether well or ill grounded which rendered the repeal of the stamp act a popular measure among the merchants at least in the total exclusion from the colony market was it to last only for a few years the greater part of our merchants used to fancy that they foresaw an entire stop to their trade the greater part of our master manufacturers the entire ruin of their business and the greater part of our workmen an end of their employment a rupture with any of our neighbors upon the continent though likely too to occasion some stop or interruption in the employments of some of all these different orders of people is foreseen however without any such general emotion the blood of which the circulation is stopped in some of the smaller vessels easily disgorges itself into the greater without occasioning any dangerous disorder but when it is stopped in any of the greater vessels convulsions apoplexy or death are the immediate and unavoidable consequences if but one of those overgrown manufactures which by means either of bounties or of the monopoly of the home and colony markets have been artificially raised up to an unnatural height finds some small stop or interruption in its employment it frequently occasions a mutiny and disorder alarming to government and embarrassing even to the deliberations of the legislature how great therefore would be the disorder and confusion it was thought which must necessarily be occasioned by a sudden and entire stop in the employment of so great a proportion of our principal manufacturers  some moderate and gradual relaxation of the laws which give to great britain the exclusive trade to the colonies till it is rendered in a great measure free seems to be the only expedient which can deliver her from this danger which can enable her or even force her to withdraw some part of her capital from this overgrown employment and to turn it though with less profit toward other employments and which by gradually diminishing one branch of her industry and gradually increasing all the rest can by degrees restore all the different branches of it to that natural healthful and proper proportion which perfect liberty necessarily establishes and which perfect liberty can alone preserve to open the colony trade all at once to all nations might not only occasion some transitory inconveniency but a great permanent loss to the greater part of those whose industry or capital is at present engaged in it the sudden loss of the employment even of the ships which import the eightytwo thousand hogsheads of tobacco which are over and above the consumption of great britain might alone be felt very sensibly such are the unfortunate effects of all the regulations of the mercantile system they not only introduce very dangerous disorders into the state of the body politic but disorders which it is often difficult to remedy without occasioning for a time at least still greater disorders in what manner therefore the colony trade ought gradually to be opened what are the restraints which ought first and what are those which ought last to be taken away or in what manner the natural system of perfect liberty and justice ought gradually to be restored we must leave to the wisdom of future statesmen and legislators to determine  five different events unforeseen and unthought of have very fortunately concurred to hinder great britain from feeling so sensibly as it was generally expected she would the total exclusion which has now taken place for more than a year from the first of december      from a very important branch of the colony trade that of the twelve associated provinces of north america first those colonies in preparing themselves for their nonimportation agreement drained great britain completely of all the commodities which were fit for their market secondly the extraordinary demand of the spanish flota has this year drained germany and the north of many commodities linen in particular which used to come into competition even in the british market with the manufactures of great britain thirdly the peace between russia and turkey has occasioned an extraordinary demand from the turkey market which during the distress of the country and while a russian fleet was cruizing in the archipelago had been very poorly supplied fourthly the demand of the north of europe for the manufactures of great britain has been increasing from year to year for some time past and fifthly the late partition and consequential pacification of poland by opening the market of that great country have this year added an extraordinary demand from thence to the increasing demand of the north these events are all except the fourth in their nature transitory and accidental and the exclusion from so important a branch of the colony trade if unfortunately it should continue much longer may still occasion some degree of distress this distress however as it will come on gradually will be felt much less severely than if it had come on all at once and in the mean time the industry and capital of the country may find a new employment and direction so as to prevent it from ever rising to any considerable height  the monopoly of the colony trade therefore so far as it has turned toward that trade a greater proportion of the capital of great britain than what would otherwise have gone to it has in all cases turned it from a foreign trade of consumption with a neighburing into one with a more distant country in many cases from a direct foreign trade of consumption into a roundabout one and in some cases from all foreign trade of consumption into a carrying trade it has in all cases therefore turned it from a direction in which it would have maintained a greater quantity of productive labor into one in which it can maintain a much smaller quantity by suiting besides to one particular market only so great a part of the industry and commerce of great britain it has rendered the whole state of that industry and commerce more precarious and less secure than if their produce had been accommodated to a greater variety of markets  we must carefully distinguish between the effects of the colony trade and those of the monopoly of that trade the former are always and necessarily beneficial the latter always and necessarily hurtful but the former are so beneficial that the colony trade though subject to a monopoly and notwithstanding the hurtful effects of that monopoly is still upon the whole beneficial and greatly beneficials though a good deal less so than it otherwise would be  the effect of the colony trade in its natural and free state is to open a great though distant market for such parts of the produce of british industry as may exceed the demand of the markets nearer home of those of europe and of the countries which lie round the mediterranean sea in its natural and free state the colony trade without drawing from those markets any part of the produce which had ever been sent to them encourages great britain to increase the surplus continually by continually presenting new equivalents to be exchanged for it in its natural and free state the colony trade tends to increase the quantity of productive labor in great britain but without altering in any respect the direction of that which had been employed there before in the natural and free state of the colony trade the competition of all other nations would hinder the rate of profit from rising above the common level either in the new market or in the new employment the new market without drawing any thing from the old one would create if one may say so a new produce for its own supply and that new produce would constitute a new capital for carrying on the new employment which in the same manner would draw nothing from the old one  the monopoly of the colony trade on the contrary by excluding the competition of other nations and thereby raising the rate of profit both in the new market and in the new employment draws produce from the old market and capital from the old employment to augment our share of the colony trade beyond what it otherwise would be is the avowed purpose of the monopoly if our share of that trade were to be no greater with than it would have been without the monopoly there could have been no reason for establishing the monopoly but whatever forces into a branch of trade of which the returns are slower and more distant than those of the greater part of other trades a greater proportion of the capital of any country than what of its own accord would go to that branch necessarily renders the whole quantity of productive labor annually maintained there the whole annual produce of the land and labor of that country less than they otherwise would be it keeps down the revenue of the inhabitants of that country below what it would naturally rise to and thereby diminishes their power of accumulation it not only hinders at all times their capital from maintaining so great a quantity of productive labor as it would otherwise maintain but it hinders it from increasing so fast as it would otherwise increase and consequently from maintaining a still greater quantity of productive labor  the natural good effects of the colony trade however more than counterbalance to great britain the bad effects of the monopoly so that monopoly and all together that trade even as it is carried on at present is not only advantageous but greatly advantageous the new market and new employment which are opened by the colony trade are of much greater extent than that portion of the old market and of the old employment which is lost by the monopoly the new produce and the new capital which has been created if one may say so by the colony trade maintain in great britain a greater quantity of productive labor than what can have been thrown out of employment by the revulsion of capital from other trades of which the returns are more frequent if the colony trade however even as it is carried on at present is advantageous to great britain it is not by means of the monopoly but in spite of the monopoly  it is rather for the manufactured than for the rude produce of europe that the colony trade opens a new market agriculture is the proper business of all new colonies a business which the cheapness of land renders more advantageous than any other they abound therefore in the rude produce of land and instead of importing it from other countries they have generally a large surplus to export in new colonies agriculture either draws hands from all other employments or keeps them from going to any other employment there are few hands to spare for the necessary and none for the ornamental manufactures the greater part of the manufactures of both kinds they find it cheaper to purchase of other countries than to make for themselves it is chiefly by encouraging the manufactures of europe that the colony trade indirectly encourages its agriculture the manufacturers of europe to whom that trade gives employment constitute a new market for the produce of the land and the most advantageous of all markets the home market for the corn and cattle for the bread and butchersmeat of europe is thus greatly extended by means of the trade to america  but that the monopoly of the trade of populous and thriving colonies is not alone sufficient to establish or even to maintain manufactures in any country the examples of spain and portugal sufficiently demonstrate spain and portugal were manufacturing countries before they had any considerable colonies since they had the richest and most fertile in the world they have both ceased to be so  in spain and portugal the bad effects of the monopoly aggravated by other causes have entirely conquered the natural good effects of the colony trade these causes seem to be other monopolies of different kinds the degradation of the value of gold and silver below what it is in most other countries the exclusion from foreign markets by improper taxes upon exportation and the narrowing of the home market by still more improper taxes upon the transportation of goods from one part of the country to another but above all that irregular and partial administration of justice which often protects the rich and powerful debtor from the pursuit of his injured creditor and which makes the industrious part of the nation afraid to prepare goods for the consumption of those haughty and great men to whom they dare not refuse to sell upon credit and from whom they are altogether uncertain of repayment  in england on the contrary the natural good effects of the colony trade assisted by other causes have in a great measure conquered the bad effects of the monopoly these causes seem to be the general liberty of trade which notwithstanding some restraints is at least equal perhaps superior to what it is in any other country the liberty of exporting duty free almost all sorts of goods which are the produce of domestic industry to almost any foreign country and what perhaps is of still greater importance the unbounded liberty of transporting them from any one part of our own country to any other without being obliged to give any account to any public office without being liable to question or examination of any kind but above all that equal and impartial administration of justice which renders the rights of the meanest british subject respectable to the greatest and which by securing to every man the fruits of his own industry gives the greatest and most effectual encouragement to every sort of industry  if the manufactures of great britain however have been advanced as they certainly have by the colony trade it has not been by means of the monopoly of that trade but in spite of the monopoly the effect of the monopoly has been not to augment the quantity but to alter the quality and shape of a part of the manufactures of great britain and to accommodate to a market from which the returns are slow and distant what would otherwise have been accommodated to one from which the returns are frequent and near its effect has consequently been to turn a part of the capital of great britain from an employment in which it would have maintained a greater quantity of manufacturing industry to one in which it maintains a much smaller and thereby to diminish instead of increasing the whole quantity of manufacturing industry maintained in great britain  the monopoly of the colony trade therefore like all the other mean and malignant expedients of the mercantile system depresses the industry of all other countries but chiefly that of the colonies without in the least increasing but on the contrary diminishing that of the country in whose favor it is established  the monopoly hinders the capital of that country whatever may at any particular time be the extent of that capital from maintaining so great a quantity of productive labor as it would otherwise maintain and from affording so great a revenue to the industrious inhabitants as it would otherwise afford but as capital can be increased only by savings from revenue the monopoly by hindering it from affording so great a revenue as it would otherwise afford necessarily hinders it from increasing so fast as it would otherwise increase and consequently from maintaining a still greater quantity of productive labor and affording a still greater revenue to the industrious inhabitants of that country one great original source of revenue therefore the wages of labor the monopoly must necessarily have rendered at all timesless abundant than it otherwise would have been  by raising the rate of mercantile profit the monopoly discourages the improvement of land the profit of improvement depends upon the difference between what the land actually produces and what by the application of a certain capital it can be made to produce if this difference affords a greater profit than what can be drawn from an equal capital in any mercantile employment the improvement of land will draw capital from all mercantile employments if the profit is less mercantile employments will draw capital from the improvement of land whatever therefore raises the rate of mercantile profit either lessens the superiority or increases the inferiority of the profit of improvement and in the one case hinders capital from going to improvement and in the other draws capital from it but by discouraging improvement the monopoly necessarily retards the natural increase of another great original source of revenue the rent of land by raising the rate of profit too the monopoly necessarily keeps up the market rate of interest higher than it otherwise would be but the price of land in proportion to the rent which it affords the number of years purchase which is commonly paid for it necessarily falls as the rate of interest rises and rises as the rate of interest falls the monopoly therefore hurts the interest of the landlord two different ways by retarding the natural increase first of his rent and secondly of the price which he would get for his land in proportion to the rent which it affords  the monopoly indeed raises the rate of mercantile profit and thereby augments somewhat the gain of our merchants but as it obstructs the natural increase of capital it tends rather to diminish than to increase the sum total of the revenue which the inhabitants of the country derive from the profits of stock a small profit upon a great capital generally affording a greater revenue than a great profit upon a small one the monopoly raises the rate of profit but it hinders the sum of profit from rising so high as it otherwise would do  all the original sources of revenue the wages of labor the rent of land and the profits of stock the monopoly renders much less abundant than they otherwise would be to promote the little interest of one little order of men in one country it hurts the interest of all other orders of men in that country and of all men in all other countries  it is solely by raising the ordinary rate of profit that the monopoly either has proved or could prove advantageous to any one particular order of men but besides all the bad effects to the country in general which have already been mentioned as necessarily resulting from a high rate of profit there is one more fatal perhaps than all these put together but which if we may judge from experience is inseparably connected with it the high rate of profit seems every where to destroy that parsimony which in other circumstances is natural to the character of the merchant when profits are high that sober virtue seems to be superfluous and expensive luxury to suit better the affluence of his situation but the owners of the great mercantile capitals are necessarily the leaders and conductors of the whole industry of every nation and their example has a much greater influence upon the manners of the whole industrious part of it than that of any other order of men if his employer is attentive and parsimonious the workman is very likely to be so too but if the master is dissolute and disorderly the servant who shapes his work according to the pattern which his master prescribes to him will shape his life too according to the example which he sets him accumulation is thus prevented in the hands of all those who are naturally the most disposed to accumulate and the funds destined for the maintenance of productive labor receive no augmentation from the revenue of those who ought naturally to augment them the most the capital of the country instead of increasing gradually dwindles away and the quantity of productive labor maintained in it grows every day less and less have the exorbitant profits of the merchants of cadiz and lisbon augmented the capital of spain and portugal have they alleviated the poverty have they promoted the industry of those two beggarly countries such has been the tone of mercantile expense in those two trading cities that those exorbitant profits far from augmenting the general capital of the country seem scarce to have been sufficient to keep up the capitals upon which they were made foreign capitals are every day intruding themselves if i may say so more and more into the trade of cadiz and lisbon it is to expel those foreign capitals from a trade which their own capital grows every day more and more insufficient for carrying on that the spaniards and portugueze endeavor every day to straiten more and more the galling bands of their absurd monopoly compare the mercantile manners of cadiz and lisbon with those of amsterdam and you will be sensible how differently the conduct and character of merchants are affected by the high and by the low profits of stock the merchants of london indeed have not yet generally become such magnificent lords as those of cadiz and lisbon but neither are they in general such attentive and parsimonious burghers as those of amsterdam they are supposed however many of them to be a good deal richer than the greater part of the former and not quite so rich as many of the latter but the rate of their profit is commonly much lower than that of the former and a good deal higher than that of the latter light come light go says the proverb and the ordinary tone of expense seems every where to be regulated not so much according to the real ability of spending as to the supposed facility of getting money to spend  it is thus that the single advantage which the monopoly procures to a single order of men is in many different ways hurtful to the general interest of the country  to found a great empire for the sole purpose of raising up a people of customers may at first sight appear a project fit only for a nation of shopkeepers it is however a project altogether unfit for a nation of shopkeepers but extremely fit for a nation that is governed by shopkeepers such sovereigns and such sovereigns only are capable of fancying that they will find some advantage in employing the blood and treasure of their subjects to found and to maintain such an empire say to a shopkeeper buy me a good estate and i shall always buy my clothes at your shop even though i should pay somewhat dearer than what i can have them for at other shops and you will not find him very forward to embrace your proposal but should any other person buy you such an estate the shopkeeper would be much obliged to your benefactor if he would enjoin you to buy all your clothes at his shop england purchased for some of her subjects who found themselves uneasy at home a great estate in a distant country the price indeed was very small and instead of thirty years purchase the ordinary price of land in the present times it amounted to little more than the expense of the different equipments which made the furst discovery reconnoitered the coast and took a fictitious possession of the country the land was good and of great extent and the cultivators having plenty of good ground to work upon and being for some time at liberty to sell their produce where they pleased became in the course of little more than thirty or forty years between    0 and    0 so numerous and thriving a people that the shopkeepers and other traders of england wished to secure to themselves the monopoly of their custom without pretending therefore that they had paid any part either of the original purchase money or of the subsequent expense of improvement they petitioned the parliament that the cultivators of america might for the future be confined to their shop first for buying all the goods which tey wanted from europe and secondly for selling all such parts of their own produce as those traders might find it convenient to buy for they did not find it convenient to buy every part of it some parts of it imported into england might have interfered with some of the trades which they themselves carried on at home those particular parts of it therefore they were willing that the colonists should sell where they could the farther off the better and upon that account proposed that their market should be confined to the countries south of cape finisterre a clause in the famous act of navigation established this truly shopkeeper proposal into a law  the maintenance of this monopoly has hitherto been the principal or more properly perhaps the sole end and purpose of the dominion which great britain assumes over her colonies in the exclusive trade it is supposed consists the great advantage of provinces which have never yet afforded either revenue or military force for the support of the civil government or the defense of the mother country the monopoly is the principal badge of their dependency and it is the sole fruit which has hitherto been gathered from that dependency whatever expense great britain has hitherto laid out in maintaining this dependency has really been laid out in order to support this monopoly the expense of the ordinary peace establishment of the colonies amounted before the commencement of the present disturbances to the pay of twenty regiments of foot to the expense of the artillery stores and extraordinary provisions with which it is necessary to supply them and to the expense of a very considerable naval force which is constantly kept up in order to guard from the smuggling vessels of other nations the immense coast of north america and that of our west indian islands the whole expense of this peace establishment was a charge upon the revenue of great britain and was at the same time the smallest part of what the dominion of the colonies has cost the mother country if we would know the amount of the whole we must add to the annual expense of this peace establishment the interest of the sums which in consequence of her considering her colonies as provinces subject to her dominion great britain has upon different occasions laid out upon their defense we must add to it in particular the whole expense of the late war and a great part of that which preceeded it the late war was altogether a colony quarrel and the whole expense of it in whatever part of the world it may have been laid out whether in germany or in the east indies ought justly to be stated to the account of the colonies it amounted to more than ninety millions sterling including not only the new debt which was contracted but the two shillings in the pound additional land tax and the sums which were every year borrowed from the sinking fund the spanish war which began in      was principally a colony quarrel its principal object was to prevent the search of the colony ships which carried on a contraband trade with the spanish main this whole expense is in reality a bounty which has been given in order to support a monopoly the pretended purpose of it was to encourage the manufactures and to increase the commerce of great britain but its real effect has been to raise the rate of mercantile profit and to enable our merchants to turn into a branch of trade of which the returns are more slow and distant than those of the greater part of other trades a greater proportion of their capital than they otherwise would have done two events which if a bounty could have prevented it might perhaps have been very well worth while to give such a bounty  under the present system of management therefore great britain derives nothing but loss from the dominion which she assumes over her colonies  to propose that great britain should voluntarily give up all authority over her colonies and leave them to elect their own magistrates to enact their own laws and to make peace and war as they might think proper would be to propose such a measure as never was and never will be adopted by any nation in the world no nation ever voluntarily gave up the dominion of any province how troublesome soever it might be to govern it and how small soever the revenue which it afforded might be in proportion to the expense which it occasioned such sacrifices though they might frequently be agreeable to the interest are always mortifying to the pride of every nation and what is perhaps of still greater consequence they are always contrary to the private interest of the governing part of it who would thereby be deprived of the disposal of many places of trust and profit of many opportunities of acquiring wealth and distinction which the possession of the most turbulent and to the great body of the people the most unprofitable province seldom fails to afford the most visionary enthusiast would scarce be capable of proposing such a measure with any serious hopes at least of its ever being adopted if it was adopted however great britain would not only be immediately freed from the whole annual expense of the peace establishment of the colonies but might settle with them such a treaty of commerce as would effectually secure to her a free trade more advantageous to the great body of the people though less so to the merchants than the monopoly which she at present enjoys by thus parting good friends the natural affection of the colonies to the mother country which perhaps our late dissensions have well nigh extinguished would quickly revive it might dispose them not only to respect for whole centuries together that treaty of commerce which they had concluded with us at parting but to favor us in war as well as in trade and instead of turbulent and factious subjects to become our most faithful affectionate and generous allies and the same sort of parental affection on the one side and filial respect on the other might revive between great britain and her colonies which used to subsist between those of ancient greece and the mother city from which they descended  in order to render any province advantageous to the empire to which it belongs it ought to afford in time of peace a revenue to the public sufficient not only for defraying the whole expense of its own peace establishment but for contributing its proportion to the support of the general government of the empire every province necessarily contributes more or less to increase the expense of that general government if any particular province therefore does not contribute its share toward defraying this expense an unequal burden must be thrown upon some other part of the empire the extraordinary revenue too which every province affords to the public in time of war ought from parity of reason to bear the same proportion to the extraordinary revenue of the whole empire which its ordinary revenue does in time of peace that neither the ordinary nor extraordinary revenue which great britain derives from her colonies bears this proportion to the whole revenue of the british empire will readily be allowed the monopoly it has been supposed indeed by increasing the private revenue of the people of great britain and thereby enabling them to pay greater taxes compensates the deficiency of the public revenue of the colonies but this monopoly i have endeavored to show though a very grievous tax upon the colonies and though it may increase the revenue of a particular order of men in great britain diminishes instead of increasing that of the great body of the people and consequently diminishes instead of increasing the ability of the great body of the people to pay taxes the men too whose revenue the monopoly increases constitute a particular order which it is both absolutely impossible to tax beyond the proportion of other orders and extremely impolitick even to attempt to tax beyond that proportion as i shall endeavor to show in the following book no particular resource therefore can be drawn from this particular order  the colonies may be taxed either by their own assemblies or by the parliament of great britain  that the colony assemblies can ever be so managed as to levy upon their constituents a public revenue sufficient not only to maintain at all times their own civil and military establishment but to pay their proper proportion of the expense of the general government of the british empire seems not very probable it was a long time before even the parliament of england though placed immediately under the eye of the sovereign could be brought under such a system of management or could be rendered sufficiently liberal in their grants for supporting the civil and military establishments even of their own country it was only by distributing among the particular members of parliament a great part either of the offices or of the disposal of the offices arising from this civil and military establishment that such a system of management could be established even with regard to the parliament of england but the distance of the colony assemblies from the eye of the sovereign their number their dispersed situation and their various constitutions would render it very difficult to manage them in the same manner even though the sovereign had the same means of doing it and those means are wanting it would be absolutely impossible to distribute among all the leading members of all the colony assemblies such a share either of the offices or of the disposal of the offices arising from the general government of the british empire as to dispose them to give up their popularity at home and to tax their constituents for the support of that general government of which almost the whole emoluments were to be divided among people who were strangers to them the unavoidable ignorance of administration besides concerning the relative importance of the different members of those different assemblies the offenses which must frequently be given the blunders which must constantly be committed in attempting to manage them in this manner seem to render such a system of management altogether impracticable with regard to them  the colony assemblies besides cannot be supposed the proper judges of what is necessary for the defense and support of the whole empire the care of that defense and support is not entrusted to them it is not their business and they have no regular means of information concerning it the assembly of a province like the vestry of a parish may judge very properly concerning the affairs of its own particular district but can have no proper means of judging concerning those of the whole empire it cannot even judge properly concerning the proportion which its own province bears to the whole empire or concerning the relative degree of its wealth and importance compared with the other provinces because those other provinces are not under the inspection and superintendancy of the assembly of a particular province what is necessary for the defense and support of the whole empire and in what proportion each part ought to contribute can be judged of only by that assembly which inspects and superintends the affairs of the whole empire  it has been proposed accordingly that the colonies should be taxed by requisition the parliament of great britain determining the sum which each colony ought to pay and the provincial assembly assessing and levying it in the way that suited best the circumstances of the province what concerned the whole empire would in this way be determined by the assembly which inspects and superintends the affairs of the whole empire and the provincial affairs of each colony might still be regulated by its own assembly though the colonies should in this case have no representatives in the british parliament yet if we may judge by experience there is no probability that the parliamentary requisition would be unreasonable the parliament of england has not upon any occasion shown the smallest disposition to overburden those parts of the empire which are not represented in parliament the islands of guernsey and jersey without any means of resisting the authority of parliament are more lightly taxed than any part of great britain parliament in attempting to exercise its supposed right whether well or ill grounded of taxing the colonies has never hitherto demanded of them any thing which even approached to a just proportion to what was paid by their fellow subjects at home if the contribution of the colonies besides was to rise or fall in proportion to the rise or fall of the land tax parliament could not tax them without taxing at the same time its own constituents and the colonies might in this case be considered as virtually represented in parliament  examples are not wanting of empires in which all the different provinces are not taxed if i may be allowed the expression in one mass but in which the sovereign regulates the sum which each province ought to pay and in some provinces assesses and levies it as he thinks proper while in others he leaves it to be assessed and levied as the respective states of each province shall determine in some provinces of france the king not only imposes what taxes he thinks proper but assesses and levies them in the way he thinks proper from others he demands a certain sum but leaves it to the states of each province to assess and levy that sum as they think proper according to the scheme of taxing by requisition the parliament of great britain would stand nearly in the same situation toward the colony assemblies as the king of france does toward the states of those provinces which still enjoy the privilege of having states of their own the provinces of france which are supposed to be the best governed  but though according to this scheme the colonies could have no just reason to fear that their share of the public burdens should ever exceed the proper proportion to that of their fellow citizens at home great britain might have just reason to fear that it never would amount to that proper proportion the parliament of great britain has not for some time past had the same established authority in the colonies which the french king has in those provinces of france which still enjoy the privilege of having states of their own the colony assemblies if they were not very favorably disposed and unless more skilfully managed than they ever have been hitherto they are not very likely to be so might still find many pretenses for evading or rejecting the most reasonable requisitions of parliament a french war breaks out we shall suppose ten millions must immediately be raised in order to defend the seat of the empire this sum must be borrowed upon the credit of some parliamentary fund mortgaged for paying the interest part of this fund parliament proposes to raise by a tax to be levied in great britain and part of it by a requisition to all the different colony assemblies of america and the west indies would people readily advance their money upon the credit of a fund which partly depended upon the good humor of all those assemblies far distant from the seat of the war and sometimes perhaps thinking themselves not much concerned in the event of it upon such a fund no more money would probably be advanced than what the tax to be levied in great britain might be supposed to answer for the whole burden of the debt contracted on account of the war would in this manner fall as it always has done hitherto upon great britain upon a part of the empire and not upon the whole empire great britain is perhaps since the world began the only state which as it has extended its empire has only increased its expense without once augmenting its resources other states have generally disburdened themselves upon their subject and subordinate provinces of the most considerable part of the expense of defending the empire great britain has hitherto suffered her subject and subordinate provinces to disburden themselves upon her of almost this whole expense in order to put great britain upon a footing of equality with her own colonies which the law has hitherto supposed to be subject and subordinate it seems necessary upon the scheme of taxing them by parliamentary requisition that parliament should have some means of rendering its requisitions immediately effectual in case the colony assemblies should attempt to evade or reject them and what those means are it is not very easy to conceive and it has not yet been explained  should the parliament of great britain at the same time be ever fully established in the right of taxing the colonies even independent of the consent of their own assemblies the importance of those assemblies would from that moment be at an end and with it that of all the leading men of british america men desire to have some share in the management of public affairs chiefly on account of the importance which it gives them upon the power which the greater part of the leading men the natural aristocracy of every country have of preserving or defending their respective importance depends the stability and duration of every system of free government in the attacks which those leading men are continually making upon the importance of one another and in the defense of their own consists the whole play of domestic faction and ambition the leading men of america like those of all other countries desire to preserve their own importance they feel or imagine that if their assemblies which they are fond of calling parliaments and of considering as equal in authority to the parliament of great britain should be so far degraded as to become the humble ministers and executive officers of that parliament the greater part of their own importance would be at an end they have rejected therefore the proposal of being taxed by parliamentary requisition and like other ambitious and high spirited men have rather chosen to draw the sword in defense of their own importance  toward the declension of the roman republic the allies of rome who had born the principal burden of defending the state and extending the empire demanded to be admitted to all the privileges of roman citizens upon being refused the social war broke out during the course of that war rome granted those privileges to the greater part of them one by one and in proportion as they detached themselves from the general confederacy the parliament of great britain insists upon taxing the colonies and they refuse to be taxed by a parliament in which they are not represented if to each colony which should detach itself from the general confederacy great britain should allow such a number of representatives as suited the proportion of what it contributed to the public revenue of the empire in consequence of its being subjected to the same taxes and in compensation admitted to the same freedom of trade with its fellow subjects at home the number of its representatives to be augmented as the proportion of its contribution might afterward augment a new method of acquiring importance a new and more dazzling object of ambition would be presented to the leading men of each colony instead of piddling for the little prizes which are to be found in what may be called the paltry raffle of colony faction they might then hope from the presumption which men naturally have in their own ability and good fortune to draw some of the great prizes which sometimes come from the wheel of the great state lottery of british politics unless this or some other method is fallen upon and there seems to be none more obvious than this of preserving the importance and of gratifying the ambition of the leading men of america it is not very probable that they will ever voluntarily submit to us and we ought to consider that the blood which must be shed in forcing them to do so is every drop of it the blood either of those who are or of those whom we wish to have for our fellow citizens they are very weak who flatter themselves that in the state to which things have come our colonies will be easily conquered by force alone the persons who now govern the resolutions of what they call their continental congress feel in themselves at this moment a degree of importance which perhaps the greatest subjects in europe scarce feel from shopkeepers tradesmen and attorneys they are become statesmen and legislators and are employed in contriving a new form of government for an extensive empire which they flatter themselves will become and which indeed seems very likely to become one of the greatest and most formidable that ever was in the world five hundred different people perhaps who in different ways act immediately under the continental congress and five hundred thousand perhaps who act under those five hundred all feel in the same manner a proportionable rise in their own importance almost every individual of the governing party in america fills at present in his own fancy a station superior not only to what he had ever filled before but to what he had ever expected to fill and unless some new object of ambition is presented either to him or to his leaders if he has the ordinary spirit of a man he will die in defense of that station  it is a remark of the president henaut that we now read with pleasure the account of many little transactions of the ligue which when they happened were not perhaps considered as very important pieces of news but every man then says he fancied himself of some importance and the innumerable memoirs which have come down to us from those times were the greater part of them written by people who took pleasure in recording and magnifying events in which they flattered themselves they had been considerable actors how obstinately the city of paris upon that occasion defended itself what a dreadful famine it supported rather than submit to the best and afterward the most beloved of all the french kings is well known the greater part of the citizens or those who governed the greater part of them fought in defense of their own importance which they foresaw was to be at an end whenever the ancient government should be reestablished our colonies unless they can be induced to consent to a union are very likely to defend themselves against the best of all mother countries as obstinately as the city of paris did against one of the best of kings  the idea of representation was unknown in ancient times when the people of one state were admitted to the right of citizenship in another they had no other means of exercising that right but by coming in a body to vote and deliberate with the people of that other state the admission of the greater part of the inhabitants of italy to the privileges of roman citizens completely ruined the roman republic it was no longer possible to distinguish between who was and who was not a roman citizen no tribe could know its own members a rabble of any kind could be introduced into the assemblies of the people could drive out the real citizens and decide upon the affairs of the republic as if they themselves had been such but though america was to send fifty or sixty new representatives to parliament the doorkeeper of the house of commons could not find any great difficulty in distinguishing between who was and who was not a member though the roman constitution therefore was necessarily ruined by the union of rome with the allied states of italy there is not the least probability that the british constitution would be hurt by the union of great britain with her colonies that constitution on the contrary would be completed by it and seems to be imperfect without it the assembly which deliberates and decides concerning the affairs of every part of the empire in order to be properly informed ought certainly to have representatives from every part of it that this union however could be easily effectuated or that difficulties and great difficulties might not occur in the execution i do not pretend i have yet heard of none however which appear insurmountable the principal perhaps arise not from the nature of things but from the prejudices and opinions of the people both on this and the other side of the atlantic  we on this side the water are afraid lest the multitude of american representatives should overturn the balance of the constitution and increase too much either the influence of the crown on the one hand or the force of the democracy on the other but if the number of american representatives was to be in proportion to the produce of american taxation the number of people to be managed would increase exactly in proportion to the means of managing them and the means of managing to the number of people to be managed the monarchical and democratical parts of the constitution would after the union stand exactly in the same degree of relative force with regard to one another as they had done before  the people on the other side of the water are afraid lest their distance from the seat of government might expose them to many oppressions but their representatives in parliament of which the number ought from the first to be considerable would easily be able to protect them from all oppression the distance could not much weaken the dependency of the representative upon the constituent and the former would still feel that he owed his seat in parliament and all the consequence which he derived from it to the good will of the latter it would be the interest of the former therefore to cultivate that good will by complaining with all the authority of a member of the legislature of every outrage which any civil or military officer might be guilty of in those remote parts of the empire the distance of america from the seat of government besides the nations of that country might flatter themselves with some appearance of reason too would not be of very long continuance such has hitherto been the rapid progress of that country in wealth population and improvement that in the course of little more than a century perhaps the produce of american might exceed that of british taxation the seat of the empire would then naturally remove itself to that part of the empire which contributed most to the general defense and support of the whole  the discovery of america and that of a passage to the east indies by the cape of good hope are the two greatest and most important events recorded in the history of mankind their consequences have already been very great but in the short period of between two and three centuries which has elapsed since these discoveries were made it is impossible that the whole extent of their consequences can have been seen what benefits or what misfortunes to mankind may hereafter result from those great events no human wisdom can foresee by uniting in some measure the most distant parts of the world by enabling them to relieve one anothers wants to increase one anothers enjoyments and to encourage one anothers industry their general tendency would seem to be beneficial to the natives however both of the east and west indies all the commercial benefits which can have resulted from those events have been sunk and lost in the dreadful misfortunes which they have occasioned these misfortunes however seem to have arisen rather from accident than from any thing in the nature of those events themselves at the particular time when these discoveries were made the superiority of force happened to be so great on the side of the europeans that they were enabled to commit with impunity every sort of injustice in those remote countries hereafter perhaps the natives of those countries may grow stronger or those of europe may grow weaker and the inhabitants of all the different quarters of the world may arrive at that equality of courage and force which by inspiring mutual fear can alone overawe the injustice of independent nations into some sort of respect for the rights of one another but nothing seems more likely to establish this equality of force than that mutual communication of knowledge and of all sorts of improvements which an extensive commerce from all countries to all countries naturally or rather necessarily carries along with it  in the mean time one of the principal effects of those discoveries has been to raise the mercantile system to a degree of splendour and glory which it could never otherwise have attained to it is the object of that system to enrich a great nation rather by trade and manufactures than by the improvement and cultivation of land rather by the industry of the towns than by that of the country but in consequence of those discoveries the commercial towns of europe instead of being the manufacturers and carriers for but a very small part of the world that part of europe which is washed by the atlantic ocean and the countries which lie round the baltic and mediterranean seas have now become the manufacturers for the numerous and thriving cultivators of america and the carriers and in some respects the manufacturers too for almost all the different nations of asia africa and america two new worlds have been opened to their industry each of them much greater and more extensive than the old one and the market of one of them growing still greater and greater every day  the countries which possess the colonies of america and which trade directly to the east indies enjoy indeed the whole show and splendour of this great commerce other countries however notwithstanding all the invidious restraints by which it is meant to exclude them frequently enjoy a greater share of the real benefit of it the colonies of spain and portugal for example give more real encouragement to the industry of other countries than to that of spain and portugal in the single article of linen alone the consumption of those colonies amounts it is said but i do not pretend to warrant the quantity to more than three millions sterling a year but this great consumption is almost entirely supplied by france flanders holland and germany spain and portugal furnish but a small part of it the capital which supplies the colonies with this great quantity of linen is annually distributed among and furnishes a revenue to the inhabitants of those other countries the profits of it only are spent in spain and portugal where they help to support the sumptuous profusion of the merchants of cadiz and lisbon  even the regulations by which each nation endeavors to secure to itself the exclusive trade of its own colonies are frequently more hurtful to the countries in favor of which they are established than to those against which they are established the unjust oppression of the industry of other countries falls back if i may say so upon the heads of the oppressors and crushes their industry more than it does that of those other countries by those regulations for example the merchant of hamburgh must send the linen which he destines for the american market to london and he must bring back from thence the tobacco which he destines for the german market because he can neither send the one directly to america nor bring back the other directly from thence by this restraint he is probably obliged to sell the one somewhat cheaper and to buy the other somewhat dearer than he otherwise might have done and his profits are probably somewhat abridged by means of it in this trade however between hamburgh and london he certainly receives the returns of his capital much more quickly than he could possibly have done in the direct trade to america even though we should suppose what is by no means the case that the payments of america were as punctual as those of london in the trade therefore to which those regulations confine the merchant of hamburgh his capital can keep in constant employment a much greater quantity of german industry than it possibly could have done in the trade from which he is excluded though the one employment therefore may to him perhaps be less profitable than the other it cannot be less advantageous to his country it is quite otherwise with the employment into which the monopoly naturally attracts if i may say so the capital of the london merchant that employment may perhaps be more profitable to him than the greater part of other employments but on account of the slowness of the returns it cannot be more advantageous to his country  after all the unjust attempts therefore of every country in europe to engross to itself the whole advantage of the trade of its own colonies no country has yet been able to engross to itself any thing but the expense of supporting in time of peace and of defending in time of war the oppressive authority which it assumes over them the inconveniences resulting from the possession of its colonies every country has engrossed to itself completely the advantages resulting from their trade it has been obliged to share with many other countries  at first sight no doubt the monopoly of the great commerce of america naturally seems to be an acquisition of the highest value to the undiscerning eye of giddy ambition it naturally presents itself amidst the confused scramble of politics and war as a very dazzling object to fight for the dazzling splendour of the object however the immense greatness of the commerce is the very quality which renders the monopoly of it hurtful or which makes one employment in its own nature necessarily less advantageous to the country than the greater part of other employments absorb a much greater proportion of the capital of the country than what would otherwise have gone to it  the mercantile stock of every country it has been shown in the second book naturally seeks if one may say so the employment most advantageous to that country it it is employed in the carrying trade the country to which it belongs becomes the emporium of the goods of all the countries whose trade that stock carries on but the owner of that stock necessarily wishes to dispose of as great a part of those goods as he can at home he thereby saves himself the trouble risk and expense of exportation and he will upon that account be glad to sell them at home not only for a much smaller price but with somewhat a smaller profit than he might expect to make by sending them abroad he naturally therefore endeavors as much as he can to turn his carrying trade into a foreign trade of consumption if his stock again is employed in a foreign trade of consumption he will for the same reason be glad to dispose of at home as great a part as he can of the home goods which he collects in order to export to some foreign market and he will thus endeavor as much as he can to turn his foreign trade of consumption into a home trade the mercantile stock of every country naturally courts in this manner the near and shuns the distant employment naturally courts the employment in which the returns are frequent and shuns that in which they are distant and slow naturally courts the employment in which it can maintain the greatest quantity of productive labor in the country to which it belongs or in which its owner resides and shuns that in which it can maintain there the smallest quantity it naturally courts the employment which in ordinary cases is most advantageous and shuns that which in ordinary cases is least advantageous to that country  but if in any of those distant employments which in ordinary cases are less advantageous to the country the profit should happen to rise somewhat higher than what is sufficient to balance the natural preference which is given to nearer employments this superiority of profit will draw stock from those nearer employments till the profits of all return to their proper level this superiority of profit however is a proof that in the actual circumstances of the society those distant employments are somewhat understocked in proportion to other employments and that the stock of the society is not distributed in the properest manner among all the different employments carried on in it it is a proof that something is either bought cheaper or sold dearer than it ought to be and that some particular class of citizens is more or less oppressed either by paying more or by getting less than what is suitable to that equality which ought to take place and which naturally does take place among all the different classes of them though the same capital never will maintain the same quantity of productive labor in a distant as in a near employment yet a distant employment may be as necessary for the welfare of the society as a near one the goods which the distant employment deals in being necessary perhaps for carrying on many of the nearer employments but if the profits of those who deal in such goods are above their proper level those goods will be sold dearer than they ought to be or somewhat above their natural price and all those engaged in the nearer employments will be more or less oppressed by this high price their interest therefore in this case requires that some stock should be withdrawn from those nearer employments and turned toward that distant employment in order to reduce its profits to their proper level and the price of the goods which it deals in to their natural price in this extraordinary case the public interest requires that some stock should be withdrawn from those employments which in ordinary cases are more advantageous and turned toward one which in ordinary cases is less advantageous to the public and in this extraordinary case the natural interests and inclinations of men coincide as exactly with the public interest as in all other ordinary cases and lead them to withdraw stock from the near and to turn it toward the distant employment  it is thus that the private interests and passions of individuals naturally dispose them to turn their stock toward the employments which in ordinary cases are most advantageous to the society bu if from this natural preference they should turn too much of it toward those employments the fall of profit in them and the rise of it in all others immediately dispose them to alter this faulty distribution without any intervention of law therefore the private interests and passions of men naturally lead them to divide and distribute the stock of every society among all the different employments carried on in it as nearly as possible in the proportion which is most agreeable to the interest of the whole society  all the different regulations of the mercantile system necessarily derange more or less this natural and most advantageous distribution of stock but those which concern the trade to america and the east indies derange it perhaps more than any other because the trade to those two great continents absorbs a greater quantity of stock than any two other branches of trade the regulations however by which this derangement is effected in those two different branches of trade are not altogether the same monopoly is the great engine of both but it is a different sort of monopoly monopoly of one kind or another indeed seems to be the sole engine of the mercantile system  in the trade to america every nation endeavors to engross as much as possible the whole market of its own colonies by fairly excluding all other nations from any direct trade to them during the greater part of the sixteenth century the portugueze endeavored to manage the trade to the east indies in the same manner by claiming the sole right of sailing in the indian seas on account of the merit of having first found out the road to them the dutch still continue to exclude all other european nations from any direct trade to their spice islands monopolies of this kind are evidently established against all other european nations who are thereby not only excluded from a trade to which it might be convenient for them to turn some part of their stock but are obliged to buy the goods which that trade deals in somewhat dearer than if they could import them themselves directly from the countries which produce them  but since the fall of the power of portugal no european nation has claimed the exclusive right of sailing in the indian seas of which the principal ports are now open to the ships of all european nations except in portugal however and within these few years in france the trade to the east indies has in every european country been subjected to an exclusive company monopolies of this kind are properly established against the very nation which erects them the greater part of that nation are thereby not only excluded from a trade to which it might be convenient for them to turn some part of their stock but are obliged to buy the goods which that trade deals in somewhat dearer than if it was open and free to all their countrymen since the establishment of the english east india company for example the other inhabitants of england over and above being excluded from the trade must have paid in the price of the east india goods which they have consumed not only for all the extraordinary profits which the company may have made upon those goods in consequence of their monopoly but for all the extraordinary waste which the fraud and abuse inseparable from the management of the affairs of so great a company must necessarily have occasioned the absurdity of this second kind of monopoly therefore is much more manifest than that of the first  both these kinds of monopolies derange more or less the natural distribution of the stock of the society but they do not always derange it in the same way  monopolies of the first kind always attract to the particular trade in which they are established a greater proportion of the stock of the society than what would go to that trade of its own accord  monopolies of the second kind may sometimes attract stock toward the particular trade in which they are established and sometimes repel it from that trade according to different circumstances in poor countries they naturally attract toward that trade more stock than would otherwise go to it in rich countries they naturally repel from it a good deal of stock which would otherwise go to it  such poor countries as sweden and denmark for example would probably have never sent a single ship to the east indies had not the trade been subjected to an exclusive company the establishment of such a company necessarily encourages adventurers their monopoly secures them against all competitors in the home market and they have the same chance for foreign markets with the traders of other nations their monopoly shows them the certainty of a great profit upon a considerable quantity of goods and the chance of a considerable profit upon a great quantity without such extraordinary encouragement the poor traders of such poor countries would probably never have thought of hazarding their small capitals in so very distant and uncertain an adventure as the trade to the east indies must naturally have appeared to them  such a rich country as holland on the contrary would probably in the case of a free trade send many more ships to the east indies than it actually does the limited stock of the dutch east india company probably repels from that trade many great mercantile capitals which would otherwise go to it the mercantile capital of holland is so great that it is as it were continually overflowing sometimes into the public funds of foreign countries sometimes into loans to private traders and adventurers of foreign countries sometimes into the most round about foreign trades of consumption and sometimes into the carrying trade all near employments being completely filled up all the capital which can be placed in them with any tolerable profit being already placed in them the capital of holland necessarily flows toward the most distant employments the trade to the east indies if it was altogether free would probably absorb the greater part of this redundant capital the east indies offer a market both for the manufactures of europe and for the gold and silver as well as for several other productions of america greater and more extensive than both europe and america put together  every derangement of the natural distribution of stock is necessarily hurtful to the society in which it takes place whether it be by repelling from a particular trade the stock which would otherwise go to it or by attracting toward a particular trade that which would not otherwise come to it if without any exclusive company the trade of holland to the east indies would be greater than it actually is that country must suffer a considerable loss by part of its capital being excluded from the employment most convenient for that part and in the same manner if without an exclusive company the trade of sweden and denmark to the east indies would be less than it actually is or what perhaps is more probable would not exist at all those two countries must likewise suffer a considerable loss by part of their capital being drawn into an employment which must be more or less unsuitable to their present circumstances better for them perhaps in their present circumstances to buy east india goods of other nations even though they should pay somewhat dearer than to turn so great a part of their small capital to so very distant a trade in which the returns are so very slow in which that capital can maintain so small a quantity of productive labor at home where productive labor is so much wanted where so little is done and where so much is to do  though without an exclusive company therefore a particular country should not be able to carry on any direct trade to the east indies it will not from thence follow that such a company ought to be established there but only that such a country ought not in these circumstances to trade directly to the east indies that such companies are not in general necessary for carrying on the east india trade is sufficiently demonstrated by the experience of the portugueze who enjoyed almost the whole of it for more than a century together without any exclusive company  no private merchant it has been said could well have capital sufficient to maintain factors and agents in the different ports of the east indies in order to provide goods for the ships which he might occasionally send thither and yet unless he was able do this the difficulty of finding a cargo might frequently make his ships lose the season for returning and the expense of so long a delay would not only eat up the whole profit of the adventure but frequently occasion a very considerable loss this argument however if it proved any thing at all would prove that no one great branch of trade could be carried on without an exclusive company which is contrary to the experience of all nations there is no great branch of trade in which the capital of any one private merchant is sufficient for carrying on all the subordinate branches which must be carried on in order to carry on the principal branch but when a nation is ripe for any great branch of trade some merchants naturally turn their capitals toward the principal and some toward the subordinate branches of it and though all the different branches of it are in this manner carried on yet it very seldom happens that they are all carried on by the capital of one private merchant if a nation therefore is ripe for the east india trade a certain portion of its capital will naturally divide itself among all the different branches of that trade some of its merchants will find it for their interest to reside in the east indies and to employ their capitals there in providing goods for the ships which are to be sent out by other merchants who reside in europe the settlements which different european nations have obtained in the east indies if they were taken from the exclusive companies to which they at present belong and put under the immediate protection of the sovereign would render this residence both safe and easy at least to the merchants of the particular nations to whom those settlements belong if at any particular time that part of the capital of any country which of its own accord tended and inclined if i may say so toward the east india trade was not sufficient for carrying on all those different branches of it it would be a proof that at that particular time that country was not ripe for that trade and that it would do better to buy for some time even at a higher price from other european nations the east india goods it had occasion for than to import them itself directly from the east indies what it might lose by the high price of those goods seldom be equal to the loss which it would sustain by the distraction of a large portion of its capital from other employments more necessary or more useful or more suitable to its circumstances and situation than a direct trade to the east indies  though the europeans possess many considerable settlements both upon the coast of africa and in the east indies they have not yet established in either of those countries such numerous and thriving colonies as those in the islands and continent of america africa however as well as several of the countries comprehended under the general name of the east indies are inhabited by barbarous nations but those nations were by no means so weak and defenseless as the miserable and helpless americans and in proportion to the natural fertility of the countries which they inhabited they were besides much more populous the most barbarous nations either of africa or of the east indies were shepherds even the hotentots were so but the natives of every part of america except mexico and peru were only hunters and the difference is very great between the number of shepherds and that of hunters whom the same extent of equally fertile territory can maintain in africa and the east indies therefore it was more difficult to displace the natives and to extend the european plantations over the greater part of the lands of the original inhabitants the genius of exclusive companies besides is unfavourable it has already been observed to the growth of new colonies and has probably been the principal cause of the little progress which they have made in the east indies the portugueze carried on the trade both to africa and the east indies without any exclusive companies and their settlements at congo angola and benguela on the coast of africa and at goa in the east indies though much depressed by superstition and every sort of bad government yet bear some faint resemblance to the colonies of america and are partly inhabited by portugueze who have been established there for several generations the dutch settlements at the cape of good hope and at batavia are at present the most considerable colonies which the europeans have established either in africa or in the east indies and both those settlements are peculiarly fortunate in their situation the cape of good hope was inhabited by a race of people almost as barbarous and quite as incapable of defending themselves as the natives of america it is besides the half wayhouse if one may say so between europe and the east indies at which almost every european ship makes some stay both in going and returning the supplying of those ships with every sort of fresh provisions with fruit and sometimes with wine affords alone a very extensive market for the surplus produce of the colonists what the cape of good hope is between europe and every part of the east indies batavia is between the principal countries of the east indies it lies upon the most frequented road from indostan to china and japan and is nearly about midway upon that road almost all the ships too that sail between europe and china touch at batavia and it is over and above all this the center and principal mart of what is called the country trade of the east indies not only of that part of it which is carried on by europeans but of that which is carried on by the native indians and vessels navigated by the inhabitants of china and japan of tonquin malacca cochinchina and the island of celebes are frequently to be seen in its port such advantageous situations have enabled those two colonies to surmount all the obstacles which the oppressive genius of an exclusive company may have occasionally opposed to their growth they have enabled batavia to surmount the additional disadvantage of perhaps the most unwholesome climate in the world  the english and dutch companies though they have established no considerable colonies except the two above mentioned have both made considerable conquests in the east indies but in the manner in which they both govern their new subjects the natural genius of an exclusive company has shown itself most distinctly in the spice islands the dutch burn all the spiceries which a fertile season produces beyond what they expect to dispose of in europe with such a profit as they think sufficient in the islands where they have no settlements they give a premium to those who collect the young blossoms and green leaves of the clove and nutmeg trees which naturally grow there but which this barbarous policy has now it is said almost completely extirpated even in the islands where they have settlements they have very much reduced it is said the number of those trees if the produce even of their own islands was much greater than what suited their market the natives they suspect might find means to convey some part of it to other nations and the best way they imagine to secure their own monopoly is to take care that no more shall grow than what they themselves carry to market by different arts of oppression they have reduced the population of several of the moluccas nearly to the number which is sufficient to supply with fresh provisions and other necessaries of life their own insignificant garrisons and such of their ships as occasionally come there for a cargo of spices under the government even of the portugueze however those islands are said to have been tolerably well inhabited the english company have not yet had time to establish in bengal so perfectly destructive a system the plan of their government however has had exactly the same tendency it has not been uncommon i am well assured for the chief that is the first clerk of a factory to order a peasant to plough up a rich field of poppies and sow it with rice or some other grain the pretense was to prevent a scarcity of provisions but the real reason to give the chief an opportunity of selling at a better price a large quantity of opium which he happened then to have upon hand upon other occasions the order has been reversed and a rich field of rice or other grain has been ploughed up in order to make room for a plantation of poppies when the chief foresaw that extraordinary profit was likely to be made by opium the servants of the company have upon several occasions attempted to establish in their own favor the monopoly of some of the most important branches not only of the foreign but of the inland trade of the country had they been allowed to go on it is impossible that they should not at some time or another have attempted to restrain the production of the particular articles of which they had thus usurped the monopoly not only to the quantity which they themselves could purchase but to that which they could expect to sell with such a profit as they might think sufficient in the course of a century or two the policy of the english company would in this manner have probably proved as completely destructive as that of the dutch  nothing however can be more directly contrary to the real interest of those companies considered as the sovereigns of the countries which they have conquered than this destructive plan in almost all countries the revenue of the sovereign is drawn from that of the people the greater the revenue of the people therefore the greater the annual produce of their land and labor the more they can afford to the sovereign it is his interest therefore to increase as much as possible that annual produce but if this is the interest of every sovereign it is peculiarly so of one whose revenue like that of the sovereign of bengal arises chiefly from a landrent that rent must necessarily be in proportion to the quantity and value of the produce and both the one and the other must depend upon the extent of the market the quantity will always be suited with more or less exactness to the consumption of those who can afford to pay for it and the price which they will pay will always be in proportion to the eagerness of their competition it is the interest of such a sovereign therefore to open the most extensive market for the produce of his country to allow the most perfect freedom of commerce in order to increase as much as possible the number and the competition of buyers and upon this account to abolish not only all monopolies but all restraints upon the transportation of the home produce from one part of the country to another upon its exportation to foreign countries or upon the importation of goods of any kind for which it can be exchanged he is in this manner most likely to increase both the quantity and value of that produce and consequently of his own share of it or of his own revenue  but a company of merchants are it seems incapable of considering themselves as sovereigns even after they have become such trade or buying in order to sell again they still consider as the principal business and by a strange absurdity regard the character of the sovereign as but an appendix to that of the merchant as something which ought to be made subservient to it or by means of which they may be enabled to buy cheaper in india and thereby to sell with a better profit in europe they endeavor for this purpose to keep out as much as possible all competitors from the market of the countries which are subject to their government and consequently to reduce at least some part of the surplus produce of those countries to what is barely sufficient for supplying their own demand or to what they can expect to sell in europe with such a profit as they may think reasonable their mercantile habits draw them in this manner almost necessarily though perhaps insensibly to prefer upon all ordinary occasions the little and transitory profit of the monopolist to the great and permanent revenue of the sovereign and would gradually lead them to treat the countries subject to their government nearly as the dutch treat the moluccas  but if the genius of such a government even as to what concerns its direction in europe is in this manner essentially and perhaps incurably faulty that of its administration in india is still more so that administration is necessarily composed of a council of merchants a profession no doubt extremely respectable but which in no country in the world carries along with it that sort of authority which naturally overawes the people and without force commands their willing obedience such a council can command obedience only by the military force with which they are accompanied and their government is therefore necessarily military and despotical their proper business however is that of merchants it is to sell upon their masters account the european goods consigned to them and to buy in return indian goods for the european market it is to sell the one as dear and to buy the other as cheap as possible and consequently to exclude as much as possible all rivals from the particular market where they keep their shop the genius of the administration therefore so far as concerns the trade of the company is the same as that of the direction it tends to make government subservient to the interest of monopoly and consequently to stunt the natural growth of some parts at least of the surplus produce of the country to what is barely sufficient for answering the demand of the company  all the members of the administration besides trade more or less upon their own account and it is in vain to prohibit them from doing so nothing can be more completely foolish than to expect that the clerks of a great counting house at ten thousand miles distance and consequently almost quite out of sight should upon a simple order from their masters give up at once doing any sort of business upon their own account abandon forever all hopes of making a fortune of which they have the means in their hands and content themselves with the moderate salaries which those masters allow them and which moderate as they are can seldom be augmented being commonly as large as the real profits of the company trade can afford in such circumstances to prohibit the servants of the company from trading upon their own account can have scarce any other effect than to enable the superior servants under pretense of executing their masters order to oppress such of the inferior ones as have had the misfortune to fall under their displeasure the servants naturally endeavor to establish the same monopoly in favor of their own private trade as of the public trade of the company if they are suffered to act as they could wish they will establish this monopoly openly and directly by fairly prohibiting all other people from trading in the articles in which they choose to deal and this perhaps is the best and least oppressive way of establishing it but if by an order from europe they are prohibited from doing this they will notwithstanding endeavor to establish a monopoly of the same kind secretly and indirectly in a way that is much more destructive to the country they will employ the whole authority of government and pervert the administration of justice in order to harrass and ruin those who interfere with them in any branch of commerce which by means of agents either concealed or at least not publicly avowed they may choose to carry on but the private trade of the servants will naturally extend to a much greater variety of articles than the public trade of the company the public trade of the company extends no further than the trade with europe and comprehends a part only of the foreign trade of the country but the private trade of the servants may extend to all the different branches both of its inland and foreign trade the monopoly of the company can tend only to stunt the natural growth of that part of the surplus produce which in the case of a free trade would be exported to europe that of the servants tends to stunt the natural growth of every part of the produce in which they choose to deal of what is destined for home consumption as well as of what is destined for exportation and consequently to degrade the cultivation of the whole country and to reduce the number of its inhabitants it tends to reduce the quantity of every sort of produce even that of the necessaries of life whenever the servants of the company choose to deal in them to what those servants can both afford to buy and expect to sell with such a profit as pleases them  from the nature of their situation too the servants must be more disposed to support with rigorous severity their own interest against that of the country which they govern than their masters can be to support theirs the country belongs to their masters who cannot avoid having some regard for the interest of what belongs to them but it does not belong to the servants the real interest of their masters if they were capable of understanding it is the same with that of the country and it is from ignorance only and the meanness of mercantile prejudice that they ever oppress it but the real interest of the servants is by no means the same with that of the country and the most perfect information would not necessarily put an end to their oppressions the regulations accordingly which have been sent out from europe though they have been frequently weak have commonly been wellmeaning more intelligence and perhaps less goodmeaning has sometimes appeared in those established by the servants in india it is a very singular government in which every member of the administration wishes to get out of the country and consequently to have done with the government as soon as he can and to whose interest the day after he has left it and carried his whole fortune with him it is perfectly indifferent if the whole country was swallowed up by an earthquake  i mean not however by any thing which i have here said to throw any odious imputation upon the general character of the servants of the east india company and much less upon that of any particular persons it is the system of government the situation in which they were placed that i mean to censure not the character of those who have acted in it they acted as their situation naturally directed and they who have clamoured the loudest against them would probably not have acted better themselves in war and negotiation the councils of madrass and calcutta have upon several occasions conducted themselves with a resolution and decisive wisdom which would have done honor to the senate of rome in the best days of that republic the members of those councils however had been bred to professions very different from war and politics but their situation alone without education experience or even example seems to have formed in them all at once the great qualities which it required and to have inspired them both with abilities and virtues which they themselves could not well know that they possessed if upon some occasions therefore it has animated them to actions of magnanimity which could not well have been expected from them we should not wonder if upon others it has prompted them to exploits of somewhat a different nature  such exclusive companies therefore are nuisances in every respect always more or less inconvenient to the countries in which they are established and destructive to those which have the misfortune to fall under their government  chap viii of the agricultural systems or of those systems of political economy which represent the produce of land as either the sole or the principal source of the revenue and wealth of every country the agricultural systems of political economy will not require so long an explanation as that which i have thought it necessary to bestow upon the mercantile or commercial system  that system which represents the produce of land as the sole source of the revenue and wealth of every country has so far as i know never been adopted by any nation and it at present exists only in the speculations of a few men of great learning and ingenuity in france it would not surely be worth while to examine at great length the errors of a system which never has done and probably never will do any harm in any part of the world i shall endeavor to explain however as distinctly as i can the great outlines of this very ingenious system  mr colbert the famous minister of lewis xivth was a man of probity of great industry and knowledge of detail of great experience and acuteness in the examination of public accounts and of abilities in short every way fitted for introducing method and good order into the collection and expenditure of the public revenue that minister had unfortunately embraced all the prejudices of the mercantile system that system in its nature and essence a system of restraint and regulation could scarce fail to be agreeable to a laborious and plodding man of business who had been accustomed to regulate the different departments of public offices and to establish the necessary checks and controuls for confining each to its proper sphere the industry and commerce of a great country he endeavored to regulate upon the same model as the departments of a public office and instead of allowing every man to pursue his own interest his own way upon the liberal plan of equality liberty and justice he bestowed upon certain branches of industry extraordinary privileges while he laid others under as extraordinary restraints he was not only disposed like other european ministers to encourage more the industry of the towns than that of the country but in order to support the industry of the towns he was willing even to depress and keep down that of the country in order to render provisions cheap to the inhabitants of the towns and thereby to encourage manufactures and foreign commerce he prohibited altogether the exportation of corn and thus excluded the inhabitants of the country from every foreign market for by far the most important part of the produce of their industry this prohibition joined to the restraints imposed by the ancient provincial laws of france upon the transportation of corn from one province to another and to the arbitrary and degrading taxes which are levied upon the cultivators in almost all the provinces discouraged and kept down the agriculture of that country very much below the state to which it would naturally have risen in so very fertile a soil and so very happy a climate this state of discouragement and depression was felt more or less in every different part of the country and many different enquiries were set on foot concerning the causes of it one of those causes appeared to be the preference given by the institutions of mr colbert to the industry of the towns above that of the country  if the rod be bent too much one way says the proverb in order to make it straight you must bend it as much the other the french philosophers who have proposed the system which represents agriculture as the sole source of the revenue and wealth of every country seem to have adopted this proverbial maxim and as in the plan of mr colbert the industry of the towns was certainly overvalued in comparison with that of the country so in their system it seems to be as certainly undervalued  the different orders of people who have ever been supposed to contribute in any respect toward the annual produce of the land and labor of the country they divide into three classes the first is the class of the proprietors of land the second is the class of the cultivators of farmers and country laborers whom they honor with the peculiar appellation of the productive class the third is the class of artificers manufacturers and merchants whom they endeavor to degrade by the humiliating appellation of the barren or unproductive class  the class of proprietors contributes to the annual produce by the expense which they may occasionally lay out upon the improvement of the land upon the buildings drains enclosures and other ameliorations which they may either make or maintain upon it and by means of which the cultivators are enabled with the same capital to raise a greater produce and consequently to pay a greater rent this advanced rent may be considered as the interest or profit due to the proprietor upon the expense or capital which he thus employs in the improvement of his land such expenses are in this system called ground expenses depenses foncieres  the cultivators or farmers contribute to the annual produce by what are in this system called the original and annual expenses depenses primitives et depenses annuelles which they lay out upon the cultivation of the land the original expenses consist in the instruments of husbandry in the stock of cattle in the seed and in the maintenance of the farmers family servants and cattle during at least a great part of the first year of his occupancy or till he can receive some return from the land the annual expenses consist in the seed in the tear and wear of the instruments of husbandry and in the annual maintenance of the farmers servants and cattle and of his family too so far as any part of them can be considered as servants employed in cultivation that part of the produce of the land which remains to him after paying the rent ought to be sufficient first to replace to him within a reasonable time at least during the term of his occupancy the whole of his original expenses together with the ordinary profits of stock and secondly to replace to him annually the whole of his annual expenses together likewise with the ordinary profits of stock those two sorts of expenses are two capitals which the farmer employs in cultivation and unless they are regularly restored to him together with a reasonable profit he cannot carry on his employment upon a level with other employments but from a regard to his own interest must desert it as soon as possible and seek some other employment that part of the produce of the land which is thus necessary for enabling the farmer to continue his business ought to be considered as a fund sacred to cultivation which if the landlord violates he necessarily degrades the produce of his own land and in a few years not only disables the farmer from paying this racked rent but from paying the reasonable rent which he might otherwise have got for his land the rent which properly belongs to the landlord is no more than the neat produce which remains after paying in the compleatest manner all the necessary expenses which must be previously laid out in order to raise the gross or the whole produce it is because the labor of the cultivators over and above paying completely all those necessary expenses affords a neat produce of this kind that this class of people are in this system peculiarly distinguished by the honorable appellation of the productive class their original and annual expenses are for the same reason called in this system productive expenses because over and above replacing their own value they occasion the annual reproduction of this neat produce  the ground expenses as they are called or what the landlord lays out upon the improvement of his land are in this system too honored with the appellation of productive expenses till the whole of those expenses together with the ordinary profits of stock have been completely repaid to him by the advanced rent which he gets from his land that advanced rent ought to be regarded as sacred and inviolable both by the church and by the king ought to be subject neither to tithe nor to taxation if it is otherwise by discouraging the improvement of land the church discourages the future increase of her own tithes and the king the future increase of his own taxes as in a well ordered state of things therefore those ground expenses over and above reproducing in the compleatest manner their own value occasion likewise after a certain time a reproduction of a neat produce they are in this system considered as productive expenses  the ground expenses of the landlord however together with the original and the annual expenses of the farmer are the only three sorts of expenses which in this system are considered as productive all other expenses and all other orders of people even those who in the common apprehensions of men are regarded as the most productive are in this account of things represented as altogether barren and unproductive  artificers and manufacturers in particular whose industry in the common apprehensions of men increases so much the value of the rude produce of land are in this system represented as a class of people altogether barren and unproductive their labor it is said replaces only the stock which employs them together with its ordinary profits that stock consists in the materials tools and wages advanced to them by their employer and is the fund destined for their employment and maintenance its profits are the fund destined for the maintenance of their employer their employer as he advances to them the stock of materials tools and wages necessary for their employment so he advances to himself what is necessary for his own maintenance and this maintenance he generally proportions to the profit which he expects to make by the price of their work unless its price repays to him the maintenance which he advances to himself as well as the materials tools and wages which he advances to his workmen it evidently does not repay him the whole expense which he lays out upon it the profits of manufacturing stock therefore are not like the rent of land a neat produce which remains after completely repaying the whole expense which must be laid out in order to obtain them the stock of the farmer yields him a profit as well as that of the master manufacturer and it yields a rent likewise to another person which that of the master manufacturer does not the expense therefore laid out in employing and maintaining artificers and manufacturers does no more than continue if one may say so the existence of its own value and does not produce any new value it is therefore altogether a barren and unproductive expense the expense on the contrary laid out in employing farmers and country laborers over and above continuing the existence of its own value produces a new value the rent of the landlord it is therefore a productive expense  mercantile stock is equally barren and unproductive with manufacturing stock it only continues the existence of its own value without producing any new value its profits are only the repayment of the maintenance which its employer advances to himself during the time that he employs it or till he receives the returns of it they are only the repayment of a part of the expense which must be laid out in employing it  the labor of artificers and manufacturers never adds any thing to the value of the whole annual amount of the rude produce of the land it adds indeed greatly to the value of some particular parts of it but the consumption which in the mean time it occasions of other parts is precisely equal to the value which it adds to those parts so that the value of the whole amount is not at any one moment of time in the least augmented by it the person who works the lace of a pair of fine ruffles for example will sometimes raise the value of perhaps a pennyworth of flax to thirty pounds sterling but though at first sight he appears thereby to multiply the value of a part of the rude produce about seven thousand and two hundred times he in reality adds nothing to the value of the whole annual amount of the rude produce the working of that lace costs him perhaps two years labor the thirty pounds which he gets for it when it is finished is no more than the repayment of the subsistence which he advances to himself during the two years that he is employed about it the value which by every days months or years labor he adds to the flax does no more than replace the value of his own consumption during that day month or year at no moment of time therefore does he add any thing to the value of the whole annual amount of the rude produce of the land the portion of that produce which he is continually consuming being always equal to the value which he is continually producing the extreme poverty of the greater part of the persons employed in this expensive though trifling manufacture may satisfy us that the price of their work does not in ordinary cases exceed the value of their subsistence it is otherwise with the work of farmers and country laborers the rent of the landlord is a value which in ordinary cases it is continually producing over and above replacing in the most complete manner the whole consumption the whole expense laid out upon the employment and maintenance both of the workmen and of their employer  artificers manufacturers and merchants can augment the revenue and wealth of their society by parsimony only or as it is expressed in this system by privation that is by depriving themselves of a part of the funds destined for their own subsistence they annually reproduce nothing but those funds unless therefore they annually save some part of them unless they annually deprive themselves of the enjoyment of some part of them the revenue and wealth of their society can never be in the smallest degree augmented by means of their industry farmers and country laborers on the contrary may enjoy completely the whole funds destined for their own subsistence and yet augment at the same time the revenue and wealth of their society over and above the funds destined for their own subsistence their industry annually affords a neat produce of which the augmentation necessarily augments the revenue and wealth of their society nations therefore which like france or england consist in a great measure of proprietors and cultivators can be enriched by industry and enjoyment nations on the contrary which like holland and hamburgh are composed chiefly of merchants artificers and manufacturers can grow rich only through parsimony and privation as the interest of nations so differently circumstanced is very different so is likewise the common character of the people in those of the former kind liberality frankness and good fellowship naturally make a part of that common character in the latter narrowness meanness and a selfish disposition averse to all social pleasure and enjoyment  the unproductive class that of merchants artificers and manufacturers is maintained and employed altogether at the expense of the two other classes of that of proprietors and of that of cultivators they furnish it both with the materials of its work and with the fund of its subsistence with the corn and cattle which it consumes while it is employed about that work the proprietors and cultivators finally pay both the wages of all the workmen of the unproductive class and the profits of all their employers those workmen and their employers are properly the servants of the proprietors and cultivators they are only servants who work without doors as menial servants work within both the one and the other however are equally maintained at the expense of the same masters the labor of both is equally unproductive it adds nothing to the value of the sum total of the rude produce of the land instead of increasing the value of that sum total it is a charge and expense which must be paid out of it  the unproductive class however is not only useful but greatly useful to the other two classes by means of the industry of merchants artificers and manufacturers the proprietors and cultivators can purchase both the foreign goods and the manufactured produce of their own country which they have occasion for with the produce of a much smaller quantity of their own labor than what they would be obliged to employ if they were to attempt in an awkward and unskilful manner either to import the one or to make the other for their own use by means of the unproductive class the cultivators are delivered from many cares which would otherwise distract their attention from the cultivation of land the superiority of produce which in consequence of this undivided attention they are enabled to raise is fully sufficient to pay the whole expense which the maintenance and employment of the unproductive class costs either the proprietors or themselves the industry of merchants artificers and manufacturers though in its own nature altogether unproductive yet contributes in this manner indirectly to increase the produce of the land it increases the productive powers of productive labor by leaving it at liberty to confine itself to its proper employment the cultivation of land and the plough goes frequently the easier and the better by means of the labor of the man whose business is most remote from the plough  it can never be the interest of the proprietors and cultivators to restrain or to discourage in any respect the industry of merchants artificers and manufacturers the greater the liberty which this unproductive class enjoys the greater will be the competition in all the different trades which compose it and the cheaper will the other two classes be supplied both with foreign goods and with the manufactured produce of their own country  it can never be the interest of the unproductive class to oppress the other two classes it is the surplus produce of the land or what remains after deducting the maintenance first of the cultivators and afterward of the proprietors that maintains and employs the unproductive class the greater this surplus the greater must likewise be its maintenance and employment the establishment of perfect justice of perfect liberty and of perfect equality is the very simple secret which most effectually secures the highest degred of prosperity to all the three classes  the merchants artificers and manufacturers of those mercantile states which like holland and hamburgh consist chiefly of this unproductive class are in the same manner maintained and employed altogether at the expense of the proprietors and cultivators of land the only difference is that those proprietors and cultivators are the greater part of them placed at a most inconvenient distance from the merchants artificers and manufacturers whom they supply with the materials of their work and the fund of their subsistence are the inhabitants of other countries and the subjects of other governments  such mercantile states however are not only useful but greatly useful to the inhabitants of those other countries they fill up in some measure a very important void and supply the place of the merchants artificers and manufacturers whom the inhabitants of those countries ought to find at home but whom from some defect in their policy they do not find at home  it can never be the interest of those landed nations if i may call them so to discourage or distress the industry of such mercantile states by imposing high duties upon their trade or upon the commodities which they furnish such duties by rendering those commodities dearer could serve only to sink the real value of the surplus produce of their own land with which or what comes to the same thing with the price of which those commodities are purchased such duties could serve only to discourage the increase of that surplus produce and consequently the improvement and cultivation of their own land the most effectual expedient on the contrary for raising the value of that surplus produce for encouraging its increase and consequently the improvement and cultivation of their own land would be to allow the most perfect freedom to the trade of all such mercantile nations  this perfect freedom of trade would even be the most effectual expedient for supplying them in due time with all the artificers manufacturers and merchants whom they wanted at home and for filling up in the properest and most advantageous manner that very important void which they felt there  the continual increase of the surplus produce of their land would in due time create a greater capital than what could be employed with the ordinary rate of profit in the improvement and cultivation of land and the surplus part of it would naturally turn itself to the employment of artificers and manufacturers at home but those artificers and manufacturers finding at home both the materials of their work and the fund of their subsistence might immediately even with much less art and skill be able to work as cheap as the like artificers and manufacturers of such mercantile states who had both to bring from a great distance even though from want of art and skill they might not for some time be able to work as cheap yet finding a market at home they might be able to sell their work there as cheap as that of the artificers and manufacturers of such mercantile states which could not be brought to that market but from so great a distance and as their art and skill improved they would soon be able to sell it cheaper the artificers and manufacturers of such mercantile states therefore would immediately be rivalled in the market of those landed nations and soon after undersold and justled out of it altogether the cheapness of the manufacturers of those landed nations in consequence of the gradual improvements of art and skill would in due time extend their sale beyond the home market and carry them to many foreign markets from which they would in the same manner gradually justle out many of the manufactures of such mercantile nations  this continual increase both of the rude and manufactured produce of those landed nations would in due time create a greater capital than could with the ordinary rate of profit be employed either in agriculture or in manufacturers the surplus of this capital would naturally turn itself to foreign trade and be employed in exporting to foreign countries such parts of the rude and manufactured produce of its own country as exceeded the demand of the home market in the exportation of the produce of their own country the merchants of a landed nation would have an advantage of the same kind over those of mercantile nations which its artificers and manufacturers had over the artificers and manufacturers of such nations the advantage of finding at home that cargo and those stores and provisions which the others were obliged to seek for at a distance with inferior art and skill in navigation therefore they would be able to sell that cargo as cheap in foreign markets as the merchants of such mercantile nations and with equal art and skill they would be able to sell it cheaper they would soon therefore rival those mercantile nations in this branch of their foreign trade and in due time would justle them out of it altogether  according to this liberal and generous system therefore the most advantageous method in which a landed nation can raise up artificers manufacturers and merchants of its own is to grant the most perfect freedom of trade to the artificers manufacturers and merchants of all other nations it thereby raises the value of the surplus produce of its own land of which the continual increase gradually establishes a fund which in due time necessarily raises up all the artificers manufacturers and merchants whom it has occasion for  when a landed nation on the contrary oppresses either by high duties or by prohibitions the trade of foreign nations it necessarily hurts its own interest in two different ways first by raising the price of all foreign goods and of all sorts of manufactures it necessarily sinks the real value of the surplus produce of its own land with which or what comes to the same thing with the price of which it purchases those foreign goods and manufactures secondly by giving a sort of monopoly of the home market to its own merchants artificers and manufacturers it raises the rate of mercantile and manufacturing profit in proportion to that of agricultural profit and consequently either draws from agriculture a part of the capital which had before been employed in it or hinders from going to it a part of what would otherwise have gone to it this policy therefore discourages agriculture in two different ways first by sinking the real value of its produce and thereby lowering the rate of its profit and secondly by raising the rate of profit in all other employments agriculture is rendered less advantageous and trade and manufactures more advantageous than they otherwise would be and every man is tempted by his own interest to turn as much as he can both his capital and his industry from the former to the latter employments  though by this oppressive policy a landed nation should be able to raise up artificers manufacturers and merchants of its own somewhat sooner than it could do by the freedom of trade a matter however which is not a little doubtful yet it would raise them up if one may say so prematurely and before it was perfectly ripe for them by raising up too hastily one species of industry it would depress another more valuable species of industry by raising up too hastily a species of industry which only replaces the stock which employs it together with the ordinary profit it would depress a species of industry which over and above replacing that stock with its profit affords likewise a neat produce a free rent to the landlord it would depress productive labor by encouraging too hastily that labor which is altogether barren and unproductive  in what manner according to this system the sum total of the annual produce of the land is distributed among the three classes abovementioned and in what manner the labor of the unproductive class does no more than replace the value of its own consumption without increasing in any respect the value of that sum total is represented by mr quesnai the very ingenious and profound author of this system in some arithmetical formularies the first of these formularies which by way of eminence he peculiarly distinguishes by the name of the oeconomical table represents the manner in which he supposes this distribution takes place in a state of the most perfect liberty and therefore of the highest prosperity in a state where the annual produce is such as to afford the greatest possible neat produce and where each class enjoys its proper share of the whole annual produce some subsequent formularies represent the manner in which he supposes this distribution is made in different states of restraint and regulation in which either the class of proprietors or the barren and unproductive class is more favored than the class of cultivators and in which either the one or the other encroaches more or less upon the share which ought properly to belong to this productive class every such encroachment every violation of that natural distribution which the most perfect liberty would establish must according to this system necessarily degrade more or less from one year to another the value and sum total of the annual produce and must necessarily occasion a gradual declension in the real wealth and revenue of the society a declension of which the progress must be quicker or slower according to the degree of this encroachment according as that natural distribution which the most perfect liberty would establish is more or less violated those subsequent formularies represent the different degrees of declension which according to this system correspond to the different degrees in which this natural distribution of things is violated  some speculative physicians seem to have imagined that the health of the human body could be preserved only by a certain precise regimen of diet and exercise of which every the smallest violation necessarily occasioned some degree of disease or disorder proportioned to the degree of the violation experience however would seem to show that the human body frequently preserves at least to all appearance the most perfect state of health under a vast variety of different regimens even under some which are generally believed to be very far from being perfectly wholesome but the healthful state of the human body it would seem contains in itself some unknown principle of preservation capable either of preventing or of correcting in many respects the bad effects even of a very faulty regimen mr quesnai who was himself a physician and a very speculative physician seems to have entertained a notion of the same kind concerning the political body and to have imagined that it would thrive and prosper only under a certain precise regimen the exact regimen of perfect liberty and perfect justice he seems not to have considered that in the political body the natural effort which every man is continually making to better his own condition is a principle of preservation capable of preventing and correcting in many respects the bad effects of a political economy in some degree both partial and oppressive such a political economy though it no doubt retards more or less is not always capable of stopping altogether the natural progress of a nation toward wealth and prosperity and still less of making it go backwards if a nation could not prosper without the enjoyment of perfect liberty and perfect justice there is not in the world a nation which could ever have prospered in the political body however the wisdom of nature has fortunately made ample provision for remedying many of the bad effects of the folly and injustice of man in the same manner as it has done in the natural body for remedying those of his sloth and intemperance  the capital error of this system however seems to lie in its representing the class of artificers manufacturers and merchants as altogether barren and unproductive the following observations may serve to show the impropriety of this representation  first this class it is acknowledged reproduces annually the value of its own annual consumption and continues at least the existence of the stock or capital which maintains and employs it but upon this account alone the denomination of barren or unproductive should seem to be very improperly applied to it we should not call a marriage barren or unproductive though it produced only a son and a daughter to replace the father and mother and though it did not increase the number of the human species but only continued it as it was before farmers and country laborers indeed over and above the stock which maintains and employs them reproduce annually a neat produce a free rent to the landlord as a marriage which affords three children is certainly more productive than one which affords only two so the labor of farmers and country laborers is certainly more productive than that of merchants artificers and manufacturers the superior produce of the one class however does not render the other barren or unproductive  secondly it seems upon this account altogether improper to consider artificers manufacturers and merchants in the same light as menial servants the labor of menial servants does not continue the existence of the fund which maintains and employs them their maintenance and employment is altogether at the expense of their masters and the work which they perform is not of a nature to repay that expense that work consists in services which perish generally in the very instant of their performance and does not fix or realize itself in any vendible commodity which can replace the value of their wages and maintenance the labor on the contrary of artificers manufacturers and merchants naturally does fix and realize itself in some such vendible commodity it is upon this account that in the chapter in which i treat of productive and unproductive labor i have classed artificers manufacturers and merchants among the productive laborers and menial servants among the barren or unproductive  thirdly it seems upon every supposition improper to say that the labor of artificers manufacturers and merchants does not increase the real revenue of the society though we should suppose for example as it seems to be supposed in this system that the value of the daily monthly and yearly consumption of this class was exactly equal to that of its daily monthly and yearly production yet it would not from thence follow that its labor added nothing to the real revenue to the real value of the annual produce of the land and labor of the society an artificer for example who in the first six months after harvest executes ten pounds worth of work though he should in the same time consume ten pounds worth of corn and other necessaries yet really adds the value of ten pounds to the annual produce of the land and labor of the society while he has been consuming a half yearly revenue of ten pounds worth of corn and other necessaries he has produced an equal value of work capable of purchasing either to himself or to some other person an equal half yearly revenue the value therefore of what has been consumed and produced during these six months is equal not to ten but to twenty pounds it is possible indeed that no more than ten pounds worth of this value may ever have existed at any one moment of time but if the ten pounds worth of corn and other necessaries which were consumed by the artificer had been consumed by a soldier or by a menial servant the value of that part of the annual produce which existed at the end of the six months would have been ten pounds less than it actually is in consequence of the labor of the artificer though the value of what the artificer produces therefore should not at any one moment of time be supposed greater than the value he consumes yet at every moment of time the actually existing value of goods in the market is in consequence of what he produces greater than it otherwise would be  when the patrons of this system assert that the consumption of artificers manufacturers and merchants is equal to the value of what they produce they probably mean no more than that their revenue or the fund destined for their consumption is equal to it but if they had expressed themselves more accurately and only asserted that the revenue of this class was equal to the value of what they produced it might readily have occurred to the reader that what would naturally be saved out of this revenue must necessarily increase more or less the real wealth of the society in order therefore to make out something like an argument it was necessary that they should express themselves as they have done and this argument even supposing things actually were as it seems to presume them to be turns out to be a very inconclusive one  fourthly farmers and country laborers can no more augment without parsimony the real revenue the annual produce of the land and labor of their society than artificers manufacturers and merchants the annual produce of the land and labor of any society can be augmented only in two ways either first by some improvement in the productive powers of the useful labor actually maintained within it or secondly by some increase in the quantity of that labor  the improvement in the productive powers of useful labor depend first upon the improvement in the ability of the workman and secondly upon that of the machinery with which he works but the labor of artificers and manufacturers as it is capable of being more subdivided and the labor of each workman reduced to a greater simplicity of operation than that of farmers and country laborers so it is likewise capable of both these sorts of improvement in a much higher degree see book i chap i n n   in this respect therefore the class of cultivators can have no sort of advantage over that of artificers and manufacturers  the increase in the quantity of useful labor actually employed within any society must depend altogether upon the increase of the capital which employs it and the increase of that capital again must be exactly equal to the amount of the savings from the revenue either of the particular persons who manage and direct the employment of that capital or of some other persons who lend it to them if merchants artificers and manufacturers are as this system seems to suppose naturally more inclined to parsimony and saving than proprietors and cultivators they are so far more likely to augment the quantity of useful labor employed within their society and consequently to increase its real revenue the annual produce of its land and labor  fifthly and lastly though the revenue of the inhabitants of every country was supposed to consist altogether as this system seems to suppose in the quantity of subsistence which their industry could procure to them yet even upon this supposition the revenue of a trading and manufacturing country must other things being equal always be much greater than that of one without trade or manufactures by means of trade and manufactures a greater quantity of subsistence can be annually imported into a particular country than what its own lands in the actual state of their cultivation could afford the inhabitants of a town though they frequently possess no lands of their own yet draw to themselves by their industry such a quantity of the rude produce of the lands of other people as supplies them not only with the materials of their work but with the fund of their subsistence what a town always is with regard to the country in its neighborhood one independent state or country may frequently be with regard to other independent states or countries it is thus that holland draws a great part of its subsistence from other countries live cattle from holstein and jutland and corn from almost all the different countries of europe a small quantity of manufactured produce purchases a great quantity of rude produce a trading and manufacturing country therefore naturally purchases with a small part of its manufactured produce a great part of the rude produce of other countries while on the contrary a country without trade and manufactures is generally obliged to purchase at the expense of a great part of its rude produce a very small part of the manufactured produce of other countries the one exports what can subsist and accommodate but a very few and imports the subsistence and accommodation of a great number the other exports the accommodation and subsistence of a great number and imports that of a very few only the inhabitants of the one must always enjoy a much greater quantity of subsistence than what their own lands in the actual state of their cultivation could afford the inhabitants of the other must always enjoy a much smaller quantity  this system however with all its imperfections is perhaps the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy and is upon that account well worth the consideration of every man who wishes to examine with attention the principles of that very important science though in representing the labor which is employed upon land as the only productive labor the notions which it inculcates are perhaps too narrow and confined yet in representing the wealth of nations as consisting not in the unconsumable riches of money but in the consumable goods annually reproduced by the labor of the society and in representing perfect liberty as the only effectual expedient for rendering this annual reproduction the greatest possible its doctrine seems to be in every respect as just as it is generous and liberal its followers are very numerous and as men are fond of paradoxes and of appearing to understand what surpasses the comprehension of ordinary people the paradox which it maintains concerning the unproductive nature of manufacturing labor has not perhaps contributed a little to increase the number of its admirers they have for some years past made a pretty considerable sect distinguished in the french republic of letters by the name of the oeconomists their works have certainly been of some service to their country not only by bringing into general discussion many subjects which had never been well examined before but by influencing in some measure the public administration in favor of agriculture it has been in consequence of their representations accordingly that the agriculture of france has been delivered from several of the oppressions which it before labored under the term during which such a lease can be granted as will be valid against every future purchaser or proprietor of the land has been prolonged from nine to twentyseven years the ancient provincial restraints upon the transportation of corn from one province of the kingdom to another have been entirely taken away and the liberty of exporting it to all foreign countries has been established as the common law of the kingdom in all ordinary cases this sect in their works which are very numerous and which treat not only of what is properly called political economy or of the nature and causes of the wealth of nations but of every other branch of the system of civil government all follow implicitly and without any sensible variation the doctrine of mr quesnai there is upon this account little variety in the greater part of their works the most distinct and best connected account of this doctrine is to be found in a little book written by mr mercier de la riviere sometime intendant of martinico entitled the natural and essential order of political societies the admiration of this whole sect for their master who was himself a man of the greatest modesty and simplicity is not inferior to that of any of the ancient philosophers for the founders of their respective systems there have been since the world began says a very diligent and respectable author the marquis de mirabeau three great inventions which have principally given stability to political societies independent of many other inventions which have enriched and adorned them the first is the invention of writing which alone gives human nature the power of transmitting without alteration its laws its contracts its annals and its discoveries the second is the invention of money which binds together all the relations between civilized societies the third is the oeconomical table the result of the other two which completes them both by perfecting their object the great discovery of our age but of which our posterity will reap the benefit  as the political economy of the nations of modern europe has been more favorable to manufactures and foreign trade the industry of the towns than to agriculture the industry of the country so that of other nations has followed a different plan and has been more favorable to agriculture than to manufactures and foreign trade  the policy of china favors agriculture more than all other employments in china the condition of a labourer is said to be as much superior to that of an artificer as in most parts of europe that of an artificer is to that of a labourer in china the great ambition of every man is to get possession of some little bit of land either in property or in lease and leases are there said to be granted upon very moderate terms and to be sufficiently secured to the lessees the chinese have little respect for foreign trade your beggarly commerce was the language in which the mandarins of pekin used to talk to mr langlet the russian envoy concerning it except with japan the chinese carry on themselves and in their own bottoms little or no foreign trade and it is only into one or two ports of their kingdom that they even admit the ships of foreign nations foreign trade therefore is in china every way confined within a much narrower circle than that to which it would naturally extend itself if more freedom was allowed to it either in their own ships or in those of foreign nations  manufactures as in a small bulk they frequently contain a great value and can upon that account be transported at less expense from one country to another than most sorts of rude produce are in almost all countries the principal support of foreign trade in countries besides less extensive and less favorably circumstanced for interior commerce than china they generally require the support of foreign trade without an extensive foreign market they could not well flourish either in countries so moderately extensive as to afford but a narrow home market or in countries where the communication between one province and another was so difficult as to render it impossible for the goods of any particular place to enjoy the whole of that home market which the country could afford the perfection of manufacturing industry it must be remembered depends altogether upon the division of labor and the degree to which the division of labor can be introduced into any manufacture is necessarily regulated it has already been shown by the extent of the market but the great extent of the empire of china the vast multitude of its inhabitants the variety of climate and consequently of productions in its different provinces and the easy communication by means of water carriage between the greater part of them render the home market of that country of so great extent as to be alone sufficient to support very great manufactures and to admit of very considerable subdivisions of labor the home market of china is perhaps in extent not much inferior to the market of all the different countries of europe put together a more extensive foreign trade however which to this great home market added the foreign market of all the rest of the world especially if any considerable part of this trade was carried on in chinese ships could scarce fail to increase very much the manufactures of china and to improve very much the productive powers of its manufacturing industry by a more extensive navigation the chinese would naturally learn the art of using and constructing themselves all the different machines made use of in other countries as well as all the other improvements of art and industry which are practiced in all the different parts of the world upon their present plan they have little opportunity of improving themselves by the example of any other nation except that of the japanese  the policy of ancient egypt too and that of the gentoo government of indostan seem to have favored agriculture more than all other employments  both in ancient egypt and in indostan the whole body of the people was divided into different casts or tribes each of which was confined from father to son to a particular employment or class of employments the son of a priest was necessarily a priest the son of a soldier a soldier the son of a labourer a labourer the son of a weaver a weaver the son of a tailor a tailor etc in both countries the cast of the priests held the highest rank and that of the soldiers the next and in both countries the cast of the farmers and laborers was superior to the casts of merchants and manufacturers  the government of both countries was particularly attentive to the interest of agriculture the works constructed by the ancient sovereigns of egypt for the proper distribution of the waters of the nile were famous in antiquity and the ruined remains of some of them are still the admiration of travelers those of the same kind which were constructed by the ancient sovereigns of indostan for the proper distribution of the waters of the ganges as well as of many other rivers though they have been less celebrated seem to have been equally great both countries accordingly though subject occasionally to dearths have been famous for their great fertility though both were extremely populous yet in years of moderate plenty they were both able to export great quantities of grain to their neighbors  the ancient egyptians had a superstitious aversion to the sea and as the gentoo religion does not permit its followers to light a fire nor consequently to dress any victuals upon the water it in effect prohibits them from all distant sea voyages both the egyptians and indians must have depended almost altogether upon the navigation of other nations for the exportation of their surplus produce and this dependency as it must have confined the market so it must have discouraged the increase of this surplus produce it must have discouraged too the increase of the manufactured produce more than that of the rude produce manufactures require a much more extensive market than the most important parts of the rude produce of the land a single shoemaker will make more than three hundred pairs of shoes in the year and his own family will not perhaps wear out six pairs unless therefore he has the custom of at least fifty such families as his own he cannot dispose of the whole produce of his own labor the most numerous class of artificers will seldom in a large country make more than one in fifty or one in a hundred of the whole number of families contained in it but in such large countries as france and england the number of people employed in agriculture has by some authors been computed at a half by others at a third and by no author that i know of at less than a fifth of the whole inhabitants of the country but as the produce of the agriculture of both france and england is the far greater part of it consumed at home each person employed in it must according to these computations require little more than the custom of one two or at most four such families as his own in order to dispose of the whole produce of his own labor agriculture therefore can support itself under the discouragement of a confined market much better than manufactures in both ancient egypt and indostan indeed the confinement of the foreign market was in some measure compensated by the convenience of many inland navigations which opened in the most advantageous manner the whole extent of the home market to every part of the produce of every different district of those countries the great extent of indostan too rendered the home market of that country very great and sufficient to support a great variety of manufactures but the small extent of ancient egypt which was never equal to england must at all times have rendered the home market of that country too narrow for supporting any great variety of manufactures bengal accordingly the province of indostan which commonly exports the greatest quantity of rice has always been more remarkable for the exportation of a great variety of manufactures than for that of its grain ancient egypt on the contrary though it exported some manufactures fine linen in particular as well as some other goods was always most distinguished for its great exportation of grain it was long the granary of the roman empire  the sovereigns of china of ancient egypt and of the different kingdoms into which indostan has at different times been divided have always derived the whole or by far the most considerable part of their revenue from some sort of land tax or landrent this land tax or landrent like the tithe in europe consisted in a certain proportion a fifth it is said of the produce of the land which was either delivered in kind or paid in money according to a certain valuation and which therefore varied from year to year according to all the variations of the produce it was natural therefore that the sovereigns of those countries should be particularly attentive to the interests of agriculture upon the prosperity or declension of which immediately depended the yearly increase or diminution of their own revenue  the policy of the ancient republics of greece and that of rome though it honored agriculture more than manufactures or foreign trade yet seems rather to have discouraged the latter employments than to have given any direct or intentional encouragement to the former in several of the ancient states of greece foreign trade was prohibited altogether and in several others the employments of artificers and manufacturers were considered as hurtful to the strength and agility of the human body as rendering it incapable of those habits which their military and gymnastic exercises endeavored to form in it and as thereby disqualifying it more or less from undergoing the fatigues and encountering the dangers of war such occupations were considered as fit only for slaves and the free citizens of the state were prohibited from exercising them even in those states where no such prohibition took place as in rome and athens the great body of the people were in effect excluded from all the trades which are now commonly exercised by the lower sort of the inhabitants of towns such trades were at athens and rome all occupied by the slaves of the rich who exercised them for the benefit of their masters whose wealth power and protection made it almost impossible for a poor freeman to find a market for his work when it came into competition with that of the slaves of the rich slaves however are very seldom inventive and all the most important improvements either in machinery or in that arrangement and distribution of work which facilitate and abridge labor have been the discoveries of freemen should a slave propose any improvement of this kind his master would be very apt to consider the proposal as the suggestion of laziness and of a desire to save his own labor at the masters expense the poor slave instead of reward would probably meet with much abuse perhaps with some punishment in the manufactures carried on by slaves therefore more labor must generally have been employed to execute the same quantity of work than in those carried on by freemen the work of the former must upon that account generally have been dearer than that of the latter the hungarian mines it is remarked by mr montesquieu though not more rich have always been wrought with less expense and therefore with more profit than the turkish mines in their neighborhood the turkish mines are wrought by slaves and the arms of those slaves are the only machines which the turks have ever thought of employing the hungarian mines are wrought by freemen who employ a good deal of machinery by which they facilitate and abridge their own labor from the very little that is known about the price of manufactures in the times of the greeks and romans it would appear that those of the finer sort were excessively dear silk sold for its weight in gold it was not indeed in those times a european manufacture and as it was all brought from the east indies the distance of the carriage may in some measure account for the greatness of the price the price however which a lady it is said would sometimes pay for a piece of very fine linen seems to have been equally extravagant and as linen was always either a european or at farthest an egyptian manufacture this high price can be accounted for only by the great expense of the labor which must have been employed about it and the expense of this labor again could arise from nothing but the aukwardness of the machinery which it made use of the price of fine woollens too though not quite so extravagant seems however to have been much above that of the present times some cloths we are told by pliny dyed in a particular manner cost a hundred denarii or three pounds six shillings and eight pence the pound weight others dyed in another manner cost a thousand denarii the pound weight or thirtythree pounds six shillings and eight pence the roman pound it must be remembered contained only twelve of our averdupois ounces this high price indeed seems to have been principally owing to the dye but had not the cloths themselves been much dearer than any which are made in the present times so very expensive a dye would not probably have been bestowed upon them the disproportion would have been too great between the value of the accessory and that of the principal the price mentioned by the same author of some triclinaria a sort of woollen pillows or cushions made use of to lean upon as they reclined upon their couches at table passes all credibility some of them being said to have cost more than thirty thousand others more than three hundred thousand pounds this high price too is not said to have arisen from the dye in the dress of the people of fashion of both sexes there seems to have been much less variety it is observed by doctor arbuthnot in ancient than in modern times and the very little variety which we find in that of the ancient statues confirms his observation he infers from this that their dress must upon the whole have been cheaper than ours but the conclusion does not seem to follow when the expense of fashionable dress is very great the variety must be very small but when by the improvements in the productive powers of manufacturing art and industry the expense of any one dress comes to be very moderate the variety will naturally be very great the rich not being able to distinguish themselves by the expense of any one dress will naturally endeavor to do so by the multitude and variety of their dresses  the greatest and most important branch of the commerce of every nation it has already been observed is that which is carried on between the inhabitants of the town and those of the country the inhabitants of the town draw from the country the rude produce which constitutes both the materials of their work and the fund of their subsistence and they pay for this rude produce by sending back to the country a certain portion of it manufactured and prepared for immediate use the trade which is carried on between those two different sets of people consists ultimately in a certain quantity of rude produce exchanged for a certain quantity of manufactured produce the dearer the latter therefore the cheaper the former and whatever tends in any country to raise the price of manufactured produce tends to lower that of the rude produce of the land and thereby to discourage agriculture the smaller the quantity of manufactured produce which any given quantity of rude produce or what comes to the same thing which the price of any given quantity of rude produce is capable of purchasing the smaller the real value of that given quantity of rude produce the smaller the encouragement which either the landlord has to increase its quantity by improving or the farmer by cultivating the land whatever besides tends to diminish in any country the number of artificers and manufacturers tends to diminish the home market the most important of all markets for the rude produce of the land and thereby still further to discourage agriculture  those systems therefore which preferring agriculture to all other employments in order to promote it impose restraints upon manufactures and foreign trade act contrary to the very end which they propose and indirectly discourage that very species of industry which they mean to promote they are so far perhaps more inconsistent than even the mercantile system that system by encouraging manufactures and foreign trade more than agriculture turns a certain portion of the capital of the society from supporting a more advantageous to support a less advantageous species of industry but still it really and in the end encourages that species of industry which it means to promote those agricultural systems on the contrary really and in the end discourage their own favorite species of industry  it is thus that every system which endeavors either by extraordinary encouragements to draw toward a particular species of industry a greater share of the capital of the society than what would naturally go to it or by extraordinary restraints to force from a particular species of industry some share of the capital which would otherwise be employed in it is in reality subversive of the great purpose which it means to promote it retards instead of accelerating the progress of the society toward real wealth and greatness and diminishes instead of increasing the real value of the annual produce of its land and labor  all systems either of preference or of restraint therefore being thus completely taken away the obvious and simple system of natural liberty establishes itself of its own accord every man as long as he does not violate the laws of justice is left perfectly free to pursue his own interest his own way and to bring both his industry and capital into competition with those of any other man or order of men the sovereign is completely discharged from a duty in the attempting to perform which he must always be exposed to innumerable delusions and for the proper performance of which no human wisdom or knowledge could ever be sufficient the duty of superintending the industry of private people and of directing it toward the employments most suitable to the interest of the society according to the system of natural liberty the sovereign has only three duties to attend to three duties of great importance indeed but plain and intelligible to common understandings first the duty of protecting the society from the violence and invasion of other independent societies secondly the duty of protecting as far as possible every member of the society from the injustice or oppression of every other member of it or the duty of establishing an exact administration of justice and thirdly the duty of erecting and maintaining certain public works and certain public institutions which it can never be for the interest of any individual or small number of individuals to erect and maintain because the profit could never repay the expense to any individual or small number of individuals though it may frequently do much more than repay it to a great society  the proper performance of those several duties of the sovereign necessarily supposes a certain expense and this expense again necessarily requires a certain revenue to support it in the following book therefore i shall endeavor to explain first what are the necessary expenses of the sovereign or commonwealth and which of those expenses ought to be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society and which of them by that of some particular part only or of some particular members of the society secondly what are the different methods in which the whole society may be made to contribute toward defraying the expenses incumbent on the whole society and what are the principal advantages and inconveniences of each of those methods and thirdly what are the reasons and causes which have induced almost all modern governments to mortgage some part of this revenue or to contract debts and what have been the effects of those debts upon the real wealth the annual produce of the land and labor of the society the following book therefore will naturally be divided into three chapters  book v of the revenue of the sovereign or commonwealth chap i of the expenses of the sovereign or commonwealth part first of the expense of defense the first duty of the sovereign that of protecting the society from the violence and invasion of other independent societies can be performed only by means of a military force but the expense both of preparing this military force in time of peace and of employing it in time of war is very different in the different states of society in the different periods of improvement  among nations of hunters the lowest and rudest state of society such as we find it among the native tribes of north america every man is a warrior as well as a hunter when he goes to war either to defend his society or to revenge the injuries which have been done to it by other societies he maintains himself by his own labor in the same manner as when he lives at home his society for in this state of things there is properly neither sovereign nor commonwealth is at no sort of expense either to prepare him for the field or to maintain him while he is in it  among nations of shepherds a more advanced state of society such as we find it among the tartars and arabs every man is in the same manner a warrior such nations have commonly no fixed habitation but live either in tents or in a sort of covered wagons which are easily transported from place to place the whole tribe or nation changes its situation according to the different seasons of the year as well as according to other accidents when its herds and flocks have consumed the forage of one part of the country it removes to another and from that to a third in the dry season it comes down to the banks of the rivers in the wet season it retires to the upper country when such a nation goes to war the warriors will not trust their herds and flocks to the feeble defense of their old men their women and children and their old men their women and children will not be left behind without defense and without subsistence the whole nation besides being accustomed to a wandering life even in time of peace easily takes the field in time of war whether it marches as an army or moves about as a company of herdsmen the way of life is nearly the same though the object proposed by it is very different they all go to war together therefore and every one does as well as he can among the tartars even the women have been frequently known to engage in battle if they conquer whatever belongs to the hostile tribe is the recompense of the victory but if they are vanquished all is lost and not only their herds and flocks but their women and children become the booty of the conqueror even the greater part of those who survive the action are obliged to submit to him for the sake of immediate subsistence the rest are commonly dissipated and dispersed in the desert  the ordinary life the ordinary exercises of a tartar or arab prepare him sufficiently for war running wrestling cudgelplaying throwing the javeling drawing the bow etc are the common pastimes of those who live in the open air and are all of them the images of war when a tartar or arab actually goes to war he is maintained by his own herds and flocks which he carries with him in the same manner as in peace his chief or sovereign for those nations have all chiefs or sovereigns is at no fort of expense in preparing him for the field and when he is in it the chance of plunder is the only pay which he either expects or requires  an army of hunters can seldom exceed two or three hundred men the precarious subsistence which the chase affords could seldom allow a greater number to keep together for any considerable time an army of shepherds on the contrary may sometimes amount to two or three hundred thousand as long as nothing stops their progress as long as they can go on from one district of which they have consumed the forage to another which is yet entire there seems to be scarce any limit to the number who can march on together a nation of hunters can never be formidable to the civilized nations in their neighborhood a nation of shepherds may nothing can be more contemptible than an indian war in north america nothing on the contrary can be more dreadful than a tartar invasion has frequently been in asia the judgment of thucidides that both europe and asia could not resist the scythians united has been verified by the experience of all ages the inhabitants of the extensive but defenseless plains of scythia or tartary have been frequently united under the dominion of the chief of some conquering horde or clan and the havoc and devastation of asia have always signalized their union the inhabitants of the inhospitable deserts of arabia the other great nation of shepherds have never been united but once under mahomet and his immediate successors their union which was more the effect of religious enthusiasm than of conquest was signalized in the same manner if the hunting nations of america should ever become shepherds their neighborhood would be much more dangerous to the european colonies than it is at present  in a yet more advanced state of society among those nations of husbandmen who have little foreign commerce and no other manufactures but those coarse and household ones which almost every private family prepares for its own use every man in the same manner either is a warrior or easily becomes such they who live by agriculture generally pass the whole day in the open air exposed to all the inclemencies of the seasons the hardiness of their ordinary life prepares them for the fatigues of war to some of which their necessary occupations bear a good deal of analogy the necessary occupation of a ditcher prepares him to work in the trenches and to fortify a camp as well as to enclose a field the ordinary pastimes of such husbandmen are the same as those of shepherds and are in the same manner the images of war but as husbandmen have less leisure than shepherds they are not so frequently employed in those pastimes they are soldiers but soldiers not quite so much masters of their exercise such as they are however it seldom costs the sovereign or commonwealth any expense to prepare them for the field  agriculture even in its rudest and lowest state supposes a settlement some sort of fixed habitation which cannot be abandoned without great loss when a nation of mere husbandmen therefore goes to war the whole people cannot take the field together the old men the women and children at least must remain at home to take care of the habitation all the men of the military age however may take the field and in small nations of this kind have frequently done so in every nation the men of the military age are supposed to amount to about a fourth or fifth part of the whole body of the people if the campaign too should begin after seed time and end before harvest both the husbandman and his principal laborers can be spared from the farm without much loss he trusts that the work which must be done in the meantime can be well enough executed by the old men the women and the children he is not unwilling therefore to serve without pay during so short a campaign and it frequently costs the sovereign or commonwealth as little to maintain him in the field as to prepare him for it the citizens of all the different states of ancient greece seem to have served in this manner till after the second persian war and the people of peloponesus till after the peloponesian war the peloponesians thucidides observes generally left the field in the summer and returned home to reap the harvest the roman people under their kings and during the first ages of the republic served in the same manner it was not till the siege of veii that they who staid at home began to contribute something toward maintaining those who went to war in the european monarchies which were founded upon the ruins of the roman empire both before and for some time after the establishment of what is properly called the feudal law the great lords with all their immediate dependents used to serve the crown at their own expense in the field in the same manner as at home they maintained themselves by their own revenue and not by any stipend or pay which they received from the king upon that particular occasion  in a more advanced state of society two different causes contribute to render it altogether impossible that they who take the field should maintain themselves at their own expense those two causes are the progress of manufactures and the improvement in the art of war  though a husbandman should be employed in an expedition provided it begins after seed time and ends before harvest the interruption of his business will not always occasion any considerable diminution of his revenue without the intervention of his labor nature does herself the greater part of the work which remains to be done but the moment that an artificer a smith a carpenter or a weaver for example quits his workhouse the sole source of his revenue is completely dried up nature does nothing for him he does all for himself when he takes the field therefore in defense of the public as he has no revenue to maintain himself he must necessarily be maintained by the public but in a country of which a great part of the inhabitants are artificers and manufacturers a great part of the people who go to war must be drawn from those classes and must therefore be maintained by the public as long as they are employed in its service  when the art of war too has gradually grown up to be a very intricate and complicated science when the event of war ceases to be determined as in the first ages of society by a single irregular skirmish or battle but when the contest is generally spun out through several different campaigns each of which lasts during the greater part of the year it becomes universally necessary that the public should maintain those who serve the public in war at least while they are employed in that service whatever in time of peace might be the ordinary occupation of those who go to war so very tedious and expensive a service would otherwise be by far too heavy a burden upon them after the second persian war accordingly the armies of athens seem to have been generally composed of mercenary troops consisting indeed partly of citizens but partly too of foreigners and all of them equally hired and paid at the expense of the state from the time of the seige of veii the armies of rome received pay for their service during the time which they remained in the field under the feudal governments the military service both of the great lords and of their immediate dependents was after a certain period universally exchanged for a payment in money which was employed to maintain those who served in their stead  the number of those who can go to war in proportion to the whole number of the people is necessarily much smaller in a civilized than in a rude state of society in a civilized society as the soldiers are maintained altogether by the labor of those who are not soldiers the number of the former never can exceed what the latter can maintain over and above maintaining in a manner suitable to their respective stations both themselves and the other officers of government and law whom they are obliged to maintain in the little agrarian states of ancient greece a fourth or a fifth part of the whole body of the people considered themselves as soldiers and would sometimes it is said take the field among the civilized nations of modern europe it is commonly computed that not more than one hundredth part of the inhabitants of any country can be employed as soldiers without ruin to the country at whose expense they are employed  the expense of preparing the army for the field seems not to have become considerable in any nation till long after that of maintaining it in the field had devolved entirely upon the sovereign or commonwealth in all the different republics of ancient greece to learn his military exercises was a necessary part of education imposed by the state upon every free citizen in every city there seems to have been a public field in which under the protection of the public magistrate the young people were taught their different exercises by different masters in this very simple institution consisted the whole expense which any grecian state seems ever to have been at in preparing its citizens for war in ancient rome the exercises of the campus martius answered the same purpose with those of the gymnasium in ancient greece under the feudal governments the many public ordinances that the citizens of every district should practice archery as well as several other military exercises were intended for promoting the same purpose but do not seem to have promoted it so well either from want of interest in the officers entrusted with the execution of those ordinances or from some other cause they appear to have been universally neglected and in the progress of all those governments military exercises seem to have gone gradually into disuse among the great body of the people  in the republics of ancient greece and rome during the whole period of their existence and under the feudal governments for a considerable time after their first establishment the trade of a soldier was not a separate distinct trade which constituted the sole or principal occupation of a particular class of citizens every subject of the state whatever might be the ordinary trade or occupation by which he gained his livelihood considered himself upon all ordinary occasions as fit likewise to exercise the trade of a soldier and upon many extraordinary occasions as bound to exercise it  the art of war however as it is certainly the noblest of all arts so in the progress of improvement it necessarily becomes one of the most complicated among them the state of the mechanical as well as of some other arts with which it is necessarily connected determines the degree of perfection to which it is capable of being carried at any particular time but in order to carry it to this degree of perfection it is necessary that it should become the sole or principal occupation of a particular class of citizens and the division of labor is as necessary for the improvement of this as of every other art into other arts the division of labor is naturally introduced by the prudence of individuals who find that they promote their private interest better by confining themselves to a particular trade than by exercising a great number but it is the wisdom of the state only which can render the trade of a soldier a particular trade separate and distinct from all others a private citizen who in time of profound peace and without any particular encouragement from the public should spend the greater part of his time in military exercises might no doubt both improve himself very much in them and amuse himself very well but he certainly would not promote his own interest it is the wisdom of the state only which can render it for his interest to give up the greater part of his time to this peculiar occupation and states have not always had this wisdom even when their circumstances had become such that the preservation of their existence required that they should have it  a shepherd has a great deal of leisure a husbandman in the rude state of husbandry has some an artificer or manufacturer has none at all the first may without any loss employ a great deal of his time in martial exercises the second may employ some part of it but the last cannot employ a single hour in them without some loss and his attention to his own interest naturally leads him to neglect them altogether those improvements in husbandry too which the progress of arts and manufactures necessarily introduces leave the husbandman as little leisure as the artificer military exercises come to be as much neglected by the inhabitants of the country as by those of the town and the great body of the people becomes altogether unwarlike that wealth at the same time which always follows the improvements of agriculture and manufactures and which in reality is no more than the accumulated produce of those improvements provokes the invasion of all their neighbors an industrious and upon that account a wealthy nation is of all nations the most likely to be attacked and unless the state takes some new measures for the public defense the natural habits of the people render them altogether incapable of defending themselves  in these circumstances there seem to be but two methods by which the state can make any tolerable provision for the public defense  it may either first by means of a very rigorous police and in spite of the whole bent of the interest genius and inclinations of the people enforce the practice of military exercises and oblige either all the citizens of the military age or a certain number of them to join in some measure the trade of a soldier to whatever other trade or profession they may happen to carry on  or secondly by maintaining and employing a certain number of citizens in the constant practice of military exercises it may render the trade of a soldier a particular trade separate and distinct from all others  if the state has recourse to the first of those two expedients its military force is said to consist in a militia if to the second it is said to consist in a standing army the practice of military exercises is the sole or principal occupation of the soldiers of a standing army and the maintenance or pay which the state affords them is the principal and ordinary fund of their subsistence the practice of military exercises is only the occasional occupation of the soldiers of a militia and they derive the principal and ordinary fund of their subsistence from some other occupation in a militia the character of the labourer artificer or tradesman predominates over that of the soldier in a standing army that of the soldier predominates over every other character and in this distinction seems to consist the essential difference between those two different species of military force  militias have been of several different kinds in some countries the citizens destined for defending the state seem to have been exercised only without being if i may say so regimented that is without being divided into separate and distinct bodies of troops each of which performed its exercises under its own proper and permanent officers in the republics of ancient greece and rome each citizen as long as he remained at home seems to have practiced his exercises either separately and independently or with such of his equals as he liked best and not to have been attached to any particular body of troops till he was actually called upon to take the field in other countries the militia has not only been exercised but regimented in england in switzerland and i believe in every other country of modern europe where any imperfect military force of this kind has been established every militiaman is even in time of peace attached to a particular body of troops which performs its exercises under its own proper and permanent officers  before the invention of firearms that army was superior in which the soldiers had each individually the greatest skill and dexterity in the use of their arms strength and agility of body were of the highest consequence and commonly determined the fate of battles but this skill and dexterity in the use of their arms could be acquired only in the same manner as fencing is acquired at present by practicing not in great bodies but each man separately in a particular school under a particular master or with his own particular equals and companions since the invention of firearms strength and agility of body or even extraordinary dexterity and skill in the use of arms though they are far from being of no consequence are however of less consequence the nature of the weapon though it by no means puts the awkward upon a level with the skilful puts him more nearly so than he ever was before all the dexterity and skill it is supposed which are necessary for using it can be well enough acquired by practicing in great bodies  regularity order and prompt obedience to command are qualities which in modern armies are of more importance toward determining the fate of battles than the dexterity and skill of the soldiers in the use of their arms but the noise of firearms the smoke and the invisible death to which every man feels himself every moment exposed as soon as he comes within cannonshot and frequently a long time before the battle can be well said to be engaged must render it very difficult to maintain any considerable degree of this regularity order and prompt obedience even in the beginning of a modern battle in an ancient battle there was no noise but what arose from the human voice there was no smoke there was no invisible cause of wounds or death every man till some mortal weapon actually did approach him saw clearly that no such weapon was near him in these circumstances and among troops who had some confidence in their own skill and dexterity in the use of their arms it must have been a good deal less difficult to preserve some degree of regularity and order not only in the beginning but through the whole progress of an ancient battle and till one of the two armies was fairly defeated but the habits of regularity order and prompt obedience to command can be acquired only by troops which are exercised in great bodies  a militia however in whatever manner it may be either disciplined or exercised must always be much inferior to a well disciplined and well exercised standing army  the soldiers who are exercised only once a week or once a month can never be so expert in the use of their arms as those who are exercised every day or every other day and though this circumstance may not be of so much consequence in modern as it was in ancient times yet the acknowledged superiority of the prussian troops owing it is said very much to their superior expertness in their exercise may satisfy us that it is even at this day of very considerable consequence  the soldiers who are bound to obey their officer only once a week or once a month and who are at all other times at liberty to manage their own affairs their own way without being in any respect accountable to him can never be under the same awe in his presence can never have the same disposition to ready obedience with those whose whole life and conduct are every day directed by him and who every day even rise and go to bed or at least retire to their quarters according to his orders in what is called discipline or in the habit of ready obedience a militia must always be still more inferior to a standing army than it may sometimes be in what is called the manual exercise or in the management and use of its arms but in modern war the habit of ready and instant obedience is of much greater consequence than a considerable superiority in the management of arms  those militias which like the tartar or arab militia go to war under the same chieftains whom they are accustomed to obey in peace are by far the best in respect for their officers in the habit of ready obedience they approach nearest to standing armies the highland militia when it served under its own chieftains had some advantage of the same kind as the highlanders however were not wandering but stationary shepherds as they had all a fixed habitation and were not in peaceable times accustomed to follow their chieftain from place to place so in time of war they were less willing to follow him to any considerable distance or to continue for any long time in the field when they had acquired any booty they were eager to return home and his authority was seldom sufficient to detain them in point of obedience they were always much inferior to what is reported of the tartars and arabs as the highlanders too from their stationary life spend less of their time in the open air they were always less accustomed to military exercises and were less expert in the use of their arms than the tartars and arabs are said to be  a militia of any kind it must be observed however which has served for several successive campaigns in the field becomes in every respect a standing army the soldiers are every day exercised in the use of their arms and being constantly under the command of their officers are habituated to the same prompt obedience which takes place in standing armies what they were before they took the field is of little importance they necessarily become in every respect a standing army after they have passed a few campaigns in it should the war in america drag out through another campaign the american militia may become in every respect a match for that standing army of which in the last war the valor appeared at least not inferior to that of the hardiest veterans of france and spain  this distinction being well understood the history of all ages it will be found bears testimony to the irresistible superiority which a well regulated standing army has over every sort of militia  one of the first standing armies of which we have any distinct account in any well authenticated history is that of philip of macedon his frequent wars with the thracians illyrians thessalians and some of the greek cities in the neighborhood of macedon gradually formed his troops which in the beginning were probably militia to the exact discipline of a standing army when he was at peace which he was very seldom and never for any long time together he was careful not to disband that army vanquished and subdued after a long and violent struggle indeed the galant and well exercised militias of the principal republics of ancient greece and afterward with very little struggle the effeminate and ill exercised militia of the great persian empire the fall of the greek republics and of the persian empire was the effect of the irresistible superiority which a standing army has over every sort of militia it is the first great revolution in the affairs of mankind of which history has preserved any distinct or circumstantial account  the fall of carthage and the consequent elevation of rome is the second all the varieties in the fortune of those two famous republics may very well be accounted for from the same cause  from the end of the first to the beginning of the second carthaginian war the armies of carthage were continually in the field and employed under three great generals who succeeded one another in the command amilcar his son in law asdrubal and his son annibal first in chastising their own rebellious slaves afterward in subduing the revolted nations of africa and lastly in conquering the great kingdom of spain the army which annibal led from spain into italy must necessarily in those different wars have been gradually formed to the exact discipline of a standing army the romans in the mean time though they had not been altogether at peace yet they had not during this period been engaged in any war of very great consequence and their military discipline it is generally said was a good deal relaxed the roman armies which annibal encountered at trebia thrasymenus and cannae were militia opposed to a standing army this circumstance it is probable contributed more than any other to determine the fate of those battles  the standing army which annibal left behind him in spain had the like superiority over the militia which the romans sent to oppose it and in a few years under the command of his brother the younger asdrubal expelled them almost entirely from that country  annibal was ill supplied from home the roman militia being continually in the field became in the progress of the war a well disciplined and well exercised standing army and the superiority of annibal grew every day less and less asdrubal judged it necessary to lead the whole or almost the whole of the standing army which he commanded in spain to the assistance of his brother in italy in his march he is said to have been misled by his guides and in a country which he did not know was surprised and attacked by another standing army in every respect equal or superior to his own and was entirely defeated  when asdrubal had left spain the great scipio found nothing to oppose him but a militia inferior to his own he conquered and subdued that militia and in the course of the war his own militia necessarily became a well disciplined and well exercised standing army that standing army was afterward carried to africa where it found nothing but a militia to oppose it in order to defend carthage it became necessary to recall the standing army of annibal the disheartened and frequently defeated african militia joined it and at the battle of zama composed the greater part of the troops of annibal the event of that day determined the fate of the two rival republics  from the end of the second carthaginian war till the fall of the roman republic the armies of rome were in every respect standing armies the standing army of macedon made some resistance to their arms in the height of their grandeur it cost them two great wars and three great battles to subdue that little kingdom of which the conquest would probably have been still more difficult had it not been for the cowardice of its last king the militias of all the civilized nations of the ancient world of greece of syria and of egypt made but a feeble resistance to the standing armies of rome the militias of some barbarous nations defended themselves much better the scythian or tartar militia which mithridates drew from the countries north of the euxine and caspian seas were the most formidable enemies which the romans had to encounter after the second carthaginian war the parthian and german militias too were always respectable and upon several occasions gained very considerable advantages over the roman armies in general however and when the roman armies were well commanded they appear to have been very much superior and if the romans did not pursue the final conquest either of parthia or germany it was probably because they judged that it was not worth while to add those two barbarous countries to an empire which was already too large the ancient parthians appear to have been a nation of scythian or tartar extraction and to have always retained a good deal of the manners of their ancestors the ancient germans were like the scythians or tartars a nation of wandering shepherds who went to war under the same chiefs whom they were accustomed to follow in peace their militia was exactly of the same kind with that of the scythians or tartars from whom too they were probably descended  many different causes contributed to relax the discipline of the roman armies its extreme severity was perhaps one of those causes in the days of their grandeur when no enemy appeared capable of opposing them their heavy armor was laid aside as unnecessarily burdensome their laborious exercises were neglected as unnecessarily toilsome under the roman emperors besides the standing armies of rome those particularly which guarded the german and pannonian frontiers became dangerous to their masters against whom they used frequently to set up their own generals in order to render them less formidable according to some authors dioelesian according to others constantine first withdrew them from the frontier where they had always before been encamped in great bodies generally of two or three legions each and dispersed them in small bodies through the different provincial towns from whence they were scarce ever removed but when it became necessary to repel an invasion small bodies of soldiers quartered in trading and manufacturing towns and seldom removed from those quarters became themselves tradesmen artificers and manufacturers the civil came to predominate over the military character and the standing armies of rome gradually degenerated into a corrupt neglected and undisciplined militia incapable of resisting the attack of the german and scythian militias which soon afterward invaded the western empire it was only by hiring the militia of some of those nations to oppose to that of others that the emperors were for some time able to defend themselves the fall of the western empire is the third great revolution in the affairs of mankind of which ancient history has preserved any distinct or circumstantial account it was brought about by the irresistible superiority which the militia of a barbarous has over that of a civilized nation which the militia of a nation of shepherds has over that of a nation of husbandmen artificers and manufacturers the victories which have been gained by militias have generally been not over standing armies but over other militias in exercise and discipline inferior to themselves such were the victories which the greek militia gained over that of the persian empire and such too were those which in later times the swiss militia gained over that of the austrians and burgundians  the military force of the german and scythian nations who established themselves upon the ruins of the western empire continued for some time to be of the same kind in their new settlements as it had been in their original country it was a militia of shepherds and husbandmen which in time of war took the field under the command of the same chieftains whom it was accustomed to obey in peace it was therefore tolerably well exercised and tolerably well disciplined as arts and industry advanced however the authority of the chieftains gradually decayed and the great body of the people had less time to spare for military exercises both the discipline and the exercise of the feudal militia therefore went gradually to ruin and standing armies were gradually introduced to supply the place of it when the expedient of a standing army besides had once been adopted by one civilized nation it became necessary that all its neighbors should follow the example they soon found that their safety depended upon their doing so and that their own militia was altogether incapable of resisting the attack of such an army  the soldiers of a standing army though they may never have seen an enemy yet have frequently appeared to possess all the courage of veteran troops and the very moment that they took the field to have been fit to face the hardiest and most experienced veterans in      when the russian army marched into poland the valor of the russian soldiers did not appear inferior to that of the prussians at that time supposed to be the hardiest and most experienced veterans in europe the russian empire however had enjoyed a profound peace for near twenty years before and could at that time have very few soldiers who had ever seen an enemy when the spanish war broke out in      england had enjoyed a profound peace for about eight and twenty years the valor of her soldiers however far from being corrupted by that long peace was never more distinguished than in the attempt upon carthagena the first unfortunate exploit of that unfortunate war in a long peace the generals perhaps may sometimes forget their skill but where a well regulated standing army has been kept up the soldiers seem never to forget their valor  when a civilized nation depends for its defense upon a militia it is at all times exposed to be conquered by any barbarous nation which happens to be in its neighborhood the frequent conquests of all the civilized countries in asia by the tartars sufficiently demonstrate the natural superiority which the militia of a barbarous has over that of a civilized nation a well regulated standing army is superior to every militia such an army as it can best be maintained by an opulent and civilized nation so it can alone defend such a nation against the invasion of a poor and barbarous neighbor it is only by means of a standing army therefore that the civilization of any country can be perpetuated or even preserved for any considerable time  as it is only by means of a well regulated standing army that a civilized country can be defended so it is only by means of it that a barbarous country can be suddenly and tolerably civilized a standing army establishes with an irresistible force the law of the sovereign through the remotest provinces of the empire and maintains some degree of regular government in countries which could not otherwise admit of any whoever examines with attention the improvements which peter the great introduced into the russian empire will find that they almost all resolve themselves into the establishment of a well regulated standing army it is the instrument which executes and maintains all his other regulations that degree of order and internal peace which that empire has ever since enjoyed is altogether owing to the influence of that army  men of republican principles have been jealous of a standing army as dangerous to liberty it certainly is so wherever the interest of the general and that of the principal officers are not necessarily connected with the support of the constitution of the state the standing army of caesar destroyed the roman republic the standing army of cromwell turned the long parliament out of doors but where the sovereign is himself the general and the principal nobility and gentry of the country the chief officers of the army where the military force is placed under the command of those who have the greatest interest in the support of the civil authority because they have themselves the greatest share of that authority a standing army can never be dangerous to liberty on the contrary it may in some cases be favorable to liberty the security which it gives to the sovereign renders unnecessary that troublesome jealousy which in some modern republics seems to watch over the minutest actions and to be at all times ready to disturb the peace of every citizen where the security of the magistrate though supported by the principal people of the country is endangered by every popular discontent where a small tumult is capable of bringing about in a few hours a great revolution the whole authority of government must be employed to suppress and punish every murmur and complaint against it to a sovereign on the contrary who feels himself supported not only by the natural aristocracy of the country but by a well regulated standing army the rudest the most groundless and the most licentious remonstrances can give little disturbance he can safely pardon or neglect them and his consciousness of his own superiority naturally disposes him to do so that degree of liberty which approaches to licentiousness can be tolerated only in countries where the sovereign is secured by a well regulated standing army it is in such countries only that the public safety does not require that the sovereign should be trusted with any discretionary power for suppressing even the impertinent wantonness of this licentious liberty  the first duty of the sovereign therefore that of defending the society from the violence and injustice of other independent societies grows gradually more and more expensive as the society advances in civilization the military force of the society which originally cost the sovereign no expense either in time of peace or in time of war must in the progress of improvement first be maintained by him in time of war and afterward even in time of peace  the great change introduced into the art of war by the invention of fire arms has enhanced still further both the expense of exercising and disciplining any particular number of soldiers in time of peace and that of employing them in time of war both their arms and their ammunition are become more expensive a musket is a more expensive machine than a javelin or a bow and arrows a cannon or a mortar than a balista or a catapulta the powder which is spent in a modern review is lost irrecoverably and occasions a very considerable expense the javelins and arrows which were thrown or shot in an ancient one could easily be picked up again and were besides of very little value the cannon and the mortar are not only much dearer but much heavier machines than the balista or catapulta and require a greater expense not only to prepare them for the field but to carry them to it as the superiority of the modern artillery too over that of the ancients is very great it has become much more difficult and consequently much more expensive to fortify a rown so as to resist even for a few weeks the attack of that supetior artillery in modern times many different causes contribute to render the defense of the society more expensive the unavoidable effects of the natural progress of improvement have in this respect been a good deal enhanced by a great revolution in the art of war to which a mere accident the invention of gunpowder seems to have given occasion  in modern war the great expense of firearms gives an evident advantage to the nation which can best afford that expense and consequently to an opulent and civilized over a poor and barbarous nation in ancient times the opulent and civilized found it difficult to defend themselves against the poor and barbarous nations in modern times the poor and barbarous find it difficult to defend themselves against the opulent and civilized the invention of firearms an invention which at first sight appears to be so pernicious is certainly favorable both to the permanency and to the extension of civilization  part ii of the expense of justice the second duty of the sovereign that of protecting as far as possible every member of the society from the injustice or oppression of every other member of it or the duty of establishing an exact administration of justice requires too very different degrees of expense in the different periods of society  among nations of hunters as there is scarce any property or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days labor so there is seldom any established magistrate or any regular administration of justice men who have no property can injure one another only in their persons or reputations but when one man kills wounds beats or defames another though he to whom the injury is done suffers he who does it receives no benefit it is otherwise with the injuries to property the benefit of the person who does the injury is often equal to the loss of him who suffers it envy malice or resentment are the only passions which can prompt one man to injure another in his person or reputation but the greater part of men are not very frequently under the influence of those passions and the very worst men are so only occasionally as their gratification too how agreeable soever it may be to certain characters is not attended with any real or permanent advantage it is in the greater part of men commonly restrained by prudential considerations men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions but avarice and ambition in the rich in the poor the hatred of labor and the love of present ease and enjoyment are the passions which prompt to invade property passions much more steady in their operation and much more universal in their influence wherever there is great property there is great inequality for one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many the affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor who are often both driven by want and prompted by envy to invade his possessions it is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property which is acquired by the labor of many years or perhaps of many successive generations can sleep a single night in security he is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies whom though he never provoked he can never appease and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it the acquisition of valuable or extensive property therefore necessarily requires the establishment of civil government where there is no property or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days labor civil government is not so necessary  civil government supposes a certain subordination but as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property  the causes or circumstances which naturally introduce subordination or which naturally and antecedent to any civil institution give some men some superiority over the greater part of their brethren seem to be four in number  the first of those causes or circumstances is the superiority of personal qualifications of strength beauty and agility of body of wisdom and virtue of prudence justice fortitude and moderation of mind the qualifications of the body unless supported by those of the mind can give little authority in any period of society he is a very strong man who by mere strength of body can force two weak ones to obey him the qualifications of the mind can alone give very great authority they are however invisible qualities always disputable and generally disputed no society whether barbarous or civilized has ever found it convenient to settle the rules of precedence of rank and subordination according to those invisible qualities but according to something that is more plain and palpable  the second of those causes or circumstances is the superiority of age an old man provided his age is not so far advanced as to give suspicion of dotage is every where more respected than a young man of equal rank fortune and abilities among nations of hunters such as the native tribes of north america age is the sole foundation of rank and precedence among them father is the appellation of a superior brother of an equal and son of an inferior in the most opulent and civilized nations age regulates rank among those who are in every other respect equal and among whom therefore there is nothing else to regulate it among brothers and among sisters the eldest always take place and in the succession of the paternal estate every thing which cannot be divided but must go entire to one person such as a title of honor is in most cases given to the eldest age is a plain and palpable quality which admits of no dispute  the third of those causes or circumstances is the superiority of fortune the authority of riches however though great in every age of society is perhaps greatest in the rudest age of society which admits of any considerable inequality of fortune a tartar chief the increase of whose herds and flocks is sufficient to maintain a thousand men cannot well employ that increase in any other way than in maintaining a thousand men the rude state of his society does not afford him any manufactured produce any trinkets or baubles of any kind for which he can exchange that part of his rude produce which is over and above his own consumption the thousand men whom he thus maintains depending entirely upon him for their subsistence must both obey his orders in war and submit to his jurisdiction in peace he is necessarily both their general and their judge and his chieftainship is the necessary effect of the superiority of his fortune in an opulent and civilized society a man may possess a much greater fortune and yet not be able to command a dozen of people though the produce of his estate may be sufficient to maintain and may perhaps actually maintain more than a thousand people yet as those people pay for every thing which they get from him as he gives scarce any thing to any body but in exchange for an equivalent there is scarce any body who considers himself as entirely dependent upon him and his authority extends only over a few menial servants the authority of fortune however is very great even in an opulent and civilized society that it is much greater than that either of age or of personal qualities has been the constant complaint of every period of society which admitted of any considerable inequality of fortune the first period of society that of hunters admits of no such inequality universal poverty establishes there universal equality and the superiority either of age or of personal qualities are the feeble but the sole foundations of authority and subordination there is therefore little or no authority or subordination in this period of society the second period of society that of shepherds admits of very great inequalities of fortune and there is no period in which the superiority of fortune gives so great authority to those who possess it there is no period accordingly in which authority and subordination are more perfectly established the authority of an arabian scherif is very great that of a tartar khan altogether despotical  the fourth of those causes or circumstances is the superiority of birth superiority of birth supposes an ancient superiority of fortune in the family of the person who claims it all families are equally ancient and the ancestors of the prince though they may be better known cannot well be more numerous than those of the beggar antiquity of family means every where the antiquity either of wealth or of that greatness which is commonly either founded upon wealth or accompanied with it upstart greatness is every where less respected than ancient greatness the hatred of usurpers the love for the family of an ancient monarch are in a great measure founded upon the contempt which men naturally have for the former and upon their veneration for the latter as a military officer submits without reluctance to the authority of a superior by whom he has always been commanded but cannot bear that his inferior should be set over his head so men easily submit to a family to whom they and their ancestors have always submitted but are fired with indignation when another family in whom they had never acknowledged any such superiority assumes a dominion over them  the distinction of birth being subsequent to the inequality of fortune can have no place in nations of hunters among whom all men being equal in fortune must likewise be very nearly equal in birth the son of a wise and brave man may indeed even among them be somewhat more respected than a man of equal merit who has the misfortune to be the son of a fool or a coward the difference however will not be very great and there never was i believe a great family in the world whose illustration was entirely derived from the inheritance of wisdom and virtue  the distinction of birth not only may but always does take place among nations of shepherds such nations are always strangers to every sort of luxury and great wealth can scarce ever be dissipated among them by improvident profusion there are no nations accordingly who abound more in families revered and honored on account of their descent from a long race of great and illustrious ancestors because there are no nations among whom wealth is likely to continue longer in the same families  birth and fortune are evidently the two circumstances which principally set one man above another they are the two great sources of personal distinction and are therefore the principal causes which naturally establish authority and subordination among men among nations of shepherds both those causes operate with their full force the great shepherd or herdsman respected on account of his great wealth and of the great number of those who depend upon him for subsistence and revered on account of the nobleness of his birth and of the immemorial antiquity of his illustrious family has a natural authority over all the inferior shepherds or herdsmen of his horde or clan he can command the united force of a greater number of people than any of them his military power is greater than that of any of them in time of war they are all of them naturally disposed to muster themselves under his banner rather than under that of any other person and his birth and fortune thus naturally procure to him some sort of executive power by commanding too the united force of a greater number of people than any of them he is best able to compel any one of them who may have injured another to compensate the wrong he is the person therefore to whom all those who are too weak to defend themselves naturally look up for protection it is to him that they naturally complain of the injuries which they imagine have been done to them and his interposition in such cases is more easily submitted to even by the person complained of than that of any other person would be his birth and fortune thus naturally procure him some sort of judicial authority  it is in the age of shepherds in the second period of society that the inequality of fortune first begins to take place and introduces among men a degree of authority and subordination which could not possibly exist before it thereby introduces some degree of that civil government which is indispensably necessary for its own preservation and it seems to do this naturally and even independent of the consideration of that necessity the consideration of that necessity comes no doubt afterward to contribute very much to maintain and secure that authority and subordination the rich in particular are necessarily interested to support that order of things which can alone secure them in the possession of their own advantages men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs all the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them they constitute a sort of little nobility who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority civil government so far as it is instituted for the security of property is in reality instituted for the defense of the rich against the poor or of those who have some property against those who have none at all  the judicial authority of such a sovereign however far from being a cause of expense was for a long time a source of revenue to him the persons who applied to him for justice were always willing to pay for it and a present never failed to accompany a petition after the authority of the sovereign too was thoroughly established the person found guilty over and above the satisfaction which he was obliged to make to the party was likewise forced to pay an amercement to the sovereign he had given trouble he had disturbed he had broke the peace of his lord the king and for those offenses an amercement was thought due in the tartar governments of asia in the governments of europe which were founded by the german and scythian nations who overturned the roman empire the administration of justice was a considerable source of revenue both to the sovereign and to all the lesser chiefs or lords who exercised under him any particular jurisdiction either over some particular tribe or clan or over some particular territory or district originally both the sovereign and the inferior chiefs used to exercise this jurisdiction in their own persons afterward they universally found it convenient to delegate it to some substitute bailiff or judge this substitute however was still obliged to account to his principal or constituent for the profits of the jurisdiction whoever reads the instructions they are to be found in tyrrells history of england which were given to the judges of the circuit in the time of henry ii will see clearly that those judges were a sort of itinerant factors sent round the country for the purpose of levying certain branches of the kings revenue in those days the administration of justice not only afforded a certain revenue to the sovereign but to procure this revenue seems to have been one of the principal advantages which he proposed to obtain by the administration of justice  this scheme of making the administration of justice subservient to the purposes of revenue could scarce fail to be productive of several very gross abuses the person who applied for justice with a large present in his hand was likely to get something more than justice while he who applied for it with a small one was likely to get something less justice too might frequently be delayed in order that this present might be repeated the amercement besides of the person complained of might frequently suggest a very strong reason for finding him in the wrong even when he had not really been so that such abuses were far from being uncommon the ancient history of every country in europe bears witness  when the sovereign or chief exercised his judicial authority in his own person how much soever he might abuse it it must have been scarce possible to get any redress because there could seldom be any body powerful enough to call him to account when he exercised it by a bailiff indeed redress might sometimes be had if it was for his own benefit only that the bailiff had been guilty of any act of injustice the sovereign himself might not always be unwilling to punish him or to oblige him to repair the wrong but if it was for the benefit of his sovereign if it was in order to make court to the person who appointed him and who might prefer him that he had committed any act of oppression redress would upon most occasions be as impossible as if the sovereign had committed it himself in all barbarous governments accordingly in all those ancient governments of europe in particular which were founded upon the ruins of the roman empire the administration of justice appears for a long time to have been extremely corrupt far from being quite equal and impartial even under the best monarchs and altogether profligate under the worst  among nations of shepherds where the sovereign or chief is only the greatest shepherd or herdsman of the horde or clan he is maintained in the same manner as any of his vassals or subjects by the increase of his own herds or flocks among those nations of husbandmen who are but just come out of the shepherd state and who are not much advanced beyond that state such as the greek tribes appear to have been about the time of the trojan war and our german and scythian ancestors when they first settled upon the ruins of the western empire the sovereign or chief is in the same manner only the greatest landlord of the country and is maintained in the same manner as any other landlord by a revenue derived from his own private estate or from what in modern europe was called the demesne of the crown his subjects upon ordinary occasions contribute nothing to his support except when they stand in need of the interposition of his authority in order to protect them from the oppression of some of their fellow subjects the presents which they make him upon such occasions constitute the whole ordinary revenue the whole of the emoluments which except perhaps upon some very extraordinary emergencies he derives from his dominion over them when agamemnon in homer offers to achilles for his friendship the sovereignty of seven greek cities the sole advantage which he mentions as likely to be derived from it was that the people would honor him with presents as long as such presents as long as the emoluments of justice or what may be called the fees of court constituted in this manner the whole ordinary revenue which the sovereign derived from his sovereignty it could not well be expected it could not even decently be proposed that he should give them up altogether it might and it frequently was proposed that he should regulate and ascertain them but after they had been so regulated and ascertained how to hinder a person who was allpowerful from extending them beyond those regulations was still very difficult not to say impossible during the continuance of this state of things therefore the corruption of justice naturally resulting from the arbitrary and uncertain nature of those presents scarce admitted of any effectual remedy  but when from different causes chiefly from the continually increasing expense of defending the nation against the invasion of other nations the private estate of the sovereign had become altogether insufficient for defraying the expense of the sovereignty and when it had become necessary that the people should for their own security contribute toward this expense by taxes of different kinds it seems to have been very commonly stipulated that no present for the administration of justice should under any pretense be accepted either by the sovereign or by his bailiffs and substitutes the judges those presents it seems to have been supposed could more easily be abolished altogether than effectually regulated and ascertained fixed salaries were appointed to the judges which were supposed to compensate to them the loss of whatever might have been their share of the ancient emoluments of justice as the taxes more than compensated to the sovereign the loss of his justice was then said to be administered gratis  justice however never was in reality administered gratis in any country lawyers and attorneys at least must always be paid by the parties and if they were not they would perform their duty still worse than they actually perform it the fees annually paid to lawyers and attorneys amount in every court to a much greater sum than the salaries of the judges the circumstance of those salaries being paid by the crown can no where much diminish the necessary expense of a lawsuit but it was not so much to diminish the expense as to prevent the corruption of justice that the judges were prohibited from receiving any present or fee from the parties  the office of judge is in itself so very honorable that men are willing to accept of it though accompanied with very small emoluments the inferior office of justice of peace though attended with a good deal of trouble and in most cases with no emoluments at all is an object of ambition to the greater part of our country gentlemen the salaries of all the different judges high and low together with the whole expense of the administration and execution of justice even where it is not managed with very good economy makes in any civilized country but a very inconsiderable part of the whole expense of government  the whole expense of justice too might easily be defrayed by the fees of court and without exposing the administration of justice to any real hazard of corruption the public revenue might thus be entirely discharged from a certain though perhaps but a small encumbrance it is difficult to regulate the fees of court effectually where a person so powerful as the sovereign is to share in them and to derive any considerable part of his revenue from them it is very easy where the judge is the principal person who can reap any benefit from them the law can very easily oblige the judge to respect the regulation though it might not always be able to make the sovereign respect it where the fees of court are precisely regulated and ascertained where they are paid all at once at a certain period of every process into the hands of a cashier or receiver to be by him distributed in certain known proportions among the different judges after the process is decided and not till it is decided there seems to be no more danger of corruption than where such fees are prohibited altogether those fees without occasioning any considerable increase in the expense of a lawsuit might be rendered fully sufficient for defraying the whole expense of justice by not being paid to the judges till the process was determined they might be some incitement to the diligence of the court in examining and deciding it in courts which consisted of a considerable number of judges by proportioning the share of each judge to the number of hours and days which he had employed in examining the process either in the court or in a committee by order of the court those fees might give some encouragement to the diligence of each particular judge public services are never better performed than when their reward comes only in consequence of their being performed and is proportioned to the diligence employed in performing them in the different parliaments of france the fees of court called epices and vacations constitute the far greater part of the emoluments of the judges after all deductions are made the neat salary paid by the crown to a counselor or judge in the parliament of toulouse in rank and dignity the second parliament of the kingdom amounts only to a hundred and fifty livres about six pounds eleven shillings sterling a year about seven years ago that sum was in the same place the ordinary yearly wages of a common footman the distribution of those epices too is according to the diligence of the judges a diligent judge gains a comfortable though moderate revenue by his office an idle one gets little more than his salary those parliaments are perhaps in many respects not very convenient courts of justice but they have never been accused they seem never even to have been suspected of corruption  the fees of court seem originally to have been the principal support of the different courts of justice in england each court endeavored to draw to itself as much business as it could and was upon that account willing to take cognizance of many suits which were not originally intended to fall under its jurisdiction the court of kings bench instituted for the trial of criminal causes only took cognizance of civil suits the plaintiff pretending that the defendant in not doing him justice had been guilty of some trespass or misdemeanor the court of exchequer instituted for the levying of the kings revenue and for enforcing the payment of such debts only as were due to the king took cognizance of all other contract debts the plaintiff alleging that he could not pay the king because the defendant would not pay him in consequence of such fictions it came in many cases to depend altogether upon the parties before what court they would choose to have their cause tried and each court endeavored by superior dispatch and impartiality to draw to itself as many causes as it could the present admirable constitution of the courts of justice in england was perhaps originally in a great measure formed by this emulation which anciently took place between their respective judges each judge endeavoring to give in his own court the speediest and most effectual remedy which the law would admit for every sort of injustice originally the courts of law gave damages only for breach of contract the court of chancery as a court of conscience first took upon it to enforce the specific performance of agreements when the breach of contract consisted in the nonpayment of money the damage sustained could be compensated in no other way than by ordering payment which was equivalent to a specific performance of the agreement in such cases therefore the remedy of the courts of law was sufficient it was not so in others when the tenant sued his lord for having unjustly outed him of his lease the damages which he recovered were by no means equivalent to the possession of the land such causes therefore for some time went all to the court of chancery to the no small loss of the courts of law it was to draw back such causes to themselves that the courts of law are said to have invented the artificial and fictitious writ of ejectment the most effectual remedy for an unjust outer or dispossession of land  a stampduty upon the law proceedings of each particular court to be levied by that court and applied toward the maintenance of the judges and other officers belonging to it might in the same manner afford a revenue sufficient for defraying the expense of the administration of justice without bringing any burden upon the general revenue of the society the judges indeed might in this case be under the temptation of multiplying unnecessarily the proceedings upon every cause in order to increase as much as possible the produce of such a stampduty it has been the custom in modern europe to regulate upon most occasions the payment of the attorneys and clerks of court according to the number of pages which they had occasion to write the court however requiring that each page should contain so many lines and each line so many words in order to increase their payment the attorneys and clerks have contrived to multiply words beyond all necessity to the corruption of the law language of i believe every court of justice in europe a like temptation might perhaps occasion a like corruption in the form of law proceedings  but whether the administration of justice be so contrived as to defray its own expense or whether the judges be maintained by fixed salaries paid to them from some other fund it does not seem necessary that the person or persons entrusted with the executive power should be charged with the management of that fund or with the payment of those salaries that fund might arise from the rent of landed estates the management of each estate being entrusted to the particular court which was to be maintained by it that fund might arise even from the interest of a sum of money the lending out of which might in the same manner be entrusted to the court which was to be maintained by it a part though indeed but a small part of the salary of the judges of the court of session in scotland arises from the interest of a sum of money the necessary instability of such a fund seems however to render it an improper one for the maintenance of an institution which ought to last forever  the separation of the judicial from the executive power seems originally to have arisen from the increasing business of the society in consequence of its increasing improvement the administration of justice became so laborious and so complicated a duty as to require the undivided attention of the persons to whom it was entrusted the person entrusted with the executive power not having leisure to attend to the decision of private causes himself a deputy was appointed to decide them in his stead in the progress of the roman greatness the consul was too much occupied with the political affairs of the state to attend to the administration of justice a praetor therefore was appointed to administer it in his stead in the progress of the european monarchies which were founded upon the ruins of the roman empire the sovereigns and the great lords came universally to consider the administration of justice as an office both too laborious and too ignoble for them to execute in their own persons they universally therefore discharged themselves of it by appointing a deputy bailiff or judge  when the judicial is united to the executive power it is scarce possible that justice should not frequently be sacrificed to what is vulgarly called politics the persons entrusted with the great interests of the state may even without any corrupt views sometimes imagine it necessary to sacrifice to those interests the rights of a private man but upon the impartial administration of justice depends the liberty of every individual the sense which he has of his own security in order to make every individual feel himself perfectly secure in the possession of every right which belongs to him it is not only necessary that the judicial should be separated from the executive power but that it should be rendered as much as possible independent of that power the judge should not be liable to be removed from his office according to the caprice of that power the regular payment of his salary should not depend upon the goodwill or even upon the good economy of that power  part iii of the expense of public works and public institutions the third and last duty of the sovereign or commonwealth is that of erecting and maintaining those public institutions and those public works which though they may be in the highest degree advantageous to a great society are however of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual or small number of individuals and which it therefore cannot be expected that any individual or small number of individuals should erect or maintain the performance of this duty requires too very different degrees of expense in the different periods of society  after the public institutions and public works necessary for the defense of the society and for the administration of justice both of which have already been mentioned the other works and institutions of this kind are chiefly those for facilitating the commerce of the society and those for promoting the instruction of the people the institutions for instruction are of two kinds those for the education of the youth and those for the instruction of people of all ages the consideration of the manner in which the expense of those different sorts of public work and institutions may be most properly defrayed will divide this third part of the present chapter into three different articles  article i of the public works and institutions for facilitating the commerce of the society that the erection and maintenance of the public works which facilitate the commerce of any country such as good roads bridges navigable canals harbors etc must require very different degrees of expense in the different periods of society is evident without any proof the expense of making and maintaining the public roads of any country must evidently increase with the annual produce of the land and labor of that country or with the quantity and weight of the goods which it becomes necessary to fetch and carry upon those roads the strength of a bridge must be suited to the number and weight of the carriages which are likely to pass over it the depth and the supply of water for a navigable canal must be proportioned to the number and tunnage of the lighters which are likely to carry goods upon it the extent of a harbor to the number of the shipping which are likely to take shelter in it  it does not seem necessary that the expense of those public works should be defrayed from that public revenue as it is commonly called of which the collection and application is in most countries assigned to the executive power the greater part of such public works may easily be so managed as to afford a particular revenue sufficient for defraying their own expense without bringing any burden upon the general revenue of the society  a highway a bridge a navigable canal for example may in most cases be both made and maintained by a small toll upon the carriages which make use of them a harbor by a moderate port duty upon the tunnage of the shipping which load or unload in it the coinage another institution for facilitating commerce in many countries not only defrays its own expense but affords a small revenue or seignorage to the sovereign the post office another institution for the same purpose over and above defraying its own expense affords in almost all countries a very considerable revenue to the sovereign  when the carriages which pass over a highway or a bridge and the lighters which sail upon a navigable canal pay toll in proportion to their weight or their tunnage they pay for the maintenance of those public works exactly in proportion to the tear and wear which they occasion of them it seems scarce possible to invent a more equitable way of maintaining such works this tax or toll too though it is advanced by the carrier is finally paid by the consumer to whom it must always be charged in the price of the goods as the expense of carriage however is very much reduced by means of such public works the goods notwithstanding the toll come cheaper to the consumer than they could otherwise have done their price not being so much raised by the toll as it is lowered by the cheapness of the carriage the person who finally pays this tax therefore gains by the application more than he loses by the payment of it his payment is exactly in proportion to his gain it is in reality no more than a part of that gain which he is obliged to give up in order to get the rest it seems impossible to imagine a more equitable method of raising a tax  when the toll upon carriages of luxury upon coaches postchaises etc is made somewhat higher in proportion to their weight than upon carriages of necessary use such as carts wagons etc the indolence and vanity of the rich is made to contribute in a very easy manner to the relief of the poor by rendering cheaper the transportation of heavy goods to all the different parts of the country  when high roads bridges canals etc are in this manner made and supported by the commerce which is carried on by means of them they can be made only where that commerce requires them and consequently where it is proper to make them their expense too their grandeur and magnificence must be suited to what that commerce can afford to pay they must be made consequently as it is proper to make them a magnificent high road cannot be made through a desert country where there is little or no commerce or merely because it happens to lead to the country villa of the intendant of the province or to that of some great lord to whom the intendant finds it convenient to make his court a great bridge cannot be thrown over a river at a place where nobody passes or merely to embellish the view from the windows of a neighboring palace things which sometimes happen in countries where works of this kind are carried on by any other revenue than that which they themselves are capable of affording  in several different parts of europe the toll or lockduty upon a canal is the property of private persons whose private interest obliges them to keep up the canal if it is not kept in tolerable order the navigation necessarily ceases altogether and along with it the whole profit which they can make by the tolls if those tolls were put under the management of commissioners who had themselves no interest in them they might be less attentive to the maintenance of the works which produced them the canal of languedoc cost the king of france and the province upwards of thirteen millions of livres which at twentyeight livres the mark of silver the value of french money in the end of the last century amounted to upwards of nine hundred thousand pounds sterling when that great work was finished the most likely method it was found of keeping it in constant repair was to make a present of the tolls to riquet the engineer who planned and conducted the work those tolls constitute at present a very large estate to the different branches of the family of that gentleman who have therefore a great interest to keep the work in constant repair but had those tolls been put under the management of commissioners who had no such interest they might perhaps have been dissipated in ornamental and unnecessary expenses while the most essential parts of the work were allowed to go to ruin  the tolls for the maintenance of a high road cannot with any safety be made the property of private persons a high road though entirely neglected does not become altogether impassable though a canal does the proprietors of the tolls upon a high road therefore might neglect altogether the repair of the road and yet continue to levy very nearly the same tolls it is proper therefore that the tolls for the maintenance of such a work should be put under the management of commissioners or trustees  in great britain the abuses which the trustees have committed in the management of those tolls have in many cases been very justly complained of at many turnpikes it has been said the money levied is more than double of what is necessary for executing in the compleatest manner the work which is often executed in a very slovenly manner and sometimes not executed at all the system of repairing the high roads by tolls of this kind it must be observed is not of very long standing we should not wonder therefore if it has not yet been brought to that degree of perfection of which it seems to be capable if mean and improper persons are frequently appointed trustees and if proper courts of inspection and account have not yet been established for controuling their conduct and for reducing the tolls to what is barely sufficient for executing the work to be done by them the recency of the institution both accounts and apologizes for those defects of which by the wisdom of parliament the greater part may in due time be gradually remedied  the money levied at the different turnpikes in great britain is supposed to exceed so much what is necessary for repairing the roads that the savings which with proper economy might be made from it have been considered even by some ministers as a very great resource which might at some time or another be applied to the exigencies of the state government it has been said by taking the management of the turnpikes into its own hands and by employing the soldiers who would work for a very small addition to their pay could keep the roads in good order at a much less expense than it can be done by trustees who have no other workmen to employ but such as derive their whole subsistence from their wages a great revenue half a million perhaps it has been pretended might in this manner be gained without laying any new burden upon the people and the turnpike roads might be made to contribute to the general expense of the state in the same manner as the post office does at present  that a considerable revenue might be gained in this manner i have no doubt though probably not near so much as the projectors of this plan have supposed the plan itself however seems liable to several very important objections  first if the tolls which are levied at the turnpikes should ever be considered as one of the resources for supplying the exigencies of the state they would certainly be augmented as those exigencies were supposed to require according to the policy of great britain therefore they would probably be augmented very fast the facility with which a great revenue could be drawn from them would probably encourage administration to recur very frequently to this resource though it may perhaps be more than doubtful whether half a million could by any economy be saved out of the present tolls it can scarce be doubted but that a million might be saved out of them if they were doubled and perhaps two millions if they were tripled this great revenue too might be levied without the appointment of a single new officer to collect and receive it but the turnpike tolls being continually augmented in this manner instead of facilitating the inland commerce of the country as at present would soon become a very great encumbrance upon it the expense of transporting all heavy goods from one part of the country to another would soon be so much increased the market for all such goods consequently would soon be so much narrowed that their production would be in a great measure discouraged and the most important branches of the domestic industry of the country annihilated altogether  secondly a tax upon carriages in proportion to their weight though a very equal tax when applied to the sole purpose of repairing the roads is a very unequal one when applied to any other purpose or to supply the common exigencies of the state when it is applied to the sole purpose above mentioned each carriage is supposed to pay exactly for the tear and wear which that carriage occasions of the roads but when it is applied to any other purpose each carriage is supposed to pay for more than that tear and wear and contributes to the supply of some other exigency of the state but as the turnpike toll raises the price of goods in proportion to their weight and not to their value it is chiefly paid by the consumers of coarse and bulky not by those of precious and light commodities whatever exigency of the state therefore this tax might be intended to supply that exigency would be chiefly supplied at the expense of the poor not of the rich at the expense of those who are least able to supply it not of those who are most able  thirdly if government should at any time neglect the reparation of the high roads it would be still more difficult than it is at present to compel the proper application of any part of the turnpike tolls a large revenue might thus be levied upon the people without any part of it being applied to the only purpose to which a revenue levied in this manner ought ever to be applied if the meanness and poverty of the trustees of turnpike roads render it sometimes difficult at present to oblige them to repair their wrong their wealth and greatness would render it ten times more so in the case which is here supposed  in france the funds destined for the reparation of the high roads are under the immediate direction of the executive power those funds consist partly in the six days labor which the country people are in most parts of europe obliged to give to the reparation of the highways and partly in such a portion of the general revenue of the state as the king chooses to spare from his other expenses  by the ancient law of france as well as by that of most other parts of europe the six days labor was under the direction of a local or provincial magistracy which had no immediate dependency upon the kings council but by the present practice both the six days labor and whatever other fund the king may choose to assign for the reparation of the high roads in any particular province or generality are entirely under the management of the intendant an officer who is appointed and removed by the kings council who receives his orders from it and is in constant correspondence with it in the progress of despotism the authority of the executive power gradually absorbs that of every other power in the state and assumes to itself the management of every branch of revenue which is destined for any public purpose in france however the great post roads the roads which make the communication between the principal towns of the kingdom are in general kept in good order and in some provinces are even a good deal superior to the greater part of the turnpike roads of england but what we call the cross roads that is the far greater part of the roads in the country are entirely neglected and are in many places absolutely impassable for any heavy carriage in some places it is even dangerous to travel on horseback and mules are the only conveyance which can safely be trusted the proud minister of an ostentatious court may frequently take pleasure in executing a work of splendour and magnificence such as a great highway which is frequently seen by the principal nobility whose applauses not only flatter his vanity but even contribute to support his interest at court but to execute a great number of little works in which nothing that can be done can make any great appearance or excite the smallest degree of admiration in any traveller and which in short have nothing to recommend them but their extreme utility is a business which appears in every respect too mean and paultry to merit the attention of so great a magistrate under such an administration therefore such works are almost always entirely neglected  in china and in several other governments of asia the executive power charges itself both with the reparation of the high roads and with the maintenance of the navigable canals in the instructions which are given to the governor of each province those objects it is said are constantly recommended to him and the judgment which the court forms of his conduct is very much regulated by the attention which he appears to have paid to this part of his instructions this branch of public police accordingly is said to be very much attended to in all those countries but particularly in china where the high roads and still more the navigable canals it is pretended exceed very much every thing of the same kind which is known in europe the accounts of those works however which have been transmitted to europe have generally been drawn up by weak and wondering travelers frequently by stupid and lying missionaries if they had been examined by more intelligent eyes and if the accounts of them had been reported by more faithful witnesses they would not perhaps appear to be so wonderful the account which bernier gives of some works of this kind in indostan falls very much short of what had been reported of them by other travelers more disposed to the mavelous than he was it may too perhaps be in those countries as it is in france where the great roads the great communications which are likely to be the subjects of conversation at the court and in the capital are attended to and all the rest neglected in china besides in indostan and in several other governments of asia the revenue of the sovereign arises almost altogether from a land tax or landrent which rises or falls with the rise or fall of the annual produce of the land the great interest of the sovereign therefore his revenue is in such countries necessarily and immediately connected with the cultivation of the land with the greatness of its produce and with the value of its produce but in order to render that produce both as great and as valuable as possible it is necessary to procure to it as extensive a market as possible and consequently to establish the freest the easiest and the least expensive communication between all the different parts of the country which can be done only by means of the best roads and the best navigable canals but the revenue of the sovereign does not in any part of europe arise chiefly from a land tax or landrent in all the great kingdoms of europe perhaps the greater part of it may ultimately depend upon the produce of the land but that dependency is neither so immediate nor so evident in europe therefore the sovereign does not feel himself so directly called upon to promote the increase both in quantity and value of the produce of the land or by maintaining good roads and canals to provide the most extensive market for that produce though it should be true therefore what i apprehend is not a little doubtful that in some parts of asia this department of the public police is very properly managed by the executive power there is not the least probability that during the present state of things it could be tolerably managed by that power in any part of europe  even those public works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves but of which the convenience is nearly confined to some particular place or district are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue under the management of a local or provincial administration than by the general revenue of the state of which the executive power must always have the management were the streets of london to be lighted and paved at the expense of the treasury is there any probability that they would be so well lighted and paved as they are at present or even at so small an expense the expense besides instead of being raised by a local tax upon the inhabitants of each particular street parish or district in london would in this case be defrayed out of the general revenue of the state and would consequently be raised by a tax upon all the inhabitants of the kingdom of whom the greater part derive no sort of benefit from the lighting and paving of the streets of london  the abuses which sometimes creep into the local and provincial administration of a local and provincial revenue how enormous soever they may appear are in reality however almost always very trifling in comparison of those which commonly take place in the administration and expenditure of the revenue of a great empire they are besides much more easily corrected under the local or provincial administration of the justices of the peace in great britain the six days labor which the country people are obliged to give to the reparation of the highways is not always perhaps very judiciously applied but it is scarce ever exacted with any circumstance of cruelty or oppression in france under the administration of the intendants the application is not always more judicious and the exaction is frequently the most cruel and oppressive such corvees as they are called make one of the principal instruments of tyranny by which the intendant chastises any parish or communaute which has had the misfortune to fall under his displeasure  article ii of the expense of the institutions for the education of the youth the institutions for the education of the youth may in the same manner furnish a revenue sufficient for defraying their own expense the fee or honorary which the scholar pays to the master naturally constitutes a revenue of this kind  even where the reward of the master does not arise altogether from this natural revenue it still is not necessary that it should be derived from that general revenue of the society of which the collection and application is in most countries assigned to the executive power through the greater part of europe accordingly the endowment of schools and colleges makes either no charge upon that general revenue or but a very small one it every where arises chiefly from some local or provincial revenue from the rent of some landed estate or from the interest of some sum of money allotted and put under the management of trustees for this particular purpose sometimes by the sovereign himself and sometimes by some private donor  have those public endowments contributed in general to promote the end of their institution have they contributed to encourage the diligence and to improve the abilities of the teachers have they directed the course of education toward objects more useful both to the individual and to the public than those to which it would naturally have gone of its own accord it should not seem very difficult to give at least a probable answer to each of those questions  in every profession the exertion of the greater part of those who exercise it is always in proportion to the necessity they are under of making that exertion this necessity is greatest with those to whom the emoluments of their profession are the only source from which they expect their fortune or even their ordinary revenue and subsistence in order to acquire this fortune or even to get this subsistence they must in the course of the year execute a certain quantity of work of a known value and where the competition is free the rivalship of competitors who are all endeavoring to justle one another out of employment obliges every man to endeavor to execute his work with a certain degree of exactness the greatness of the objects which are to be acquired by success in some particular professions may no doubt sometimes animate the exertion of a few men of extraordinary spirit and ambition great objects however are evidently not necessary in order to occasion the greatest exertions rivalship and emulation render excellency even in mean professions an object of ambition and frequently occasion the very greatest exertions great objects on the contrary alone and unsupported by the necessity of application have seldom been sufficient to occasion any considerable exertion in england success in the profession of the law leads to some very great objects of ambition and yet how few men born to easy fortunes have ever in this country been eminent in that profession  the endowments of schools and colleges have necessarily diminished more or less the necessity of application in the teachers their subsistence so far as it arises from their salaries is evidently derived from a fund altogether independent of their success and reputation in their particular professions  in some universities the salary makes but a part and frequently but a small part of the emoluments of the teacher of which the greater part arises from the honoraries or fees of his pupils the necessity of application though always more or less diminished is not in this case entirely taken away reputation in his profession is still of some importance to him and he still has some dependency upon the affection gratitude and favorable report of those who have attended upon his instructions and these favorable sentiments he is likely to gain in no way so well as by deserving them that is by the abilities and diligence with which he discharges every part of this duty  in other universities the teacher is prohibited from receiving any honorary or fee from his pupils and his salary constitutes the whole of the revenue which he derives from his office his interest is in this case set as directly in opposition to his duty as it is possible to set it it is the interest of every man to live as much at his ease as he can and if his emoluments are to be precisely the same whether he does or does not perform some very laborious duty it is certainly his interest at least as interest is vulgarly understood either to neglect it altogether or if he is subject to some authority which will not suffer him to do this to perform it in as careless and slovenly a manner as that authority will permit if he is naturally active and a lover of labor it is his interest to employ that activity in any way from which he can derive some advantage rather than in the performance of his duty from which he can derive none  if the authority to which he is subject resides in the body corporate the college or university of which he himself is a member and in which the greater part of the other members are like himself persons who either are or ought to be teachers they are likely to make a common cause to be all very indulgent to one another and every man to consent that his neighbor may neglect his duty provided he himself is allowed to neglect his own in the university of oxford the greater part of the public professors have for these many years given up altogether even the pretense of teaching  if the authority to which he is subject resides not so much in the body corporate of which he is a member as in some other extraneous persons in the bishop of the diocese for example in the governor of the province or perhaps in some minister of state it is not indeed in this case very likely that he will be suffered to neglect his duty altogether all that such superiors however can force him to do is to attend upon his pupils a certain number of hours that is to give a certain number of lectures in the week or in the year what those lectures shall be must still depend upon the diligence of the teacher and that diligence is likely to be proportioned to the motives which he has for exerting it an extraneous jurisdiction of this kind besides is liable to be exercised both ignorantly and capriciously in its nature it is arbitrary and discretionary and the persons who exercise it neither attending upon the lectures of the teacher themselves nor perhaps understanding the sciences which it is his business to teach are seldom capable of exercising it with judgment from the insolence of office too they are frequently indifferent how they exercise it and are very apt to censure or deprive him of his office wantonly and without any just cause the person subject to such jurisdiction is necessarily degraded by it and instead of being one of the most respectable is rendered one of the meanest and most contemptible persons in the society it is by powerful protection only that he can effectually guard himself against the bad usage to which he is at all times exposed and this protection he is most likely to gain not by ability or diligence in his profession but by obsequiousness to the will of his superiors and by being ready at all times to sacrifice to that will the rights the interest and the honor of the body corporate of which he is a member whoever has attended for any considerable time to the administration of a french university must have had occasion to remark the effects which naturally result from an arbitrary and extraneous jurisdiction of this kind  whatever forces a certain number of students to any college or university independent of the merit or reputation of the teachers tends more or less to diminish the necessity of that merit or reputation  the privileges of graduates in arts in law in physic and divinity when they can be obtained only by residing a certain number of years in certain universities necessarily force a certain number of students to such universities independent of the merit or reputation of the teachers the privileges of graduates are a sort of statutes of apprenticeship which have contributed to the improvement of education just as other statutes of apprenticeship have to that of arts and manufactures  the charitable foundations of scholarships exhibitions burasaries etc necessarily attach a certain number of students to certain colleges independent altogether of the merit of those particular colleges were the students upon such charitable foundations left free to choose what college they liked best such liberty might perhaps contribute to excite some emulation among different colleges a regulation on the contrary which prohibited even the independent members of every particular college from leaving it and going to any other without leave first asked and obtained of that which they meant to abandon would tend very much to extinguish that emulation  if in each college the tutor or teacher who was to instruct each student in all arts and sciences should not be voluntarily chosen by the student but appointed by the head of the college and if in case of neglect inability or bad usage the student should not be allowed to change him for another without leave first asked and obtained such a regulation would not only tend very much to extinguish all emulation among the different tutors of the same college but to diminish very much in all of them the necessity of diligence and of attention to their respective pupils such teachers though very well paid by their students might be as much disposed to neglect them as those who are not paid by them at all or who have no other recompense but their salary  if the teacher happens to be a man of sense it must be an unpleasant thing to him to be conscious while he is lecturing his students that he is either speaking or reading nonsense or what is very little better than nonsense it must too be unpleasant to him to observe that the greater part of his students desert his lectures or perhaps attend upon them with plain enough marks of neglect contempt and derision if he is obliged therefore to give a certain number of lectures these motives alone without any other interest might dispose him to take some pains to give tolerably good ones several different expedients however may be fallen upon which will effectually blunt the edge of all those incitements to diligence the teacher instead of explaining to his pupils himself the science in which he proposes to instruct them may read some book upon it and if this book is written in a foreign and dead language by interpreting it to them into their own or what would give him still less trouble by making them interpret it to him and by now and then making an occasional remark upon it he may flatter himself that he is giving a lecture the slightest degree of knowledge and application will enable him to do this without exposing himself to contempt or derision or saying any thing that is really foolish absurd or ridiculous the discipline of the college at the same time may enable him to force all his pupils to the most regular attendance upon this shamlecture and to maintain the most decent and respectful behavior during the whole time of the performance  the discipline of colleges and universities is in general contrived not for the benefit of the students but for the interest or more properly speaking for the ease of the masters its object is in all cases to maintain the authority of the master and whether he neglects or performs his duty to oblige the students in all cases to behave to him as if he performed it with the greatest diligence and ability it seems to presume perfect wisdom and virtue in the one order and the greatest weakness and folly in the other where the masters however really perform their duty there are no examples i believe that the greater part of the students ever neglect theirs no discipline is ever requisite to force attendance upon lectures which are really worth the attending as is well known wherever any such lectures are given force and restraint may no doubt be in some degree requisite in order to oblige children or very young boys to attend to those parts of education which it is thought necessary for them to acquire during that early period of life but after twelve or thirteen years of age provided the master does his duty force or restraint can scarce ever be necessary to carry on any part of education such is the generosity of the greater part of young men that so far from being disposed to neglect or despise the instructions of their master provided he shows some serious intention of being of use to them they are generally inclined to pardon a great deal of incorrectness in the performance of his duty and sometimes even to conceal from the public a good deal of gross negligence  those parts of education it is to be observed for the teaching of which there are no public institutions are generally the best taught when a young man goes to a fencing or a dancing school he does not indeed always learn to fence or to dance very well but he seldom fails of learning to fence or to dance the good effects of the riding school are not commonly so evident the expense of a riding school is so great that in most places it is a public institution the three most essential parts of literary education to read write and account it still continues to be more common to acquire in private than in public schools and it very seldom happens that any body fails of acquiring them to the degree in which it is necessary to acquire them  in england the public schools are much less corrupted than the universities in the schools the youth are taught or at least may be taught greek and latin that is every thing which the masters pretend to teach or which it is expected they should teach in the universities the youth neither are taught nor always can find any proper means of being taught the sciences which it is the business of those incorporated bodies to teach the reward of the schoolmaster in most cases depends principally in some case almost entirely upon the fees or honoraries of his scholars schools have no exclusive privileges in order to obtain the honors of graduation it is not necessary that a person should bring a certificate of his having studied a certain number of years at a public school if upon examination he appears to understand what is taught there no questions are asked about the place where he learnt it  the parts of education which are commonly taught in universities it may perhaps be said are not very well taught but had it not been for those institutions they would not have been commonly taught at all and both the individual and the public would have suffered a good deal from the want of those important parts of education  the present universities of europe were originally the greater part of them ecclesiastical corporations instituted for the education of churchmen they were founded by the authority of the pope and were so entirely under his immediate protection that their members whether masters or students had all of them what was then called the benefit of clergy that is were exempted from the civil jurisdiction of the countries in which their respective universities were situated and were amenable only to the ecclesiastical tribunals what was taught in the greater part of those universities was suitable to the end of their institution either theology or something that was merely preparatory to theology  when christianity was first established by law a corrupted latin had become the common language of all the western parts of europe the service of the church accordingly and the translation of the bible which was read in churches were both in that corrupted latin that is in the common language of the country after the irruption of the barbarous nations who overturned the roman empire latin gradually ceased to be the language of any part of europe but the reverence of the people naturally preserves the established forms and ceremonies of religion long after the circumstances which first introduced and rendered them reasonable are no more though latin therefore was no longer understood any where by the great body of the people the whole service of the church still continued to be performed in that language two different languages were thus established in europe in the same manner as in ancient egypt a language of the priests and a language of the people a sacred and a profane a learned and an unlearned language but it was necessary that the priests should understand something of that sacred and learned language in which they were to officiate and the study of the latin language therefore made from the beginning an essential part of university education  it was not so with that either of the greek or of the hebrew language the infallible decrees of the church had pronounced the latin translation of the bible commonly called the latin vulgate to have been equally dictated by divine inspiration and therefore of equal authority with the greek and hebrew originals the knowledge of those two languages therefore not being indispensibly requisite to a churchman the study of them did not for a long time make a necessary part of the common course of university education there are some spanish universities i am assured in which the study of the greek language has never yet made any part of that course the first reformers found the greek text of the new testament and even the hebrew text of the old more favorable to their opinions than the vulgate translation which as might naturally be supposed had been gradually accommodated to support the doctrines of the catholic church they set themselves therefore to expose the many errors of that translation which the roman catholic clergy were thus put under the necessity of defending or explaining but this could not well be done without some knowledge of the original languages of which the study was therefore gradually introduced into the greater part of universities both of those which embraced and of those which rejected the doctrines of the reformation the greek language was connected with every part of that classical learning which though at first principally cultivated by catholics and italians happened to come into fashion much about the same time that the doctrines of the reformation were set on foot in the greater part of universities therefore that language was taught previous to the study of philosophy and as soon as the student had made some progress in the latin the hebrew language having no connection with classical learning and except the holy scriptures being the language of not a single book in any esteem the study of it did not commonly commence till after that of philosophy and when the student had entered upon the study of theology  originally the first rudiments both of the greek and latin languages were taught in universities and they still continue to be so in some universities in others it is expected that the student should have previously acquired at least the rudiments of one or both of those languages of which the study continues to make every where a very considerable part of university education  the ancient greek philosophy was divided into three great branches physics or natural philosophy ethics or moral philosophy and logic this general division seems perfectly agreeable to the nature of things  the great phenomena of nature the revolution of the heavenly bodies eclipses comets thunder lightning and other extraordinary meteors the generation the life growth and dissolution of plants and animals are objects which as they naturally excite the wonder so they necessarily call forth the curiosity of mankind to enquire into their causes superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods philosophy afterward endeavored to account for them from more familiar causes or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods as those great phenomena are the first objects of human curiosity so the science which pretends to explain them must naturally have been the first branch of philosophy that was cultivated the first philosophers accordingly of whom history has preserved any account appear to have been natural philosophers  in every age and country of the world men must have attended to the characters designs and actions of one another and many reputable rules and maxims for the conduct of human life must have been laid down and approved of by common consent as soon as writing came into fashion wise men or those who fancied themselves such would naturally endeavor to increase the number of those established and respected maxims and to express their own sense of what was either proper or improper conduct sometimes in the more artificial form of apologues like what are called the fables of aesop and sometimes in the more simple one of apophthegms or wise sayings like the proverbs of solomon the verses of theognis and phocyllides and some part of the works of hesiod they might continue in this manner for a long time merely to multiply the number of those maxims of prudence and morality without even attempting to arrange them in any very distinct or methodical order much less to connect them together by one or more general principles from which they were all deducible like effects from their natural causes the beauty of a systematical arrangement of different observations connected by a few common principles was first seen in the rude essays of those ancient times toward a system of natural philosophy something of the same kind was afterward attempted in morals the maxims of common life were arranged in some methodical order and connected together by a few common principles in the same manner as they had attempted to arrange and connect the phenomena of nature the science which pretends to investigate and explain those connecting principles is what is properly called moral philosophy  different authors gave different systems both of natural and moral philosophy but the arguments by which they supported those different systems far from being always demonstrations were frequently at best but very slender probabilities and sometimes mere sophisms which had no other foundation but the inaccuracy and ambiguity of common language speculative systems have in all ages of the world been adopted for reasons too frivolous to have determined the judgment of any man of common sense in a matter of the smallest pecuniary interest gross sophistry has scarce ever had any influence upon the opinions of mankind except in matters of philosophy and speculation and in these it has frequently had the greatest the patrons of each system of natural and moral philosophy naturally endeavored to expose the weakness of the arguments adduced to support the systems which were opposite to their own in examining those arguments they were necessarily led to consider the difference between a probable and a demonstrative argument between a fallacious and a conclusive one and logic or the science of the general principles of good and bad reasoning necessarily arose out of the observations which a scrutiny of this kind gave occasion to though in its origin posterior both to physics and to ethics it was commonly taught not indeed in all but in the greater part of the ancient schools of philosophy previously to either of those sciences the student it seems to have been thought ought to understand well the difference between good and bad reasoning before he was led to reason upon subjects of so great importance  this ancient division of philosophy into three parts was in the greater part of the universities of europe changed for another into five  in the ancient philosophy whatever was taught concerning the nature either of the human mind or of the deity made a part of the system of physics those beings in whatever their essence might be supposed to consist were parts of the great system of the universe and parts too productive of the most important effects whatever human reason could either conclude or conjecture concerning them made as it were two chapters though no doubt two very important ones of the science which pretended to give an account of the origin and revolutions of the great system of the universe but in the universities of europe where philosophy was taught only as subservient to theology it was natural to dwell longer upon those two chapters than upon any other of the science those two chapters were gradually more and more extended and were divided into many inferior chapters till at last the doctrine of spirits of which so little can be known came to take up as much room in the system of philosophy as the doctrine of bodies of which so much can be known the doctrines concerning those two subjects were considered as making two distinct sciences what was called metaphysics or pneumatics was set in opposition to physics and was cultivated not only as the more sublime but for the purposes of a particular profession as the more useful science of the two the proper subject of experiment and observation a subject in which a careful attention is capable of making so many useful discoveries was almost entirely neglected the subject in which after a few very simple and almost obvious truths the most careful attention can discover nothing but obscurity and uncertainty and can consequently produce nothing but subtleties and sophisms was greatly cultivated  when those two sciences had thus been set in opposition to one another the comparison between them naturally gave birth to a third to what was called ontology or the science which treated of the qualities and attributes which were common to both the subjects of the other two sciences but if subtleties and sophisms composed the greater part of the metaphysics or pneumatics of the schools they composed the whole of this cobweb science of ontology which was likewise sometimes called metaphysics  wherein consisted the happiness and perfection of a man considered not only as an individual but as the member of a family of a state and of the great society of mankind was the object which the ancient moral philosophy proposed to investigate in that philosophy the duties of human life were treated of as subservient to the happiness and perfection of human life but when moral as well as natural philosophy came to be taught only as subservient to theology the duties of human life were treated of as chiefly subservient to the happiness of a life to come in the ancient philosophy the perfection of virtue was represented as necessarily productive to the person who possessed it of the most perfect happiness in this life in the modern philosophy it was frequently represented as generally or rather as almost always inconsistent with any degree of happiness in this life and heaven was to be earned only by penance and mortification by the austerities and abasement of a monk not by the liberal generous and spirited conduct of a man casuistry and an ascetic morality made up in most cases the greater part of the moral philosophy of the schools by far the most important of all the different branches of philosophy became in this manner by far the most corrupted  such therefore was the common course of philosophical education in the greater part of the universities of europe logic was taught first ontology came in the second place pneumatology comprehending the doctrine concerning the nature of the human soul and of the deity in the third in the fourth followed a debased system of moral philosophy which was considered as immediately connected with the doctrines of pneumatology with the immortality of the human soul and with the rewards and punishments which from the justice of the deity were to be expected in a life to come a short and superficial system of physics usually concluded the course  the alterations which the universities of europe thus introduced into the ancient course of philosophy were all meant for the education of ecclesiastics and to render it a more proper introduction to the study of theology but the additional quantity of subtlety and sophistry the casuistry and the ascetic morality which those alterations introduced into it certainly did not render it more proper for the education of gentlemen or men of the world or more likely either to improve the understanding or to mend the heart  this course of philosophy is what still continues to be taught in the greater part of the universities of europe with more or less diligence according as the constitution of each particular university happens to render diligence more or less necessary to the teachers in some of the richest and best endowed universities the tutors content themselves with teaching a few unconnected shreds and parcels of this corrupted course and even these they commonly teach very negligently and superficially  the improvements which in modern times have been made in several different branches of philosophy have not the greater part of them been made in universities though some no doubt have the greater part of universities have not even been very forward to adopt those improvements after they were made and several of those learned societies have chosen to remain for a long time the sanctuaries in which exploded systems and obsolete prejudices found shelter and protection after they had been hunted out of every other corner of the world in general the richest and best endowed universities have been the slowest in adopting those improvements and the most averse to permit any considerable change in the established plan of education those improvements were more easily introduced into some of the poorer universities in which the teachers depending upon their reputation for the greater part of their subsistence were obliged to pay more attention to the current opinions of the world  but though the public schools and universities of europe were originally intended only for the education of a particular profession that of churchmen and though they were not always very diligent in instructing their pupils even in the sciences which were supposed necessary for that profession yet they gradually drew to themselves the education of almost all other people particularly of almost all gentlemen and men of fortune no better method it seems could be fallen upon of spending with any advantage the long interval between infancy and that period of life at which men begin to apply in good earnest to the real business of the world the business which is to employ them during the remainder of their days the greater part of what is taught in schools and universities however does not seem to be the most proper preparation for that business  in england it becomes every day more and more the custom to send young people to travel in foreign countries immediately upon their leaving school and without sending them to any university our young people it is said generally return home much improved by their travels a young man who goes abroad at seventeen or eighteen and returns home at one and twenty returns three or four years older than he was when he went abroad and at that age it is very difficult not to improve a good deal in three or four years in the course of his travels he generally acquires some knowledge of one or two foreign languages a knowledge however which is seldom sufficient to enable him either to speak or write them with propriety in other respects he commonly returns home more conceited more unprincipled more dissipated and more incapable of any serious application either to study or to business than he could well have become in so short a time had he lived at home by traveling so very young by spending in the most frivolous dissipation the most precious years of his life at a distance from the inspection and control of his parents and relations every useful habit which the earlier parts of his education might have had some tendency to form in him instead of being rivetted and confirmed is almost necessarily either weakened or effaced nothing but the discredit into which the universities are allowing themselves to fall could ever have brought into repute so very absurd a practice as that of traveling at this early period of life by sending his son abroad a father delivers himself at least for some time from so disagreeable an object as that of a son unemployed neglected and going to ruin before his eyes  such have been the effects of some of the modern institutions for education  different plans and different institutions for education seem to have taken place in other ages and nations  in the republics of ancient greece every free citizen was instructed under the direction of the public magistrate in gymnastic exercises and in music by gymnastic exercises it was intended to harden his body to sharpen his courage and to prepare him for the fatigues and dangers of war and as the greek militia was by all accounts one of the best that ever was in the world this part of their public education must have answered completely the purpose for which it was intended by the other part music it was proposed at least by the philosophers and historians who have given us an account of those institutions to humanize the mind to soften the temper and to dispose it for performing all the social and moral duties both of public and private life  in ancient rome the exercises of the campus martius answered the same purpose as those of the gymnazium in ancient greece and they seem to have answered it equally well but among the romans there was nothing which corresponded to the musical education of the greeks the morals of the romans however both in private and public life seem to have been not only equal but upon the whole a good deal superior to those of the greeks that they were superior in private life we have the express testimony of polybius and of dionysius of halicarnassus two authors well acquainted with both nations and the whole tenor of the greek and roman history bears witness to the superiority of the public morals of the romans the good temper and moderation of contending factions seems to be the most essential circumstance in the public morals of a free people but the factions of the greeks were almost always violent and sanguinary whereas till the time of the gracchi no blood had ever been shed in any roman faction and from the time of the gracchi the roman republic may be considered as in reality dissolved notwithstanding therefore the very respectable authority of plato aristotle and polybius and notwithstanding the very ingenious reasons by which mr montesquieu endeavors to support that authority it seems probable that the musical education of the greeks had no great effect in mending their morals since without any such education those of the romans were upon the whole superior the respect of those ancient sages for the institutions of their ancestors had probably disposed them to find much political wisdom in what was perhaps merely an ancient custom continued without interruption from the earliest period of those societies to the times in which they had arrived at a considerable degree of refinement music and dancing are the great amusements of almost all barbarous nations and the great accomplishments which are supposed to fit any man for entertaining his society it is so at this day among the negroes on the coast of africa it was so among the ancient celtes among the ancient scandinavians and as we may learn from homer among the ancient greeks in the times preceding the trojan war when the greek tribes had formed themselves into little republics it was natural that the study of those accomplishments should for a long time make a part of the public and common education of the people  the masters who instructed the young people either in music or in military exercises do not seem to have been paid or even appointed by the state either in rome or even in athens the greek republic of whose laws and customs we are the best informed the state required that every free citizen should fit himself for defending it in war and should upon that account learn his military exercises but it left him to learn them of such masters as he could find and it seems to have advanced nothing for this purpose but a public field or place of exercise in which he should practice and perform them  in the early ages both of the greek and roman republics the other parts of education seem to have consisted in learning to read write and account according to the arithmetic of the times these accomplishments the richer citizens seem frequently to have acquired at home by the assistance of some domestic pedagogue who was generally either a slave or a freedman and the poorer citizens in the schools of such masters as made a trade of teaching for hire such parts of education however were abandoned altogether to the care of the parents or guardians of each individual it does not appear that the state ever assumed any inspection or direction of them by a law of solon indeed the children were acquitted from maintaining in their old age those parents who had neglected to instruct them in some profitable trade or business  in the progress of refinement when philosophy and rhetoric came into fashion the better sort of people used to send their children to the schools of philosophers and rhetoricians in order to be instructed in those fashionable sciences but those schools were not supported by the public they were for a long time barely tolerated by it the demand for philosophy and rhetoric was for a long time so small that the first professed teachers of either could not find constant employment in any one city but were obliged to travel about from place to place in this manner lived zeno of elea protagoras gorgias hippias and many others as the demand increased the schools both of philosophy and rhetoric became stationary first in athens and afterward in several other cities the state however seems never to have encouraged them further than by assigning to some of them a particular place to teach in which was sometimes done too by private donors the state seems to have assigned the academy to plato the lyceum to aristotle and the portico to zeno of citta the founder of the stoics but epicurus bequeathed his gardens to his own school till about the time of marcus antoninus however no teacher appears to have had any salary from the public or to have had any other emoluments but what arose from the honoraries or fees of his scholars the bounty which that philosophical emperor as we learn from lucian bestowed upon the teachers of philosophy probably lasted no longer than his own life there was nothing equivalent to the privileges of graduation and to have attended any of those schools was not necessary in order to be permitted to practice any particular trade or profession if the opinion of their own utility could not draw scholars to them the law neither forced any body to go to them nor rewarded any body for having gone to them the teachers had no jurisdiction over their pupils nor any other authority besides that natural authority which superior virtue and abilities never fail to procure from young people toward those who are entrusted with any part of their education  at rome the study of the civil law made a part of the education not of the greater part of the citizens but of some particular families the young people however who wished to acquire knowledge in the law had no public school to go to and had no other method of studying it than by frequenting the company of such of their relations and friends as were supposed to understand it it is perhaps worth while to remark that though the laws of the twelve tables were many of them copied from those of some ancient greek republics yet law never seems to have grown up to be a science in any republic of ancient greece in rome it became a science very early and gave a considerable degree of illustration to those citizens who had the reputation of understanding it in the republics of ancient greece particularly in athens the ordinary courts of justice consisted of numerous and therefore disorderly bodies of people who frequently decided almost at random or as clamor faction and party spirit happened to determine the ignominy of an unjust decision when it was to be divided among five hundred a thousand or fifteen hundred people for some of their courts were so very numerous could not fall very heavy upon any individual at rome on the contrary the principal courts of justice consisted either of a single judge or of a small number of judges whose characters especially as they deliberated always in public could not fail to be very much affected by any rash or unjust decision in doubtful cases such courts from their anxiety to avoid blame would naturally endeavor to shelter themselves under the example or precedent of the judges who had sat before them either in the same or in some other court this attention to practice and precedent necessarily formed the roman law into that regular and orderly system in which it has been delivered down to us and the like attention has had the like effects upon the laws of every other country where such attention has taken place the superiority of character in the romans over that of the greeks so much remarked by polybius and dionysius of halicarnassus was probably more owing to the better constitution of their courts of justice than to any of the circumstances to which those authors ascribe it the romans are said to have been particularly distinguished for their superior respect to an oath but the people who were accustomed to make oath only before some diligent and well informed court of justice would naturally be much more attentive to what they swore than they who were accustomed to do the same thing before mobbish and disorderly assemblies  the abilities both civil and military of the greeks and romans will readily be allowed to have been at least equal to those of any modern nation our prejudice is perhaps rather to overrate them but except in what related to military exercises the state seems to have been at no pains to form those great abilities for i cannot be induced to believe that the musical education of the greeks could be of much consequence in forming them masters however had been found it seems for instructing the better sort of people among those nations in every art and science in which the circumstances of their society rendered it necessary or convenient for them to be instructed the demand for such instruction produced what it always produces the talent for giving it and the emulation which an unrestrained competition never fails to excite appears to have brought that talent to a very high degree of perfection in the attention which the ancient philosophers excited in the empire which they acquired over the opinions and principles of their auditors in the faculty which they possessed of giving a certain tone and character to the conduct and conversation of those auditors they appear to have been much superior to any modern teachers in modern times the diligence of public teachers is more or less corrupted by the circumstances which render them more or less independent of their success and reputation in their particular professions their salaries too put the private teacher who would pretend to come into competition with them in the same state with a merchant who attempts to trade without a bounty in competition with those who trade with a considerable one if he sells his goods at nearly the same price he cannot have the same profit and poverty and beggary at least if not bankruptcy and ruin will infallibly be his lot if he attempts to sell them much dearer he is likely to have so few customers that his circumstances will not be much mended the privileges of graduation besides are in many countries necessary or at least extremely convenient to most men of learned professions that is to the far greater part of those who have occasion for a learned education but those privileges can be obtained only by attending the lectures of the public teachers the most careful attendance upon the ablest instructions of any private teacher cannot always give any title to demand them it is from these different causes that the private teacher of any of the sciences which are commonly taught in universities is in modern times generally considered as in the very lowest order of men of letters a man of real abilities can scarce find out a more humiliating or a more unprofitable employment to turn them to the endowments of schools and colleges have in this manner not only corrupted the diligence of public teachers but have rendered it almost impossible to have any good private ones  were there no public institutions for education no system no science would be taught for which there was not some demand or which the circumstances of the times did not render it either necessary or convenient or at least fashionable to learn a private teacher could never find his account in teaching either an exploded and antiquated system of a science acknowleged to be useful or a science universally believed to be a mere useless and pedantic heap of sophistry and nonsense such systems such sciences can subsist no where but in those incorporated societies for education whose prosperity and revenue are in a great measure independent of their reputation and altogether independent of their industry were there no public institutions for education a gentleman after going through with application and abilities the most complete course of education which the circumstances of the times were supposed to afford could not come into the world completely ignorant of every thing which is the common subject of conversation among gentlemen and men of the world  there are no public institutions for the education of women and there is accordingly nothing useless absurd or fantastical in the common course of their education they are taught what their parents or guardians judge it necessary or useful for them to learn and they are taught nothing else every part of their education tends evidently to some useful purpose either to improve the natural attractions of their person or to form their mind to reserve to modesty to chastity and to economy to render them both likely to become the mistresses of a family and to behave properly when they have become such in every part of her life a woman feels some convenience or advantage from every part of her education it seldom happens that a man in any part of his life derives any convenience or advantage from some of the most laborious and troublesome parts of his education  ought the public therefore to give no attention it may be asked to the education of the people or if it ought to give any what are the different parts of education which it ought to attend to in the different orders of the people and in what manner ought it to attend to them  in some cases the state of the society necessarily places the greater part of individuals in such situations as naturally form in them without any attention of government almost all the abilities and virtues which that state requires or perhaps can admit of in other cases the state of the society does not place the greater part of individuals in such situations and some attention of government is necessary in order to prevent the almost entire corruption and degeneracy of the great body of the people  in the progress of the division of labor the employment of the far greater part of those who live by labor that is of the great body of the people comes to be confined to a very few simple operations frequently to one or two but the understandings of the greater part of men are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments the man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations of which the effects too are perhaps always the same or very nearly the same has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur he naturally loses therefore the habit of such exertion and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become the torpor of his mind renders him not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation but of conceiving any generous noble or tender sentiment and consequently of forming any just judgment concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life of the great and extensive interests of his country he is altogether incapable of judging and unless very particular pains have been taken to render him otherwise he is equally incapable of defending his country in war the uniformity of his stationary life naturally corrupts the courage of his mind and makes him regard with abhorrence the irregular uncertain and adventurous life of a soldier it corrupts even the activity of his body and renders him incapable of exerting his strength with vigor and perseverance in any other employment than that to which he has been bred his dexterity at his own particular trade seems in this manner to be acquired at the expense of his intellectual social and martial virtues but in every improved and civilized society this is the state into which the laboring poor that is the great body of the people must necessarily fall unless government takes some pains to prevent it  it is otherwise in the barbarous societies as they are commonly called of hunters of shepherds and even of husbandmen in that rude state of husbandry which precedes the improvement of manufactures and the extension of foreign commerce in such societies the varied occupations of every man oblige every man to exert his capacity and to invent expedients for removing difficulties which are continually occurring invention is kept alive and the minds of men are not suffered to fall into that drowsy stupidity which in a civilized society seems to benumb the understanding of almost all the inferior ranks of people in those barbarous societies as they are called every man it has already been observed is a warrior every man too is in some measure a statesman and can form a tolerable judgment concerning the interest of the society and the conduct of those who govern it how far their chiefs are good judges in peace or good leaders in war is obvious to the observation of almost every single man among them in such a society indeed no man can well acquire that improved and refined understanding which a few men sometimes possess in a more civilized state though in a rude society there is a good deal of variety in the occupations of every individual there is not a great deal in those of the whole society every man does or is capable of doing almost every thing which any other man does or is capable of doing every man has a considerable degree of knowledge ingenuity and invention but scarce any man has a great degree the degree however which is commonly possessed is generally sufficient for conducting the whole simple business of the society in a civilized state on the contrary though there is little variety in the occupations of the greater part of individuals there is an almost infinite variety in those of the whole society these varied occupations present an almost infinite variety of objects to the contemplation of those few who being attached to no particular occupation themselves have leisure and inclination to examine the occupations of other people the contemplation of so great a variety of objects necessarily exercises their minds in endless comparisons and combinations and renders their understandings in an extraordinary degree both acute and comprehensive unless those few however happen to be placed in some very particular situations their great abilities though honorable to themselves may contribute very little to the good government or happiness of their society notwithstanding the great abilities of those few all the nobler parts of the human character may be in a great measure obliterated and extinguished in the great body of the people  the education of the common people requires perhaps in a civilized and commercial society the attention of the public more than that of people of some rank and fortune people of some rank and fortune are generally eighteen or nineteen years of age before they enter upon that particular business profession or trade by which they propose to distinguish themselves in the world they have before that full time to acquire or at least to fit themselves for afterward acquiring every accomplishment which can recommend them to the public esteem or render them worthy of it their parents or guardians are generally sufficiently anxious that they should be so accomplished and are in most cases willing enough to lay out the expense which is necessary for that purpose if they are not always properly educated it is seldom from the want of expense laid out upon their education but from the improper application of that expense it is seldom from the want of masters but from the negligence and incapacity of the masters who are to be had and from the difficulty or rather from the impossibility which there is in the present state of things of finding any better the employments too in which people of some rank or fortune spend the greater part of their lives are not like those of the common people simple and uniform they are almost all of them extremely complicated and such as exercise the head more than the hands the understandings of those who are engaged in such employments can seldom grow torpid from want of exercise the employments of people of some rank and fortune besides are seldom such as harrass them from morning to night they generally have a good deal of leisure during which they may perfect themselves in every branch either of useful or ornamental knowledge of which they may have laid the foundation or for which they may have acquired some taste in the earlier part of life  it is otherwise with the common people they have little time to spare for education their parents can scarce afford to maintain them even in infancy as soon as they are able to work they must apply to some trade by which they can earn their subsistence that trade too is generally so simple and uniform as to give little exercise to the understanding while at the same time their labor is both so constant and so severe that it leaves them little leisure and less inclination to apply to or even to think of any thing else  but though the common people cannot in any civilized society be so well instructed as people of some rank and fortune the most essential parts of education however to read write and account can be acquired at so early a period of life that the greater part even of those who are to be bred to the lowest occupations have time to acquire them before they can be employed in those occupations for a very small expense the public can facilitate can encourage and can even impose upon almost the whole body of the people the necessity of acquiring those most essential parts of education  the public can facilitate this acquisition by establishing in every parish or district a little school where children may be taught for a reward so moderate that even a common labourer may afford it the master being partly but not wholly paid by the public because if he was wholly or even principally paid by it he would soon learn to neglect his business in scotland the establishment of such parish schools has taught almost the whole common people to read and a very great proportion of them to write and account in england the establishment of charity schools has had an effect of the same kind though not so universally because the establishment is not so universal if in those little schools the books by which the children are taught to read were a little more instructive than they commonly are and if instead of the little smattering of latin which the children of the common people are sometimes taught there and which can scarce ever be of any use to them they were instructed in the elementary parts of geometry and mechanics the literary education of this rank of people would perhaps be as complete as it is capable of being there is scarce a common trade which does not afford some opportunities of applying to it the principles of geometry and mechanics and which would not therefore gradually exercise and improve the common people in those principles the necessary introduction to the most sublime as well as to the most useful sciences  the public can encourage the acquisition of those most essential parts of education by giving small premiums and little badges of distinction to the children of the common people who excel in them  the public can impose upon almost the whole body of the people the necessity of acquiring those most essential parts of education by obliging every man to undergo an examination or probation in them before he can obtain the freedom in any corporation or be allowed to set up any trade either in a village or town corporate  it was in this manner by facilitating the acquisition of their military and gymnastic exercises by encouraging it and even by imposing upon the whole body of the people the necessity of learning those exercises that the greek and roman republics maintained the martial spirit of their respective citizens they facilitated the acquisition of those exercises by appointing a certain place for learning and practicing them and by granting to certain masters the privilege of teaching in that place those masters do not appear to have had either salaries or exclusive privileges of any kind their reward consisted altogether in what they got from their scholars and a citizen who had learnt his exercises in the public gymnasia had no sort of legal advantage over one who had learnt them privately provided the latter had learnt them equally well those republics encouraged the acquisition of those exercises by bestowing little premiums and badges of distinction upon those who excelled in them to have gained a prize in the olympic isthmian or nemaean games gave illustration not only to the person who gained it but to his whole family and kindred the obligation which every citizen was under to serve a certain number of years if called upon in the armies of the republic sufficiently imposed the necessity of learning those exercises without which he could not be fit for that service  that in the progress of improvement the practice of military exercises unless government takes proper pains to support it goes gradually to decay and together with it the martial spirit of the great body of the people the example of modern europe sufficiently demonstrates but the security of every society must always depend more or less upon the martial spirit of the great body of the people in the present times indeed that martial spirit alone and unsupported by a well disciplined standing army would not perhaps be sufficient for the defense and security of any society but where every citizen had the spirit of a soldier a smaller standing army would surely be requisite that spirit besides would necessarily diminish very much the dangers to liberty whether real or imaginary which are commonly apprehended from a standing army as it would very much facilitate the operations of that army against a foreign invader so it would obstruct them as much if unfortunately they should ever be directed against the constitution of the state  the ancient institutions of greece and rome seem to have been much more effectual for maintaining the martial spirit of the great body of the people than the establishment of what are called the militias of modern times they were much more simple when they were once established they executed themselves and it required little or no attention from government to maintain them in the most perfect vigor whereas to maintain even in tolerable execution the complex regulations of any modern militia requires the continual and painful attention of government without which they are constantly falling into total neglect and disuse the influence besides of the ancient institutions was much more universal by means of them the whole body of the people was completely instructed in the use of arms whereas it is but a very small part of them who can ever be so instructed by the regulations of any modern militia except perhaps that of switzerland but a coward a man incapable either of defending or of revenging himself evidently wants one of the most essential parts of the character of a man he is as much mutilated and deformed in his mind as another is in his body who is either deprived of some of its most essential members or has lost the use of those members he is evidently the more wretched and miserable of the two because happiness and misery which reside altogether in the mind must necessarily depend more upon the healthful or unhealthful the mutilated or entire state of the mind than upon that of the body even though the martial spirit of the people were of no use toward the defense of the society yet to prevent that sort of mental mutilation deformity and wretchedness which cowardice necessarily involves in it from spreading themselves through the great body of the people would still deserve the most serious attention of government in the same manner as it would deserve its most serious attention to prevent a leprosy or any other loathsome and offensive disease though neither mortal nor dangerous from spreading itself among them though perhaps no other public good might result from such attention besides the prevention of so great a public evil  the same thing may be said of the gross ignorance and stupidity which in a civilized society seem so frequently to benumb the understandings of all the inferior ranks of people a man without the proper use of the intellectual faculties of a man is if possible more contemptible than even a coward and seems to be mutilated and deformed in a still more essential part of the character of human nature though the state was to derive no advantage from the instruction of the inferior ranks of people it would still deserve its attention that they should not be altogether uninstructed the state however derives no inconsiderable advantage from their instruction the more they are instructed the less liable they are to the delusions of enthusiasm and superstition which among ignorant nations frequently occasion the most dreadful disorders an instructed and intelligent people besides are always more decent and orderly than an ignorant and stupid one they feel themselves each individually more respectable and more likely to obtain the respect of their lawful superiors and they are therefore more disposed to respect those superiors they are more disposed to examine and more capable of seeing through the interested complaints of faction and sedition and they are upon that account less apt to be misled into any wanton or unnecessary opposition to the measures of government in free countries where the safety of government depends very much upon the favorable judgment which the people may form of its conduct it must surely be of the highest importance that they should not be disposed to judge rashly or capriciously concerning it  article iii of the expense of the institutions for the instruction of people of all ages the institutions for the instruction of people of all ages are chiefly those for religious instruction this is a species of instruction of which the object is not so much to render the people good citizens in this world as to prepare them for another and a better world in a life to come the teachers of the doctrine which contains this instruction in the same manner as other teachers may either depend altogether for their subsistence upon the voluntary contributions of their hearers or they may derive it from some other fund to which the law of their country may entitle them such as a landed estate a tithe or land tax an established salary or stipend their exertion their zeal and industry are likely to be much greater in the former situation than in the latter in this respect the teachers of new religions have always had a considerable advantage in attacking those ancient and established systems of which the clergy reposing themselves upon their benefices had neglected to keep up the fervor of faith and devotion in the great body of the people and having given themselves up to indolence were become altogether incapable of making any vigorous exertion in defense even of their own establishment the clergy of an established and well endowed religion frequently become men of learning and elegance who possess all the virtues of gentlemen or which can recommend them to the esteem of gentlemen but they are apt gradually to lose the qualities both good and bad which gave them authority and influence with the inferior ranks of people and which had perhaps been the original causes of the success and establishment of their religion such a clergy when attacked by a set of popular and bold though perhaps stupid and ignorant enthusiasts feel themselves as perfectly defenseless as the indolent effeminate and fullfed nations of the southern parts of asia when they were invaded by the active hardy and hungry tartars of the north such a clergy upon such an emergency have commonly no other resource than to call upon the civil magistrate to persecute destroy or drive out their adversaries as disturbers of the public peace it was thus that the roman catholic clergy called upon the civil magistrate to persecute the protestants and the church of england to persecute the dissenters and that in general every religious sect when it has once enjoyed for a century or two the security of a legal establishment has found itself incapable of making any vigorous defense against any new sect which chose to attack its doctrine or discipline upon such occasions the advantage in point of learning and good writing may sometimes be on the side of the established church but the arts of popularity all the arts of gaining proselytes are constantly on the side of its adversaries in england those arts have been long neglected by the wellendowed clergy of the established church and are at present chiefly culitvated by the dissenters and by the methodists the independent provisions however which in many places have been made for dissenting teachers by means of voluntary subscriptions of trustrights and other evasions of the law seem very much to have abated the zeal and activity of those teachers they have many of them become very learned ingenious and respectable men but they have in general ceased to be very popular preachers the methodists without half the learning of the dissenters are much more in vogue  in the church of rome the industry and zeal of the inferior clergy is kept more alive by the powerful motive of selfinterest than perhaps in any established protestant church the parochial clergy derive many of them a very considerable part of their subsistence from the voluntary oblations of the people a source of revenue which confession gives them many opportunities of improving the mendicant orders derive their whole subsistence from such oblations it is with them as with the hussars and light infantry of some armies no plunder no pay the parochial clergy are like those teachers whose reward depends partly upon their salary and partly upon the fees or honoraries which they get from their pupils and these must always depend more or less upon their industry and reputation the mendicant orders are like those teachers whose subsistence depends altogether upon their industry they are obliged therefore to use every art which can animate the devotion of the common people the establishment of the two great mendicant orders of st dominick and st francis it is observed by machiavel revived in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the languishing faith and devotion of the catholic church in roman catholic countries the spirit of devotion is supported altogether by the monks and by the poorer parochial clergy the great dignitaries of the church with all the accomplishments of gentlemen and men of the world and sometimes with those of men of learning are careful enough to maintain the necessary discipline over their inferiors but seldom give themselves any trouble about the instruction of the people  most of the arts and professions in a state says by far the most illustrious philosopher and historian of the present age are of such a nature that while they promote the interests of the society they are also useful or agreeable to some individuals and in that case the constant rule of the magistrate except perhaps on the first introduction of any art is to leave the profession to itself and trust its encouragement to the individuals who reap the benefit of it the artizans finding their profits to rise by the favor of their customers increase as much as possible their skill and industry and as matters are not disturbed by any injudicious tampering the commodity is always sure to be at all times nearly proportioned to the demand but there are also some callings which though useful and even necessary in a state bring no advantage or pleasure to any individual and the supreme power is obliged to alter its conduct with regard to the retainers of those professions it must give them public encouragement in order to their subsistence and it must provide against that negligence to which they will naturally be subject either by annexing particular honors to the profession by establishing a long subordination of ranks and a strict dependence or by some other expedient the persons employed in the finances fleets and magistracy are instances of this order of men  it may naturally be thought at first sight that the ecclesiastics belong to the first class and that their encouragement as well as that of lawyers and physicians may safely be entrusted to the liberality of individuals who are attached to their doctrines and who find benefit or consolation from their spiritual ministry and assistance their industry and vigilance will no doubt be whetted by such an additional motive and their skill in the profession as well as their address in governing the minds of the people must receive daily increase from their increasing practice study and attention  but if we consider the matter more closely we shall find that this interested diligence of the clergy is what every wise legislator will study to prevent because in every religion except the true it is highly pernicious and it has even a natural tendency to pervert the true by infusing into it a strong mixture of superstition folly and delusion each ghostly practitioner in order to render himself more precious and sacred in the eyes of his retainers will inspire them with the most violent abhorrence of all other sects and continually endeavor by some novelty to excite the languid devotion of his audience no regard will be paid to truth morals or decency in the doctrines inculcated every tenet will be adopted that best suits the disorderly affections of the human frame customers will be drawn to each conventicle by new industry and address in practicing on the passions and credulity of the populace and in the end the civil magistrate will find that he has dearly paid for his pretended frugality in saving a fixed establishment for the priests and that in reality the most decent and advantageous composition which he can make with the spiritual guides is to bribe their indolence by assigning stated salaries to their profession and rendering it superfluous for them to be farther active than merely to prevent their flock from straying in quest of new pastures and in this manner ecclesiastical establishments though commonly they arose at first from religious views prove in the end advantageous to the political interests of society    but whatever may have been the good or bad effects of the independent provision of the clergy it has perhaps been very seldom bestowed upon them from any view to those effects times of violent religious controversy have generally been times of equally violent political faction upon such occasions each political party has either found it or imagined it for its interest to league itself with some one or other of the contending religious sects but this could be done only by adopting or at least by favoring the tenets of that particular sect the sect which had the good fortune to be leagued with the conquering party necessarily shared in the victory of its ally by whose favor and protection it was soon enabled in some degree to silence and subdue all its adversaries those adversaries had generally leagued themselves with the enemies of the conquering party and were therefore the enemies of that party the clergy of this particular sect having thus become complete masters of the field and their influence and authority with the great body of the people being in its highest vigor they were powerful enough to overawe the chiefs and leaders of their own party and to oblige the civil magistrate to respect their opinions and inclinations their first demand was generally that he should silence and subdue all their adversaries and their second that he should bestow an independent provision on themselves as they had generally contributed a good deal to the victory it seemed not unreasonable that they should have some share in the spoil they were weary besides of humouring the people and of depending upon their caprice for a subsistence in making this demand therefore they consulted their own case and comfort without troubling themselves about the effect which it might have in future times upon the influence and authority of their order the civil magistrate who could comply with this demand only by giving them something which he would have chosen much rather to take or to keep to himself was seldom very forward to grant it necessity however always forced him to submit at last though frequently not till after many delays evasions and affected excuses  but if politics had never called in the aid of religion had the conquering party never adopted the tenets of one sect more than those of another when it had gained the victory it would probably have dealt equally and impartially with all the different sects and have allowed every man to choose his own priest and his own religion as he thought proper there would in this case no doubt have been a great multitude of religious sects almost every different congregation might probably have made a little sect by itself or have entertained some peculiar tenets of its own each teacher would no doubt have felt himself under the necessity of making the utmost exertion and of using every art both to preserve and to increase the number of his disciples but as every other teacher would have felt himself under the same necessity the success of no one teacher or sect of teachers could have been very great the interested and active zeal of religious teachers can be dangerous and troublesome only where there is either but one sect tolerated in the society or where the whole of a large society is divided into two or three great sects the teachers of each sect acting by concert and under a regular discipline and subordination but that zeal must be altogether innocent where the society is divided into two or three hundred or perhaps into as many thousand small sects of which no one could be considerable enough to disturb the public tranquillity the teachers of each sect seeing themselves surrounded on all sides with more adversaries than friends would be obliged to learn that candor and moderation which is so seldom to be found among the teachers of those great sects whose tenets being supported by the civil magistrate are held in veneration by almost all the inhabitants of extensive kingdoms and empires and who therefore see nothing round them but followers disciples and humble admirers the teachers of each little sect finding themselves almost alone would be obliged to respect those of almost every other sect and the concessions which they would mutually find it both convenient and agreeable to make to one another might in time probably reduce the doctrine of the greater part of them to that pure and rational religion freefrom every mixture of absurdity imposture or fanaticism such as wise men have in all ages of the world wished to see established but such as positive law has perhaps never yet established and probably never will establish in any country because with regard to religion positive law always has been and probably always will be more or less influenced by popular superstition and enthusiasm this plan of ecclesiastical government or more properly of no ecclesiastical government was what the sect called independents a sect no doubt of very wild enthusiasts proposed to establish in england toward the end of the civil war if it had been established though of a very unphilosophical origin it would probably by this time have been productive of the most philosophical good temper and moderation with regard to every sort of religious principle it has been established in pensylvania where though the quakers happen to be the most numerous sect the law in reality favors no one sect more than another and it is there said to have been productive of this philosophical good temper and moderation  but though this equality of treatment should not be productive of this good temper and moderation in all or even in the greater part of the religious sects of a particular country yet provided those sects were sufficiently numerous and each of them consequently too small to disturb the public tranquillity the excessive zeal of each sect for its particular tenets could not well be productive of any very hurtful effects but on the contrary of several good ones and if the government was perfectly decided both to let them all alone and to oblige them all to let alone one another there is little danger that they would not of their own accord subdivide themselves fast enough so as soon to become sufficiently numerous  in every civilized society in every society where the distinction or ranks has once been completely established there have been always two different schemes or systems of morality current at the same time of which the one may be called the strict or austere the other the liberal or if you will the loose system the former is generally admired and revered by the common people the latter is commonly more esteemed and adopted by what are called people of fashion the degree of disapprobation with which we ought to mark the vices of levity the vices which are apt to arise from great prosperity and from the excess of gaiety and good humor seems to constitute the principal distinction between those two opposite schemes or systems in the liberal or loose system luxury wanton and even disorderly mirth the pursuit of pleasure to some degree of intemperance the breach of chastity at least in one of the two sexes etc provided they are not accompanied with gross indecency and do not lead to falsehood or injustice are generally treated with a good deal of indulgence and are easily either excused or pardoned altogether in the austere system on the contrary those excesses are regarded with the utmost abhorrence and detestation the vices of levity are always ruinous to the common people and a single weeks thoughtlesness and dissipation is often sufficient to undo a poor workman for ever and to drive him through despair upon committing the most enormous crimes the wiser and better sort of the common people therefore have always the utmost abhorrence and detestation of such excesses which their experience tells them are so immediately fatal to people of their condition the disorder and extravagance of several years on the contrary will not always ruin a man of fashion and people of that rank are very apt to consider the power of indulging in some degree of excess as one of the advantages of their fortune and the liberty of doing so without censure or reproach as one of the privileges which belong to their station in people of their own station therefore they regard such excesses with but a small degree of disapprobation and censure them either very slightly or not at all  almost all religious sects have begun among the common people from whom they have generally drawn their earliest as well as their most numerous proselytes the austere system of morality has accordingly been adopted by those sects almost constantly or with very few exceptions for there have been some it was the system by which they could best recommend themselves to that order of people to whom they first proposed their plan of reformation upon what had been before established many of them perhaps the greater part of them have even endeavored to gain credit by refining upon this austere system and by carrying it to some degree of folly and extravagance and this excessive rigor has frequently recommended them more than any thing else to the respect and veneration of the common people  a man of rank and fortune is by his station the distinguished member of a great society who attend to every part of his conduct and who thereby oblige him to attend to every part of it himself his authority and consideration depend very much upon the respect which this society bears to him he dare not do any thing which would disgrace or discredit him in it and he is obliged to a very strict observation of that species of morals whether liberal or austere which the general consent of this society prescribes to persons of his rank and fortune a man of low condition on the contrary is far from being a distinguished member of any great society while he remains in a country village his conduct may be attended to and he may be obliged to attend to it himself in this situation and in this situation only he may have what is called a character to lose but as soon as he comes into a great city he is sunk in obscurity and darkness his conduct is observed and attended to by nobody and he is therefore very likely to neglect it himself and to abandon himself to every sort of low profligacy and vice he never emerges so effectually from this obscurity his conduct never excites so much the attention of any respectable society as by his becoming the member of a small religious sect he from that moment acquires a degree of consideration which he never had before all his brother sectaries are for the credit of the sect interested to observe his conduct and if he gives occasion to any scandal if he deviates very much from those austere morals which they almost always require of one another to punish him by what is always a very severe punishment even where no civil effects attend it expulsion or excommunication from the sect in little religious sects accordingly the morals of the common people have been almost always remarkably regular and orderly generally much more so than in the established church the morals of those little sects indeed have frequently been rather disagreeably rigorous and unsocial  there are two very easy and effectual remedies however by whose joint operation the state might without violence correct whatever was unsocial or disagreeably rigorous in the morals of all the little sects into which the country was divided  the first of those remedies is the study of science and philosophy which the state might render almost universal among all people of middling or more than middling rank and fortune not by giving salaries to teachers in order to make them negligent and idle but by instituting some sort of probation even in the higher and more difficult sciences to be undergone by every person before he was permitted to exercise any liberal profession or before he could be received as a candidate for any honorable office of trust or profit if the state imposed upon this order of men the necessity of learning it would have no occasion to give itself any trouble about providing them with proper teachers they would soon find better teachers for themselves than any whom the state could provide for them science is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition and where all the superior ranks of people were secured from it the inferior ranks could not be much exposed to it  the second of those remedies is the frequency and gaiety of public diversions the state by encouraging that is by giving entire liberty to all those who for their own interest would attempt without scandal or indecency to amuse and divert the people by painting poetry music dancing by all sorts of dramatic representations and exhibitions would easily dissipate in the greater part of them that melancholy and gloomy humor which is almost always the nurse of popular superstition and enthusiasm public diversions have always been the objects of dread and hatred to all the fanatical promoters of those popular frenzies the gaiety and good humor which those diversions inspire were altogether inconsistent with that temper of mind which was fittest for their purpose or which they could best work upon dramatic representations besides frequently exposing their artifices to public ridicule and sometimes even to public execration were upon that account more than all other diversions the objects of their peculiar abhorrence  in a country where the law favored the teachers of no one religion more than those of another it would not be necessary that any of them should have any particular or immediate dependency upon the sovereign or executive power or that he should have any thing to do either in appointing or in dismissing them from their offices in such a situation he would have no occasion to give himself any concern about them further than to keep the peace among them in the same manner as among the rest of his subjects that is to hinder them from persecuting abusing or oppressing one another but it is quite otherwise in countries where there is an established or governing religion the sovereign can in this case never be secure unless he has the means of influencing in a considerable degree the greater part of the teachers of that religion  the clergy of every established church constitute a great incorporation they can act in concert and pursue their interest upon one plan and with one spirit as much as if they were under the direction of one man and they are frequently too under such direction their interest as an incorporated body is never the same with that of the sovereign and is sometimes directly opposite to it their great interest is to maintain their authority with the people and this authority depends upon the supposed certainty and importance of the whole doctrine which they inculcate and upon the supposed necessity of adopting every part of it with the most implicit faith in order to avoid eternal misery should the sovereign have the imprudence to appear either to deride or doubt himself of the most trifling part of their doctrine or from humanity attempt to protect those who did either the one or the other the punctilious honor of a clergy who have no sort of dependency upon him is immediately provoked to proscribe him as a profane person and to employ all the terrors of religion in order to oblige the people to transfer their allegiance to some more orthodox and obedient prince should he oppose any of their pretensions or usurpations the danger is equally great the princes who have dared in this manner to rebel against the church over and above this crime of rebellion have generally been charged too with the additional crime of heresy notwithstanding their solemn protestations of their faith and humble submission to every tenet which she thought proper to prescribe to them but the authority of religion is superior to every other authority the fears which it suggests conquer all other fears when the authorized teachers of religion propagate through the great body of the people doctrines subversive of the authority of the sovereign it is by violence only or by the force of a standing army that he can maintain his authority even a standing army cannot in this case give him any lasting security because if the soldiers are not foreigners which can seldom be the case but drawn from the great body of the people which must almost always be the case they are likely to be soon corrupted by those very doctrines the revolutions which the turbulence of the greek clergy was continually occasioning at constantinople as long as the eastern empire subsisted the convulsions which during the course of several centuries the turbulence of the roman clergy was continually occasioning in every part of europe sufficiently demonstrate how precarious and insecure must always be the situation of the sovereign who has no proper means of influencing the clergy of the established and governing religion of his country  articles of faith as well as all other spiritual matters it is evident enough are not within the proper department of a temporal sovereign who though he may be very well qualified for protecting is seldom supposed to be so for instructing the people with regard to such matters therefore his authority can seldom be sufficient to counterbalance the united authority of the clergy of the established church the public tranquillity however and his own security may frequently depend upon the doctrines which they may think proper to propagate concerning such matters as he can seldom directly oppose their decision therefore with proper weight and authority it is necessary that he should be able to influence it and he can influence it only by the fears and expectations which he may excite in the greater part of the individuals of the order those fears and expectations may consist in the fear of deprivation or other punishment and in the expectation of further preferment  in all christian churches the benefices of the clergy are a sort of freeholds which they enjoy not during pleasure but during life or good behavior if they held them by a more precarious tenure and were liable to be turned out upon every slight disobligation either of the sovereign or of his ministers it would perhaps be impossible for them to maintain their authority with the people who would then consider them as mercenary dependants upon the court in the sincerity of whose instructions they could no longer have any confidence but should the sovereign attempt irregularly and by violence to deprive any number of clergymen of their freeholds on account perhaps of their having propagated with more than ordinary zeal some factious or seditious doctrine he would only render by such persecution both them and their doctrine ten times more popular and therefore ten times more troublesome and dangerous than they had been before fear is in almost all cases a wretched instrument of government and ought in particular never to be employed against any order of men who have the smallest pretensions to independency to attempt to terrify them serves only to irritate their bad humor and to confirm them in an opposition which more gentle usage perhaps might easily induce them either to soften or to lay aside altogether the violence which the french government usually employed in order to oblige all their parliaments or sovereign courts of justice to enregister any unpopular edict very seldom succeeded the means commonly employed however the imprisonment of all the refractory members one would think were forcible enough the princes of the house of steuart sometimes employed the like means in order to influence some of the members of the parliament of england and they generally found them equally intractable the parliament of england is now managed in another manner and a very small experiment which the duke of choiseul made about twelve years ago upon the parliament of paris demonstrated sufficiently that all the parliaments of france might have been managed still more easily in the same manner that experiment was not pursued for though management and persuasion are always the easiest and the safest instruments of government as force and violence are the worst and the most dangerous yet such it seems is the natural insolence of man that he almost always disdains to use the good instrument except when he cannot or dare not use the bad one the french government could and durst use force and therefore disdained to use management and persuasion but there is no order of men it appears i believe from the experience of all ages upon whom it is so dangerous or rather so perfectly ruinous to employ force and violence as upon the respected clergy of any established church the rights the privileges the personal liberty of every individual ecclesiastic who is upon good terms with his own order are even in the most despotic governments more respected than those of any other person of nearly equal rank and fortune it is so in every gradation of despotism from that of the gentle and mild government of paris to that of the violent and furious government of constantinople but though this order of men can scarce ever be forced they may be managed as easily as any other and the security of the sovereign as well as of the public tranquillity seems to depend very much upon the means which he has of managing them and those means seem to consist altogether in the preferment which he has to bestow upon them  in the ancient constitution of the roman catholic church the bishop of each diocese was elected by the joint votes of the clergy and of the people of the episcopal city the people did not long retain their right of election and while they did retain it they almost always acted under the influence of the clergy who in such spiritual matters appeared to be their natural guides the clergy however soon grew weary of the trouble of managing them and found it easier to elect their own bishops themselves the abbot in the same manner was elected by the monks of the monastery at least in the greater part of abbacies all the inferior ecclesiastical benefices comprehended within the diocese were collated by the bishop who bestowed them upon such ecclesiastics as he thought proper all church preferments were in this manner in the disposal of the church the sovereign though he might have some indirect influence in those elections and though it was sometimes usual to ask both his consent to elect and his approbation of the election yet had no direct or sufficient means of managing the clergy the ambition of every clergyman naturally led him to pay court not so much to his sovereign as to his own order from which only he could expect preferment  through the greater part of europe the pope gradually drew to himself first the collation of almost all bishoprics and abbacies or of what were called consistorial benefices and afterward by various machinations and pretenses of the greater part of inferior benefices comprehended within each diocese little more being left to the bishop than what was barely necessary to give him a decent authority with his own clergy by this arrangement the condition of the sovereign was still worse than it had been before the clergy of all the different countries of europe were thus formed into a sort of spiritual army dispersed in different quarters indeed but of which all the movements and operations could now be directed by one head and conducted upon one uniform plan the clergy of each particular country might be considered as a particular detachment of that army of which the operations could easily be supported and seconded by all the other detachments quartered in the different countries round about each detachment was not only independent of the sovereign of the country in which it was quartered and by which it was maintained but dependant upon a foreign sovereign who could at any time turn its arms against the sovereign of that particular country and support them by the arms of all the other detachments  those arms were the most formidable that can well be imagined in the ancient state of europe before the establishment of arts and manufactures the wealth of the clergy gave them the same sort of influence over the common people which that of the great barons gave them over their respective vassals tenants and retainers in the great landed estates which the mistaken piety both of princes and private persons had bestowed upon the church jurisdictions were established of the same kind with those of the great barons and for the same reason in those great landed estates the clergy or their bailiffs could easily keep the peace without the support or assistance either of the king or of any other person and neither the king nor any other person could keep the peace there without the support and assistance of the clergy the jurisdictions of the clergy therefore in their particular baronies or manors were equally independent and equally exclusive of the authority of the kings courts as those of the great temporal lords the tenants of the clergy were like those of the great barons almost all tenants at will entirely dependent upon their immediate lords and therefore liable to be called out at pleasure in order to fight in any quarrel in which the clergy might think proper to engage them over and above the rents of those estates the clergy possessed in the tithes a very large portion of the rents of all the other estates in every kingdom of europe the revenues arising from both those species of rents were the greater part of them paid in kind in corn wine cattle poultry etc the quantity exceeded greatly what the clergy could themselves consume and there were neither arts nor manufactures for the produce of which they could exchange the surplus the clergy could derive advantage from this immense surplus in no other way than by employing it as the great barons employed the like surplus of their revenues in the most profuse hospitality and in the most extensive charity both the hospitality and the charity of the ancient clergy accordingly are said to have been very great they not only maintained almost the whole poor of every kingdom but many knights and gentlemen had frequently no other means of subsistence than by traveling about from monastery to monastery under pretense of devotion but in reality to enjoy the hospitality of the clergy the retainers of some particular prelates were often as numerous as those of the greatest laylords and the retainers of all the clergy taken together were perhaps more numerous than those of all the laylords there was always much more union among the clergy than among the laylords the former were under a regular discipline and subordination to the papal authority the latter were under no regular discipline or subordination but almost always equally jealous of one another and of the king though the tenants and retainers of the clergy therefore had both together been less numerous than those of the great laylords and their tenants were probably much less numerous yet their union would have rendered them more formidable the hospitality and charity of the clergy too not only gave them the command of a great temporal force but increased very much the weight of their spiritual weapons those virtues procured them the highest respect and veneration among all the inferior ranks of people of whom many were constantly and almost all occasionally fed by them every thing belonging or related to so popular an order its possessions its privileges its doctrines necessarily appeared sacred in the eyes of the common people and every violation of them whether real or pretended the highest act of sacrilegious wickedness and profaneness in this state of things if the sovereign frequently found it difficult to resist the confederacy of a few of the great nobility we cannot wonder that he should find it still more so to resist the united force of the clergy of his own dominions supported by that of the clergy of all the neighboring dominions in such circumstances the wonder is not that he was sometimes obliged to yield but that he ever was able to resist  the privileges of the clergy in those ancient times which to us who live in the present times appear the most absurd their total exemption from the secular jurisdiction for example or what in england was called the benefit of clergy were the natural or rather the necessary consequences of this state of things how dangerous must it have been for the sovereign to attempt to punish a clergyman for any crime whatever if his own order were disposed to protect him and to represent either the proof as insufficient for convicting so holy a man or the punishment as too severe to be inflicted upon one whose person had been rendered sacred by religion the sovereign could in such circumstances do no better than leave him to be tried by the ecclesiastical courts who for the honor of their own order were interested to restrain as much as possible every member of it from committing enormous crimes or even from giving occasion to such gross scandal as might disgust the minds of the people  in the state in which things were through the greater part of europe during the tenth eleventh twelfth and thirteenth centuries and for some time both before and after that period the constitution of the church of rome may be considered as the most formidable combination that ever was formed against the authority and security of civil government as well as against the liberty reason and happiness of mankind which can flourish only where civil government is able to protect them in that constitution the grossest delusions of superstition were supported in such a manner by the private interests of so great a number of people as put them out of all danger from any assault of human reason because though human reason might perhaps have been able to unveil even to the eyes of the common people some of the delusions of superstition it could never have dissolved the ties of private interest had this constitution been attacked by no other enemies but the feeble efforts of human reason it must have endured forever but that immense and well built fabric which all the wisdom and virtue of man could never have shaken much less have overturned was by the natural course of things first weakened afterward in part destroyed and is now likely in the course of a few centuries more perhaps to crumble into ruins altogether  the gradual improvements of arts manufactures and commerce the same causes which destroyed the power of the great barons destroyed in the same manner through the greater part of europe the whole temporal power of the clergy in the produce of arts manufactures and commerce the clergy like the great barons found something for which they could exchange their rude produce and thereby discovered the means of spending their whole revenues upon their own persons without giving any considerable share of them to other people their charity became gradually less extensive their hospitality less liberal or less profuse their retainers became consequently less numerous and by degrees dwindled away altogether the clergy too like the great barons wished to get a better rent from their landed estates in order to spend it in the same manner upon the gratification of their own private vanity and folly but this increase of rent could be got only by granting leases to their tenants who thereby became in a great measure independent of them the ties of interest which bound the inferior ranks of people to the clergy were in this manner gradually broken and dissolved they were even broken and dissolved sooner than those which bound the same ranks of people to the great barons because the benefices of the church being the greater part of them much smaller than the estates of the great barons the possessor of each benefice was much sooner able to spend the whole of its revenue upon his own person during the greater part of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the power of the great barons was through the greater part of europe in full vigor but the temporal power of the clergy the absolute command which they had once had over the great body of the people was very much decayed the power of the church was by that time very nearly reduced through the greater part of europe to what arose from her spiritual authority and even that spiritual authority was much weakened when it ceased to be supported by the charity and hospitality of the clergy the inferior ranks of people no longer looked upon that order as they had done before as the comforters of their distress and the relievers of their indigence on the contrary they were provoked and disgusted by the vanity luxury and expense of the richer clergy who appeared to spend upon their own pleasures what had always before been regarded as the patrimony of the poor  in this situation of things the sovereigns in the different states of europe endeavored to recover the influence which they had once had in the disposal of the great benefices of the church by procuring to the deans and chapters of each diocese the restoration of their ancient right of electing the bishop and to the monks of each abbacy that of electing the abbot the reestablishing of this ancient order was the object of several statutes enacted in england during the course of the fourteenth century and of the pragmatic sanction established in france in the fifteenth century in order to render the election valid it was necessary that the sovereign should both consent to it beforehand and afterward approve of the person elected and though the election was still supposed to be free he had however all the indirect means which his situation necessarily afforded him of influencing the clergy in his own dominions other regulations of a similar tendency were established in other parts of europe but the power of the pope in the collation of the great benefices of the church seems before the reformation to have been no where so effectually and so universally restrained as in france and england the concordat afterward in the sixteenth century gave to the kings of france the absolute right of presenting to all the great and consistorial benefices of the gallican church  since the establishment of the pragmatic sanction and of the concordat the clergy of france have in general shown less respect to the decrees of the papal court than the clergy of any other catholic country in all the disputes which their sovereign has had with the pope they have almost constantly taken party with the former this independency of the clergy of france upon the court of rome seems to be principally founded upon the pragmatic sanction and the concordat in the earlier periods of the monarchy the clergy of france appear to have been as much devoted to the pope as those of any other country when robert the second prince of the capetian race was most unjustly excommunicated by the court of rome his own servants it is said threw the victuals which came from his table to the dogs and refused to taste any thing themselves which had been polluted by the contact of a person in his situation they were taught to do so it may very safely be prefumed by the clergy of his own dominions  the claim of collatinig to the great benefices of the church a claim in defense of which the court of rome had frequently shaken and sometimes overturned the thrones of some of the greatest sovereigns in christendom was in this manner either restrained or modified or given up altogether in many different parts of europe even before the time of the reformation as the clergy had now less influence over the people so the state had more influence over the clergy the clergy therefore had both less power and less inclination to disturb the state  the authority of the church of rome was in this state of declension when the disputes which gave birth to the reformation began in germany and soon spread themselves through every part of europe the new doctrines were every where received with a high degree of popular favor they were propagated with all that enthusiastic zeal which commonly animates the spirit of party when it attacks established authority the teachers of those doctrines though perhaps in other respects not more learned than many of the divines who defended the established church seem in general to have been better acquainted with ecclesiastical history and with the origin and progress of that system of opinions upon which the authority of the church was established and they had thereby some advantage in almost every dispute the austerity of their manners gave them authority with the common people who contrasted the strict regularity of their conduct with the disorderly lives of the greater part of their own clergy they possessed too in a much higher degree than their adversaries all the arts of popularity and of gaining proselytes arts which the lofty and dignified sons of the church had long neglected as being to them in a great measure useless the reason of the new doctrines recommended them to some their novelty to many the hatred and contempt of the established clergy to a still greater number but the zealous passionate and fanatical though frequently coarse and rustic eloquence with which they were almost every where inculcated recommended them to by far the greatest number  the success of the new doctrines was almost every where so great that the princes who at that time happened to be on bad terms with the court of rome were by means of them easily enabled in their own dominions to overturn the church which having lost the respect and veneration of the inferior ranks of people could make scarce any resistance the court of rome had disobliged some of the smaller princes in the northern parts of germany whom it had probably considered as too insignificant to be worth the managing they universally therefore established the reformation in their own dominions the tyranny of christiern ii and of troll archbishop of upsal enabled gustavus vasa to expel them both from sweden the pope favored the tyrant and the archbishop and gustavus vasa found no difficulty in establishing the reformation in sweden christiern ii was afterward deposed from the throne of denmark where his conduct had rendered him as odious as in sweden the pope however was still disposed to favor him and frederic of holstein who had mounted the throne in his stead revenged himself by following the example of gustavus vasa the magistrates of berne and zurich who had no particular quarrel with the pope established with great ease the reformation in their respective cantons where just before some of the clergy had by an imposture somewhat grosser than ordinary rendered the whole order both odious and contemptible  in this critical situation of its affairs the papal court was at sufficient pains to cultivate the friendship of the powerful sovereigns of france and spain of whom the latter was at that time emperor of germany with their assistance it was enabled though not without great difficulty and much bloodshed either to suppress altogether or to obstruct very much the progress of the reformation in their dominions it was well enough inclined too to be complaisant to the king of england but from the circumstances of the times it could not be so without giving offense to a still greater sovereign charles v king of spain and emperor of germany henry viii accordingly though he did not embrace himself the greater part of the doctrines of the reformation was yet enabled by the general prevalence of those doctrines to suppress all the monasteries and to abolish the authority of the church of rome in his dominions that he should go so far though he went no further gave some satisfaction to the patrons of the reformation who having got possession of the government in the reign of his son and successor completed without any difficulty the work which henry viii had begun  in some countries as in scotland where the government was weak unpopular and not very firmly established the reformation was strong enough to overturn not only the church but the state likewise for attempting to support the church  among the followers of the reformation dispersed in all the different countries of europe there was no general tribunal which like that of the court of rome or an ecumenical council could settle all disputes among them and with irresistible authority prescribe to all of them the precise limits of orthodoxy when the followers of the reformation in one country therefore happened to differ from their brethren in another as they had no common judge to appeal to the dispute could never be decided and many such disputes arose among them those concerning the government of the church and the right of conferring ecclesiastical benefices were perhaps the most interesting to the peace and welfare of civil society they gave birth accordingly to the two principal parties or sects among the followers of the reformation the lutheran and calvinistic sects the only sects among them of which the doctrine and discipline have ever yet been established by law in any part of europe  the followers of luther together with what is called the church of england preserved more or less of the episcopal government established subordination among the clergy gave the sovereign the disposal of all the bishoprics and other consistorial benefices within his dominions and thereby rendered him the real head of the church and without depriving the bishop of the right of collating to the smaller benefices within his diocese they even to those benefices not only admitted but favored the right of presentation both in the sovereign and in all other laypatrons this system of church government was from the beginning favorable to peace and good order and to submission to the civil sovereign it has never accordingly been the occasion of any tumult or civil commotion in any country in which it has once been established the church of england in particular has always valued herself with great reason upon the unexceptionable loyalty of her principles under such a government the clergy naturally endeavor to recommend themselves to the sovereign to the court and to the nobility and gentry of the country by whose influence they chiefly expect to obtain preferment they pay court to those patrons sometimes no doubt by the vilest flattery and assentation but frequently too by cultivating all those arts which best deserve and which are therefore most likely to gain them the esteem of people of rank and fortune by their knowledge in all the different branches of useful and ornamental learning by the decent liberality of their manners by the social good humor of their conversation and by their avowed contempt of those absurd and hypocritical austerities which fanatics inculcate and pretend to practice in order to draw upon themselves the veneration and upon the greater part of men of rank and fortune who avow that they do not practice them the abhorrence of the common people such a clergy however while they pay their court in this manner to the higher ranks of life are very apt to neglect altogether the means of maintaining their influence and authority with the lower they are listened to esteemed and respected by their superiors but before their inferiors they are frequently incapable of defending effectually and to the conviction of such hearers their own sober and moderate doctrines against the most ignorant enthusiast who chooses to attack them  the followers of zuinglius or more properly those of calvin on the contrary bestowed upon the people of each parish whenever the church became vacant the right of electing their own pastor and established at the same time the most perfect equality among the clergy the former part of this institution as long as it remained in vigor seems to have been productive of nothing but disorder and confusion and to have tended equally to corrupt the morals both of the clergy and of the people the latter part seems never to have had any effects but what were perfectly agreeable  as long as the people of each parish preserved the right of electing their own pastors they acted almost always under the influence of the clergy and generally of the most factious and fanatical of the order the clergy in order to preserve their influence in those popular elections became or affected to become many of them fanatics themselves encouraged fanaticism among the people and gave the preference almost always to the most fanatical candidate so small a matter as the appointment of a parish priest occasioned almost always a violent contest not only in one parish but in all the neighboring parishes who seldom failed to take party in the quarrel when the parish happened to be situated in a great city it divided all the inhabitants into two parties and when that city happened either to constitute itself a little republic or to be the head and capital of a little republic as is the case with many of the considerable cities in switzerland and holland every paltry dispute of this kind over and above exasperating the animosity of all their other factions threatened to leave behind it both a new schism in the church and a new faction in the state in those small republics therefore the magistrate very soon found it necessary for the sake of preserving the public peace to assume to himself the right of presenting to all vacant benefices in scotland the most extensive country in which this presbyterian form of church government has ever been established the rights of patronage were in effect abolished by the act which established presbytery in the beginning of the reign of william iii that act at least put it in the power of certain classes of people in each parish to purchase for a very small price the right of electing their own pastor the constitution which this act established was allowed to subsist for about two and twenty years but was abolished by the  0th of queen ann chapter    on account of the confusions and disorders which this more popular mode of election had almost every where occasioned in so extensive a country as scotland however a tumult in a remote parish was not so likely to give disturbance to government as in a smaller state the  0th of queen ann restored the rights of patronage but though in scotland the law gives the benefice without any exception to the person presented by the patron yet the church requires sometimes for she has not in this respect been very uniform in her decisions a certain concurrence of the people before she will confer upon the presentee what is called the cure of souls or the ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the parish she sometimes at least from an affected concern for the peace of the parish delays the settlement till this concurrence can be procured the private tampering of some of the neighboring clergy sometimes to procure but more frequently to prevent this concurrence and the popular arts which they cultivate in order to enable them upon such occasions to tamper more effectually are perhaps the causes which principally keep up whatever remains of the old fanatical spirit either in the clergy or in the people of scotland  the equality which the presbyterian form of church government establishes among the clergy consists first in the equality of authority or ecclesiastical jurisdiction and secondly in the equality of benefice in all presbyterian churches the equality of authority is perfect that of benefice is not so the difference however between one benefice and another is seldom so considerable as commonly to tempt the possessor even of the small benefice to pay court to his patron by the vile arts of flattery and assentation in order to get a better in all the presbyterian churches where the rights of patronage are thoroughly established it is by nobler and better arts that the established clergy in general endeavor to gain the favor of their superiors by their learning by the irreproachable regularity of their life and by the faithful and diligent discharge of their duty their patrons even frequently complain of the independency of their spirit which they are apt to construe into ingratitude for past favors but which at worst perhaps is seldom any more than that indifference which naturally arises from the consciousness that no further favors of the kind are ever to be expected there is scarce perhaps to be found any where in europe a more learned decent independent and respectable set of men than the greater part of the presbyterian clergy of holland geneva switzerland and scotland  where the church benefices are all nearly equal none of them can be very great and this mediocrity of benefice though it may no doubt be carried too far has however some very agreeable effects nothing but the most exemplary morals can give dignity to a man of small fortune the vices of levity and vanity necessarily render him ridiculous and are besides almost as ruinous to him as they are to the common people in his own conduct therefore he is obliged to follow that system of morals which the common people respect the most he gains their esteem and affection by that plan of life which his own interest and situation would lead him to follow the common people look upon him with that kindness with which we naturally regard one who approaches somewhat to our own condition but who we think ought to be in a higher their kindness naturally provokes his kindness he becomes careful to instruct them and attentive to assist and relieve them he does not even despise the prejudices of people who are disposed to be so favorable to him and never treats them with those contemptuous and arrogant airs which we so often meet with in the proud dignitaries of opulent and wellendowed churches the presbyterian clergy accordingly have more influence over the minds of the common people than perhaps the clergy of any other established church it is accordingly in presbyterian countries only that we ever find the common people converted without persecution completely and almost to a man to the established church  in countries where church benefices are the greater part of them very moderate a chair in a university is generally a better establishment than a church benefice the universities have in this case the picking and choosing of their members from all the churchmen of the country who in every country constitute by far the most numerous class of men of letters where church benefices on the contrary are many of them very considerable the church naturally draws from the universities the greater part of their eminent men of letters who generally find some patron who does himself honor by procuring them church preferment in the former situation we are likely to find the universities filled with the most eminent men of letters that are to be found in the country in the latter we are likely to find few eminent men among them and those few among the youngest members of the society who are likely too to be drained away from it before they can have acquired experience and knowledge enough to be of much use to it it is observed by mr de voltaire that father porree a jesuit of no great eminence in the republic of letters was the only professor they had ever had in france whose works were worth the reading in a country which has produced so many eminent men of letters it must appear somewhat singular that scarce one of them should have been a professor in a university the famous gassendi was in the beginning of his life a professor in the university of aix upon the first dawning of his genius it was represented to him that by going into the church he could easily find a much more quiet and comfortable subsistence as well as a better situation for pursuing his studies and he immediately followed the advice the observation of mr de voltaire may be applied i believe not only to france but to all other roman catholic countries we very rarely find in any of them an eminent man of letters who is a professor in a university except perhaps in the professions of law and physic professions from which the church is not so likely to draw them after the church of rome that of england is by far the richest and best endowed church in christendom in england accordingly the church is continually draining the universities of all their best and ablest members and an old college tutor who is known and distinguished in europe as an eminent man of letters is as rarely to be found there as in any roman catholic country in geneva on the contrary in the protestant cantons of switzerland in the protestant countries of germany in holland in scotland in sweden and denmark the most eminent men of letters whom those countries have produced have not all indeed but the far greater part of them been professors in universities in those countries the universities are continually draining the church of all its most eminent men of letters  it may perhaps be worth while to remark that if we except the poets a few orators and a few historians the far greater part of the other eminent men of letters both of greece and rome appear to have been either public or private teachers generally either of philosophy or of rhetoric this remark will be found to hold true from the days of lysias and isocrates of plato and aristotle down to those of plutarch and epictetus of suetonius and quintilian several of those whom we do not know with certainty to have been public teachers appear to have been private tutors polybius we know was private tutor to scipio aemilianus dionysius of halicarnassus there are some probable reasons for believing was so to the children of marcus and quintus cicero to impose upon any man the necessity of teaching year after year any particular branch of science seems in reality to be the most effectual method for rendering him completely master of it himself by being obliged to go every year over the same ground if he is good for any thing he necessarily becomes in a few years well acquainted with every part of it and if upon any particular point he should form too hasty an opinion one year when he comes in the course of his lectures to reconsider the same subject the year thereafter he is very likely to correct it as to be a teacher of science is certainly the natural employment of a mere man of letters so is it likewise perhaps the education which is most likely to render him a man of solid learning and knowledge the mediocrity of church benefices naturally tends to draw the greater part of men of letters in the country where it takes place to the employment in which they can be the most useful to the public and at the same time to give them the best education perhaps they are capable of receiving it tends to render their learning both as solid as possible and as useful as possible  the revenue of every established church such parts of it excepted as may arise from particular lands or manors is a branch it ought to be observed of the general revenue of the state which is thus diverted to a purpose very different from the defense of the state the tithe for example is a real land tax which puts it out of the power of the proprietors of land to contribute so largely toward the defense of the state as they otherwise might be able to do the rent of land however is according to some the sole fund and according to others the principal fund from which in all great monarchies the exigencies of the state must be ultimately supplied the more of this fund that is given to the church the less it is evident can be spared to the state it may be laid down as a certain maxim that all other things being supposed equal the richer the church the poorer must necessarily be either the sovereign on the one hand or the people on the other and in all cases the less able must the state be to defend itself in several protestant countries particularly in all the protestant cantons of switzerland the revenue which anciently belonged to the roman catholic church the tithes and church lands has been found a fund sufficient not only to afford competent salaries to the established clergy but to defray with little or no addition all the other expenses of the state the magistrates of the powerful canton of berne in particular have accumulated out of the savings from this fund a very large sum supposed to amount to several millions part of which is deposited in a public treasure and part is placed at interest in what are called the public funds of the different indebted nations of europe chiefly in those of france and great britain what may be the amount of the whole expense which the church either of berne or of any other protestant canton costs the state i do not pretend to know by a very exact account it appears that in      the whole revenue of the clergy of the church of scotland including their glebe or church lands and the rent of their manses or dwelling houses estimated according to a reasonable valuation amounted only to         s  d     this very moderate revenue affords a decent subsistence to nine hundred and fortyfour ministers the whole expense of the church including what is occasionally laid out for the building and reparation of churches and of the manses of ministers cannot well be supposed to exceed eighty or eightyfive thousand pounds a year the most opulent church in christendom does not maintain better the uniformity of faith the fervor of devotion the spirit of order regularity and austere morals in the great body of the people than this very poorly endowed church of scotland all the good effects both civil and religious which an established church can be supposed to produce are produced by it as completely as by any other the greater part of the protestant churches of switzerland which in general are not better endowed than the church of scotland produce those effects in a still higher degree in the greater part of the protestant cantons there is not a single person to be found who does not prosess himself to be of the established church if he professes himself to be of any other indeed the law obliges him to leave the canton but so severe or rather indeed so oppressive a law could never have been executed in such free countries had not the diligence of the clergy beforehand converted to the established church the whole body of the people with the exception of perhaps a few individuals only in some parts of switzerland accordingly where from the accidental union of a protestant and roman catholic country the conversion has not been so complete both religions are not only tolerated but established by law  the proper performance of every service seems to require that its pay or recompense should be as exactly as possible proportioned to the nature of the service if any service is very much underpaid it is very apt to suffer by the meanness and incapacity of the greater part of those who are employed in it if it is very much overpaid it is apt to suffer perhaps still more by their negligence and idleness a man of a large revenue whatever may to his profession thinks he ought to live like other men of large revenues and to spend a great part of his time in festivity in vanity and in dissipation but in a clergyman this train of life not only consumes the time which ought to be employed in the duties of his function but in the eyes of the common people destroys almost entirely that sanctity of character which can alone enable him to perform those duties with proper weight and authority  part iv of the expense of supporting the dignity of the sovereign over and above the expense necessary for enabling the sovereign to perform his several duties a certain expense is requisite for the support of his dignity this expense varies both with the different periods of improvement and with the different forms of government  in an opulent and improved society where all the different orders of people are growing every day more expensive in their houses in their furniture in their tables in their dress and in their equipage it cannot well be expected that the sovereign should alone hold out against the fashion he naturally therefore or rather necessarily becomes more expensive in all those different articles too his dignity even seems to require that he should become so  as in point of dignity a monarch is more raised above his subjects than the chief magistrate of any republic is ever supposed to be above his fellow citizens so a greater expense is necessary for supporting that higher dignity we naturally expect more splendour in the court of a king than in the mansion house of a doge or burgomaster  conclusion the expense of defending the society and that of supporting the dignity of the chief magistrate are both laid out for the general benefit of the whole society it is reasonable therefore that they should be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society all the different members contributing as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities  the expense of the administration of justice too may no doubt be considered as laid out for the benefit of the whole society there is no impropriety therefore in its being defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society the persons however who give occasion to this expense are those who by their injustice in one way or another make it necessary to seek redress or protection from the courts of justice the persons again most immediately benefited by this expense are those whom the courts of justice either restore to their rights or maintain in their rights the expense of the administration of justice therefore may very properly be defrayed by the particular contribution of one or other or both of those two different sets of persons according as different occasions may require that is by the fees of court it cannot be necessary to have recourse to the general contribution of the whole society except for the conviction of those criminals who have not themselves any estate or fund sufficient for paying those fees  those local or provincial expenses of which the benefit is local or provincial what is laid out for example upon the police of a particular town or district ought to be defrayed by a local or provincial revenue and ought to be no burden upon the general revenue of the society it is unjust that the whole society should contribute toward an expense of which the benefit is confined to a part of the society  the expense of maintaining good roads and communications is no doubt beneficial to the whole society and may therefore without any injustice be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society this expense however is most immediately and directly beneficial to those who travel or carry goods from one place to another and to those who consume such goods the turnpike tolls in england and the duties called peages in other countries lay it altogether upon those two different setts of people and thereby discharge the general revenue of the society from a very considerable burden  the expense of the institutions for education and religious instruction is likewise no doubt beneficial to the whole society and may therefore without injustice be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society this expense however might perhaps with equal propriety and even with some advantage be defrayed altogether by those who receive the immediate benefit of such education and instruction or by the voluntary contribution of those who think they have occasion for either the one or the other  when the institutions or public works which are beneficial to the whole society either cannot be maintained altogether or are not maintained altogether by the contribution of such particular members of the society as are most immediately benefited by them the deficiency must in most cases be made up by the general contribution of the whole society the general revenue of the society over and above defraying the expense of defending the society and of supporting the dignity of the chief magistrate must make up for the deficiency of many particular branches of revenue the sources of this general or public revenue i shall endeavor to explain in the following chapter  chap ii of the sources of the general or public revenue of the society the revenue which must defray not only the expense of defending the society and of supporting the dignity of the chief magistrate but all the other necessary expenses of government for which the constitution of the state has not provided any particular revenue may be drawn either first from some fund which peculiarly belongs to the sovereign or commonwealth and which is independent of the revenue of the people or secondly from the revenue of the people  part i of the funds or sources of revenue which may peculiarly belong to the sovereign or commonwealth the funds or sources of revenue which may peculiarly belong to the sovereign or commonwealth must consist either in stock or in land  the sovereign like any other owner of stock may derive a revenue from it either by employing it himself or by lending it his revenue is in the one case profit in the other interest  the revenue of a tartar or arabian chief consists in profit it arises principally from the milk and increase of his own herds and flocks of which he himself superintends the management and is the principal shepherd or herdsman of his own horde or tribe it is however in this earliest and rudest state of civil government only that profit has ever made the principal part of the public revenue of a monarchical state  small republics have sometimes derived a considerable revenue from the profit of mercantile projects the republic of hamburgh is said to do so from the profits of a public wine cellar and apothecaries shop see memoires concernant les droits and impositions en europe tome   page    this work was compiled by the order of the court for the use of a commission employed for some years past in considering the proper means for reforming the finances of france the account of the french taxes which takes up three volumes in quarto may be regarded as perfectly authentic that of those of other european nations was compiled from such informations as the french ministers at the different courts could procure it is much shorter and probably not quite so exact as that of the french taxes  the state cannot be very great of which the sovereign has leisure to carry on the trade of a wine merchant or apothecary the profit of a public bank has been a source of revenue to more considerable states it has been so not only to hamburgh but to venice and amsterdam a revenue of this kind has even by some people been thought not below the attention of so great an empire as that of great britain reckoning the ordinary dividend of the bank of england at five and a half per cent and its capital at ten millions seven hundred and eighty thousand pounds the neat annual profit after paying the expense of management must amount it is said to five hundred and ninetytwo thousand nine hundred pounds government it is pretended could borrow this capital at three per cent interest and by taking the management of the bank into its own hands might make a clear profit of two hundred and sixtynine thousand five hundred pounds a year the orderly vigilant and parsimonious administration of such aristocracies as those of venice and amsterdam is extremely proper it appears from experience for the management of a mercantile project of this kind but whether such a government as that of england which whatever may be its virtues has never been famous for good economy which in time of peace has generally conducted itself with the slothful and negligent profusion that is perhaps natural to monarchies and in time of war has constantly acted with all the thoughtless extravagance that democracies are apt to fall into could be safely trusted with the management of such a project must at least be a good deal more doubtful  the post office is properly a mercantile project the government advances the expense of establishing the different offices and of buying or hiring the necessary horses or carriages and is repaid with a large profit by the duties upon what is carried it is perhaps the only mercantile project which has been successfully managed by i believe every sort of government the capital to be advanced is not very considerable there is no mystery in the business the returns are not only certain but immediate  princes however have frequently engaged in many other mercantile projects and have been willing like private persons to mend their fortunes by becoming adventurers in the common branches of trade they have scarce ever succeeded the profusion with which the affairs of princes are always managed renders it almost impossible that they should the agents of a prince regard the wealth of their master as inexhaustible are careless at what price they buy are careless at what price they sell are careless at what expense they transport his goods from one place to another those agents frequently live with the profusion of princes and sometimes too in spite of that profusion and by a proper method of making up their accounts acquire the fortunes of princes it was thus as we are told by machiavel that the agents of lorenzo of medicis not a prince of mean abilities carried on his trade the republic of florence was several times obliged to pay the debt into which their extravagance had involved him he found it convenient accordingly to give up the business of merchant the business to which his family had originally owed their fortune and in the latter part of his life to employ both what remained of that fortune and the revenue of the state of which he had the disposal in projects and expenses more suitable to his station  no two characters seem more inconsistent than those of trader and sovereign if the trading spirit of the english east india company renders them very bad sovereigns the spirit of sovereignty seems to have rendered them equally bad traders while they were traders only they managed their trade successfully and were able to pay from their profits a moderate dividend to the proprietors of their stock since they became sovereigns with a revenue which it is said was originally more than three millions sterling they have been obliged to beg the extraordinary assistance of government in order to avoid immediate bankruptcy in their former situation their servants in india considered themselves as the clerks of merchants in their present situation those servants consider themselves as the ministers of sovereigns  a state may sometimes derive some part of its public revenue from the interest of money as well as from the profits of stock if it has amassed a treasure it may lend a part of that treasure either to foreign states or to its own subjects  the canton of berne derives a considerable revenue by lending a part of its treasure to foreign states that is by placing it in the public funds of the different indebted nations of europe chiefly in those of france and england the security of this revenue must depend first upon the security of the funds in which it is placed or upon the good faith of the government which has the management of them and secondly upon the certainty or probability of the continuance of peace with the debtor nation in the case of a war the very first act of hostility on the part of the debtor nation might be the forfeiture of the funds of its creditor this policy of lending money to foreign states is so far as i know peculiar to the canton of berne  the city of hamburgh see id ibid has established a sort of public pawnshop which lends money to the subjects of the state upon pledges at six per cent interest this pawnshop or lombard as it is called affords a revenue it is pretended to the state of a hundred and fifty thousand crowns which at four and sixpence the crown amounts to     0 l sterling  the government of pensylvania without amassing any treasure invented a method of lending not money indeed but what is equivalent to money to its subjects by advancing to private people at interest and upon land security to double the value paper bills of credit to be redeemed fifteen years after their date and in the mean time made transferable from hand to hand like bank notes and declared by act of assembly to be a legal tender in all payments from one inhabitant of the province to another it raised a moderate revenue which went a considerable way toward defraying an annual expense of about   00 l the whole ordinary expense of that frugal and orderly government the success of an expedient of this kind must have depended upon three different circumstances first upon the demand for some other instrument of commerce besides gold and silver money or upon the demand for such a quantity of consumable stock as could not be had without sending abroad the greater part of their gold and silver money in order to purchase it secondly upon the good credit of the government which made use of this expedient and thirdly upon the moderation with which it was used the whole value of the paper bills of credit never exceeding that of the gold and silver money which would have been necessary for carrying on their circulation had there been no paper bills of credit the same expedient was upon different occasions adopted by several other american colonies but from want of this moderation it produced in the greater part of them much more disorder than convenience  the unstable and perishable nature of stock and credit however render them unfit to be trusted to as the principal funds of that sure steady and permanent revenue which can alone give security and dignity to government the government of no great nation that was advanced beyond the shepherd state seems ever to have derived the greater part of its public revenue from such sources  land is a fund of a more stable and permanent nature and the rent of public lands accordingly has been the principal source of the public revenue of many a great nation that was much advanced beyond the shepherd state from the produce or rent of the public lands the ancient republics of greece and italy derived for a long time the greater part of that revenue which defrayed the necessary expenses of the commonwealth the rent of the crown lands constituted for a long time the greater part of the revenue of the ancient sovereigns of europe  war and the preparation for war are the two circumstances which in modern times occasion the greater part of the necessary expense of all great states but in the ancient republics of greece and italy every citizen was a soldier who both served and prepared himself for service at his own expense neither of those two circumstances therefore could occasion any very considerable expense to the state the rent of a very moderate landed estate might be fully sufficient for defraying all the other necessary expenses of government  in the ancient monarchies of europe the manners and customs of the times sufficiently prepared the great body of the people for war and when they took the field they were by the condition of their feudal tenures to be maintained either at their own expense or at that of their immediate lords without bringing any new charge upon the sovereign the other expenses of government were the greater part of them very moderate the administration of justice it has been shown instead of being a cause of expense was a source of revenue the labor of the country people for three days before and for three days after harvest was thought a fund sufficient for making and maintaining all the bridges highways and other public works which the commerce of the country was supposed to require in those days the principal expense of the sovereign seems to have consisted in the maintenance of his own family and household the officers of his household accordingly were then the great officers of state the lord treasurer received his rents the lord steward and lord chamberlain looked after the expense of his family the care of his stables was committed to the lord constable and the lord marshal his houses were all built in the form of castles and seem to have been the principal fortresses which he possessed the keepers of those houses or castles might be considered as a sort of military governors they seem to have been the only military officers whom it was necessary to maintain in time of peace in these circumstances the rent of a great landed estate might upon ordinary occasions very well defray all the necessary expenses of government  in the present state of the greater part of the civilized monarchies of europe the rent of all the lands in the country managed as they probably would be if they all belonged to one proprietor would scarce perhaps amount to the ordinary revenue which they levy upon the people even in peaceable times the ordinary revenue of great britain for example including not only what is necessary for defraying the current expense of the year but for paying the interest of the public debts and for sinking a part of the capital of those debts amounts to upwards of ten millions a year but the land tax at four shillings in the pound falls short of two millions a year this land tax as it is called however is supposed to be onefifth not only of the rent of all the land but of that of all the houses and of the interest of all the capital stock of great britain that part of it only excepted which is either lent to the public or employed as farming stock in the cultivation of land a very considerable part of the produce of this tax arises from the rent of houses and the interest of capital stock the land tax of the city of london for example at four shillings in the pound amounts to        l  s  d that of the city of westminster to   0   l  s  d that of the palaces of whitehall and st jamess to  0    l  s  d a certain proportion of the land tax is in the same manner assessed upon all the other cities and towns corporate in the kingdom and arises almost altogether either from the rent of houses or from what is supposed to be the interest of trading and capital stock according to the estimation therefore by which great britain is rated to the land tax the whole mass of revenue arising from the rent of all the lands from that of all the houses and from the interest of all the capital stock that part of it only excepted which is either lent to the public or employed in the cultivation of land does not exceed ten millions sterling a year the ordinary revenue which government levies upon the people even in peaceable times the estimation by which great britain is rated to the land tax is no doubt taking the whole kingdom at an average very much below the real value though in several particular counties and districts it is said to be nearly equal to that value the rent of the lands alone exclusive of that of houses and of the interest of stock has by many people been estimated at twenty millions an estimation made in a great measure at random and which i apprehend is as likely to be above as below the truth but if the lands of great britain in the present state of their cultivation do not afford a rent of more than twenty millions a year they could not well afford the half most probably not the fourth part of that rent if they all belonged to a single proprietor and were put under the negligent expensive and oppressive management of his factors and agents the crown lands of great britain do not at present afford the fourth part of the rent which could probably be drawn from them if they were the property of private persons if the crown lands were more extensive it is probable they would be still worse managed  the revenue which the great body of the people derives from land is in proportion not to the rent but to the produce of the land the whole annual produce of the land of every country if we except what is reserved for seed is either annually consumed by the great body of the people or exchanged for something else that is consumed by them whatever keeps down the produce of the land below what it would otherwise rise to keeps down the revenue of the great body of the people still more than it does that of the proprietors of land the rent of land that portion of the produce which belongs to the proprietors is scarce any where in great britain supposed to be more than a third part of the whole produce if the land which in one state of cultivation affords a rent of ten millions sterling a year would in another afford a rent of twenty millions the rent being in both cases supposed a third part of the produce the revenue of the proprietors would be less than it otherwise might be by ten millions a year only but the revenue of the great body of the people would be less than it otherwise might be by thirty millions a year deducting only what would be necessary for seed the population of the country would be less by the number of people which thirty millions a year deducting always the seed could maintain according to the particular mode of living and expense which might take place in the different ranks of men among whom the remainder was distributed  though there is not at present in europe any civilized state of any kind which derives the greater part of its public revenue from the rent of lands which are the property of the state yet in all the great monarchies of europe there are still many large tracts of land which belong to the crown they are generally forest and sometimes forest where after traveling several miles you will scarce find a single tree a mere waste and loss of country in respect both of produce and population in every great monarchy of europe the sale of the crown lands would produce a very large sum of money which if applied to the payment of the public debts would deliver from mortgage a much greater revenue than any which those lands have ever afforded to the crown in countries where lands improved and cultivated very highly and yielding at the time of sale as great a rent as can easily be got from them commonly sell at thirty years purchase the unimproved uncultivated and lowrented crown lands might well be expected to sell at forty fifty or sixty years purchase the crown might immediately enjoy the revenue which this great price would redeem from mortgage in the course of a few years it would probably enjoy another revenue when the crown lands had become private property they would in the course of a few years become wellimproved and wellcultivated the increase of their produce would increase the population of the country by augmenting the revenue and consumption of the people but the revenue which the crown derives from the duties of customs and excise would necessarily increase with the revenue and consumption of the people  the revenue which in any civilized monarchy the crown derives from the crown lands though it appears to cost nothing to individuals in reality costs more to the society than perhaps any other equal revenue which the crown enjoys it would in all cases be for the interest of the society to replace this revenue to the crown by some other equal revenue and to divide the lands among the people which could not well be done better perhaps than by exposing them to public sale  lands for the purposes of pleasure and magnificence parks gardens public walks etc possessions which are every where considered as causes of expense not as sources of revenue seem to be the only lands which in a great and civilized monarchy ought to belong to the crown  public stock and public lands therefore the two sources of revenue which may peculiarly belong to the sovereign or commonwealth being both improper and insufficient funds for defraying the necessary expense of any great and civilized state it remains that this expense must the greater part of it be defrayed by taxes of one kind or another the people contributing a part of their own private revenue in order to make up a public revenue to the sovereign or commonwealth  part ii of taxes the private revenue of individuals it has been shown in the first book of this inquiry arises ultimately from three different sources rent profit and wages every tax must finally be paid from some one or other of those three different sorts of revenue or from all of them indifferently i shall endeavor to give the best account i can first of those taxes which it is intended should fall upon rent secondly of those which it is intended should fall upon profit thirdly of those which it is intended should fall upon wages and fourthly of those which it is intended should fall indifferently upon all those three different sources of private revenue the particular consideration of each of these four different sorts of taxes will divide the second part of the present chapter into four articles three of which will require several other subdivisions many of those taxes it will appear from the following review are not finally paid from the fund or source of revenue upon which it was intended they should fall  before i enter upon the examination of particular taxes it is necessary to premise the four following maxims with regard to taxes in general  i the subjects of every state ought to contribute toward the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state the expense of government to the individuals of a great nation is like the expense of management to the joint tenants of a great estate who are all obliged to contribute in proportion to their respective interests in the estate in the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what is called the equality or inequality of taxation every tax it must be observed once for all which falls finally upon one only of the three sorts of revenue abovementioned is necessarily unequal in so far as it does not affect the other two in the following examination of different taxes i shall seldom take much further notice of this sort of inequality but shall in most cases confine my observations to that inequality which is oceasioned by a particular tax falling unequally even upon that particular sort of private revenue which is affected by it  ii the tax which each individual is bound to pay ought to be certain and not arbitrary the time of payment the manner of payment the quantity to be paid ought all to be clear and plain to the contributor and to every other person where it is otherwise every person subject to the tax is put more or less in the power of the taxgatherer who can either aggravate the tax upon any obnoxious contributor or extort by the terror of such aggravation some present or perquisite to himself the uncertainty of taxation encourages the insolence and favors the corruption of an order of men who are naturally unpopular even where they are neither insolent nor corrupt the certainty of what each individual ought to pay is in taxation a matter of so great importance that a very considerable degree of inequality it appears i believe from the experience of all nations is not near so great an evil as a very small degree of uncertainty  iii every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner in which it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it a tax upon the rent of land or of houses payable at the same term at which such rents are usually paid is levied at the time when it is most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay or when he is most likely to have wherewithal to pay taxes upon such consumable goods as are articles of luxury are all finally paid by the consumer and generally in a manner that is very convenient for him he pays them by little and little as he has occasion to buy the goods as he is at liberty too either to buy or not to buy as he pleases it must be his own fault if he ever suffers any considerable inconveniency from such taxes  iv every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and above what it brings into the public treasury of the state a tax may either take out or keep out of the pockets of the people a great deal more than it brings into the public treasury in the four following ways first the levying of it may require a great number of officers whose salaries may eat up the greater part of the produce of the tax and whose perquisites may impose another additional tax upon the people secondly it may obstruct the industry of the people and discourage them from applying to certain branches of business which might give maintenance and employment to great multitudes while it obliges the people to pay it may thus diminish or perhaps destroy some of the funds which might enable them more easily to do so thirdly by the forfeitures and other penalties which those unfortunate individuals incur who attempt unsuccessfully to evade the tax it may frequently ruin them and thereby put an end to the benefit which the community might have received from the employment of their capitals an injudicious tax offers a great temptation to smuggling but the penalties of smuggling must rise in proportion to the temptation the law contrary to all the ordinary principles of justice first creates the temptation and then punishes those who yield to it and it commonly enhances the punishment too in proportion to the very circumstance which ought certainly to alleviate it the temptation to commit the crime see sketches of the history of man page     and seq  fourthly by subjecting the people to the frequent visits and the odious examination of the taxgatherers it may expose them to much unnecessary trouble vexation and oppression and though vexation is not strictly speaking expense it is certainly equivalent to the expense at which every man would be willing to redeem himself from it it is in some one or other of these four different ways that taxes are frequently so much more burdensome to the people than they are beneficial to the sovereign  the evident justice and utility of the foregoing maxims have recommended them more or less to the attention of all nations all nations have endeavored to the best of their judgment to render their taxes as equal as certain as convenient to the contributor both in the time and in the mode of payment and in proportion to the revenue which they brought to the prince as little burdensome to the people as they could contrive the following short review of some of the principal taxes which have taken place in different ages and countries will show that the endeavors of all nations have not in this respect been equally successful  article i taxes upon rent taxes upon the rent of land a tax upon the rent of land may either be imposed according to a certain canon every district being valued at a certain rent which valuation is not afterward to be altered or it may be imposed in such a manner as to vary with every variation in the real rent of the land and to rise or fall with the improvement or declension of its cultivation  a land tax which like that of great britain is imposed according to a certain invariable canon though it should be equal at the time of its first establishment necessarily becomes unequal in process of time according to the unequal degrees of improvement or neglect in the cultivation of the different parts of the country in england the valuation according to which the different counties and parishes were assessed to the landtax by the  th of william and mary was very unequal even at its first establishment this tax therefore so far offends against the first of the four maxims abovementioned it is perfectly agreeable to the other three it is perfectly certain the time of payment for the tax being the same as that for the rent is as convenient as it can be to the contributor though the landlord is in all cases the real contributor the tax is commonly advanced by the tenant to whom the landlord is obliged to allow it in the payment of the rent this tax is levied by a much smaller number of officers than any other which affords nearly the same revenue as the tax does not rise with the rise of the rent the sovereign does not share in the profits of the landlords improvements the tax therefore does not discourage those improvements nor keep down the produce of the land below what it would otherwise rise to as it has no tendency to diminish the quantity it can have none to raise the price of the produce it does not obstruct the industry of the people it subjects the landlord to no other inconveniency besides the unavoidable one of paying the tax  the advantage however which the landlord has derived from the invariable constancy of the valuation by which all the lands of great britain are rated to the land tax has been principally owing to some circumstances altogether extraneous to the nature of the tax  it has been owing in part to the great prosperity of almost every part of the country the rents of almost all the estates of great britain having since the time when this valuation was first established been continually rising and scarce any of them having fallen the landlords therefore have almost all gained the difference between the tax which they would have paid according to the present rent of their estates and that which they actually pay according to the ancient valuation had the state of the country been different had rents been gradually falling in consequence of the declension of cultivation the landlords would almost all have lost this difference in the state of things which has happened to take place since the revolution the constancy of the valuation has been advantageous to the landlord and hurtful to the sovereign in a different state of things it might have been advantageous to the sovereign and hurtful to the landlord  as the tax is made payable in money so the valuation of the land is expressed in money since the establishment of this valuation the value of silver has been pretty uniform and there has been no alteration in the standard of the coin either as to weight or fineness had silver risen considerably in its value as it seems to have done in the course of the two centuries which preceeded the discovery of the mines of america the constancy of the valuation might have proved very oppressive to the landlord had silver fallen considerably in its value as it certainly did for about a century at least after the discovery of those mines the same constancy of valuation would have reduced very much this branch of the revenue of the sovereign had any considerable alteration been made in the standard of the money either by sinking the same quantity of silver to a lower denomination or by raising it to a higher had an ounce of silver for example instead of being coined into five shillings and twopence been coined either into pieces which bore so low a denomination as two shillings and sevenpence or into pieces which bore so high a one as ten shillings and fourpence it would in the one case have hurt the revenue of the proprietor in the other that of the sovereign  in circumstances therefore somewhat different from those which have actually taken place this constancy of valuation might have been a very great inconveniency either to the contributors or to the commonwealth in the course of ages such circumstances however must at some time or other happen but though empires like all the other works of men have all hitherto proved mortal yet every empire aims at immortality every constitution therefore which it is meant should be as permanent as the empire itself ought to be convenient not in certain circumstances only but in all circumstances or ought to be suited not to those circumstances which are transitory occasional or accidental but to those which are necessary and therefore always the same  a tax upon the rent of land which varies with every variation of the rent or which rises and falls according to the improvement or neglect of cultivation is recommended by that sect of men of letters in france who call themselves the oeconomists as the most equitable of all taxes all taxes they pretend fall ultimately upon the rent of land and ought therefore to be imposed equally upon the fund which must finally pay them that all taxes ought to fall as equally as possible upon the fund which must finally pay them is certainly true but without entering into the disagreeable discussion of the metaphysical arguments by which they support their very ingenious theory it will sufficiently appear from the following review what are the taxes which fall finally upon the rent of the land and what are those which fall finally upon some other fund  in the venetian territory all the arable lands which are given in lease to farmers are taxed at a tenth of the rent memoires concernant les droits p   0     the leases are recorded in a public register which is kept by the officers of revenue in each province or district when the proprietor cultivates his own lands they are valued according to an equitable estimation and he is allowed a deduction of onefifth of the tax so that for such lands he pays only eight instead of ten per cent of the supposed rent  a land tax of this kind is certainly more equal than the land tax of england it might not perhaps be altogether so certain and the assessment of the tax might frequently occasion a good deal more trouble to the landlord it might too be a good deal more expensive in the levying  such a system of administration however might perhaps be contrived as would in a great measure both prevent this uncertainty and moderate this expense  the landlord and tenant for example might jointly be obliged to record their lease in a public register proper penalties might be enacted against concealing or misrepresenting any of the conditions and if part of those penalties was to be paid to either of the two parties who informed against and convicted the other of such concealment or misrepresentation it would effectually deter them from combining together in order to defraud the public revenue all the conditions of the lease might be sufficiently known from such a record  some landlords instead of raising the rent take a fine for the renewal of the lease this practice is in most cases the expedient of a spendthrift who for a sum of ready money sells a future revenue of much greater value it is in most cases therefore hurtful to the landlord it is frequently hurtful to the tenant and it is always hurtful to the community it frequently takes from the tenant so great a part of his capital and thereby diminishes so much his ability to cultivate the land that he finds it more difficult to pay a small rent than it would otherwise have been to pay a great one whatever diminishes his ability to cultivate necessarily keeps down below what it would otherwise have been the most important part of the revenue of the community by rendering the tax upon such fines a good deal heavier than upon the ordinary rent this hurtful practice might be discouraged to the no small advantage of all the different parties concerned of the landlord of the tenant of the sovereign and of the whole community  some leases prescribe to the tenant a certain mode of cultivation and a certain succession of crops during the whole continuance of the lease this condition which is generally the effect of the landlords conceit of his own superior knowledge a conceit in most cases very ill founded ought always to be considered as an additional rent as a rent in service instead of a rent in money in order to discourage the practice which is generally a foolish one this species of rent might be valued rather high and consequently taxed somewhat higher than common money rents  some landlords instead of a rent in money require a rent in kind in corn cattle poultry wine oil etc others again require a rent in service such rents are always more hurtful to the tenant than beneficial to the landlord they either take more or keep more out of the pocket of the former than they put into that of the latter in every country where they take place the tenants are poor and beggarly pretty much according to the degree in which they take place by valuing in the same manner such rents rather high and consequently taxing them somewhat higher than common moneyrents a practice which is hurtful to the whole community might perhaps be sufficiently discouraged  when the landlord chose to occupy himself a part of his own lands the rent might be valued according to an equitable arbitration of the farmers and landlords in the neighborhood and a moderate abatement of the tax might be granted to him in the same manner as in the venetian territory provided the rent of the lands which he occupied did not exceed a certain sum it is of importance that the landlord should be encouraged to cultivate a part of his own land his capital is generally greater than that of the tenant and with less skill he can frequently raise a greater produce the landlord can afford to try experiments and is generally disposed to do so his unsuccessful experiments occasion only a moderate loss to himself his successful ones contribute to the improvement and better cultivation of the whole country it might be of importance however that the abatement of the tax should encourage him to cultivate to a certain extent only if the landlords should the greater part of them be tempted to farm the whole of their own lands the country instead of sober and industrious tenants who are bound by their own interest to cultivate as well as their capital and skill will allow them would be filled with idle and profligate bailiffs whose abusive management would soon degrade the cultivation and reduce the annual produce of the land to the diminution not only of the revenue of their masters but of the most important part of that of the whole society  such a system of administration might perhaps free a tax of this kind from any degree of uncertainty which could occasion either oppression or inconveniency to the contributor and might at the same time serve to introduce into the common management of land such a plan or policy as might contribute a good deal to the general improvement and good cultivation of the country  the expense of levying a land tax which varied with every variation of the rent would no doubt be somewhat greater than that of levying one which was always rated according to a fixed valuation some additional expense would necessarily be incurred both by the different register offices which it would be proper to establish in the different districts of the country and by the different valuations which might occasionally be made of the lands which the proprietor chose to occupy himself the expense of all this however might be very moderate and much below what is incurred in the levying of many other taxes which afford a very inconsiderable revenue in comparison of what might easily be drawn from a tax of this kind  the discouragement which a variable land tax of this kind might give to the improvement of land seems to be the most important objection which can be made to it the landlord would certainly be less disposed to improve when the sovereign who contributed nothing to the expense was to share in the profit of the improvement even this objection might perhaps be obviated by allowing the landlord before he began his improvement to ascertain in conjunction with the officers of revenue the actual value of his lands according to the equitable arbitration of a certain number of landlords and farmers in the neighborhood equally chosen by both parties and by rating him according to this valuation for such a number of years as might be fully sufficient for his complete indemnification to draw the attention of the sovereign toward the improvement of the land from a regard to the increase of his own revenue is one of the principal advantages proposed by this species of land tax the term therefore allowed for the indemnification of the landlord ought not to be a great deal longer than what was necessary for that purpose lest the remoteness of the interest should discourage too much this attention it had better however be somewhat too long than in any respect too short no encitement to the attention of the sovereign can ever counterbalance the smallest discouragement to that of the landlord the attention of the sovereign can be at best but a very general and vague consideration of what is likely to contribute to the better cultivation of the greater part of his dominions the attention of the landlord is a particular and minute consideration of what is likely to be the most advantageous application of every inch of ground upon his estate the principal attention of the sovereign ought to be to encourage by every means in his power the attention both of the landlord and of the farmer by allowing both to pursue their own interest in their own way and according to their own judgment by giving to both the most perfect security that they shall enjoy the full recompense of their own industry and by procuring to both the most extensive market for every part of their produce in consequence of establishing the easiest and safest communications both by land and by water through every part of his own dominions as well as the most unbounded freedom of exportation to the dominions of all other princes  if by such a system of administration a tax of this kind could be so managed as to give not only no discouragement but on the contrary some encouragement to the improvement of land it does not appear likely to occasion any other inconveniency to the landlord except always the unavoidable one of being obliged to pay the tax  in all the variations of the state of the society in the improvement and in the declension of agriculture in all the variations in the value of silver and in all those in the standard of the coin a tax of this kind would of its own accord and without any attention of government readily suit itself to the actual situation of things and would be equally just and equitable in all those different changes it would therefore be much more proper to be established as a perpetual and unalterable regulation or as what is called a fundamental law of the commonwealth than any tax which was always to be levied according to a certain valuation  some states instead of the simple and obvious expedient of a register of leases have had recourse to the laborious and expensive one of an actual survey and valuation of all the lands in the country they have suspected probably that the lessor and lessee in order to defraud the public revenue might combine to conceal the real terms of the lease doomsday book seems to have been the result of a very accurate survey of this kind  in the ancient dominions of the king of prussia the land tax is assessed according to an actual survey and valuation which is reviewed and altered from time to time memoires concernant les drois etc tome i p             etc  according to that valuation the lay proprietors pay from twenty to twentyfive per cent of their revenue ecclesiastics from forty to fortyfive per cent the survey and valuation of silesia was made by order of the present king it is said with great accuracy according to that valuation the lands belonging to the bishop of breslaw are taxed at twentyfive per cent of their rent the other revenues of the ecclesiastics of both religions at fifty per cent the commanderies of the teutonic order and of that of malta at forty per cent lands held by a noble tenure at thirtyeight and onethird per cent lands held by a base tenure at thirtyfive and onethird per cent  the survey and valuation of bohemia is said to have been the work of more than a hundred years it was not perfected till after the peace of      by the orders of the present empress queen id p       the survey of the duchy of milan which was begun in the time of charles vi was not perfected till after    0 it is esteemed one of the most accurate that has ever been made the survey of savoy and piemont was executed under the orders of the late king of sardinia id p   0 etc also p     etc to       in the dominions of the king of prussia the revenue of the church is taxed much higher than that of lay proprietors the revenue of the church is the greater part of it a burden upon the rent of land it seldom happens that any part of it is applied toward the improvement of land or is so employed as to contribute in any respect toward increasing the revenue of the great body of the people his prussian majesty had probably upon that account thought it reasonable that it should contribute a good deal more toward relieving the exigencies of the state in some countries the lands of the church are exempted from all taxes in others they are taxed more lightly than other lands in the duchy of milan the lands which the church possessed before      are rated to the tax at a third only of their value  in silesia lands held by a noble tenure are taxed three per cent higher than those held by a base tenure the honors and privileges of different kinds annexed to the former his prussian majesty had probably imagined would sufficiently compensate to the proprietor a small aggravation of the tax while at the same time the humiliating inferiority of the latter would be in some measure alleviated by being taxed somewhat more lightly in other countries the system of taxation instead of alleviating aggravates this inequality in the dominions of the king of sardinia and in those provinces of france which are subject to what is called the real or predial taille the tax falls altogether upon the lands held by a base tenure those held by a noble one are exempted  a land tax assessed according to a general survey and valuation how equal soever it may be at first must in the course of a very moderate period of time become unequal to prevent its becoming so would require the continual and painful attention of government to all the variations in the state and produce of every different farm in the country the governments of prussia of bohemia of sardinia and of the duchy of milan actually exert an attention of this kind an attention so unsuitable to the nature of government that it is not likely to be of long continuance and which if it is continued will probably in the longrun occasion much more trouble and vexation than it can possibly bring relief to the contributors  in      the generality of montauban was assessed to the real or predial taille according it is said to a very exact survey and valuation id tome ii p     etc by      this assessment had become altogether unequal in order to remedy this inconveniency government has found no better expedient than to impose upon the whole generality an additional tax of a hundred and twenty thousand livres this additional tax is rated upon all the different districts subject to the taille according to the old assessment but it is levied only upon those which in the actualstate of things are by that assessment undertaxed and it is applied to the relief of those which by the same assessment are overtaxed two districts for example one of which ought in the actual state of things to be taxed at nine hundred the other at eleven hundred livres are by the old assessment both taxed at a thousand livres both these districts are by the additional tax rated at eleven hundred livres each but this additional tax is levied only upon the district undercharged and it is applied altogether to the relief of that overcharged which consequently pays only nine hundred livres the government neither gains nor loses by the additional tax which is applied altogether to remedy the inequalities arising from the old assessment the application is pretty much regulated according to the discretion of the intendant of the generality and must therefore be in a great measure arbitrary  taxes which are proportioned not to the rent but to the produce of land taxes upon the produce of land are in reality taxes upon the rent and though they may be originally advanced by the farmer are finally paid by the landlord when a certain portion of the produce is to be paid away for a tax the farmer computes as well as he can what the value of this portion is one year with another likely to amount to and he makes a proportionable abatement in the rent which he agrees to pay to the landlord there is no farmer who does not compute beforehand what the churchtythe which is a land tax of this kind is one year with another likely to amount to  the tithe and every other land tax of this kind under the appearance of perfect equality are very unequal taxes a certain portion of the produce being in different situations equivalent to a very different portion of the rent in some very rich lands the produce is so great that the one half of it is fully sufficient to replace to the farmer his capital employed in cultivation together with the ordinary profits of farming stock in the neighborhood the other half or what comes to the same thing the value of the other half he could afford to pay as rent to the landlord if there was no tithe but if a tenth of the produce is taken from him in the way of tithe he must require an abatement of the fifth part of this rent otherwise he cannot get back his capital with the ordinary profit in this case the rent of the landlord instead of amounting to a half or fivetenths of the whole produce will amount only to fourtenths of it in poorer lands on the contrary the produce is sometimes so small and the expense of cultivation so great that it requires fourfifths of the whole produce to replace to the farmer his capital with the ordinary profit in this case though there was no tithe the rent of the landlord could amount to no more than onefifth or twotenths of the whole produce but if the farmer pays onetenth of the produce in the way of tithe he must require an equal abatement of the rent of the landlord which will thus be reduced to onetenth only of the whole produce upon the rent of rich lands the tithe may sometimes be a tax of no more than onefifth part or four shillings in the pound whereas upon that of poorer lands it may sometimes be a tax of onehalf or of ten shillings in the pound  the tithe as it is frequently a very unequal tax upon the rent so it is always a great discouragement both to the improvements of the landlord and to the cultivation of the farmer the one cannot venture to make the most important which are generally the most expensive improvements nor the other to raise the most valuable which are generally too the most expensive crops when the church which lays out no part of the expense is to share so very largely in the profit the cultivation of madder was for a long time confined by the tithe to the united provinces which being presbyterian countries and upon that account exempted from this destructive tax enjoyed a sort of monopoly of that useful dying drug against the rest of europe the late attempts to introduce the culture of this plant into england have been made only in consequence of the statute which enacted that five shillings an acre should be received in lieu of all manner of tithe upon madder  as through the greater part of europe the church so in many different countries of asia the state is principally supported by a land tax proportioned not to the rent but to the produce of the land in china the principal revenue of the sovereign consists in a tenth part of the produce of all the lands of the empire this tenth part however is estimated so very moderately that in many provinces it is said not to exceed a thirtieth part of the ordinary produce the land tax or land rent which used to be paid to the mohammedan government of bengal before that country fell into the hands of the english east india company is said to have amounted to about a fifth part of the produce the land tax of ancient egypt is said likewise to have amounted to a fifth part  in asia this sort of land tax is said to interest the sovereign in the improvement and cultivation of land the sovereigns of china those of bengal while under the mohammedan government and those of ancient egypt are said accordingly to have been extremely attentive to the making and maintaining of good roads and navigable canals in order to increase as much as possible both the quantity and value of every part of the produce of the land by procuring to every part of it the most extensive market which their own dominions could afford the tithe of the church is divided into such small portions that no one of its proprietors can have any interest of this kind the parson of a parish could never find his account in making a road or canal to a distant part of the country in order to extend the market for the produce of his own particular parish such taxes when destined for the maintenance of the state have some advantages which may serve in some measure to balance their inconveniency when destined for the maintenance of the church they are attended with nothing but inconveniency  taxes upon the produce of land may be levied either in kind or according to a certain valuation in money  the parson of a parish or a gentleman of small fortune who lives upon his estate may sometimes perhaps find some advantage in receiving the one his tithe and the other his rent in kind the quantity to be collected and the district within which it is to be collected are so small that they both can oversee with their own eyes the collection and disposal of every part of what is due to them a gentleman of great fortune who lived in the capital would be in danger of suffering much by the neglect and more by the fraud of his factors and agents if the rents of an estate in a distant province were to be paid to him in this manner the loss of the sovereign from the abuse and depredation of his taxgatherers would necessarily be much greater the servants of the most careless private person are perhaps more under the eye of their master than those of the most careful prince and a public revenue which was paid in kind would suffer so much from the mismanagement of the collectors that a very small part of what was levied upon the people would ever arrive at the treasury of the prince some part of the public revenue of china however is said to be paid in this manner the mandarins and other taxgatherers will no doubt find their advantage in continuing the practice of a payment which is so much more liable to abuse than any payment in money  a tax upon the produce of land which is levied in money may be levied either according to a valuation which varies with all the variations of the market price or according to a fixed valuation a bushel of wheat for example being always valued at one and the same money price whatever may be the state of the market the produce of a tax levied in the former way will vary only according to the variations in the real produce of the land according to the improvement or neglect of cultivation the produce of a tax levied in the latter way will vary not only according to the variations in the produce of the land but according to both those in the value of the precious metals and those in the quantity of those metals which is at different times contained in coin of the same denomination the produce of the former will always bear the same proportion to the value of the real produce of the land the produce of the latter may at different times bear very different proportions to that value  when instead either of a certain portion of the produce of land or of the price of a certain portion a certain sum of money is to be paid in full compensation for all tax or tithe the tax becomes in this case exactly of the same nature with the land tax of england it neither rises nor falls with the rent of the land it neither encourages nor discourages improvement the tithe in the greater part of those parishes which pay what is called a modus in lieu of all other tithe is a tax of this kind during the mohammedan government of bengal instead of the payment in kind of a fifth part of the produce a modus and it is said a very moderate one was established in the greater part of the districts or zemindaries of the country some of the servants of the east india company under pretense of restoring the public revenue to its proper value have in some provinces exchanged this modus for a payment in kind under their management this change is likely both to discourage cultivation and to give new opportunities for abuse in the collection of the public revenue which has fallen very much below what it was said to have been when it first fell under the management of the company the servants of the company may perhaps have profited by this change but at the expense it is probable both of their masters and of the country  taxes upon the rent of houses the rent of a house may be distinguished into two parts of which the one may very properly be called the building rent the other is commonly called the ground rent  the building rent is the interest or profit of the capital expended in building the house in order to put the trade of a builder upon a level with other trades it is necessary that this rent should be sufficient first to pay him the same interest which he would have got for his capital if he had lent it upon good security and secondly to keep the house in constant repair or what comes to the same thing to replace within a certain term of years the capital which had been employed in building it the building rent or the ordinary profit of building is therefore every where regulated by the ordinary interest of money where the market rate of interest is four per cent the rent of a house which over and above paying the ground rent affords six or six and a half per cent upon the whole expense of building may perhaps afford a sufficient profit to the builder where the market rate of interest is five per cent it may perhaps require seven or seven and a half per cent if in proportion to the interest of money the trade of the builder affords at any time a much greater profit than this it will soon draw so much capital from other trades as will reduce the profit to its proper level if it affords at any time much less than this other trades will soon draw so much capital from it as will again raise that profit  whatever part of the whole rent of a house is over and above what is sufficient for affording this reasonable profit naturally goes to the groundrent and where the owner of the ground and the owner of the building are two different persons is in most cases completely paid to the former this surplus rent is the price which the inhabitant of the house pays for some real or supposed advantage of the situation in country houses at a distance from any great town where there is plenty of ground to choose upon the ground rent is scarce any thing or no more than what the ground which the house stands upon would pay if employed in agriculture in country villas in the neighborhood of some great town it is sometimes a good deal higher and the peculiar convenience or beauty of situation is there frequently very well paid for ground rents are generally highest in the capital and in those particular parts of it where there happens to be the greatest demand for houses whatever be the reason of that demand whether for trade and business for pleasure and society or for mere vanity and fashion  a tax upon houserent payable by the tenant and proportioned to the whole rent of each house could not for any considerable time at least affect the building rent if the builder did not get his reasonable profit he would be obliged to quit the trade which by raising the demand for building would in a short time bring back his profit to its proper level with that of other trades neither would such a tax fall altogether upon the ground rent but it would divide itself in such a manner as to fall partly upon the inhabitant of the house and partly upon the owner of the ground  let us suppose for example that a particular person judges that he can afford for houserent an expense of sixty pounds a year and let us suppose too that a tax of four shillings in the pound or of onefifth payable by the inhabitant is laid upon houserent a house of sixty pounds rent will in this case cost him seventytwo pounds a year which is twelve pounds more than he thinks he can afford he will therefore content himself with a worse house or a house of fifty pounds rent which with the additional ten pounds that he must pay for the tax will make up the sum of sixty pounds a year the expense which he judges he can afford and in order to pay the tax he will give up a part of the additional convenience which he might have had from a house of ten pounds a year more rent he will give up i say a part of this additional convenience for he will seldom be obliged to give up the whole but will in consequence of the tax get a better house for fifty pounds a year than he could have got if there had been no tax for as a tax of this kind by taking away this particular competitor must diminish the competition for houses of sixty pounds rent so it must likewise diminish it for those of fifty pounds rent and in the same manner for those of all other rents except the lowest rent for which it would for some time increase the competition but the rents of every class of houses for which the competition was diminished would necessarily be more or less reduced as no part of this reduction however could for any considerable time at least affect the building rent the whole of it must in the longrun necessarily fall upon the groundrent the final payment of this tax therefore would fall partly upon the inhabitant of the house who in order to pay his share would be obliged to give up a part of his convenience and partly upon the owner of the ground who in order to pay his share would be obliged to give up a part of his revenue in what proportion this final payment would be divided between them it is not perhaps very easy to ascertain the division would probably be very different in different circumstances and a tax of this kind might according to those different circumstances affect very unequally both the inhabitant of the house and the owner of the ground  the inequality with which a tax of this kind might fall upon the owners of different ground rents would arise altogether from the accidental inequality of this division but the inequality with which it might fall upon the inhabitants of different houses would arise not only from this but from another cause the proportion of the expense of houserent to the whole expense of living is different in the different degrees of fortune it is perhaps highest in the highest degree and it diminishes gradually through the inferior degrees so as in general to be lowest in the lowest degree the necessaries of life occasion the great expense of the poor they find it difficult to get food and the greater part of their little revenue is spent in getting it the luxuries and vanities of life occasion the principal expense of the rich and a magnificent house embellishes and sets off to the best advantage all the other luxuries and vanities which they possess a tax upon houserents therefore would in general fall heaviest upon the rich and in this sort of inequality there would not perhaps be any thing very unreasonable it is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense not only in proportion to their revenue but something more than in that proportion  the rent of houses though it in some respects resembles the rent of land is in one respect essentially different from it the rent of land is paid for the use of a productive subject the land which pays it produces it the rent of houses is paid for the use of an unproductive subject neither the house nor the ground which it stands upon produce any thing the person who pays the rent therefore must draw it from some other source of revenue distinct from and independent of this subject a tax upon the rent of houses so far as it falls upon the inhabitants must be drawn from the same source as the rent itself and must be paid from their revenue whether derived from the wages of labor the profits of stock or the rent of land so far as it falls upon the inhabitants it is one of those taxes which fall not upon one only but indifferently upon all the three different sources of revenue and is in every respect of the same nature as a tax upon any other sort of consumable commodities in general there is not perhaps any one article of expense or consumption by which the liberality or narrowness of a mans whole expense can be better judged of than by his houserent a proportional tax upon this particular article of expense might perhaps produce a more considerable revenue than any which has hitherto been drawn from it in any part of europe if the tax indeed was very high the greater part of people would endeavor to evade it as much as they could by contenting themselves with smaller houses and by turning the greater part of their expense into some other channel  the rent of houses might easily be ascertained with sufficient accuracy by a policy of the same kind with that which would be necessary for ascertaining the ordinary rent of land houses not inhabited ought to pay no tax a tax upon them would fall altogether upon the proprietor who would thus be taxed for a subject which afforded him neither convenience nor revenue houses inhabited by the proprietor ought to be rated not according to the expense which they might have cost in building but according to the rent which an equitable arbitration might judge them likely to bring if leased to a tenant if rated according to the expense which they may have cost in building a tax of three or four shillings in the pound joined with other taxes would ruin almost all the rich and great families of this and i believe of every other civilized country whoever will examine with attention the different town and country houses of some of the richest and greatest families in this country will find that at the rate of only six and a half or seven per cent upon the original expense of building their houserent is nearly equal to the whole neat rent of their estates it is the accumulated expense of several successive generations laid out upon objects of great beauty and magnificence indeed but in proportion to what they cost of very small exchangeable value  groundrents are a still more proper subject of taxation than the rent of houses a tax upon groundrents would not raise the rents of houses it would fall altogether upon the owner of the groundrent who acts always as a monopolist and exacts the greatest rent which can be got for the use of his ground more or less can be got for it according as the competitors happen to be richer or poorer or can afford to gratify their fancy for a particular spot of ground at a greater or smaller expense in every country the greatest number of rich competitors is in the capital and it is there accordingly that the highest groundrents are always to be found as the wealth of those competitors would in no respect be increased by a tax upon groundrents they would not probably be disposed to pay more for the use of the ground whether the tax was to be advanced by the inhabitant or by the owner of the ground would be of little importance the more the inhabitant was obliged to pay for the tax the less he would incline to pay for the ground so that the final payment of the tax would fall altogether upon the owner of the groundrent the groundrents of uninhabited houses ought to pay no tax  both groundrents and the ordinary rent of land are a species of revenue which the owner in many cases enjoys without any care or attention of his own though a part of this revenue should be taken from him in order to defray the expenses of the state no discouragement will thereby be given to any sort of industry the annual produce of the land and labor of the society the real wealth and revenue of the great body of the people might be the same after such a tax as before groundrents and the ordinary rent of land are therefore perhaps the species of revenue which can best bear to have a peculiar tax imposed upon them  groundrents seem in this respect a more proper subject of peculiar taxation than even the ordinary rent of land the ordinary rent of land is in many cases owing partly at least to the attention and good management of the landlord a very heavy tax might discourage too much this attention and good management groundrents so far as they exceed the ordinary rent of land are altogether owing to the good government of the sovereign which by protecting the industry either of the whole people or of the inhabitants of some particular place enables them to pay so much more than its real value for the ground which they build their houses upon or to make to its owner so much more than compensation for the loss which he might sustain by this use of it nothing can be more reasonable than that a fund which owes its existence to the good government of the state should be taxed peculiarly or should contribute something more than the greater part of other funds toward the support of that government  though in many different countries of europe taxes have been imposed upon the rent of houses i do not know of any in which groundrents have been considered as a separate subject of taxation the contrivers of taxes have probably found some difficulty in ascertaining what part of the rent ought to be considered as groundrent and what part ought to be considered as building rent it should not however seem very difficult to distinguish those two parts of the rent from one another  in great britain the rent of houses is supposed to be taxed in the same proportion as the rent of land by what is called the annual land tax the valuation according to which each different parish and district is assessed to this tax is always the same it was originally extremely unequal and it still continues to be so through the greater part of the kingdom this tax falls still more lightly upon the rent of houses than upon that of land in some few districts only which were originally rated high and in which the rents of houses have fallen considerably the land tax of three or four shillings in the pound is said to amount to an equal proportion of the real rent of the houses untenanted houses though by law subject to the tax are in most districts exempted from it by the favor of the assessors and this exemption sometimes occasions some little variation in the rate of particular houses though that of the district is always the same  in the province of holland memories concernant les droits etc p     every house is taxed at two and a half per cent of its value without any regard either to the rent which it actually pays or to the circumstance of its being tenanted or untenanted there seems to be a hardship in obliging the proprietor to pay a tax for an untenanted house from which he can derive no revenue especially so very heavy a tax in holland where the market rate of interest does not exceed three per cent two and a half per cent upon the whole value of the house must in most cases amount to more than a third of the buildingrent perhaps of the whole rent the valuation indeed according to which the houses are rated though very unequal is said to be always below the real value when a house is rebuilt improved or enlarged there is a new valuation and the tax is rated accordingly  the contrivers of the several taxes which in england have at different times been imposed upon houses seem to have imagined that there was some great difficulty in ascertaining with tolerable exactness what was the real rent of every house they have regulated their taxes therefore according to some more obvious circumstance such as they had probably imagined would in most cases bear some proportion to the rent  the first tax of this kind was hearthmoney or a tax of two shillings upon every hearth in order to ascertain how many hearths were in the house it was necessary that the taxgatherer should enter every room in it this odious visit rendered the tax odious soon after the revolution therefore it was abolished as a badge of slavery  the next tax of this kind was a tax of two shillings upon every dwelling house inhabited a house with ten windows to pay four shillings more a house with twenty windows and upwards to pay eight shillings this tax was afterward so far altered that houses with twenty windows and with less than thirty were ordered to pay ten shillings and those with thirty windows and upwards to pay twenty shillings the number of windows can in most cases be counted from the outside and in all cases without entering every room in the house the visit of the taxgatherer therefore was less offensive in this tax than in the hearthmoney  this tax was afterward repealed and in the room of it was established the window tax which has undergone too several alterations and augmentations the window tax as it stands at present january      over and above the duty of three shillings upon every house in england and of one shilling upon every house in scotland lays a duty upon every window which in england augments gradually from twopence the lowest rate upon houses with not more than seven windows to two shillings the highest rate upon houses with twentyfive windows and upwards  the principal objection to all such taxes is their inequality an inequality of the worst kind as they must frequently fall much heavier upon the poor than upon the rich a house of ten pounds rent in a country town may sometimes have more windows than a house of five hundred pounds rent in london and though the inhabitant of the former is likely to be a much poorer man than that of the latter yet so far as his contribution is regulated by the windowtax he must contribute more to the support of the state such taxes are therefore directly contrary to the first of the four maxims above mentioned they do not seem to offend much against any of the other three  the natural tendency of the windowtax and of all other taxes upon houses is to lower rents the more a man pays for the tax the less it is evident he can afford to pay for the rent since the imposition of the windowtax however the rents of houses have upon the whole risen more or less in almost every town and village of great britain with which i am acquainted such has been almost every where the increase of the demand for houses that it has raised the rents more than the windowtax could sink them one of the many proofs of the great prosperity of the country and of the increasing revenue of its inhabitants had it not been for the tax rents would probably have risen still higher  article ii taxes upon profit or upon the revenue arising from stock the revenue or profit arising from stock naturally divides itself into two parts that which pays the interest and which belongs to the owner of the stock and that surplus part which is over and above what is necessary for paying the interest  this latter part of profit is evidently a subject not taxable directly it is the compensation and in most cases it is no more than a very moderate compensation for the risk and trouble of employing the stock the employer must have this compensation otherwise he cannot consistently with his own interest continue the employment if he was taxed directly therefore in proportion to the whole profit he would be obliged either to raise the rate of his profit or to charge the tax upon the interest of money that is to pay less interest if he raised the rate of his profit in proportion to the tax the whole tax though it might be advanced by him would be finally paid by one or other of two different sets of people according to the different ways in which he might employ the stock of which he had the management if he employed it as a farming stock in the cultivation of land he could raise the rate of his profit only by retaining a greater portion or what comes to the same thing the price of a greater portion of the produce of the land and as this could be done only by a reduction of rent the final payment of the tax would fall upon the landlord if he employed it as a mercantile or manufacturing stock he could raise the rate of his profit only by raising the price of his goods in which case the final payment of the tax would fall altogether upon the consumers of those goods if he did not raise the rate of his profit he would be obliged to charge the whole tax upon that part of it which was allotted for the interest of money he could afford less interest for whatever stock he borrowed and the whole weight of the tax would in this case fall ultimately upon the interest of money so far as he could not relieve himself from the tax in the one way he would be obliged to relieve himself in the other  the interest of money seems at first sight a subject equally capable of being taxed directly as the rent of land like the rent of land it is a neat produce which remains after completely compensating the whole risk and trouble of employing the stock as a tax upon the rent of land cannot raise rents because the neat produce which remains after replacing the stock of the farmer together with his reasonable profit cannot be greater after the tax than before it so for the same reason a tax upon the interest of money could not raise the rate of interest the quantity of stock or money in the country like the quantity of land being supposed to remain the same after the tax as before it the ordinary rate of profit it has been shown in the first book is every where regulated by the quantity of stock to be employed in proportion to the quantity of the employment or of the business which must be done by it but the quantity of the employment or of the business to be done by stock could neither be increased nor diminished by any tax upon the interest of money if the quantity of the stock to be employed therefore was neither increased nor diminished by it the ordinary rate of profit would necessarily remain the same but the portion of this profit necessary for compensating the risk and trouble of the employer would likewise remain the same that risk and trouble being in no respect altered the residue therefore that portion which belongs to the owner of the stock and which pays the interest of money would necessarily remain the same too at first sight therefore the interest of money seems to be a subject as fit to be taxed directly as the rent of land  there are however two different circumstances which render the interest of money a much less proper subject of direct taxation than the rent of land  first the quantity and value of the land which any man possesses can never be a secret and can always be ascertained with great exactness but the whole amount of the capital stock which he possesses is almost always a secret and can scarce ever be ascertained with tolerable exactness it is liable besides to almost continual variations a year seldom passes away frequently not a month sometimes scarce a single day in which it does not rise or fall more or less an inquisition into every mans private circumstances and an inquisition which in order to accommodate the tax to them watched over all the fluctuations of his fortune would be a source of such continual and endless vexation as no people could support  secondly land is a subject which cannot be removed whereas stock easily may the proprietor of land is necessarily a citizen of the particular country in which his estate lies the proprietor of stock is properly a citizen of the world and is not necessarily attached to any particular country he would be apt to abandon the country in which he was exposed to a vexatious inquisition in order to be assessed to a burdensome tax and would remove his stock to some other country where he could either carry on his business or enjoy his fortune more at his ease by removing his stock he would put an end to all the industry which it had maintained in the country which he left stock cultivates land stock employs labor a tax which tended to drive away stock from any particular country would so far tend to dry up every source of revenue both to the sovereign and to the society not only the profits of stock but the rent of land and the wages of labor would necessarily be more or less diminished by its removal  the nations accordingly who have attempted to tax the revenue arising from stock instead of any severe inquisition of this kind have been obliged to content themselves with some very loose and therefore more or less arbitrary estimation the extreme inequality and uncertainty of a tax assessed in this manner can be compensated only by its extreme moderation in consequence of which every man finds himself rated so very much below his real revenue that he gives himself little disturbance though his neighbor should be rated somewhat lower  by what is called the land tax in england it was intended that stock should be taxed in the same proportion as land when the tax upon land was at four shillings in the pound or at onefifth of the supposed rent it was intended that stock should be taxed at onefifth of the supposed interest when the present annual land tax was first imposed the legal rate of interest was six per cent every hundred pounds stock accordingly was supposed to be taxed at twentyfour shillings the fifth part of six pounds since the legal rate of interest has been reduced to five per cent every hundred pounds stock is supposed to be taxed at twenty shillings only the sum to be raised by what is called the land tax was divided between the country and the principal towns the greater part of it was laid upon the country and of what was laid upon the towns the greater part was assessed upon the houses what remained to be assessed upon the stock or trade of the towns for the stock upon the land was not meant to be taxed was very much below the real value of that stock or trade whatever inequalities therefore there might be in the original assessment gave little disturbance every parish and district still continues to be rated for its land its houses and its stock according to the original assessment and the almost universal prosperity of the country which in most places has raised very much the value of all these has rendered those inequalities of still less importance now the rate too upon each district continuing always the same the uncertainty of this tax so far as it might be assessed upon the stock of any individual has been very much diminished as well as rendered of much less consequence if the greater part of the lands of england are not rated to the land tax at half their actual value the greater part of the stock of england is perhaps scarce rated at the fiftieth part of its actual value in some towns the whole land tax is assessed upon houses as in westminster where stock and trade are free it is otherwise in london  in all countries a severe inquisition into the circumstances of private persons has been carefully avoided  at hamburgh memoires concernant les droits tome i p    every inhabitant is obliged to pay to the state onefourth per cent of all that he possesses and as the wealth of the people of hamburgh consists principally in stock this tax may be considered as a tax upon stock every man assesses himself and in the presence of the magistrate puts annually into the public coffer a certain sum of money which he declares upon oath to be onefourth per cent of all that he possesses but without declaring what it amounts to or being liable to any examination upon that subject this tax is generally supposed to be paid with great fidelity in a small republic where the people have entire confidence in their magistrates are convinced of the necessity of the tax for the support of the state and believe that it will be faithfully applied to that purpose such conscientious and voluntary payment may sometimes be expected it is not peculiar to the people of hamburgh  the canton of underwold in switzerland is frequently ravaged by storms and inundations and is thereby exposed to extraordinary expenses upon such occasions the people assemble and every one is said to declare with the greatest frankness what he is worth in order to be taxed accordingly at zurich the law orders that in cases of necessity every one should be taxed in proportion to his revenue the amount of which he is obliged to declare upon oath they have no suspicion it is said that any of their fellow citizens will deceive them at basil the principal revenue of the state arises from a small custom upon goods exported all the citizens make oath that they will pay every three months all the taxes imposed by the law all merchants and even all innkeepers are trusted with keeping themselves the account of the goods which they sell either within or without the territory at the end of every three months they send this account to the treasurer with the amount of the tax computed at the bottom of it it is not suspected that the revenue suffers by this confidence id tome i p               to oblige every citizen to declare publicly upon oath the amount of his fortune must not it seems in those swiss cantons be reckoned a hardship at hamburgh it would be reckoned the greatest merchants engaged in the hazardous projects of trade all tremble at the thoughts of being obliged at all times to expose the real state of their circumstances the ruin of their credit and the miscarriage of their projects they foresee would too often be the consequence a sober and parsimonious people who are strangers to all such projects do not feel that they have occasion for any such concealment  in holland soon after the exaltation of the iate prince of orange to the stadtholdership a tax of two per cent or the fiftieth penny as it was called was imposed upon the whole substance of every citizen every citizen assessed himself and paid his tax in the same manner as at hamburgh and it was in general supposed to have been paid with great fidelity the people had at that time the greatest affection for their new government which they had just established by a general insurrection the tax was to be paid but once in order to relieve the state in a particular exigency it was indeed too heavy to be permanent in a country where the market rate of interest seldom exceeds three per cent a tax of two per cent amounts to thirteen shillings and fourpence in the pound upon the highest neat revenue which is commonly drawn from stock it is a tax which very few people could pay without encroaching more or less upon their capitals in a particular exigency the people may from great public zeal make a great effort and give up even a part of their capital in order to relieve the state but it is impossible that they should continue to do so for any considerable time and if they did the tax would soon ruin them so completely as to render them altogether incapable of supporting the state  the tax upon stock imposed by the land tax bill in england though it is proportioned to the capital is not intended to diminish or take away any part of that capital it is meant only to be a tax upon the interest of money proportioned to that upon the rent of land so that when the latter is at four shillings in the pound the former may be at four shillings in the pound too the tax at hamburgh and the still more moderate taxes of underwold and zurich are meant in the same manner to be taxes not upon the capital but upon the interest or neat revenue of stock that of holland was meant to be a tax upon the capital  taxes upon the profit of particular employments in some countries extraordinary taxes are imposed upon the profits of stock sometimes when employed in particular branches of trade and sometimes when employed in agriculture  of the former kind are in england the tax upon hawkers and pedlars that upon hackney coaches and chairs and that which the keepers of alehouses pay for a license to retail ale and spirituous liquors during the late war another tax of the same kind was proposed upon shops the war having been undertaken it was said in defense of the trade of the country the merchants who were to profit by it ought to contribute toward the support of it  a tax however upon the profits of stock employed in any particular branch of trade can never fall finally upon the dealers who must in all ordinary cases have their reasonable profit and where the competition is free can seldom have more than that profit but always upon the consumers who must be obliged to pay in the price of the goods the tax which the dealer advances and generally with some overcharge  a tax of this kind when it is proportioned to the trade of the dealer is finally paid by the consumer and occasions no oppression to the dealer when it is not so proportioned but is the same upon all dealers though in this case too it is finally paid by the consumer yet it favors the great and occasions some oppression to the small dealer the tax of five shillings a week upon every hackney coach and that of ten shillings a year upon every hackney chair so far as it is advanced by the different keepers of such coaches and chairs is exactly enough proportioned to the extent of their respective dealings it neither favors the great nor oppresses the smaller dealer the tax of twenty shillings a year for a license to sell ale of forty shillings for a license to sell spirituous liquors and of forty shillings more for a license to sell wine being the same upon all retailers must necessarily give some advantage to the great and occasion some oppression to the small dealers the former must find it more easy to get back the tax in the price of their goods than the latter the moderation of the tax however renders this inequality of less importance and it may to many people appear not improper to give some discouragement to the multiplication of little alehouses the tax upon shops it was intended should be the same upon all shops it could not well have been otherwise it would have been impossible to proportion with tolerable exactness the tax upon a shop to the extent of the trade carried on in it without such an inquisition as would have been altogether insupportable in a free country if the tax had been considerable it would have oppressed the small and forced almost the whole retail trade into the hands of the great dealers the competition of the former being taken away the latter would have enjoyed a monopoly of the trade and like all other monopolists would soon have combined to raise their profits much beyond what was necessary for the payment of the tax the final payment instead of falling upon the shopkeeper would have fallen upon the consumer with a considerable overcharge to the profit of the shopkeeper for these reasons the project of a tax upon shops was laid aside and in the room of it was substituted the subsidy       what in france is called the personal taille is perhaps the most important tax upon the profits of stock employed in agriculture that is levied in any part of europe  in the disorderly state of europe during the prevalence of the feudal government the sovereign was obliged to content himself with taxing those who were too weak to refuse to pay taxes the great lords though willing to assist him upon particular emergencies refused to subject themselves to any constant tax and he was not strong enough to force them the occupiers of land all over europe were the greater part of them originally bondmen through the greater part of europe they were gradually emancipated some of them acquired the property of landed estates which they held by some base or ignoble tenure sometimes under the king and sometimes under some other great lord like the ancient copyholders of england others without acquiring the property obtained leases for terms of years of the lands which they occupied under their lord and thus became less dependent upon him the great lords seem to have beheld the degree of prosperity and independency which this inferior order of men had thus come to enjoy with malignant and contemptuous indignation and willingly consented that the sovereign should tax them in some countries this tax was confined to the lands which were held in property by an ignoble tenure and in this case the taille was said to be real the land tax established by the late king of sardinia and the taille in the provinces of languedoc provence dauphine and brittany in the generality of montauban and in the elections of again and condom as well as in some other districts of france are taxes upon lands held in property by an ignoble tenure in other countries the tax was laid upon the supposed profits of all those who held in farm or lease lands belonging to other people whatever might be the tenure by which the proprietor held them and in this case the taille was said to be personal in the greater part of those provinces of france which are called the countries of elections the taille is of this kind the real taille as it is imposed only upon a part of the lands of the country is necessarily an unequal but it is not always an arbitrary tax though it is so upon some occasions the personal taille as it is intended to be proportioned to the profits of a certain class of people which can only be guessed at is necessarily both arbitrary and unequal  in france the personal taille at present      annually imposed upon the twenty generalities called the countries of elections amounts to  0 0     livres    sous memoires concernant les droits etc tome ii p     the proportion in which this sum is assessed upon those different provinces varies from year to year according to the reports which are made to the kings council concerning the goodness or badness of the crop as well as other circumstances which may either increase or diminish their respective abilities to pay each generality is divided into a certain number of elections and the proportion in which the sum imposed upon the whole generality is divided among those different elections varies likewise from year to year according to the reports made to the council concerning their respective abilities it seems impossible that the council with the best intentions can ever proportion with tolerable exactness either of those two assessments to the real abilities of the province or district upon which they are respectively laid ignorance and misinformation must always more or less mislead the most upright council the proportion which each parish ought to support of what is assessed upon the whole election and that which each individual ought to support of what is assessed upon his particular parish are both in the same manner varied from year to year according as circumstances are supposed to require these circumstances are judged of in the one case by the officers of the election in the other by those of the parish and both the one and the other are more or less under the direction and influence of the intendant not only ignorance and misinformation but friendship party animosity and private resentment are said frequently to mislead such assessors no man subject to such a tax it is evident can ever be certain before he is assessed of what he is to pay he cannot even be certain after he is assessed if any person has been taxed who ought to have been exempted or if any person has been taxed beyond his proportion though both must pay in the mean time yet if they complain and make good their complaints the whole parish is reimposed next year in order to reimburse them if any of the contributors become bankrupt or insolvent the collector is obliged to advance his tax and the whole parish is reimposed next year in order to reimburse the collector if the collector himself should become bankrupt the parish which elects him must answer for his conduct to the receivergeneral of the election but as it might be troublesome for the receiver to prosecute the whole parish he takes at his choice five or six of the richest contributors and obliges them to make good what had been lost by the insolvency of the collector the parish is afterward reimposed in order to reimburse those five or six such reimpositions are always over and above the taille of the particular year in which they are laid on  when a tax is imposed upon the profits of stock in a particular branch of trade the traders are all careful to bring no more goods to market than what they can sell at a price sufficient to reimburse them for advancing the tax some of them withdraw a part of their stocks from the trade and the market is more sparingly supplied than before the price of the goods rises and the final payment of the tax falls upon the consumer but when a tax is imposed upon the profits of stock employed in agriculture it is not the interest of the farmers to withdraw any part of their stock from that employment each farmer occupies a certain quantity of land for which he pays rent for the proper cultivation of this land a certain quantity of stock is necessary and by withdrawing any part of this necessary quantity the farmer is not likely to be more able to pay either the rent or the tax in order to pay the tax it can never be his interest to diminish the quantity of his produce nor consequently to supply the market more sparingly than before the tax therefore will never enable him to raise the price of his produce nor to reimburse himself by throwing the final payment upon the consumer the farmer however must have his reasonable profit as well as every other dealer otherwise he must give up the trade after the imposition of a tax of this kind he can get this reasonable profit only by paying less rent to the landlord the more he is obliged to pay in the way of tax the less he can afford to pay in the way of rent a tax of this kind imposed during the currency of a lease may no doubt distress or ruin the farmer upon the renewal of the lease it must always fall upon the landlord  in the countries where the personal taille takes place the farmer is commonly assessed in proportion to the stock which he appears to employ in cultivation he is upon this account frequently afraid to have a good team of horses or oxen but endeavors to cultivate with the meanest and most wretched instruments of husbandry that he can such is his distrust in the justice of his assessors that he counterfeits poverty and wishes to appear scarce able to pay any thing for fear of being obliged to pay too much by this miserable policy he does not perhaps always consult his own interest in the most effectual manner and he probably loses more by the diminution of his produce than he saves by that of his tax though in consequence of this wretched cultivation the market is no doubt somewhat worse supplied yet the small rise of price which this may occasion as it is not likely even to indemnify the farmer for the diminution of his produce it is still less likely to enable him to pay more rent to the landlord the public the farmer the landlord all suffer more or less by this degraded cultivation that the personal taille tends in many different ways to discourage cultivation and consequently to dry up the principal source of the wealth of every great country i have already had occasion to observe in the third book of this inquiry  what are called polltaxes in the southern provinces of north america and in the west india islands annual taxes of so much a head upon every negro are properly taxes upon the profits of a certain species of stock employed in agriculture as the planters are the greater part of them both farmers and landlords the final payment of the tax falls upon them in their quality of landlords without any retribution  taxes of so much a head upon the bondmen employed in cultivation seem anciently to have been common all over europe there subsists at present a tax of this kind in the empire of russia it is probably upon this account that polltaxes of all kinds have often been represented as badges of slavery every tax however is to the person who pays it a badge not of slavery but of liberty it denotes that he is subject to government indeed but that as he has some property he cannot himself be the property of a master a polltax upon slaves is altogether different from a polltax upon freemen the latter is paid by the persons upon whom it is imposed the former by a different set of persons the latter is either altogether arbitrary or altogether unequal and in most cases is both the one and the other the former though in some respects unequal different slaves being of different values is in no respect arbitrary every master who knows the number of his own slaves knows exactly what he has to pay those different taxes however being called by the same name have been considered as of the same nature  taxes upon the profits of stock in particular employments can never affect the interest of money nobody will lend his money for less interest to those who exercise the taxed than to those who exercise the untaxed employments taxes upon the revenue arising from stock in all employments where the government attempts to levy them with any degree of exactness will in many cases fall upon the interest of money the vingtieme or twentiethpenny in france is a tax of the same kind with what is called the land tax in england and is assessed in the same manner upon the revenue arising from land houses and stock so far as it affects stock it is assessed though not with great rigor yet with much more exactness than that part of the land tax of england which is imposed upon the same fund it in many cases falls altogether upon the interest of money money is frequently sunk in france upon what are called contracts for the constitution of a rent that is perpetual annuities redeemable at any time by the debtor upon repayment of the sum originally advanced but of which this redemption is not exigible by the creditor except in particular cases the vingtieme seems not to have raised the rate of those annuities though it is exactly levied upon them all  appendix to articles i and ii taxes upon the capital value of land houses and stock while property remains in the possession of the same person whatever permanent taxes may have been imposed upon it they have never been intended to diminish or take away any part of its capital value but only some part of the revenue arising from it but when property changes hands when it is transmitted either from the dead to the living or from the living to the living such taxes have frequently been imposed upon it as necessarily take away some part of its capital value  the transference of all sorts of property from the dead to the living and that of immovable property of land and houses from the living to the living are transactions which are in their nature either public and notorious or such as cannot be long concealed such transactions therefore may be taxed directly the transference of stock or immovable property from the living to the living by the lending of money is frequently a secret transaction and may always be made so it cannot easily therefore be taxed directly it has been taxed indirectly in two different ways first by requiring that the deed containing the obligation to repay should be written upon paper or parchment which had paid a certain stampduty otherwise not to be valid secondly by requiring under the like penalty of invalidity that it should be recorded either in a public or secret register and by imposing certain duties upon such registration stampduties and duties of registration have frequently been imposed likewise upon the deeds transferring property of all kinds from the dead to the living and upon those transferring immovable property from the living to the living transactions which might easily have been taxed directly  the vicesima hereditatum the twentieth penny of inheritances imposed by augustus upon the ancient romans was a tax upon the transference of property from the dead to the living dion cassius lib    see also burman de vectigalibus pop romans cap xi and bouchaud de l impot du vingtieme sur les successions  the author who writes concerning it the least indistinctly says that it was imposed upon all successions legacies and donations in case of death except upon those to the nearest relations and to the poor  of the same kind is the dutch tax upon successions memoires concernant les droits etc tom i p      collateral successions are taxed according to the degree of relation from five to thirty per cent upon the whole value of the succession testamentary donations or legacies to collaterals are subject to the like duties those from husband to wife or from wife to husband to the fiftieth penny the luctuosa hereditas the mournful succession of ascendents to descendents to the twentieth penny only direct successions or those of descendents to ascendents pay no tax the death of a father to such of his children as live in the same house with him is seldom attended with any increase and frequently with a considerable diminution of revenue by the loss of his industry of his office or of some liferent estate of which he may have been in possession that tax would be cruel and oppressive which aggravated their loss by taking from them any part of his succession it may however sometimes be otherwise with those children who in the language of the roman law are said to be emancipated in that of the scotch law to be forisfamiliated that is who have received their portion have got families of their own and are supported by funds separate and independent of those of their father whatever part of his succession might come to such children would be a real addition to their fortune and might therefore perhaps without more inconveniency than what attends all duties of this kind be liable to some tax  the casualties of the feudal law were taxes upon the transference of land both from the dead to the living and from the living to the living in ancient times they constituted in every part of europe one of the principal branches of the revenue of the crown  the heir of every immediate vassal of the crown paid a certain duty generally a years rent upon receiving the investiture of the estate if the heir was a minor the whole rents of the estate during the continuance of the minority devolved to the superior without any other charge besides the maintenance of the minor and the payment of the widows dower when there happened to be a dowager upon the land when the minor came to be of age another tax called relief was still due to the superior which generally amounted likewise to a years rent a long minority which in the present times so frequently disburdens a great estate of all its encumbrances and restores the family to their ancient splendour could in those times have no such effect the waste and not the disincumbrance of the estate was the common effect of a long minority  by the feudal law the vassal could not alienate without the consent of his superior who generally extorted a fine or composition for granting it this fine which was at first arbitrary came in many countries to be regulated at a certain portion of the price of the land in some countries where the greater part of the other feudal customs have gone into disuse this tax upon the alienation of land still continues to make a considerable branch of the revenue of the sovereign in the canton of berne it is so high as a sixth part of the price of all noble fiefs and a tenth part of that of all ignoble ones memoires concernant les droits etc tom i p      in the canton of lucerne the tax upon the sale of lands is not universal and takes place only in certain districts but if any person sells his land in order to remove out of the territory he pays ten per cent upon the whole price of the sale id p      taxes of the same kind upon the sale either of all lands or of lands held by certain tenures take place in many other countries and make a more or less considerable branch of the revenue of the sovereign  such transactions may be taxed indirectly by means either of stampduties or of duties upon registration and those duties either may or may not be proportioned to the value of the subject which is transferred  in great britain the stampduties are higher or lower not so much according to the value of the property transferred an eighteen penny or half crown stamp being sufficient upon a bond for the largest sum of money as according to the nature of the deed the highest do not exceed six pounds upon every sheet of paper or skin of parchment and these high duties fall chiefly upon grants from the crown and upon certain law proceedings without any regard to the value of the subject there are in great britain no duties on the registration of deeds or writings except the fees of the officers who keep the register and these are seldom more than a reasonable recompense for their labor the crown derives no revenue from them  in holland id tom i p             there are both stampduties and duties upon registration which in some cases are and in some are not proportioned to the value of the property transferred all testaments must be written upon stamptpaper of which the price is proportioned to the property disposed of so that there are stamps which cost from threepence or three stivers a sheet to three hundred florins equal to about twentyseven pound ten shillings of our money if the stamp is of an inferior price to what the testator ought to have made use of his succession is confiscated this is over and above all their other taxes on succession except bills of exchange and some other mercantile bills all other deeds bonds and contracts are subject to a stampduty this duty however does not rise in proportion to the value of the subject all sales of land and of houses and all mortgages upon either must be registered and upon registration pay a duty to the state of two and a half per cent upon the amount of the price or the mortgage this duty is extended to the sale of all ships and vessels of more than two tons burden whether decked or undecked these it seems are considered as a sort of houses upon the water the sale of movables when it is ordered by a court of justice is subject to the like duty of two and a half per cent  in france there are both stampduties and duties upon registration the former are considered as a branch of the aides or excise and in the provinces where those duties take place are levied by the excise officers the latter are considered as a branch of the domaine of the crown and are levied by a different set of officers  those modes of taxation by stampduties and by duties upon registration are of very modern invention in the course of little more than a century however stampduties have in europe become almost universal and duties upon registration extremely common there is no art which one government sooner learns of another than that of draining money from the pockets of the people  taxes upon the transference of property from the dead to the living fall finally as well as immediately upon the person to whom the property is transferred taxes upon the sale of land fall altogether upon the seller the seller is almost always under the necessity of selling and must therefore take such a price as he can get the buyer is scarce ever under the necessity of buying and will therefore give only such a price as he likes he considers what the land will cost him in tax and price together the more he is obliged to pay in the way of tax the less he will be disposed to give in the way of price such taxes therefore fall almost always upon a necessitous person and must therefore be frequently very cruel and oppressive taxes upon the sale of newbuilt houses where the building is sold without the ground fall generally upon the buyer because the builder must generally have his profit otherwise he must give up the trade if he advances the tax therefore the buyer must generally repay it to him taxes upon the sale of old houses for the same reason as those upon the sale of land fall generally upon the seller whom in most cases either convenience or necessity obliges to sell the number of new built houses that are annually brought to market is more or less regulated by the demand unless the demand is such as to afford the builder his profit after paying all expenses he will build no more houses the number of old houses which happen at any time to come to market is regulated by accidents of which the greater part have no relation to the demand two or three great bankruptcies in a mercantile town will bring many houses to sale which must be sold for what can be got for them taxes upon the sale of groundrents fall altogether upon the seller for the same reason as those upon the sale of land stamp duties and duties upon the registration of bonds and contracts for borrowed money fall altogether upon the borrower and in fact are always paid by him duties of the same kind upon law proceedings fall upon the suitors they reduce to both the capital value of the subject in dispute the more it costs to acquire any property the less must be the value of it when acquired  all taxes upon the transference of property of every kind so far as they diminish the capital value of that property tend to diminish the funds destined for the maintenance of productive labor they are all more or less unthrifty taxes that increase the revenue of the sovereign which seldom maintains any but unproductive laborers at the expense of the capital of the people which maintains none but productive  such taxes even when they are proportioned to the value of the property transferred are still unequal the frequency of transference not being always equal in property of equal value when they are not proportioned to this value which is the case with the greater part of the stampduties and duties of registration they are still more so they are in no respect arbitrary but are or may be in all cases perfectly clear and certain though they sometimes fall upon the person who is not very able to pay the time of payment is in most cases sufficiently convenient for him when the payment becomes due he must in most cases have the money to pay they are levied at very little expense and in general subject the contributors to no other inconveniency besides always the unavoidable one of paying the tax  in france the stampduties are not much complained of those of registration which they call the control are they give occasion it is pretended to much extortion in the officers of the farmers general who collect the tax which is in a great measure arbitrary and uncertain in the greater part of the libels which have been written against the present system of finances in france the abuses of the control make a principal article uncertainty however does not seem to be necessarily inherent in the nature of such taxes if the popular complaints are well founded the abuse must arise not so much from the nature of the tax as from the want of precision and distinctness in the words of the edicts or laws which impose it  the registration of mortgages and in general of all rights upon immovable property as it gives great security both to creditors and purchasers is extremely advantageous to the public that of the greater part of deeds of other kinds is frequently inconvenient and even dangerous to individuals without any advantage to the public all registers which it is acknowledged ought to be kept secret ought certainly never to exist the credit of individuals ought certainly never to depend upon so very slender a security as the probity and religion of the inferior officers of revenue but where the fees of registration have been made a source of revenue to the sovereign register offices have commonly been multiplied without end both for the deeds which ought to be registered and for those which ought not in france there are several different sorts of secret registers this abuse though not perhaps a necessary it must be acknowledged is a very natural effect of such taxes  such stampduties as those in england upon cards and dice upon newspapers and periodical pamphlets etc are properly taxes upon consumption the final payment falls upon the persons who use or consume such commodities such stampduties as those upon licenses to retail ale wine and spirituous liquors though intended perhaps to fall upon the profits of the retailers are likewise finally paid by the consumers of those liquors such taxes though called by the same name and levied by the same officers and in the same manner with the stampduties above mentioned upon the transference of property are however of a quite different nature and fall upon quite different funds  article iii taxes upon the wages of labor the wages of the inferior classes of workmen i have endeavored to show in the first book are every where necessarily regulated by two different circumstances the demand for labor and the ordinary or average price of provisions the demand for labor according as it happens to be either increasing stationary or declining or to require an increasing stationary or declining population regulates the subsistence of the labourer and determines in what degree it shall be either liberal moderate or scanty the ordinary or average price of provisions determines the quantity of money which must be paid to the workman in order to enable him one year with another to purchase this liberal moderate or scanty subsistence while the demand for labor and the price of provisions therefore remain the same a direct tax upon the wages of labor can have no other effect than to raise them somewhat higher than the tax let us suppose for example that in a particular place the demand for labor and the price of provisions were such as to render ten shillings a week the ordinary wages of labor and that a tax of onefifth or four shillings in the pound was imposed upon wages if the demand for labor and the price of provisions remained the same it would still be necessary that the labourer should in that place earn such a subsistence as could be bought only for ten shillings a week or that after paying the tax he should have ten shillings a week free wages but in order to leave him such free wages after paying such a tax the price of labor must in that place soon rise not to twelve shillings a week only but to twelve and sixpence that is in order to enable him to pay a tax of onefifth his wages must necessarily soon rise not onefifth part only but onefourth whatever was the proportion of the tax the wages of labor must in all cases rise not only in that proportion but in a higher proportion if the tax for example was onetenth the wages of labor must necessarily soon rise not onetenth part only but oneeighth  a direct tax upon the wages of labor therefore though the labourer might perhaps pay it out of his hand could not properly be said to be even advanced by him at least if the demand for labor and the average price of provisions remained the same after the tax as before it in all such cases not only the tax but something more than the tax would in reality be advanced by the person who immediately employed him the final payment would in different cases fall upon different persons the rise which such a tax might occasion in the wages of manufacturing labor would be advanced by the master manufacturer who would both be entitled and obliged to charge it with a profit upon the price of his goods the final payment of this rise of wages therefore together with the additional profit of the master manufacturer would fall upon the consumer the rise which such a tax might occasion in the wages of country labor would be advanced by the farmer who in order to maintain the same number of laborers as before would be obliged to employ a greater capital in order to get back this greater capital together with the ordinary profits of stock it would be necessary that he should retain a larger portion or what comes to the same thing the price of a larger portion of the produce of the land and consequently that he should pay less rent to the landlord the final payment of this rise of wages therefore would in this case fall upon the landlord together with the additional profit of the farmer who had advanced it in all cases a direct tax upon the wages of labor must in the long run occasion both a greater reduction in the rent of land and a greater rise in the price of manufactured goods than would have followed from the proper assessment of a sum equal to the produce of the tax partly upon the rent of land and partly upon consumable commodities  if direct taxes upon the wages of labor have not always occasioned a proportionable rise in those wages it is because they have generally occasioned a considerable fall in the demand for labor the declension of industry the decrease of employment for the poor the diminution of the annual produce of the land and labor of the country have generally been the effects of such taxes in consequence of them however the price of labor must always be higher than it otherwise would have been in the actual state of the demand and this enhancement of price together with the profit of those who advance it must always be finally paid by the landlords and consumers  a tax upon the wages of country labor does not raise the price of the rude produce of land for the same reason that a tax upon the farmers profit does not raise that price  absurd and destructive as such taxes are however they take place in many countries in france that part of the taille which is charged upon the industry of workmen and daylabourers in country villages is properly a tax of this kind their wages are computed according to the common rate of the district in which they reside and that they may be as little liable as possible to any overcharge their yearly gains are estimated at no more than two hundred working days in the year id tom ii p  0   the tax of each individual is varied from year to year according to different circumstances of which the collector or the commissary whom the intendant appoints to assist him are the judges in bohemia in consequence of the alteration in the system of finances which was begun in      a very heavy tax is imposed upon the industry of artificers they are divided into four classes the highest class pay a hundred florins a year which at two and twentypence halfpenny a florin amounts to  l  s  d the second class are taxed at seventy the third at fifty and the fourth comprehending artificers in villages and the lowest class of those in towns at twentyfive florins id tom iii p      the recompense of ingenious artists and of men of liberal professions i have endeavored to show in the first book necessarily keeps a certain proportion to the emoluments of inferior trades a tax upon this recompense therefore could have no other effect than to raise it somewhat higher than in proportion to the tax if it did not rise in this manner the ingenious arts and the liberal professions being no longer upon a level with other trades would be so much deserted that they would soon return to that level  the emoluments of offices are not like those of trades and professions regulated by the free competition of the market and do not therefore always bear a just proportion to what the nature of the employment requires they are perhaps in most countries higher than it requires the persons who have the administration of government being generally disposed to reward both themselves and their immediate dependents rather more than enough the emoluments of offices therefore can in most cases very well bear to be taxed the persons besides who enjoy public offices especially the more lucrative are in all countries the objects of general envy and a tax upon their emoluments even though it should be somewhat higher than upon any other sort of revenue is always a very popular tax in england for example when by the land tax every other sort of revenue was supposed to be assessed at four shillings in the pound it was very popular to lay a real tax of five shillings in the pound upon the salaries of offices which exceeded a hundred pounds a year those of the judges and a few others less obnoxious to envy excepted there are in england no other direct taxes upon the wages of labor  article iv taxes which it is intended should fall indifferently upon everydifferent species of revenue the taxes which it is intended should fall indifferently upon every different species of revenue are capitation taxes and taxes upon consumable commodities these must be paid indifferently from whatever revenue the contributors may possess from the rent of their land from the profits of their stock or from the wages of their labor  capitation taxes capitation taxes if it is attempted to proportion them to the fortune or revenue of each contributor become altogether arbitrary the state of a mans fortune varies from day to day and without an inquisition more intolerable than any tax and renewed at least once every year can only be guessed at his assessment therefore must in most cases depend upon the good or bad humor of his assessors and must therefore be altogether arbitrary and uncertain  capitation taxes if they are proportioned not to the supposed fortune but to the rank of each contributor become altogether unequal the degrees of fortune being frequently unequal in the same degree of rank  such taxes therefore if it is attempted to render them equal become altogether arbitrary and uncertain and if it is attempted to render them certain and not arbitrary became altogether unequal let the tax be light or heavy uncertainty is always a great grievance in a light tax a considerable degree of inequality may be supported in a heavy one it is altogether intolerable  in the different polltaxes which took place in england during the reign of william iii the contributors were the greater part of them assessed according to the degree of their rank as dukes marquisses earls viscounts barons esquires gentlemen the eldest and youngest sons of peers etc all shopkeepers and tradesmen worth more than three hundred pounds that is the better sort of them were subject to the same assessment how great soever might be the difference in their fortunes their rank was more considered than their fortune several of those who in the first polltax were rated according to their supposed fortune were afterward rated according to their rank sergeants attorneys and proctors at law who in the first polltax were assessed at three shillings in the pound of their supposed income were afterward assessed as gentlemen in the assessment of a tax which was not very heavy a considerable degree of inequality had been found less insupportable than any degree of uncertainty  in the capitation which has been levied in france without any interruption since the beginning of the present century the highest orders of people are rated according to their rank by an invariable tarif the lower orders of people according to what is supposed to be their fortune by an assessment which varies from year to year the officers of the kings court the judges and other officers in the superior courts of justice the officers of the troops etc are assessed in the first manner the inferior ranks of people in the provinces are assessed in the second in france the great easily submit to a considerable degree of inequality in a tax which so far as it affects them is not a very heavy one but could not brook the arbitrary assessment of an intendant the inferior ranks of people must in that country suffer patiently the usage which their superiors think proper to give them  in england the different polltaxes never produced the sum which had been expected from them or which it was supposed they might have produced had they been exactly levied in france the capitation always produces the sum expected from it the mild government of england when it assessed the different ranks of people to the polltax contented itself with what that assessment happened to produce and required no compensation for the loss which the state might sustain either by those who could not pay or by those who would not pay for there were many such and who by the indulgent execution of the law were not forced to pay the more severe government of france assesses upon each generality a certain sum which the intendant must find as he can if any province complains of being assessed too high it may in the assessment of next year obtain an abatement proportioned to the overcharge of the year before but it must pay in the meantime the intendant in order to be sure of finding the sum assessed upon his generality was empowered to assess it in a larger sum that the failure or inability of some of the contributors might be compensated by the overcharge of the rest and till      the fixation of this surplus assessment was left altogether to his discretion in that year indeed the council assumed this power to itself in the capitation of the provinces it is observed by the perfectlywell informed author of the memoirs upon the impositions in france the portion which falls upon the nobility and upon those whose privileges exempt them from the taille is the least considerable the largest falls upon those subject to the taille who are assessed to the capitation at so much a pound of what they pay to that other tax  capitation taxes so far as they are levied upon the lower ranks of people are direct taxes upon the wages of labor and are attended with all the inconveniences of such taxes  capitation taxes are levied at little expense and where they are rigorously exacted afford a very sure revenue to the state it is upon this account that in countries where the ease comfort and security of the inferior ranks of people are little attended to capitation taxes are very common it is in general however but a small part of the public revenue which in a great empire has ever been drawn from such taxes and the greatest sum which they have ever afforded might always have been found in some other way much more convenient to the people  taxes upon consumable commodities the impossibility of taxing the people in proportion to their revenue by any capitation seems to have given occasion to the invention of taxes upon consumable commodities the state not knowing how to tax directly and proportionably the revenue of its subjects endeavors to tax it indirectly by taxing their expense which it is supposed will in most cases be nearly in proportion to their revenue their expense is taxed by taxing the consumable commodities upon which it is laid out  consumable commodities are either necessaries or luxuries  by necessaries i understand not only the commodities which are indispensibly necessary for the support of life but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people even of the lowest order to be without a linen shirt for example is strictly speaking not a necessary of life the greeks and romans lived i suppose very comfortably though they had no linen but in the present times through the greater part of europe a creditable daylabourer would be ashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt the want of which would be supposed to denote that disgraceful degree of poverty which it is presumed no body can well fall into without extreme bad conduct custom in the same manner has rendered leather shoes a necessary of life in england the poorest creditable person of either sex would be ashamed to appear in public without them in scotland custom has rendered them a necessary of life to the lowest order of men but not to the same order of women who may without any discredit walk about barefooted in france they are necessaries neither to men nor to women the lowest rank of both sexes appearing there publicly without any discredit sometimes in wooden shoes and sometimes barefooted under necessaries therefore i comprehend not only those things which nature but those things which the established rules of decency have rendered necessary to the lowest rank of people all other things i call luxuries without meaning by this appellation to throw the smallest degree of reproach upon the temperate use of them beer and ale for example in great britain and wine even in the wine countries i call luxuries a man of any rank may without any reproach abstain totally from tasting such liquors nature does not render them necessary for the support of life and custom no where renders it indecent to live without them  as the wages of labor are every where regulated partly by the demand for it and partly by the average price of the necessary articles of subsistence whatever raises this average price must necessarily raise those wages so that the labourer may still be able to purchase that quantity of those necessary articles which the state of the demand for labor whether increasing stationary or declining requires that he should have see book i cap    a tax upon those articles necessarily raises their price somewhat higher than the amount of the tax because the dealer who advances the tax must generally get it back with a profit such a tax must therefore occasion a rise in the wages of labor proportionable to this rise of price  it is thus that a tax upon the necessaries of life operates exactly in the same manner as a direct tax upon the wages of labor the labourer though he may pay it out of his hand cannot for any considerable time at least be properly said even to advance it it must always in the longrun be advanced to him by his immediate employer in the advanced rate of his wages his employer if he is a manufacturer will charge upon the price of his goods this rise of wages together with a profit so that the final payment of the tax together with this overcharge will fall upon the consumer if his employer is a farmer the final payment together with a like overcharge will fall upon the rent of the landlord  it is otherwise with taxes upon what i call luxuries even upon those of the poor the rise in the price of the taxed commodities will not necessarily occasion any rise in the wages of labor a tax upon tobacco for example though a luxury of the poor as well as of the rich will not raise wages though it is taxed in england at three times and in france at fifteen times its original price those high duties seem to have no effect upon the wages of labor the same thing may be said of the taxes upon tea and sugar which in england and holland have become luxuries of the lowest ranks of people and of those upon chocolate which in spain is said to have become so the different taxes which in great britain have in the course of the present century been imposed upon spirituous liquors are not supposed to have had any effect upon the wages of labor the rise in the price of porten occasioned by an additional tax of three shillings upon the barrel of strong beer has not raised the wages of common labor in london these were about eighteenpence and twentypence a day before the tax and they are not more now  the high price of such commodities does not necessarily diminish the ability of the inferior ranks of people to bring up families upon the sober and industrious poor taxes upon such commodities act as sumptuary laws and dispose them either to moderate or to refrain altogether from the use of superfluities which they can no longer easily afford their ability to bring up families in consequence of this forced frugality instead of being diminished is frequently perhaps increased by the tax it is the sober and industrious poor who generally bring up the most numerous families and who principally supply the demand for useful labor all the poor indeed are not sober and industrious and the dissolute and disorderly might continue to indulge themselves in the use of such commodities after this rise of price in the same manner as before without regarding the distress which this indulgence might bring upon their families such disorderly persons however seldom rear up numerous families their children generally perishing from neglect mismanagement and the scantiness or unwholesomeness of their food if by the strength of their constitution they survive the hardships to which the bad conduct of their parents exposes them yet the example of that bad conduct commonly corrupts their morals so that instead of being useful to society by their industry they become public nuisances by their vices and disorders though the advanced price of the luxuries of the poor therefore might increase somewhat the distress of such disorderly families and thereby diminish somewhat their ability to bring up children it would not probably diminish much the useful population of the country  any rise in the average price of necessaries unless it is compensated by a proportionable rise in the wages of labor must necessarily diminish more or less the ability of the poor to bring up numerous families and consequently to supply the demand for useful labor whatever may be the state of that demand whether increasing stationary or declining or such as requires an increasing stationary or declining population  taxes upon luxuries have no tendency to raise the price of any other commodities except that of the commodities taxed taxes upon necessaries by raising the wages of labor necessarily tend to raise the price of all manufactures and consequently to diminish the extent of their sale and consumption taxes upon luxuries are finally paid by the consumers of the commodities taxed without any retribution they fall indifferently upon every species of revenue the wages of labor the profits of stock and the rent of land taxes upon necessaries so far as they affect the laboring poor are finally paid partly by landlords in the diminished rent of their lands and partly by rich consumers whether landlords or others in the advanced price of manufactured goods and always with a considerable overcharge the advanced price of such manufactures as are real necessaries of life and are destined for the consumption of the poor of coarse woollens for example must be compensated to the poor by a farther advancement of their wages the middling and superior ranks of people if they understood their own interest ought always to oppose all taxes upon the necessaries of life as well as all direct taxes upon the wages of labor the final payment of both the one and the other falls altogether upon themselves and always with a considerable overcharge they fall heaviest upon the landlords who always pay in a double capacity in that of landlords by the reduction of their rent and in that of rich consumers by the increase of their expense the observation of sir matthew decker that certain taxes are in the price of certain goods sometimes repeated and accumulated four or five times is perfectly just with regard to taxes upon the necessaries of life in the price of leather for example you must pay not only for the tax upon the leather of your own shoes but for a part of that upon those of the shoemaker and the tanner you must pay too for the tax upon the salt upon the soap and upon the candles which those workmen consume while employed in your service and for the tax upon the leather which the saltmaker the soapmaker and the candlemaker consume while employed in their service  in great britain the principal taxes upon the necessaries of life are those upon the four commodities just now mentioned salt leather soap and candles  salt is a very ancient and a very universal subject of taxation it was taxed among the romans and it is so at present in i believe every part of europe the quantity annually consumed by any individual is so small and may be purchased so gradually that nobody it seems to have been thought could feel very sensibly even a pretty heavy tax upon it it is in england taxed at three shillings a bushel about three times the original price of the commodity in some other countries the tax is still higher leather is a real necessary of life the use of linen renders soap such in countries where the winter nights are long candles are a necessary instrument of trade leather and soap are in great britain taxed at three halfpence a pound candles at a penny taxes which upon the original price of leather may amount to about eight or ten per cent upon that of soap to about twenty or five and twenty per cent and upon that of candles to about fourteen or fifteen per cent taxes which though lighter than that upon salt are still very heavy as all those four commodities are real necessaries of life such heavy taxes upon them must increase somewhat the expense of the sober and industrious poor and must consequently raise more or less the wages of their labor  in a country where the winters are so cold as in great britain fuel is during that season in the strictest sense of the word a necessary of life not only for the purpose of dressing victuals but for the comfortable subsistence of many different sorts of workmen who work within doors and coals are the cheapest of all fuel the price of fuel has so important an influence upon that of labor that all over great britain manufactures have confined themselves principally to the coal countries other parts of the country on account of the high price of this necessary article not being able to work so cheap in some manufactures besides coal is a necessary instrument of trade as in those of glass iron and all other metals if a bounty could in any case be reasonable it might perhaps be so upon the transportation of coals from those parts of the country in which they abound to those in which they are wanted but the legislature instead of a bounty has imposed a tax of three shillings and threepence a ton upon coal carried coastways which upon most sorts of coal is more than sixty per cent of the original price at the coalpit coals carried either by land or by inland navigation pay no duty where they are naturally cheap they are consumed duty free where they are naturally dear they are loaded with a heavy duty  such taxes though they raise the price of subsistence and consequently the wages of labor yet they afford a considerable revenue to government which it might not be easy to find in any other way there may therefore be good reasons for continuing them the bounty upon the exportation of corn so far as it tends in the actual state of tillage to raise the price of that necessary article produces all the like bad effects and instead of affording any revenue frequently occasions a very great expense to government the high duties upon the importation of foreign corn which in years of moderate plenty amount to a prohibition and the absolute prohibition of the importation either of live cattle or of salt provisions which takes place in the ordinary state of the law and which on account of the scarcity is at present suspended for a limited time with regard to ireland and the british plantations have all the bad effects of taxes upon the necessaries of life and produce no revenue to government nothing seems necessary for the repeal of such regulations but to convince the public of the futility of that system in consequence of which they have been established  taxes upon the necessaries of life are much higher in many other countries than in great britain duties upon flour and meal when ground at the mill and upon bread when baked at the oven take place in many countries in holland the money price of the bread consumed in towns is supposed to be doubled by means of such taxes in lieu of a part of them the people who live in the country pay every year so much a head according to the sort of bread they are supposed to consume those who consume wheaten bread pay three gilders fifteen stivers about six shillings and ninepence halfpenny these and some other taxes of the same kind by raising the price of labor are said to have ruined the greater part of the manufactures of holland memoires concernant les droits etc p   0     similar taxes though not quite so heavy take place in the milanese in the states of genoa in the duchy of modena in the dutchies of parma placentia and guastalla and in the ecclesiastical state a french author le reformateur of some note has proposed to reform the finances of his country by substituting in the room of the greater part of other taxes this most ruinous of all taxes there is nothing so absurd says cicero which has not sometimes been asserted by some philosophers  taxes upon butchers meat are still more common than those upon bread it may indeed be doubted whether butchers meat is any where a necessary of life grain and other vegetables with the help of milk cheese and butter or oil where butter is not to be had it is known from experience can without any butchers meat afford the most plentiful the most wholesome the most nourishing and the most invigorating diet decency no where requires that any man should eat butchers meat as it in most places requires that he should wear a linen shirt or a pair of leather shoes  consumable commodities whether necessaries or luxuries may be taxed in two different ways the consumer may either pay an annual sum on account of his using or consuming goods of a certain kind or the goods may be taxed while they remain in the hands of the dealer and before they are delivered to the consumer the consumable goods which last a considerable time before they are consumed altogether are most properly taxed in the one way those of which the consumption is either immediate or more speedy in the other the coachtax and platetax are examples of the former method of imposing the greater part of the other duties of excise and customs of the latter  a coach may with good management last ten or twelve years it might be taxed once for all before it comes out of the hands of the coachmaker but it is certainly more convenient for the buyer to pay four pounds a year for the privilege of keeping a coach than to pay all at once forty or fortyeight pounds additional price to the coachmaker or a sum equivalent to what the tax is likely to cost him during the time he uses the same coach a service of plate in the same manner may last more than a century it is certainly easier for the consumer to pay five shillings a year for every hundred ounces of plate near one per cent of the value than to redeem this long annuity at five and twenty or thirty years purchase which would enhance the price at least five and twenty or thirty per cent the different taxes which affect houses are certainly more conveniently paid by moderate annual payments than by a heavy tax of equal value upon the first building or sale of the house  it was the well known proposal of sir matthew decker that all commodities even those of which the consumption is either immediate or very speedy should be taxed in this manner the dealer advancing nothing but the consumer paying a certain annual sum for the license to consume certain goods the object of his scheme was to promote all the different branches of foreign trade particularly the carrying trade by taking away all duties upon importation and exportation and thereby enabling the merchant to employ his whole capital and credit in the purchase of goods and the freight of ships no part of either being diverted toward the advancing of taxes the project however of taxing in this manner goods of immediate or speedy consumption seems liable to the four following very important objections first the tax would be more unequal or not so well proportioned to the expense and consumption of the different contributors as in the way in which it is commonly imposed the taxes upon ale wine and spirituous liquors which are advanced by the dealers are finally paid by the different consumers exactly in proportion to their respective consumption but if the tax was to be paid by purchasing a license to drink those liquors the sober would in proportion to his consumption be taxed much more heavily than the drunken consumer a family which exercised great hospitality would be taxed much more lightly than one which entertained fewer guests secondly this mode of taxation by paying for an annual halfyearly or quarterly license to consume certain goods would diminish very much one of the principal conveniences of taxes upon goods of speedy consumption the piecemeal payment in the price of threepence halfpenny which is at present paid for a pot of porter the different taxes upon malt hops and beer together with the extraordinary profit which the brewer charges for having advanced them may perhaps amount to about three halfpence if a workman can conveniently spare those three halfpence he buys a pot of porter if he cannot he contents himself with a pint and as a penny saved is a penny got he thus gains a farthing by his temperance he pays the tax piecemeal as he can afford to pay it and when he can afford to pay it and every act of payment is perfectly voluntary and what he can avoid if he chooses to do so thirdly such taxes would operate less as sumptuary laws when the license was once purchased whether the purchaser drunk much or drunk little his tax would be the same fourthly if a workman was to pay all at once by yearly halfyearly or quarterly payments a tax equal to what he at present pays with little or no inconveniency upon all the different pots and pints of porter which he drinks in any such period of time the sum might frequently distress him very much this mode of taxation therefore it seems evident could never without the most grievous oppression produce a revenue nearly equal to what is derived from the present mode without any oppression in several countries however commodities of an immediate or very speedy consumption are taxed in this manner in holland people pay so much a head for a license to drink tea i have already mentioned a tax upon bread which so far as it is consumed in farmhouses and country villages is there levied in the same manner  the duties of excise are imposed chiefly upon goods of home produce destined for home consumption they are imposed only upon a few sorts of goods of the most general use there can never be any doubt either concerning the goods which are subject to those duties or concerning the particular duty which each species of goods is subject to they fall almost altogether upon what i call luxuries excepting always the four duties abovementioned upon salt soap leather candles and perhaps that upon green glass  the duties of customs are much more ancient than those of excise they seem to have been called customs as denoting customary payments which had been in use from time immemorial they appear to have been originally considered as taxes upon the profits of merchants during the barbarous times of feudal anarchy merchants like all the other inhabitants of burghs were considered as little better than emancipated bondmen whose persons were despised and whose gains were envied the great nobility who had consented that the king should tallage the profits of their own tenants were not unwilling that he should tallage likewise those of an order of men whom it was much less their interest to protect in those ignorant times it was not understood that the profits of merchants are a subject not taxable directly or that the final payment of all such taxes must fall with a considerable overcharge upon the consumers  the gains of alien merchants were looked upon more unfavourably than those of english merchants it was natural therefore that those of the former should be taxed more heavily than those of the latter this distinction between the duties upon aliens and those upon english merchants which was begun from ignorance has been continued from the spirit of monopoly or in order to give our own merchants an advantage both in the home and in the foreign market  with this distinction the ancient duties of customs were imposed equally upon all sorts of goods necessaries as well as luxuries goods exported as well as goods imported why should the dealers in one sort of goods it seems to have been thought be more favored than those in another or why should the merchant exporter be more favored than the merchant importer  the ancient customs were divided into three branches the first and perhaps the most ancient of all those duties was that upon wool and leather it seems to have been chiefly or altogether an exportation duty when the woollen manufacture came to be established in england lest the king should lose any part of his customs upon wool by the exportation of woollen cloths a like duty was imposed upon them the other two branches were first a duty upon wine which being imposed at so much a ton was called a tonnage and secondly a duty upon all other goods which being imposed at so much a pound of their supposed value was called a poundage in the fortyseventh year of edward iii a duty of sixpence in the pound was imposed upon all goods exported and imported except wools woolfells leather and wines which were subject to particular duties in the fourteenth of richard ii this duty was raised to one shilling in the pound but three years afterward it was again reduced to sixpence it was raised to eightpence in the second year of henry iv and in the fourth year of the same prince to one shilling from this time to the ninth year of william iii this duty continued at one shilling in the pound the duties of tonnage and poundage were generally granted to the king by one and the same act of parliament and were called the subsidy of tonnage and poundage the subsidy of poundage having continued for so long a time at one shilling in the pound or at five per cent a subsidy came in the language of the customs to denote a general duty of this kind of five per cent this subsidy which is now called the old subsidy still continues to be levied according to the book of rates established in the twelfth of charles ii the method of ascertaining by a book of rates the value of goods subject to this duty is said to be older than the time of james i the new subsidy imposed by the ninth and tenth of william iii was an additional five per cent upon the greater part of goods the onethird and the twothird subsidy made up between them another five per cent of which they were proportionable parts the subsidy of      made a fourth five per cent upon the greater part of goods and that of      a fifth upon some particular sorts of goods besides those five subsidies a great variety of other duties have occasionally been imposed upon particular sorts of goods in order sometimes to relieve the exigencies of the state and sometimes to regulate the trade of the country according to the principles of the mercantile system  that system has come gradually more and more into fashion the old subsidy was imposed indifferently upon exportation as well as importation the four subsequent subsidies as well as the other duties which have since been occasionally imposed upon particular sorts of goods have with a few exceptions been laid altogether upon importation the greater part of the ancient duties which had been imposed upon the exportation of the goods of home produce and manufacture have either been lightened or taken away altogether in most cases they have been taken away bounties have even been given upon the exportation of some of them drawbacks too sometimes of the whole and in most cases of a part of the duties which are paid upon the importation of foreign goods have been granted upon their exportation only half the duties imposed by the old subsidy upon importation are drawn back upon exportation but the whole of those imposed by the later subsidies and other imposts are upon the greater part of goods drawn back in the same manner this growing favor of exportation and discouragement of importation have suffered only a few exceptions which chiefly concern the materials of some manufactures these our merchants and manufacturers are willing should come as cheap as possible to themselves and as dear as possible to their rivals and competitors in other countries foreign materials are upon this account sometimes allowed to be imported duty free spanish wool for example flax and raw linen yarn the exportation of the materials of home produce and of those which are the peculiar produce of our colonies has sometimes been prohibited and sometimes subjected to higher duties the exportation of english wool has been prohibited that of beaver skins of beaver wool and of gum senega has been subjected to higher duties great britain by the conquest of canada and senegal having got almost the monopoly of those commodities  that the mercantile system has not been very favorable to the revenue of the great body of the people to the annual produce of the land and labor of the country i have endeavored to show in the fourth book of this inquiry it seems not to have been more favorable to the revenue of the sovereign so far at least as that revenue depends upon the duties of customs  in consequence of that system the importation of several sorts of goods has been prohibited altogether this prohibition has in some cases entirely prevented and in others very much diminished the importation of those commodities by reducing the importers to the necessity of smuggling it has entirely prevented the importation of foreign woollens and it has very much diminished that of foreign silks and velvets in both cases it has entirely annihilated the revenue of customs which might have been levied upon such importation  the high duties which have been imposed upon the importation of many different sorts of foreign goods in order to discourage their consumption in great britain have in many cases served only to encourage smuggling and in all cases have reduced the revenue of the customs below what more moderate duties would have afforded the saying of dr swift that in the arithmetic of the customs two and two instead of making four make sometimes only one holds perfectly true with regard to such heavy duties which never could have been imposed had not the mercantile system taught us in many cases to employ taxation as an instrument not of revenue but of monopoly  the bounties which are sometimes given upon the exportation of home produce and manufactures and the drawbacks which are paid upon the reexportation of the greater part of foreign goods have given occasion to many frauds and to a species of smuggling more destructive of the public revenue than any other in order to obtain the bounty or drawback the goods it is well known are sometimes shipped and sent to sea but soon afterward clandestinely relanded in some other part of the country the defalcation of the revenue of customs occasioned by bounties and drawbacks of which a great part are obtained fraudulently is very great the gross produce of the customs in the year which ended on the  th of january      amounted to  0  000l the bounties which were paid out of this revenue though in that year there was no bounty upon corn amounted to     00l the drawbacks which were paid upon debentures and certificates to      00l bounties and drawbacks together amounted to      00l in consequence of these deductions the revenue of the customs amounted only to      00l from which deducting     00l for the expense of management in salaries and other incidents the neat revenue of the customs for that year comes out to be      00l the expense of management amounts in this manner to between five and six per cent upon the gross revenue of the customs and to something more than ten per cent upon what remains of that revenue after deducting what is paid away in bounties and drawbacks  heavy duties being imposed upon almost all goods imported our merchant importers smuggle as much and make entry of as little as they can our merchant exporters on the contrary make entry of more than they export sometimes out of vanity and to pass for great dealers in goods which pay no duty and sometimes to gain a bounty or a drawback our exports in consequence of these different frauds appear upon the customhouse books greatly to overbalance our imports to the unspeakable comfort of those politicians who measure the national prosperity by what they call the balance of trade  all goods imported unless particularly exempted and such exemptions are not very numerous are liable to some duties of customs if any goods are imported not mentioned in the book of rates they are taxed at  s  d   0 for every twenty shillings value according to the oath of the importer that is nearly at five subsidies or five poundage duties the book of rates is extremely comprehensive and enumerates a great variety of articles many of them little used and therefore not well known it is upon this account frequently uncertain under what article a particular sort of goods ought to be classed and consequently what duty they ought to pay mistakes with regard to this sometimes ruin the customhouse officer and frequently occasion much trouble expense and vexation to the importer in point of perspicuity precision and distinctness therefore the duties of customs are much inferior to those of excise  in order that the greater part of the members of any society should contribute to the public revenue in proportion to their respective expense it does not seem necessary that every single article of that expense should be taxed the revenue which is levied by the duties of excise is supposed to fall as equally upon the contributors as that which is levied by the duties of customs and the duties of excise are imposed upon a few articles only of the most general use and consumption it has been the opinion of many people that by proper management the duties of customs might likewise without any loss to the public revenue and with great advantage to foreign trade be confined to a few articles only  the foreign articles of the most general use and consumption in great britain seem at present to consist chiefly in foreign wines and brandies in some of the productions of america and the west indies sugar rum tobacco cacaonuts etc and in some of those of the east indies tea coffee chinaware spiceries of all kinds several sorts of piece goods etc these different articles afford perhaps at present the greater part of the revenue which is drawn from the duties of customs the taxes which at present subsist upon foreign manufactures if you except those upon the few contained in the foregoing enumeration have the greater part of them been imposed for the purpose not of revenue but of monopoly or to give our own merchants an advantage in the home market by removing all prohibitions and by subjecting all foreign manufactures to such moderate taxes as it was found from experience afforded upon each article the greatest revenue to the public our own workmen might still have a considerable advantage in the home market and many articles some of which at present afford no revenue to government and others a very inconsiderable one might afford a very great one  high taxes sometimes by diminishing the consumption of the taxed commodities and sometimes by encouraging smuggling frequently afford a smaller revenue to government than what might be drawn from more moderate taxes  when the diminution of revenue is the effect of the diminution of consumption there can be but one remedy and that is the lowering of the tax  when the diminution of revenue is the effect of the encouragement given to smuggling it may perhaps be remedied in two ways either by diminishing the temptation to smuggle or by increasing the difficulty of smuggling the temptation to smuggle can be diminished only by the lowering of the tax and the difficulty of smuggling can be increased only by establishing that system of administration which is most proper for preventing it  the excise laws it appears i believe from experience obstruct and embarrass the operations of the smuggler much more effectually than those of the customs by introducing into the customs a system of administration as similar to that of the excise as the nature of the different duties will admit the difficulty of smuggling might be very much increased this alteration it has been supposed by many people might very easily be brought about  the importer of commodities liable to any duties of customs it has been said might at his option be allowed either to carry them to his own private warehouse or to lodge them in a warehouse provided either at his own expense or at that of the public but under the key of the customhouse officer and never to be opened but in his presence if the merchant carried them to his own private warehouse the duties to be immediately paid and never afterward to be drawn back and that warehouse to be at all times subject to the visit and examination of the customhouse officer in order to ascertain how far the quantity contained in it corresponded with that for which the duty had been paid if he carried them to the public warehouse no duty to be paid till they were taken out for home consumption if taken out for exportation to be dutyfree proper security being always given that they should be so exported the dealers in those particular commodities either by wholesale or retail to be at all times subject to the visit and examination of the customhouse officer and to be obliged to justify by proper certificates the payment of the duty upon the whole quantity contained in their shops or warehouses what are called the excise duties upon rum imported are at present levied in this manner and the same system of administration might perhaps be extended to all duties upon goods imported provided always that those duties were like the duties of excise confined to a few sorts of goods of the most general use and consumption if they were extended to almost all sorts of goods as at present public warehouses of sufficient extent could not easily be provided and goods of a very delicate nature or of which the preservation required much care and attention could not safely be trusted by the merchant in any warehouse but his own  if by such a system of administration smuggling to any considerable extent could be prevented even under pretty high duties and if every duty was occasionally either heightened or lowered according as it was most likely either the one way or the other to afford the greatest revenue to the state taxation being always employed as an instrument of revenue and never of monopoly it seems not improbable that a revenue at least equal to the present neat revenue of the customs might be drawn from duties upon the importation of only a few sorts of goods of the most general use and consumption and that the duties of customs might thus be brought to the same degree of simplicity certainty and precision as those of excise what the revenue at present loses by drawbacks upon the reexportation of foreign goods which are afterward relanded and consumed at home would under this system be saved altogether if to this saving which would alone be very considerable was added the abolition of all bounties upon the exportation of homeproduce in all cases in which those bounties were not in reality drawbacks of some duties of excise which had before been advanced it cannot well be doubted but that the neat revenue of customs might after an alteration of this kind be fully equal to what it had ever been before  if by such a change of system the public revenue suffered no loss the trade and manufactures of the country would certainly gain a very considerable advantage the trade in the commodities not taxed by far the greatest number would be perfectly free and might be carried on to and from all parts of the world with every possible advantage among those commodities would be comprehended all the necessaries of life and all the materials of manufacture so far as the free importation of the necessaries of life reduced their average money price in the homemarket it would reduce the money price of labor but without reducing in any respect its real recompense the value of money is in proportion to the quantity of the necessaries of life which it will purchase that of the necessaries of life is altogether independent of the quantity of money which can be had for them the reduction in the money price of labor would necessarily be attended with a proportionable one in that of all homemanufactures which would thereby gain some advantage in all foreign markets the price of some manufactures would be reduced in a still greater proportion by the free importation of the raw materials if raw silk could be imported from china and indostan dutyfree the silk manufacturers in england could greatly undersell those of both france and italy there would be no occasion to prohibit the importation of foreign silks and velvets the cheapness of their goods would secure to our own workmen not only the possession of the home but a very great command of the foreign market even the trade in the commodities taxed would be carried on with much more advantage than at present if those commodities were delivered out of the public warehouse for foreign exportation being in this case exempted from all taxes the trade in them would be perfectly free the carrying trade in all sorts of goods would under this system enjoy every possible advantage if those commodities were delivered out for homeconsumption the importer not being obliged to advance the tax till he had an opportunity of selling his goods either to some dealer or to some consumer he could always afford to sell them cheaper than if he had been obliged to advance it at the moment of importation under the same taxes the foreign trade of consumption even in the taxed commodities might in this manner be carried on with much more advantage than it can at present  it was the object of the famous excise scheme of sir robert walpole to establish with regard to wine and tobacco a system not very unlike that which is here proposed but though the bill which was then brought into parliament comprehended those two commodities only it was generally supposed to be meant as an introduction to a more extensive scheme of the same kind faction combined with the interest of smuggling merchants raised so violent though so unjust a clamor against that bill that the minister thought proper to drop it and from a dread of exciting a clamor of the same kind none of his successors have dared to resume the project  the duties upon foreign luxuries imported for homeconsumption though they sometimes fall upon the poor fall principally upon people of middling or more than middling fortune such are for example the duties upon foreign wines upon coffee chocolate tea sugar etc  the duties upon the cheaper luxuries of homeproduce destined for homeconsumption fall pretty equally upon people of all ranks in proportion to their respective expense the poor pay the duties upon malt hops beer and ale upon their own consumption the rich both upon their own consumption and upon that of their servants  the whole consumption of the inferior ranks of people or of those below the middling rank it must be observed is in every country much greater not only in quantity but in value than that of the middling and of those above the middling rank the whole expense of the inferior is much greater than that of the superior ranks in the first place almost the whole capital of every country is annually distributed among the inferior ranks of people as the wages of productive labor secondly a great part of the revenue arising both from the rent of land and from the profits of stock is annually distributed among the same rank in the wages and maintenance of menial servants and other unproductive laborers thirdly some part of the profits of stock belongs to the same rank as a revenue arising from the employment of their small capitals the amount of the profits annually made by small shopkeepers tradesmen and retailers of all kinds is every where very considerable and makes a very considerable portion of the annual produce fourthly and lastly some part even of the rent of land belongs to the same rank a considerable part to those who are somewhat below the middling rank and a small part even to the lowest rank common laborers sometimes possessing in property an acre or two of land though the expense of those inferior ranks of people therefore taking them individually is very small yet the whole mass of it taking them collectively amounts always to by much the largest portion of the whole expense of the society what remains of the annual produce of the land and labor of the country for the consumption of the superior ranks being always much less not only in quantity but in value the taxes upon expense therefore which fall chiefly upon that of the superior ranks of people upon the smaller portion of the annual produce are likely to be much less productive than either those which fall indifferently upon the expense of all ranks or even those which fall chiefly upon that of the inferior ranks than either those which fall indifferently upon the whole annual produce or those which fall chiefly upon the larger portion of it the excise upon the materials and manufacture of homemade fermented and spirituous liquors is accordingly of all the different taxes upon expense by far the most productive and this branch of the excise falls very much perhaps principally upon the expense of the common people in the year which ended on the  th of july      the gross produce of this branch of the excise amounted to        l    s  0d  it must always be remembered however that it is the luxurious and not the necessary expense of the inferior ranks of people that ought ever to be taxed the final payment of any tax upon their necessary expense would fall altogether upon the superior ranks of people upon the smaller portion of the annual produce and not upon the greater such a tax must in all cases either raise the wages of labor or lessen the demand for it it could not raise the wages of labor without throwing the final payment of the tax upon the superior ranks of people it could not lessen the demand for labor without lessening the annual produce of the land and labor of the country the fund from which all taxes must be finally paid whatever might be the state to which a tax of this kind reduced the demand for labor it must always raise wages higher than they otherwise would be in that state and the final payment of this enhancement of wages must in all cases fall upon the superior ranks of people  fermented liquors brewed and spirituous liquors distilled not for sale but for private use are not in great britain liable to any duties of excise this exemption of which the object is not to expose private families to the odious visit and examination of the taxgatherer occasions the burden of those duties to fall frequently much lighter upon the rich than upon the poor it is not indeed very common to distill for private use though it is done sometimes but in the country many middling and almost all rich and great families brew their own beer their strong beer therefore costs them eight shillings a barrel less than it costs the common brewer who must have his profit upon the tax as well as upon all the other expense which he advances such families therefore must drink their beer at least nine or ten shillings a barrel cheaper than any liquor of the same quality can be drunk by the common people to whom it is every where more convenient to buy their beer by little and little from the brewery or the alehouse malt in the same manner that is made for the use of a private family is not liable to the visit or examination of the taxgatherer but in this case the family must compound at seven shillings and sixpence a head for the tax seven shillings and sixpence are equal to the excise upon ten bushels of malt a quantity fully equal to what all the different members of any sober family men women and children are at an average likely to consume but in rich and great families where country hospitality is much practiced the malt liquors consumed by the members of the family make but a small part of the consumption of the house either on account of this composition however or for other reasons it is not near so common to malt as to brew for private use it is difficult to imagine any equitable reason why those who either brew or distill for private use should not be subject to a composition of the same kind  a greater revenue than what is at present drawn from all the heavy taxes upon malt beer and ale might be raised it has frequently been said by a much lighter tax upon malt the opportunities of defrauding the revenue being much greater in a brewery than in a malthouse and those who brew for private use being exempted from all duties or composition for duties which is not the case with those who malt for private use  in the porter brewery of london a quarter of malt is commonly brewed into more than two barrels and a half sometimes into three barrels of porter the different taxes upon malt amount to six shillings a quarter those upon strong beer and ale to eight shillings a barrel in the porter brewery therefore the different taxes upon malt beer and ale amount to between twentysix and thirty shillings upon the produce of a quarter of malt in the country brewery for common country sale a quarter of malt is seldom brewed into less than two barrels of strong and one barrel of small beer frequently into two barrels and a half of strong beer the different taxes upon small beer amount to one shilling and fourpence a barrel in the country brewery therefore the different taxes upon malt beer and ale seldom amount to less than twentythree shillings and fourpence frequently to twentysix shillings upon the produce of a quarter of malt taking the whole kingdom at an average therefore the whole amount of the duties upon malt beer and ale cannot be estimated at less than twentyfour or twentyfive shillings upon the produce of a quarter of malt but by taking off all the different duties upon beer and ale and by tripling the malttax or by raising it from six to eighteen shillings upon the quarter of malt a greater revenue it is said might be raised by this single tax than what is at present drawn from all those heavier taxes l s d in      the old malt tax produced    0         the additional            in      the old tax produced            the additional      0      in      the old tax produced             the additional   0        in      the old tax produced           the additional                     0     average of these four years               in      the country excise produced             the london brewery  0   0     in      the country excise      0      the london brewery  0  0      0 in      the country excise              the london brewery   0 0      in      the country excise             the london brewery      0                   average of these four years             to which adding the average malt tax or               the whole amount of those different taxes comes out to be                  but by tripling the malt tax or by raising it from six to eighteen shillings upon the quarter of malt that single tax would produce                a sum which exceeds the foregoing by   0              under the old malt tax indeed is comprehended a tax of four shillings upon the hogshead of cider and another of ten shillings upon the barrel of mum in      the tax upon cider produced only  0   l   s   d it probably fell somewhat short of its usual amount all the different taxes upon cider having that year produced less than ordinary the tax upon mum though much heavier is still less productive on account of the smaller consumption of that liquor but to balance whatever may be the ordinary amount of those two taxes there is comprehended under what is called the country excise first the old excise of six shillings and eightpence upon the hogshead of cider secondly a like tax of six shillings and eightpence upon the hogshead of verjuice thirdly another of eight shillings and ninepence upon the hogshead of vinegar and lastly a fourth tax of elevenpence upon the gallon of mead or metheglin the produce of those different taxes will probably much more than counterbalance that of the duties imposed by what is called the annual malt tax upon cider and mum  malt is consumed not only in the brewery of beer and ale but in the manufacture of low wines and spirits if the malt tax was to be raised to eighteen shillings upon the quarter it might be necessary to make some abatement in the different excises which are imposed upon those particular sorts of low wines and spirits of which malt makes any part of the materials in what are called malt spirits it makes commonly but a third part of the materials the other twothirds being either raw barley or onethird barley and onethird wheat in the distillery of malt spirits both the opportunity and the temptation to smuggle are much greater than either in a brewery or in a malthouse the opportunity on account of the smaller bulk and greater value of the commodity and the temptation on account of the superior height of the duties which amount to   s   d upon the gallon of spirits by increasing the duties upon malt and reducing those upon the distillery both the opportunities and the temptation to smuggle would be diminished which might occasion a still further augmentation of revenue  it has for some time past been the policy of great britain to discourage the consumption of spirituous liquors on account of their supposed tendency to ruin the health and to corrupt the morals of the common people according to this policy the abatement of the taxes upon the distillery ought not to be so great as to reduce in any respect the price of those liquors spirituous liquors might remain as dear as ever while at the same time the wholesome and invigorating liquors of beer and ale might be considerably reduced in their price the people might thus be in part relieved from one of the burdens of which they at present complain the most while at the same time the revenue might be considerably augmented  the objections of doctor davenant to this alteration in the present system of excise duties seem to be without foundation those objections are that the tax instead of dividing itself as at present pretty equally upon the profit of the maltster upon that of the brewer and upon that of the retailer would so far as it affected profit fall altogether upon that of the maltster that the maltster could not so easily get back the amount of the tax in the advanced price of his malt as the brewer and retailer in the advanced price of their liquor and that so heavy a tax upon malt might reduce the rent and profit of barley land  no tax can ever reduce for any considerable time the rate of profit in any particular trade which must always keep its level with other trades in the neighborhood the present duties upon malt beer and ale do not affect the profits of the dealers in those commodities who all get back the tax with an additional profit in the enhanced price of their goods a tax indeed may render the goods upon which it is imposed so dear as to diminish the consumption of them but the consumption of malt is in malt liquors and a tax of eighteen shillings upon the quarter of malt could not well render those liquors dearer than the different taxes amounting to twentyfour or twentyfive shillings do at present those liquors on the contrary would probably become cheaper and the consumption of them would be more likely to increase than to diminish  it is not very easy to understand why it should be more difficult for the maltster to get back eighteen shillings in the advanced price of his malt than it is at present for the brewer to get back twentyfour or twentyfive sometimes thirty shillings in that of his liquor the maltster indeed instead of a tax of six shillings would be obliged to advance one of eighteen shillings upon every quarter of malt but the brewer is at present obliged to advance a tax of twentyfour or twentyfive sometimes thirty shillings upon every quarter of malt which he brews it could not be more inconvenient for the maltster to advance a lighter tax than it is at present for the brewer to advance a heavier one the maltster does not always keep in his granaries a stock of malt which it will require a longer time to dispose of than the stock of beer and ale which the brewer frequently keeps in his cellars the former therefore may frequently get the returns of his money as soon as the latter but whatever inconveniency might arise to the maltster from being obliged to advance a heavier tax could easily be remedied by granting him a few months longer credit than is at present commonly given to the brewer  nothing could reduce the rent and profit of barley land which did not reduce the demand for barley but a change of system which reduced the duties upon a quarter of malt brewed into beer and ale from twentyfour and twentyfive shillings to eighteen shillings would be more likely to increase than diminish that demand the rent and profit of barley land besides must always be nearly equal to those of other equally fertile and equally well cultivated land if they were less some part of the barley land would soon be turned to some other purpose and if they were greater more land would soon be turned to the raising of barley when the ordinary price of any particular produce of land is at what may be called a monopoly price a tax upon it necessarily reduces the rent and profit of the land which grows it a tax upon the produce of those precious vineyards of which the wine falls so much short of the effectual demand that its price is always above the natural proportion to that of the produce of other equally fertile and equally well cultivated land would necessarily reduce the rent and profit of those vineyards the price of the wines being already the highest that could be got for the quantity commonly sent to market it could not be raised higher without diminishing that quantity and the quantity could not be diminished without still greater loss because the lands could not be turned to any other equally valuable produce the whole weight of the tax therefore would fall upon the rent and profit properly upon the rent of the vineyard when it has been proposed to lay any new tax upon sugar our sugar planters have frequently complained that the whole weight of such taxes fell not upon the consumer but upon the producer they never having been able to raise the price of their sugar after the tax higher than it was before the price had it seems before the tax been a monopoly price and the argument adduced to show that sugar was an improper subject of taxation demonstrated perhaps that it was a proper one the gains of monopolists whenever they can be come at being certainly of all subjects the most proper but the ordinary price of barley has never been a monopoly price and the rent and profit of barley land have never been above their natural proportion to those of other equally fertile and equally well cultivated land the different taxes which have been imposed upon malt beer and ale have never lowered the price of barley have never reduced the rent and profit of barley land the price of malt to the brewer has constantly risen in proportion to the taxes imposed upon it and those taxes together with the different duties upon beer and ale have constantly either raised the price or what comes to the same thing reduced the quality of those commodities to the consumer the final payment of those taxes has fallen constantly upon the consumer and not upon the producer  the only people likely to suffer by the change of system here proposed are those who brew for their own private use but the exemption which this superior rank of people at present enjoy from very heavy taxes which are paid by the poor labourer and artificer is surely most unjust and unequal and ought to be taken away even though this change was never to take place it has probably been the interest of this superior order of people however which has hitherto prevented a change of system that could not well fail both to increase the revenue and to relieve the people  besides such duties as those of customs and excise abovementioned there are several others which affect the price of goods more unequally and more indirectly of this kind are the duties which in french are called peages which in old saxon times were called duties of passage and which seem to have been originally established for the same purpose as our turnpike tolls or the tolls upon our canals and navigable rivers for the maintenance of the road or of the navigation those duties when applied to such purposes are most properly imposed according to the bulk or weight of the goods as they were originally local and provincial duties applicable to local and provincial purposes the administration of them was in most cases entrusted to the particular town parish or lordship in which they were levied such communities being in some way or other supposed to be accountable for the application the sovereign who is altogether unaccountable has in many countries assumed to himself the administration of those duties and though he has in most cases enhanced very much the duty he has in many entirely neglected the application if the turnpike tolls of great britain should ever become one of the resources of government we may learn by the example of many other nations what would probably be the consequence such tolls are no doubt finally paid by the consumer but the consumer is not taxed in proportion to his expense when he pays not according to the value but according to the bulk or weight of what he consumes when such duties are imposed not according to the bulk or weight but according to the supposed value of the goods they become properly a sort of inland customs or excises which obstruct very much the most important of all branches of commerce the interior commerce of the country  in some small states duties similar to those passage duties are imposed upon goods carried across the territory either by land or by water from one foreign country to another these are in some countries called transitduties some of the little italian states which are situated upon the po and the rivers which run into it derive some revenue from duties of this kind which are paid altogether by foreigners and which are perhaps the only duties that one state can impose upon the subjects of another without obstructing in any respect the industry or commerce of its own the most important transitduty in the world is that levied by the king of denmark upon all merchant ships which pass through the sound  such taxes upon luxuries as the greater part of the duties of customs and excise though they fall indifferently upon every different species of revenue and are paid finally or without any retribution by whoever consumes the commodities upon which they are imposed yet they do not always fall equally or proportionably upon the revenue of every individual as every mans humor regulates the degree of his consumption every man contributes rather according to his humor than in proportion to his revenue the profuse contribute more the parsimonious less than their proper proportion during the minority of a man of great fortune he contributes commonly very little by his consumption toward the support of that state from whose protection he derives a great revenue those who live in another country contribute nothing by their consumption toward the support of the government of that country in which is situated the source of their revenue if in this latter country there should be no land tax nor any considerable duty upon the transference either of moveable or of immovable property as is the case in ireland such absentees may derive a great revenue from the protection of a government to the support of which they do not contribute a single shilling this inequality is likely to be greatest in a country of which the government is in some respects subordinate and dependent upon that of some other the people who possess the most extensive property in the dependent will in this case generally choose to live in the governing country ireland is precisely in this situation and we cannot therefore wonder that the proposal of a tax upon absentees should be so very popular in that country it might perhaps be a little difficult to ascertain either what sort or what degree of absence should subject a man to be taxed as an absentee or at what precise time the tax should either begin or end if you except however this very peculiar situation any inequality in the contribution of individuals which can arise from such taxes is much more than compensated by the very circumstance which occasions that inequality the circumstance that every mans contribution is altogether voluntary it being altogether in his power either to consume or not to consume the commodity taxed where such taxes therefore are properly assessed and upon proper commodities they are paid with less grumbling than any other when they are advanced by the merchant or manufacturer the consumer who finally pays them soon comes to confound them with the price of the commodities and almost forgets that he pays any tax  such taxes are or may be perfectly certain or may be assessed so as to leave no doubt concerning either what ought to be paid or when it ought to be paid concerning either the quantity or the time of payment whatever uncertainty there may sometimes be either in the duties of customs in great britain or in other duties of the same kind in other countries it cannot arise from the nature of those duties but from the inaccurate or unskilful manner in which the law that imposes them is expressed  taxes upon luxuries generally are and always may be paid piecemeal or in proportion as the contributors have occasion to purchase the goods upon which they are imposed in the time and mode of payment they are or may be of all taxes the most convenient upon the whole such taxes therefore are perhaps as agreeable to the three first of the four general maxims concerning taxation as any other they offend in every respect against the fourth  such taxes in proportion to what they bring into the public treasury of the state always take out or keep out of the pockets of the people more than almost any other taxes they seem to do this in all the four different ways in which it is possible to do it  first the levying of such taxes even when imposed in the most judicious manner requires a great number of customhouse and excise officers whose salaries and perquisites are a real tax upon the people which brings nothing into the treasury of the state this expense however it must be acknowledged is more moderate in great britain than in most other countries in the year which ended on the fifth of july      the gross produce of the different duties under the management of the commissioners of excise in england amounted to        l  s  0d which was levied at an expense of little more than five and a half per cent from this gross produce however there must be deducted what was paid away in bounties and drawbacks upon the exportation of exciseable goods which will reduce the neat produce below five millions the levying of the salt duty an excise duty but under a different management is much more expensive the neat revenue of the customs does not amount to two millions and a half which is levied at an expense of more than ten per cent in the salaries of officers and other incidents but the perquisites of customhouse officers are every where much greater than their salaries at some ports more than double or triple those salaries if the salaries of officers and other incidents therefore amount to more than ten per cent upon the neat revenue of the customs the whole expense of levying that revenue may amount in salaries and perquisites together to more than twenty or thirty per cent the officers of excise receive few or no perquisites and the administration of that branch of the revenue being of more recent establishment is in general less corrupted than that of the customs into which length of time has introduced and authorized many abuses by charging upon malt the whole revenue which is at present levied by the different duties upon malt and malt liquors a saving it is supposed of more than fifty thousand pounds might be made in the annual expense of the excise by confining the duties of customs to a few sorts of goods and by levying those duties according to the excise laws a much greater saving might probably be made in the annual expense of the customs  secondly such taxes necessarily occasion some obstruction or discouragement to certain branches of industry as they always raise the price of the commodity taxed they so far discourage its consumption and consequently its production if it is a commodity of home growth or manufacture less labor comes to be employed in raising and producing it if it is a foreign commodity of which the tax increases in this manner the price the commodities of the same kind which are made at home may thereby indeed gain some advantage in the home market and a greater quantity of domestic industry may thereby be turned toward preparing them but though this rise of price in a foreign commodity may encourage domestic industry in one particular branch it necessarily discourages that industry in almost every other the dearer the birmingham manufacturer buys his foreign wine the cheaper he necessarily sells that part of his hardware with which or what comes to the same thing with the price of which he buys it that part of his hardware therefore becomes of less value to him and he has less encouragement to work at it the dearer the consumers in one country pay for the surplus produce of another the cheaper they necessarily sell that part of their own surplus produce with which or what comes to the same thing with the price of which they buy it that part of their own surplus produce becomes of less value to them and they have less encouragement no increase its quantity all taxes upon consumable commodities therefore tend to reduce the quantity of productive labor below what it otherwise would be either in preparing the commodities taxed if they are home commodities or in preparing those with which they are purchased if they are foreign commodities such taxes too always alter more or less the natural direction of national industry and turn it into a channel always different from and generally less advantageous than that in which it would have run of its own accord  thirdly the hope of evading such taxes by smuggling gives frequent occasion to forfeitures and other penalties which entirely ruin the smuggler a person who though no doubt highly blameable for violating the laws of his country is frequently incapable of violating those of natural justice and would have been in every respect an excellent citizen had not the laws of his country made that a crime which nature never meant to be so in those corrupted governments where there is at least a general suspicion of much unnecessary expense and great misapplication of the public revenue the laws which guard it are little respected not many people are scrupulous about smuggling when without perjury they can find any easy and safe opportunity of doing so to pretend to have any scruple about buying smuggled goods though a manifest encouragement to the violation of the revenue laws and to the perjury which almost always attends it would in most countries be regarded as one of those pedantic pieces of hypocrisy which instead of gaining credit with any body serve only to expose the person who affects to practice them to the suspicion of being a greater knave than most of his neighbors by this indulgence of the public the smuggler is often encouraged to continue a trade which he is thus taught to consider as in some measure innocent and when the severity of the revenue laws is ready to fall upon him he is frequently disposed to defend with violence what he has been accustomed to regard as his just property from being at first perhaps rather imprudent than criminal he at last too often becomes one of the hardiest and most determined violaters of the laws of society by the ruin of the smuggler his capital which had before been employed in maintaining productive labor is absorbed either in the revenue of the state or in that of the revenueofficer and is employed in maintaining unproductive to the diminution of the general capital of the society and of the useful industry which it might otherwise have maintained  fourthly such taxes by subjecting at least the dealers in the taxed commodities to the frequent visits and odious examination of the tax gatherers expose them sometimes no doubt to some degree of oppression and always to much trouble and vexation and though vexation as has already been said is not strictly speaking expense it is certainly equivalent to the expense at which every man would be willing to redeem himself from it the laws of excise though more effectual for the purpose for which they were instituted are in this respect more vexatious than those of the customs when a merchant has imported goods subject to certain duties of customs when he has paid those duties and lodged the goods in his warehouse he is not in most cases liable to any further trouble or vexation from the customhouse officer it is otherwise with goods subject to duties of excise the dealers have no respite from the continual visits and examination of the excise officers the duties of excise are upon this account more unpopular than those of the customs and so are the officers who levy them those officers it is pretended though in general perhaps they do their duty fully as well as those of the customs yet as that duty obliges them to be frequently very troublesome to some of their neighbors commonly contract a certain hardness of character which the others frequently have not this observation however may very probably be the mere suggestion of fraudulent dealers whose smuggling is either prevented or detected by their diligence  the inconveniences however which are perhaps in some degree inseparable from taxes upon consumable commodities fall as light upon the people of great britain as upon those of any other country of which the government is nearly as expensive our state is not perfect and might be mended but it is as good or better than that of most of our neighbors  in consequence of the notion that duties upon consumable goods were taxes upon the profits of merchants those duties have in some countries been repeated upon every successive sale of the goods if the profits of the merchant importer or merchant manufacturer were taxed equality seemed to require that those of all the middle buyers who intervened between either of them and the consumer should likewise be taxed the famous alcavala of spain seems to have been established upon this principle it was at first a tax of ten per cent afterward of fourteen per cent and is at present of only six per cent upon the sale of every sort of property whether moveable or immovable and it is repeated every time the property is sold memoires concernant les droits etc tom i p     the levying of this tax requires a multitude of revenue officers sufficient to guard the transportation of goods not only from one province to another but from one shop to another it subjects not only the dealers in some sorts of goods but those in all sorts every farmer every manufacturer every merchant and shopkeeper to the continual visits and examination of the tax gatherers through the greater part of a country in which a tax of this kind is established nothing can be produced for distant sale the produce of every part of the country must be proportioned to the consumption of the neighborhood it is to the alcavala accordingly that ustaritz imputes the ruin of the manufactures of spain he might have imputed to it likewise the declension of agriculture it being imposed not only upon manufactures but upon the rude produce of the land  in the kingdom of naples there is a similar tax of three per cent upon the value of all contracts and consequently upon that of all contracts of sale it is both lighter than the spanish tax and the greater part of towns and parishes are allowed to pay a composition in lieu of it they levy this composition in what manner they please generally in a way that gives no interruption to the interior commerce of the place the neapolitan tax therefore is not near so ruinous as the spanish one  the uniform system of taxation which with a few exceptions of no great consequence takes place in all the different parts of the united kingdom of great britain leaves the interior commerce of the country the inland and coasting trade almost entirely free the inland trade is almost perfectly free and the greater part of goods may be carried from one end of the kingdom to the other without requiring any permit or letpass without being subject to question visit or examination from the revenue officers there are a few exceptions but they are such as can give no interruption to any important branch of the inland commerce of the country goods carried coastwise indeed require certificates or coastcockets if you except coals however the rest are almost all dutyfree this freedom of interior commerce the effect of the uniformity of the system of taxation is perhaps one of the principal causes of the prosperity of great britain every great country being necessarily the best and most extensive market for the greater part of the productions of its own industry if the same freedom in consequence of the same uniformity could be extended to ireland and the plantations both the grandeur of the state and the prosperity of every part of the empire would probably be still greater than at present  in france the different revenue laws which take place in the different provinces require a multitude of revenue officers to surround not only the frontiers of the kingdom but those of almost each particular province in order either to prevent the importation of certain goods or to subject it to the payment of certain duties to the no small interruption of the interior commerce of the country some provinces are allowed to compound for the gabelle or salttax others are exempted from it altogether some provinces are exempted from the exclusive sale of tobacco which the farmersgeneral enjoy through the greater part of the kingdom the aides which correspond to the excise in england are very different in different provinces some provinces are exempted from them and pay a composition or equivalent in those in which they take place and are in farm there are many local duties which do not extend beyond a particular town or district the traites which correspond to our customs divide the kingdom into three great parts first the provinces subject to the tarif of      which are called the provinces of the five great farms and under which are comprehended picardy normandy and the greater part of the interior provinces of the kingdom secondly the provinces subject to the tarif of      which are called the provinces reckoned foreign and under which are comprehended the greater part of the frontier provinces and thirdly those provinces which are said to be treated as foreign or which because they are allowed a free commerce with foreign countries are in their commerce with the other provinces of france subjected to the same duties as other foreign countries these are alsace the three bishoprics of metz toul and verdun and the three cities of dunkirk bayonne and marseilles both in the provinces of the five great farms called so on account of an ancient division of the duties of customs into five great branches each of which was originally the subject of a particular farm though they are now all united into one and in those which are said to be reckoned foreign there are many local duties which do not extend beyond a particular town or district there are some such even in the provinces which are said to be treated as foreign particularly in the city of marseilles it is unnecessary to observe how much both the restraints upon the interior commerce of the country and the number of the revenue officers must be multiplied in order to guard the frontiers of those different provinces and districts which are subject to such different systems of taxation  over and above the general restraints arising from this complicated system of revenue laws the commerce of wine after corn perhaps the most important production of france is in the greater part of the provinces subject to particular restraints arising from the favor which has been shown to the vineyards of particular provinces and districts above those of others the provinces most famous for their wines it will be found i believe are those in which the trade in that article is subject to the fewest restraints of this kind the extensive market which such provinces enjoy encourages good management both in the cultivation of their vineyards and in the subsequent preparation of their wines  such various and complicated revenue laws are not peculiar to france the little duchy of milan is divided into six provinces in each of which there is a different system of taxation with regard to several different sorts of consumable goods the still smaller territories of the duke of parma are divided into three or four each of which has in the same manner a system of its own under such absurd management nothing but the great fertility of the soil and happiness of the climate could preserve such countries from soon relapsing into the lowest state of poverty and barbarism  taxes upon consumable commodities may either be levied by an administration of which the officers are appointed by government and are immediately accountable to government of which the revenue must in this case vary from year to year according to the occasional variations in the produce of the tax or they may be let in farm for a rent certain the farmer being allowed to appoint his own officers who though obliged to levy the tax in the manner directed by the law are under his immediate inspection and are immediately accountable to him the best and most frugal way of levying a tax can never be by farm over and above what is necessary for paying the stipulated rent the salaries of the officers and the whole expense of administration the farmer must always draw from the produce of the tax a certain profit proportioned at least to the advance which he makes to the risk which he runs to the trouble which he is at and to the knowledge and skill which it requires to manage so very complicated a concern government by establishing an administration under their own immediate inspection of the same kind with that which the farmer establishes might at least save this profit which is almost always exorbitant to farm any considerable branch of the public revenue requires either a great capital or a great credit circumstances which would alone restrain the competition for such an undertaking to a very small number of people of the few who have this capital or credit a still smaller number have the necessary knowledge or experience another circumstance which restrains the competition still further the very few who are in condition to become competitors find it more for their interest to combine together to become copartners instead of competitors and when the farm is set up to auction to offer no rent but what is much below the real value in countries where the public revenues are in farm the farmers are generally the most opulent people their wealth would alone excite the public indignation and the vanity which almost always accompanies such upstart fortunes the foolish ostentation with which they commonly display that wealth excites that indignation still more  the farmers of the public revenue never find the laws too severe which punish any attempt to evade the payment of a tax they have no bowels for the contributors who are not their subjects and whose universal bankruptcy if it should happen the day after their farm is expired would not much affect their interest in the greatest exigencies of the state when the anxiety of the sovereign for the exact payment of his revenue is necessarily the greatest they seldom fail to complain that without laws more rigorous than those which actually take place it will be impossible for them to pay even the usual rent in those moments of public distress their demands cannot be disputed the revenue laws therefore become gradually more and more severe the most sanguinary are always to be found in countries where the greater part of the public revenue is in farm the mildest in countries where it is levied under the immediate inspection of the sovereign even a bad sovereign feels more compassion for his people than can ever be expected from the farmers of his revenue he knows that the permanent grandeur of his family depends upon the prosperity of his people and he will never knowingly ruin that prosperity for the sake of any momentary interest of his own it is otherwise with the farmers of his revenue whose grandeur may frequently be the effect of the ruin and not of the prosperity of his people  a tax is sometimes not only farmed for a rent certain but the farmer has besides the monopoly of the commodity taxed in france the taxes upon tobacco and salt are levied in this manner in such cases the farmer instead of one levies two exorbitant profits upon the people the profit of the farmer and the still more exorbitant one of the monopolist tobacco being a luxury every man is allowed to buy or not to buy as he chooses but salt being a necessary every man is obliged to buy of the farmer a certain quantity of it because if he did not buy this quantity of the farmer he would it is presumed buy it of some smuggler the taxes upon both commodities are exorbitant the temptation to smuggle consequently is to many people irresistible while at the same time the rigor of the law and the vigilance of the farmers officers render the yielding to that temptation almost certainly ruinous the smuggling of salt and tobacco fends every year several hundred people to the galleys besides a very considerable number whom it sends to the gibbet those taxes levied in this manner yield a very considerable revenue to government in      the farm of tobacco was let for twentytwo millions five hundred and fortyone thousand two hundred and seventyeight livres a year that of salt for thirtysix millions four hundred and ninetytwo thousand four hundred and four livres the farm in both cases was to commence in      and to last for six years those who consider the blood of the people as nothing in comparison with the revenue of the prince may perhaps approve of this method of levying taxes similar taxes and monopolies of salt and tobacco have been established in many other countries particularly in the austrian and prussian dominions and in the greater part of the states of italy  in france the greater part of the actual revenue of the crown is derived from eight different sources the taille the capitation the two vingtiemes the gabelles the aides the traites the domaine and the farm of tobacco the five last are in the greater part of the provinces under farm the three first are every where levied by an administration under the immediate inspection and direction of government and it is universally acknowledged that in proportion to what they take out of the pockets of the people they bring more into the treasury of the prince than the other five of which the administration is much more wasteful and expensive  the finances of france seem in their present state to admit of three very obvious reformations first by abolishing the taille and the capitation and by increasing the number of vingtiemes so as to produce an additional revenue equal to the amount of those other taxes the revenue of the crown might be preserved the expense of collection might be much diminished the vexation of the inferior ranks of people which the taille and capitation occasion might be entirely prevented and the superior ranks might not be more burdened than the greater part of them are at present the vingtieme i have already observed is a tax very nearly of the same kind with what is called the land tax of england the burden of the taille it is acknowledged falls finally upon the proprietors of land and as the greater part of the capitation is assessed upon those who are subject to the taille at so much a pound of that other tax the final payment of the greater part of it must likewise fall upon the same order of people though the number of the vingtiemes therefore was increased so as to produce an additional revenue equal to the amount of both those taxes the superior ranks of people might not be more burdened than they are at present many individuals no doubt would on account of the great inequalities with which the taille is commonly assessed upon the estates and tenants of different individuals the interest and opposition of such favored subjects are the obstacles most likely to prevent this or any other reformation of the same kind secondly by rendering the gabelle the aides the taxes upon tobacco all their different customs and excises uniform in all the different parts of the kingdom those taxes might be levied at much less expense and the interior commerce of the kingdom might be rendered as free as that of england thirdly and lastly by subjecting all those taxes to an administration under the immediate inspection and direction of government the exorbitant profits of the farmers general might be added to the revenue of the state the opposition arising from the private interest of individuals is likely to be as effectual for preventing the two last as the first mentioned scheme of reformation  the french system of taxation seems in every respect inferior to the british in great britain ten millions sterling are annually levied upon less than eight millions of people without its being possible to say that any particular order is oppressed from the collections of the abbe expilly and the observations of the author of the essay upon the legislation and commerce of corn it appears probable that france including the provinces of lorraine and bar contains about twentythree or twentyfour millions of people three times the number perhaps contained in great britain the soil and climate of france are better than those of great britain the country has been much longer in a state of improvement and cultivation and is upon that account better stocked with all those things which it requires a long time to raise up and accumulate such as great towns and convenient and well built houses both in town and country with these advantages it might be expected that in france a revenue of thirty millions might be levied for the support of the state with as little inconveniency as a revenue of ten millions is in great britain in      and      the whole revenue paid into the treasury of france according to the best though i acknowledge very imperfect accounts which i could get of it usually run between  0  and     millions of livres that is it did not amount to fifteen millions sterling not the half of what might have been expected had the people contributed in the same proportion to their numbers as the people of great britain the people of france however it is generally acknowledged are much more oppressed by taxes than the people of great britain france however is certainly the great empire in europe which after that of great britain enjoys the mildest and most indulgent government  in holland the heavy taxes upon the necessaries of life have ruined it is said their principal manufactures and are likely to discourage gradually even their fisheries and their trade in ship building the taxes upon the necessaries of life are inconsiderable in great britain and no manufacture has hitherto been ruined by them the british taxes which bear hardest on manufactures are some duties upon the importation of raw materials particularly upon that of raw silk the revenue of the states general and of the different cities however is said to amount to more than five millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling and as the inhabitants of the united provinces cannot well be supposed to amount to more than a third part of those of great britain they must in proportion to their number be much more heavily taxed  after all the proper subjects of taxation have been exhausted if the exigencies of the state still continue to require new taxes they must be imposed upon improper ones the taxes upon the necessaries of life therefore may be no impeachment of the wisdom of that republic which in order to acquire and to maintain its independency has in spite of its great frugality been involved in such expensive wars as have obliged it to contract great debts the singular countries of holland and zealand besides require a considerable expense even to preserve their existence or to prevent their being swallowed up by the sea which must have contributed to increase considerably the load of taxes in those two provinces the republican form of government seems to be the principal support of the present grandeur of holland the owners of great capitals the great mercantile families have generally either some direct share or some indirect influence in the administration of that government for the sake of the respect and authority which they derive from this situation they are willing to live in a country where their capital if they employ it themselves will bring them less profit and if they lend it to another less interest and where the very moderate revenue which they can draw from it will purchase less of the necessaries and conveniences of life than in any other part of europe the residence of such wealthy people necessarily keeps alive in spite of all disadvantages a certain degree of industry in the country any public calamity which should destroy the republican form of government which should throw the whole administration into the hands of nobles and of soldiers which should annihilate altogether the importance of those wealthy merchants would soon render it disagreeable to them to live in a country where they were no longer likely to be much respected they would remove both their residence and their capital to some other country and the industry and commerce of holland would soon follow the capitals which supported them  chap iii of public debts in that rude state of society which precedes the extension of commerce and the improvement of manufactures when those expensive luxuries which commerce and manufactures can alone introduce are altogether unknown the person who possesses a large revenue i have endeavored to show in the third book of this inquiry can spend or enjoy that revenue in no other way than by maintaining nearly as many people as it can maintain a large revenue may at all times be said to consist in the command of a large quantity of the necessaries of life in that rude state of things it is commonly paid in a large quantity of those necessaries in the materials of plain food and coarse clothing in corn and cattle in wool and raw hides when neither commerce nor manufactures furnish any thing for which the owner can exchange the greater part of those materials which are over and above his own consumption he can do nothing with the surplus but feed and cloathe nearly as many people as it will feed and cloathe a hospitality in which there is no luxury and a liberality in which there is no ostentation occasion in this situation of things the principal expenses of the rich and the great but these i have likewise endeavored to show in the same book are expenses by which people are not very apt to ruin themselves there is not perhaps any selfish pleasure so frivolous of which the pursuit has not sometimes ruined even sensible men a passion for cockfighting has ruined many bu the instances i believe are not very numerous of people who have been ruined by a hospitality or liberality of this kind though the hospitality of luxury and the liberality of ostentation have ruined many among our feudal ancestors the long time during which estates used to continue in the same family sufficiently demonstrates the general disposition of people to live within their income though the rustic hospitality constantly exercised by the great landholders may not to us in the present times seem consistent with that order which we are apt to consider as inseparably connected with good economy yet we must certainly allow them to have been at least so far frugal as not commonly to have spent their whole income a part of their wool and raw hides they had generally an opportunity of selling for money some part of this money perhaps they spent in purchasing the few objects of vanity and luxury with which the circumstances of the times could furnish them but some part of it they seem commonly to have hoarded they could not well indeed do any thing else but hoard whatever money they saved to trade was disgraceful to a gentleman and to lend money at interest which at that time was considered as usury and prohibited by law would have been still more so in those times of violence and disorder besides it was convenient to have a hoard of money at hand that in case they should be driven from their own home they might have something of known value to carry with them to some place of safety the same violence which made it convenient to hoard made it equally convenient to conceal the hoard the frequency of treasure trove or of treasure found of which no owner was known sufficiently demonstrates the frequency in those times both of hoarding and of concealing the hoard treasuretrove was then considered as an important branch of the revenue of the sovereign all the treasuretrove of the kingdom would scarce perhaps in the present times make an important branch of the revenue of a private gentleman of a good estate  the same disposition to save and to hoard prevailed in the sovereign as well as in the subjects among nations to whom commerce and manufactures are little known the sovereign it has already been observed in the fourth book is in a situation which naturally disposes him to the parsimony requisite for accumulation in that situation the expense even of a sovereign cannot be directed by that vanity which delights in the gaudy finery of a court the ignorance of the times affords but few of the trinkets in which that finery consists standing armies are not then necessary so that the expense even of a sovereign like that of any other great lord can be employed in scarce any thing but bounty to his tenants and hospitality to his retainers but bounty and hospitality very seldom lead to extravagance though vanity almost always does all the ancient sovereigns of europe accordingly it has already been observed had treasures every tartar chief in the present times is said to have one  in a commercial country abounding with every sort of expensive luxury the sovereign in the same manner as almost all the great proprietors in his dominions naturally spends a great part of his revenue in purchasing those luxuries his own and the neighboring countries supply him abundantly with all the costly trinkets which compose the splendid but insignificant pageantry of a court for the sake of an inferior pageantry of the same kind his nobles dismiss their retainers make their tenants independent and become gradually themselves as insignificant as the greater part of the wealthy burghers in his dominions the same frivolous passions which influence their conduct influence his how can it be supposed that he should be the only rich man in his dominions who is insensible to pleasures of this kind if he does not what he is very likely to do spend upon those pleasures so great a part of his revenue as to debilitate very much the defensive power of the state it cannot well be expected that he should not spend upon them all that part of it which is over and above what is necessary for supporting that defensive power his ordinary expense becomes equal to his ordinary revenue and it is well if it does not frequently exceed it the amassing of treasure can no longer be expected and when extraordinary exigencies require extraordinary expenses he must necessarily call upon his subjects for an extraordinary aid the present and the late king of prussia are the only great princes of europe who since the death of henry iv of france in    0 are supposed to have amassed any considerable treasure the parsimony which leads to accumulation has become almost as rare in republican as in monarchical governments the italian republics the united provinces of the netherlands are all in debt the canton of berne is the single republic in europe which has amassed any considerable treasure the other swiss republics have not the taste for some sort of pageantry for splendid buildings at least and other public ornaments frequently prevails as much in the apparently sober senate house of a little republic as in the dissipated court of the greatest king  the want of parsimony in time of peace imposes the necessity of contracting debt in time of war when war comes there is no money in the treasury but what is necessary for carrying on the ordinary expense of the peace establishment in war an establishment of three or four times that expense becomes necessary for the defense of the state and consequently a revenue three or four times greater than the peace revenue supposing that the sovereign should have what he scarce ever has the immediate means of augmenting his revenue in proportion to the augmentation of his expense yet still the produce of the taxes from which this increase of revenue must be drawn will not begin to come into the treasury till perhaps ten or twelve months after they are imposed but the moment in which war begins or rather the moment in which it appears likely to begin the army must be augmented the fleet must be fitted out the garrisoned towns must be put into a posture of defense that army that fleet those garrisoned towns must be furnished with arms ammunition and provisions an immediate and great expense must be incurred in that moment of immediate danger which will not wait for the gradual and slow returns of the new taxes in this exigency government can have no other resource but in borrowing  the same commercial state of society which by the operation of moral causes brings government in this manner into the necessity of borrowing produces in the subjects both an ability and an inclination to lend if it commonly brings along with it the necessity of borrowing it likewise brings along with it the facility of doing so  a country abounding with merchants and manufacturers necessarily abounds with a set of people through whose hands not only their own capitals but the capitals of all those who either lend them money or trust them with goods pass as frequently or more frequently than the revenue of a private man who without trade or business lives upon his income passes through his hands the revenue of such a man can regularly pass through his hands only once in the year but the whole amount of the capital and credit of a merchant who deals in a trade of which the returns are very quick may sometimes pass through his hands two three or four times in a year a country abounding with merchants and manufacturers therefore necessarily abounds with a set of people who have it at all times in their power to advance if they choose to do so a very large sum of money to government hence the ability in the subjects of a commercial state to lend  commerce and manufactures can seldom flourish long in any state which does not enjoy a regular administration of justice in which the people do not feel themselves secure in the possession of their property in which the faith of contracts is not supported by law and in which the authority of the state is not supposed to be regularly employed in enforcing the payment of debts from all those who are able to pay commerce and manufactures in short can seldom flourish in any state in which there is not a certain degree of confidence in the justice of government the same confidence which disposes great merchants and manufacturers upon ordinary occasions to trust their property to the protection of a particular government disposes them upon extraordinary occasions to trust that government with the use of their property by lending money to government they do not even for a moment diminish their ability to carry on their trade and manufactures on the contrary they commonly augment it the necessities of the state render government upon most occasions willing to borrow upon terms extremely advantageous to the lender the security which it grants to the original creditor is made transferable to any other creditor and from the universal confidence in the justice of the state generally sells in the market for more than was originally paid for it the merchant or monied man makes money by lending money to government and instead of diminishing increases his trading capital he generally considers it as a favor therefore when the administration admits him to a share in the first subscription for a new loan hence the inclination or willingness in the subjects of a commercial state to lend  the government of such a state is very apt to repose itself upon this ability and willingness of its subjects to lend it their money on extraordinary occasions it foresees the facility of borrowing and therefore dispenses itself from the duty of saving  in a rude state of society there are no great mercantile or manufacturing capitals the individuals who hoard whatever money they can save and who conceal their hoard do so from a distrust of the justice of government from a fear that if it was known that they had a hoard and where that hoard was to be found they would quickly be plundered in such a state of things few people would be able and nobody would be willing to lend their money to government on extraordinary exigencies the sovereign feels that he must provide for such exigencies by saving because he foresees the absolute impossibility of borrowing this foresight increases still further his natural disposition to save  the progress of the enormous debts which at present oppress and will in the longrun probably ruin all the great nations of europe has been pretty uniform nations like private men have generally begun to borrow upon what may be called personal credit without assigning or mortgaging any particular fund for the payment of the debt and when this resource has failed them they have gone on to borrow upon assignments or mortgages of particular funds  what is called the unfunded debt of great britain is contracted in the former of those two ways it consists partly in a debt which bears or is supposed to bear no interest and which resembles the debts that a private man contracts upon account and partly in a debt which bears interest and which resembles what a private man contracts upon his bill or promissory note the debts which are due either for extraordinary services or for services either not provided for or not paid at the time when they are performed part of the extraordinaries of the army navy and ordnance the arrears of subsidies to foreign princes those of seamens wages etc usually constitute a debt of the first kind navy and exchequer bills which are issued sometimes in payment of a part of such debts and sometimes for other purposes constitute a debt of the second kind exchequer bills bearing interest from the day on which they are issued and navy bills six months after they are issued the bank of england either by voluntarily discounting those bills at their current value or by agreeing with government for certain considerations to circulate exchequer bills that is to receive them at par paying the interest which happens to be due upon them keeps up their value and facilitates their circulation and thereby frequently enables government to contract a very large debt of this kind in france where there is no bank the state bills billets detat see examen des reflections politiques sur les finances have sometimes sold at sixty and seventy per cent discount during the great recoinage in king williams time when the bank of england thought proper to put a stop to its usual transactions exchequer bills and tallies are said to have sold from twentyfive to sixty per cent discount owing partly no doubt to the supposed instability of the new government established by the revolution but partly too to the want of the support of the bank of england  when this resource is exhausted and it becomes necessary in order to raise money to assign or mortgage some particular branch of the public revenue for the payment of the debt government has upon different occasions done this in two different ways sometimes it has made this assignment or mortgage for a short period of time only a year or a few years for example and sometimes for perpetuity in the one case the fund was supposed sufficient to pay within the limited time both principal and interest of the money borrowed in the other it was supposed sufficient to pay the interest only or a perpetual annuity equivalent to the interest government being at liberty to redeem at any time this annuity upon paying back the principal sum borrowed when money was raised in the one way it was said to be raised by anticipation when in the other by perpetual funding or more shortly by funding  in great britain the annual land and malt taxes are regularly anticipated every year by virtue of a borrowing clause constantly inserted into the acts which impose them the bank of england generally advances at an interest which since the revolution has varied from eight to three per cent the sums for which those taxes are granted and receives payment as their produce gradually comes in if there is a deficiency which there always is it is provided for in the supplies of the ensuing year the only considerable branch of the public revenue which yet remains unmortgaged is thus regularly spent before it comes in like an unprovident spendthrift whose pressing occasions will not allow him to wait for the regular payment of his revenue the state is in the constant practice of borrowing of its own factors and agents and of paying interest for the use of its own money  in the reign of king william and during a great part of that of queen anne before we had become so familiar as we are now with the practice of perpetual funding the greater part of the new taxes were imposed but for a short period of time for four five six or seven years only and a great part of the grants of every year consisted in loans upon anticipations of the produce of those taxes the produce being frequently insufficient for paying within the limited term the principal and interest of the money borrowed deficiencies arose to make good which it became necessary to prolong the term  in      by the  th of william iii c  0 the deficiencies of several taxes were charged upon what was then called the first general mortgage or fund consisting of a prolongation to the first of august   0  of several different taxes which would have expired within a shorter term and of which the produce was accumulated into one general fund the deficiencies charged upon this prolonged term amounted to    0    l   s  d  in   0  those duties with some others were still further prolonged for the like purposes till the first of august    0 and were called the second general mortgage or fund the deficiencies charged upon it amounted to  0      l  s   d  in   0  those duties were still further prolonged as a fund for new loans to the first of august      and were called the third general mortgage or fund the sum borrowed upon it was        l   s  d  in   0  those duties were all except the old subsidy of tonnage and poundage of which one moiety only was made a part of this fund and a duty upon the importation of scotch linen which had been taken off by the articles of union still further continued as a fund for new loans to the first of august      and were called the fourth general mortgage or fund the sum borrowed upon it was          s  d  in   0  those duties were all except the old subsidy of tonnage and poundage which was now left out of this fund altogether still further continued for the same purpose to the first of august      and were called the fifth general mortgage or fund the sum borrowed upon it was    0   l  s od  in    0 those duties were again prolonged to the first of august    0 and were called the sixth general mortgage or fund the sum borrowed upon it was         l  s   d  in      the same duties which at this time were thus subject to four different anticipations together with several others were continued for ever and made a fund for paying the interest of the capital of the south sea company which had that year advanced to government for paying debts and making good deficiencies the sum of         l   s  d the greatest loan which at that time had ever been made  before this period the principal so far as i have been able to observe the only taxes which in order to pay the interest of a debt had been imposed for perpetuity were those for paying the interest of the money which had been advanced to government by the bank and east india company and of what it was expected would be advanced but which was never advanced by a projected landbank the bank fund at this time amounted to     0  l   s  0d for which was paid an annuity or interest of  0  0 l   s  d the east india fund amounted to   00000l for which was paid an annuity or interest of   0000l the bank fund being at six per cent the east india fund at five per cent interest  in      by the first of george i c    the different taxes which had been mortgaged for paying the bank annuity together with several others which by this act were likewise rendered perpetual were accumulated into one common fund called the aggregate fund which was charged not only with the payment of the bank annuity but with several other annuities and burdens of different kinds this fund was afterward augmented by the third of george i c   and by the fifth of george i c   and the different duties which were then added to it were likewise rendered perpetual  in      by the third of george i c   several other taxes were rendered perpetual and accumulated into another common fund called the general fund for the payment of certain annuities amounting in the whole to       l  s  0d  in consequence of those different acts the greater part of the taxes which before had been anticipated only for a short term of years were rendered perpetual as a fund for paying not the capital but the interest only of the money which had been borrowed upon them by different successive anticipations  had money never been raised but by anticipation the course of a few years would have liberated the public revenue without any other attention of government besides that of not overloading the fund by charging it with more debt than it could pay within the limited term and of not anticipating a second time before the expiration of the first anticipation but the greater part of european governments have been incapable of those attentions they have frequently overloaded the fund even upon the first anticipation and when this happened not to be the case they have generally taken care to overload it by anticipating a second and a third time before the expiration of the first anticipation the fund becoming in this manner altogether insufficient for paying both principal and interest of the money borrowed upon it it became necessary to charge it with the interest only or a perpetual annuity equal to the interest and such unprovident anticipations necessarily gave birth to the more ruinous practice of perpetual funding but though this practice necessarily puts off the liberation of the public revenue from a fixed period to one so indefinite that it is not very likely ever to arrive yet as a greater sum can in all cases be raised by this new practice than by the old one of anticipations the former when men have once become familiar with it has in the great exigencies of the state been universally preferred to the latter to relieve the present exigency is always the object which principally interests those immediately concerned in the administration of public affairs the future liberation of the public revenue they leave to the care of posterity  during the reign of queen anne the market rate of interest had fallen from six to five per cent and in the twelfth year of her reign five per cent was declared to be the highest rate which could lawfully be taken for money borrowed upon private security soon after the greater part of the temporary taxes of great britain had been rendered perpetual and distributed into the aggregate south sea and general funds the creditors of the public like those of private persons were induced to accept of five per cent for the interest of their money which occasioned a saving of one per cent upon the capital of the greater part of the debts which had been thus funded for perpetuity or of onesixth of the greater part of the annuities which were paid out of the three great funds above mentioned this saving left a considerable surplus in the produce of the different taxes which had been accumulated into those funds over and above what was necessary for paying the annuities which were now charged upon them and laid the foundation of what has since been called the sinking fund in      it amounted to       l  s  d in      the interest of the greater part of the public debts was still further reduced to four per cent and in      and      to three and a half and three per cent which reductions still further augmented the sinking fund  a sinking fund though instituted for the payment of old facilitates very much the contracting of new debts it is a subsidiary fund always at hand to be mortgaged in aid of any other doubtful fund upon which money is proposed to be raised in any exigency of the state whether the sinking fund of great britain has been more frequently applied to the one or to the other of those two purposes will sufficiently appear by and by  besides those two methods of borrowing by anticipations and by perpetual funding there are two other methods which hold a sort of middle place between them these are that of borrowing upon annuities for terms of years and that of borrowing upon annuities for lives  during the reigns of king william and queen anne large sums were frequently borrowed upon annuities for terms of years which were sometimes longer and sometimes shorter in      an act was passed for borrowing one million upon an annuity of fourteen per cent or of   0000l a year for sixteen years in      an act was passed for borrowing a million upon annuities for lives upon terms which in the present times would appear very advantageous but the subscription was not filled up in the following year the deficiency was made good by borrowing upon annuities for lives at fourteen per cent or at little more than seven years purchase in      the persons who had purchased those annuities were allowed to exchange them for others of ninetysix years upon paying into the exchequer sixtythree pounds in the hundred that is the difference between fourteen per cent for life and fourteen per cent for ninetysix years was sold for sixtythree pounds or for four and a half years purchase such was the supposed instability of government that even these terms procured few purchasers in the reign of queen anne money was upon different occasions borrowed both upon annuities for lives and upon annuities for terms of thirtytwo of eightynine of ninetyeight and of ninetynine years in      the proprietors of the annuities for thirtytwo years were induced to accept in lieu of them south sea stock to the amount of eleven and a half years purchase of the annuities together with an additional quantity of stock equal to the arrears which happened then to be due upon them in    0 the greater part of the other annuities for terms of years both long and short were subscribed into the same fund the long annuities at that time amounted to       l  s  d a year on the  th of january      the remainder of them or what was not subscribed at that time amounted only to       l   s  d  during the two wars which begun in      and in      little money was borrowed either upon annuities for terms of years or upon those for lives an annuity for ninetyeight or ninetynine years however is worth nearly as much money as a perpetuity and should therefore one might think be a fund for borrowing nearly as much but those who in order to make family settlements and to provide for remote futurity buy into the public stocks would not care to purchase into one of which the value was continually diminishing and such people make a very considerable proportion both of the proprietors and purchasers of stock an annuity for a long term of years therefore though its intrinsic value may be very nearly the same with that of a perpetual annuity will not find nearly the same number of purchasers the subscribers to a new loan who mean generally to sell their subscription as soon as possible prefer greatly a perpetual annuity redeemable by parliament to an irredeemable annuity for a long term of years of only equal amount the value of the former may be supposed always the same or very nearly the same and it makes therefore a more convenient transferable stock than the latter  during the two last mentioned wars annuities either for terms of years or for lives were seldom granted but as premiums to the subscribers to a new loan over and above the redeemable annuity or interest upon the credit of which the loan was supposed to be made they were granted not as the proper fund upon which the money was borrowed but as an additional encouragement to the lender  annuities for lives have occasionally been granted in two different ways either upon separate lives or upon lots of lives which in french are called tontines from the name of their inventor when annuities are granted upon separate lives the death of every individual annuitant disburthens the public revenue so far as it was affected by his annuity when annuities are granted upon tontines the liberation of the public revenue does not commence till the death of all the annuitants comprehended in one lot which may sometimes consist of twenty or thirty persons of whom the survivors succeed to the annuities of all those who die before them the last survivor succeeding to the annuities of the whole lot upon the same revenue more money can always be raised by tontines than by annuities for separate lives an annuity with a right of survivorship is really worth more than an equal annuity for a separate life and from the confidence which every man naturally has in his own good fortune the principle upon which is founded the success of all lotteries such an annuity generally sells for something more than it is worth in countries where it is usual for government to raise money by granting annuities tontines are upon this account generally preferred to annuities for separate lives the expedient which will raise most money is almost always preferred to that which is likely to bring about in the speediest manner the liberation of the public revenue  in france a much greater proportion of the public debts consists in annuities for lives than in england according to a memoir presented by the parliament of bourdeaux to the king in      the whole public debt of france is estimated at twentyfour hundred millions of livres of which the capital for which annuities for lives had been granted is supposed to amount to three hundred millions the eighthpart of the whole public debt the annuities themselves are computed to amount to thirty millions a year the fourth part of one hundred and twenty millions the supposed interest of that whole debt these estimations i know very well are not exact but having been presented by so very respectable a body as approximations to the truth they may i apprehend be considered as such it is not the different degrees of anxiety in the two governments of france and england for the liberation of the public revenue which occasions this difference in their respective modes of borrowing it arises altogether from the different views and interests of the lenders  in england the seat of government being in the greatest mercantile city in the world the merchants are generally the people who advance money to government by advancing it they do not mean to diminish but on the contrary to increase their mercantile capitals and unless they expected to sell with some profit their share in the subscription for a new loan they never would subscribe but if by advancing their money they were to purchase instead of perpetual annuities annuities for lives only whether their own or those of other people they would not always be so likely to sell them with a profit annuities upon their own lives they would always sell with loss because no man will give for an annuity upon the life of another whose age and state of health are nearly the same with his own the same price which he would give for one upon his own an annuity upon the life of a third person indeed is no doubt of equal value to the buyer and the seller but its real value begins to diminish from the moment it is granted and continues to do so more and more as long as it subsists it can never therefore make so convenient a transferable stock as a perpetual annuity of which the real value may be supposed always the same or very nearly the same  in france the seat of government not being in a great mercantile city merchants do not make so great a proportion of the people who advance money to government the people concerned in the finances the farmers general the receivers of the taxes which are not in farm the court bankers etc make the greater part of those who advance their money in all public exigencies such people are commonly men of mean birth but of great wealth and frequently of great pride they are too proud to marry their equals and women of quality disdain to marry them they frequently resolve therefore to live bachelors and having neither any families of their own nor much regard for those of their relations whom they are not always very fond of acknowledging they desire only to live in splendour during their own time and are not unwilling that their fortune should end with themselves the number of rich people besides who are either averse to marry or whose condition of life renders it either improper or inconvenient for them to do so is much greater in france than in england to such people who have little or no care for posterity nothing can be more convenient than to exchange their capital for a revenue which is to last just as long as and no longer than they wish it to do  the ordinary expense of the greater part of modern governments in time of peace being equal or nearly equal to their ordinary revenue when war comes they are both unwilling and unable to increase their revenue in proportion to the increase of their expense they are unwilling for fear of offending the people who by so great and so sudden an increase of taxes would soon be disgusted with the war and they are unable from not well knowing what taxes would be sufficient to produce the revenue wanted the facility of borrowing delivers them from the embarrassment which this fear and inability would otherwise occasion by means of borrowing they are enabled with a very moderate increase of taxes to raise from year to year money sufficient for carrying on the war and by the practice of perpetual funding they are enabled with the smallest possible increase of taxes to raise annually the largest possible sum of money in great empires the people who live in the capital and in the provinces remote from the scene of action feel many of them scarce any inconveniency from the war but enjoy at their ease the amusement of reading in the newspapers the exploits of their own fleets and armies to them this amusement compensates the small difference between the taxes which they pay on account of the war and those which they had been accustomed to pay in time of peace they are commonly dissatisfied with the return of peace which puts an end to their amusement and to a thousand visionary hopes of conquest and national glory from a longer continuance of the war  the return of peace indeed seldom relieves them from the greater part of the taxes imposed during the war these are mortgaged for the interest of the debt contracted in order to carry it on if over and above paying the interest of this debt and defraying the ordinary expense of government the old revenue together with the new taxes produce some surplus revenue it may perhaps be converted into a sinking fund for paying off the debt but in the first place this sinking fund even supposing it should be applied to no other purpose is generally altogether inadequate for paying in the course of any period during which it can reasonably be expected that peace should continue the whole debt contracted during the war and in the second place this fund is almost always applied to other purposes  the new taxes were imposed for the sole purpose of paying the interest of the money borrowed upon them if they produce more it is generally something which was neither intended nor expected and is therefore seldom very considerable sinking funds have generally arisen not so much from any surplus of the taxes which was over and above what was necessary for paying the interest or annuity originally charged upon them as from a subsequent reduction of that interest that of holland in      and that of the ecclesiastical state in      were both formed in this manner hence the usual insufficiency of such funds  during the most profound peace various events occur which require an extraordinary expense and government finds it always more convenient to defray this expense by misapplying the sinking fund than by imposing a new tax every new tax is immediately felt more or less by the people it occasions always some murmur and meets with some opposition the more taxes may have been multiplied the higher they may have been raised upon every different subject of taxation the more loudly the people complain of every new tax the more difficult it becomes too either to find out new subjects of taxation or to raise much higher the taxes already imposed upon the old a momentary suspension of the payment of debt is not immediately felt by the people and occasions neither murmur nor complaint to borrow of the sinking fund is always an obvious and easy expedient for getting out of the present difficulty the more the public debts may have been accumulated the more necessary it may have become to study to reduce them the more dangerous the more ruinous it may be to misapply any part of the sinking fund the less likely is the public debt to be reduced to any considerable degree the more likely the more certainly is the sinking fund to be misapplied toward defraying all the extraordinary expenses which occur in time of peace when a nation is already overburdened with taxes nothing but the necessities of a new war nothing but either the animosity of national vengeance or the anxiety for national security can induce the people to submit with tolerable patience to a new tax hence the usual misapplication of the sinking fund  in great britain from the time that we had first recourse to the ruinous expedient of perpetual funding the reduction of the public debt in time of peace has never borne any proportion to its accumulation in time of war it was in the war which began in      and was concluded by the treaty of ryswick in      that the foundation of the present enormous debt of great britain was first laid  on the   st of december      the public debts of great britain funded and unfunded amounted to         l   s  d a great part of those debts had been contracted upon short anticipations and some part upon annuities for lives so that before the   st of december   0  in less than four years there had partly been paid off and partly reverted to the public the sum of     0  l   s 0d a greater reduction of the public debt than has ever since been brought about in so short a period of time the remaining debt therefore amounted only to       0 l  s  d  in the war which began in   0  and which was concluded by the treaty of utrecht the public debts were still more accumulated on the   st of december      they amounted to      0  l  s     d the subscription into the south sea fund of the long and short annuities increased the capital of the public debts so that on the   st of december      it amounted to         l  s    d the reduction of the debt began in      and went on so slowly that on the   st of december      during seventeen years of profound peace the whole sum paid off was no more than        l   s      d the capital of the public debt at that time amounting to         l  s     d  the spanish war which began in      and the french war which soon followed it occasioned a further increase of the debt which on the   st of december      after the war had been concluded by the treaty of aix la chapelle amounted to         l  s  0d the most profound peace of seventeen years continuance had taken no more than        l   s      d from it a war of less than nine years continuance added         l   s    d to it see james postlethwaites history of the public revenue   during the administration of mr pelham the interest of the public debt was reduced or at least measures were taken for reduceing it from four to three per cent the sinking fund was increased and some part of the public debt was paid off in      before the breaking out of the late war the funded debt of great britain amounted to         l on the  th of january      at the conclusion of the peace the funded debt amounted to     0    l  s  d the unfunded debt has been stated at         l  s  d but the expense occasioned by the war did not end with the conclusion of the peace so that though on the  th of january      the funded debt was increased partly by a new loan and partly by funding a part of the unfunded debt to          l  0s  d there still remained according to the very well informed author of the considerations on the trade and finances of great britain an unfunded debt which was brought to account in that and the following year of     0  l   s      d in      therefore the public debt of great britain funded and unfunded together amounted according to this author to        0 l  s  d the annuities for lives too which had been granted as premiums to the subscribers to the new loans in      estimated at fourteen years purchase were valued at     00l and the annuities for long terms of years granted as premiums likewise in      and      estimated at    years purchase were valued at        l during a peace of about seven years continuance the prudent and truly patriot administration of mr pelham was not able to pay off an old debt of six millions during a war of nearly the same continuance a new debt of more than seventyfive millions was contracted  on the  th of january      the funded debt of great britain amounted to       0  l  s  d the unfunded exclusive of a large civil list debt to    0   l  s     d both together to          l  s  d according to this account the whole debt paid off during eleven years profound peace amounted only to  0      l   s    d even this small reduction of debt however has not been all made from the savings out of the ordinary revenue of the state several extraneous sums altogether independent of that ordinary revenue have contributed toward it among these we may reckon an additional shilling in the pound land tax for three years the two millions received from the east india company as indemnification for their territorial acquisitions and the one hundred and ten thousand pounds received from the bank for the renewal of their charter to these must be added several other sums which as they arose out of the late war ought perhaps to be considered as deductions from the expenses of it the principal are l s d the produce of french prizes   0         composition for french prisoners   0000 0 0 what has been received from the sale of the ceded islands    00 0 0 total              if we add to this sum the balance of the earl of chathams and mr calcrasts accounts and other army savings of the same kind together with what has been received from the bank the east india company and the additional shilling in the pound land tax the whole must be a good deal more than five millions the debt therefore which since the peace has been paid out of the savings from the ordinary revenue of the stage has not one year with another amounted to half a million a year the sinking fund has no doubt been considerably augmented since the peace by the debt which has been paid off by the reduction of the redeemable four per cents to three per cents and by the annuities for lives which have fallen in and if peace was to continue a million perhaps might now be annually spared out of it toward the discharge of the debt another million accordingly was paid in the course of last year but at the same time a large civil list debt was left unpaid and we are now involved in a new war which in its progress may prove as expensive as any of our former wars the new debt which will probably be contracted before the end of the next campaign may perhaps be nearly equal to all the old debt which has been paid off from the savings out of the ordinary revenue of the state it would be altogether chimerical therefore to expect that the public debt should ever be completely discharged by any savings which are likely to be made from that ordinary revenue as it stands at present  the public funds of the different indebted nations of europe particularly those of england have by one author been represented as the accumulation of a great capital superadded to the other capital of the country by means of which its trade is extended its manufactures multiplied and its lands cultivated and improved much beyond what they could have been by means of that other capital only he does not consider that the capital which the first creditors of the public advanced to government was from the moment in which they advanced it a certain portion of the annual produce turned away from serving in the function of a capital to serve in that of a revenue from maintaining productive laborers to maintain unproductive ones and to be spent and wasted generally in the course of the year without even the hope of any future reproduction in return for the capital which they advanced they obtained indeed an annuity in the public funds in most cases of more than equal value this annuity no doubt replaced to them their capital and enabled them to carry on their trade and business to the same or perhaps to a greater extent than before that is they were enabled either to borrow of other people a new capital upon the credit of this annuity or by selling it to get from other people a new capital of their own equal or superior to that which they had advanced to government this new capital however which they in this manner either bought or borrowed of other people must have existed in the country before and must have been employed as all capitals are in maintaining productive labor when it came into the hands of those who had advanced their money to government though it was in some respects a new capital to them it was not so to the country but was only a capital withdrawn from certain employments in order to be turned toward others though it replaced to them what they had advanced to government it did not replace it to the country had they not advanced this capital to government there would have been in the country two capitals two portions of the annual produce instead of one employed in maintaining productive labor  when for defraying the expense of government a revenue is raised within the year from the produce of free or unmortgaged taxes a certain portion of the revenue of private people is only turned away from maintaining one species of unproductive labor toward maintaining another some part of what they pay in those taxes might no doubt have been accumulated into capital and consequently employed in maintaining productive labor but the greater part would probably have been spent and consequently employed in maintaining unproductive labor the public expense however when defrayed in this manner no doubt hinders more or less the further accumulation of new capital but it does not necessarily occasion the destruction of any actually existing capital  when the public expense is defrayed by funding it is defrayed by the annual destruction of some capital which had before existed in the country by the perversion of some portion of the annual produce which had before been destined for the maintenance of productive labor toward that of unproductive labor as in this case however the taxes are lighter than they would have been had a revenue sufficient for defraying the same expense been raised within the year the private revenue of individuals is necessarily less burdened and consequently their ability to save and accumulate some part of that revenue into capital is a good deal less impaired if the method of funding destroys more old capital it at the same time hinders less the accumulation or acquisition of new capital than that of defraying the public expense by a revenue raised within the year under the system of funding the frugality and industry of private people can more easily repair the breaches which the waste and extravagance of government may occasionally make in the general capital of the society  it is only during the continuance of war however that the system of funding has this advantage over the other system were the expense of war to be defrayed always by a revenue raised within the year the taxes from which that extraordinary revenue was drawn would last no longer than the war the ability of private people to accumulate though less during the war would have been greater during the peace than under the system of funding war would not necessarily have occasioned the destruction of any old capitals and peace would have occasioned the accumulation of many more new wars would in general be more speedily concluded and less wantonly undertaken the people feeling during the continuance of the war the complete burden of it would soon grow weary of it and government in order to humor them would not be under the necessity of carrying it on longer than it was necessary to do so the foresight of the heavy and unavoidable burdens of war would hinder the people from wantonly calling for it when there was no real or solid interest to fight for the seasons during which the ability of private people to accumulate was somewhat impaired would occur more rarely and be of shorter continuance those on the contrary during which that ability was in the highest vigor would be of much longer duration than they can well be under the system of funding  when funding besides has made a certain progress the multiplication of taxes which it brings along with it sometimes impairs as much the ability of private people to accumulate even in time of peace as the other system would in time of war the peace revenue of great britain amounts at present to more than ten millions a year if free and unmortgaged it might be sufficient with proper management and without contracting a shilling of new debt to carry on the most vigorous war the private revenue of the inhabitants of great britain is at present as much encumbered in time of peace their ability to accumulate is as much impaired as it would have been in the time of the most expensive war had the pernicious system of funding never been adopted  in the payment of the interest of the public debt it has been said it is the right hand which pays the left the money does not go out of the country it is only a part of the revenue of one set of the inhabitants which is transferred to another and the nation is not a farthing the poorer this apology is founded altogether in the sophistry of the mercantile system and after the long examination which i have already bestowed upon that system it may perhaps be unnecessary to say any thing further about it it supposes besides that the whole public debt is owing to the inhabitants of the country which happens not to be true the dutch as well as several other foreign nations having a very considerable share in our public funds but though the whole debt were owing to the inhabitants of the country it would not upon that account be less pernicious  land and capital stock are the two original sources of all revenue both private and public capital stock pays the wages of productive labor whether employed in agriculture manufactures or commerce the management of those two original sources of revenue belongs to two different setts of people the proprietors of land and the owners or employers of capital stock  the proprietor of land is interested for the sake of his own revenue to keep his estate in as good condition as he can by building and repairing his tenants houses by making and maintaining the necessary drains and enclosures and all those other expensive improvements which it properly belongs to the landlord to make and maintain but by different landtaxes the revenue of the landlord may be so much diminished and by different duties upon the necessaries and conveniences of life that diminished revenue may be rendered of so little real value that he may find himself altogether unable to make or maintain those expensive improvements when the landlord however ceases to do his part it is altogether impossible that the tenant should continue to do his as the distress of the landlord increases the agriculture of the country must necessarily decline  when by different taxes upon the necessaries and conveniences of life the owners and employers of capital stock find that whatever revenue they derive from it will not in a particular country purchase the same quantity of those necessaries and conveniences which an equal revenue would in almost any other they will be disposed to remove to some other and when in order to raise those taxes all or the greater part of merchants and manufacturers that is all or the greater part of the employers of great capitals come to be continually exposed to the mortifying and vexatious visits of the tax gatherers this disposition to remove will soon be changed into an actual removal the industry of the country will necessarily fall with the removal of the capital which supported it and the ruin of trade and manufactures will follow the declension of agriculture  to transfer from the owners of those two great sources of revenue land and capital stock from the persons immediately interested in the good condition of every particular portion of land and in the good management of every particular portion of capital stock to another set of persons the creditors of the public who have no such particular interest the greater part of the revenue arising from either must in the longrun occasion both the neglect of land and the waste or removal of capital stock a creditor of the public has no doubt a general interest in the prosperity of the agriculture manufactures and commerce of the country and consequently in the good condition of its lands and in the good management of its capital stock should there be any general failure or declension in any of these things the produce of the different taxes might no longer be sufficient to pay him the annuity or interest which is due to him but a creditor of the public considered merely as such has no interest in the good condition of any particular portion of land or in the good management of any particular portion of capital stock as a creditor of the public he has no knowledge of any such particular portion he has no inspection of it he can have no care about it its ruin may in most cases be unknown to him and cannot directly affect him  the practice of funding has gradually enfeebled every state which has adopted it the italian republics seem to have begun it genoa and venice the only two remaining which can pretend to an independent existence have both been enfeebled by it spain seems to have learned the practice from the italian republics and its taxes being probably less judicious than theirs it has in proportion to its natural strength been still more enfeebled the debts of spain are of very old standing it was deeply in debt before the end of the sixteenth century about a hundred years before england owed a shilling france notwithstanding all its natural resources languishes under an oppressive load of the same kind the republic of the united provinces is as much enfeebled by its debts as either genoa or venice is it likely that in great britain alone a practice which has brought either weakness or desolation into every other country should prove altogether innocent  the system of taxation established in those different countries it may be said is inferior to that of england i believe it is so but it ought to be remembered that when the wisest government has exhausted all the proper subjects of taxation it must in cases of urgent necessity have recourse to improper ones the wise republic of holland has upon some occasions been obliged to have recourse to taxes as inconvenient as the greater part of those of spain another war begun before any considerable liberation of the public revenue had been brought about and growing in its progress as expensive as the last war may from irresistible necessity render the british system of taxation as oppressive as that of holland or even as that of spain to the honor of our present system of taxation indeed it has hitherto given so little embarrassment to industry that during the course even of the most expensive wars the frugality and good conduct of individuals seems to have been able by saving and accumulation to repair all the breaches which the waste and extravagance of government had made in the general capital of the society at the conclusion of the late war the most expensive that great britain ever waged her agriculture was as flourishing her manufacturers as numerous and as fully employed and her commerce as extensive as they had ever been before the capital therefore which supported all those different branches of industry must have been equal to what it had ever been before since the peace agriculture has been still further improved the rents of houses have risen in every town and village of the country a proof of the increasing wealth and revenue of the people and the annual amount of the greater part of the old taxes of the principal branches of the excise and customs in particular has been continually increasing an equally clear proof of an increasing consumption and consequently of an increasing produce which could alone support that consumption great britain seems to support with ease a burden which half a century ago nobody believed her capable of supporting let us not however upon this account rashly conclude that she is capable of supporting any burden nor even be too confident that she could support without great distress a burden a little greater than what has already been laid upon her  when national debts have once been accumulated to a certain degree there is scarce i believe a single instance of their having been fairly and completely paid the liberation of the public revenue if it has ever been brought about at all has always been brought about by a bankruptcy sometimes by an avowed one but always by a real one though frequently by a pretended payment  the raising of the denomination of the coin has been the most usual expedient by which a real public bankruptcy has been disguised under the appearance of a pretended payment if a sixpence for example should either by act of parliament or royal proclamation be raised to the denomination of a shilling and twenty sixpences to that of a pound sterling the person who under the old denomination had borrowed twenty shillings or near four ounces of silver would under the new pay with twenty sixpences or with something less than two ounces a national debt of about a hundred and twentyeight millions nearly the capital of the funded and unfunded debt of great britain might in this manner be paid with about sixtyfour millions of our present money it would indeed be a pretended payment only and the creditors of the public would really be defrauded of ten shillings in the pound of what was due to them the calamity too would extend much further than to the creditors of the public and those of every private person would suffer a proportionable loss and this without any advantage but in most cases with a great additional loss to the creditors of the public if the creditors of the public indeed were generally much in debt to other people they might in some measure compensate their loss by paying their creditors in the same coin in which the public had paid them but in most countries the creditors of the public are the greater part of them wealthy people who stand more in the relation of creditors than in that of debtors toward the rest of their fellow citizens a pretended payment of this kind therefore instead of alleviating aggravates in most cases the loss of the creditors of the public and without any advantage to the public extends the calamity to a great number of other innocent people it occasions a general and most pernicious subversion of the fortunes of private people enriching in most cases the idle and profuse debtor at the expense of the industrious and frugal creditor and transporting a great part of the national capital from the hands which were likely to increase and improve it to those which are likely to dissipate and destroy it when it becomes necessary for a state to dissipate and destroy it when it becomes necessary for a state to declare itself bankrupt in the same manner as when it becomes necessary for an individual to do so a fair open and avowed bankruptcy is always the measure which is both least dishonorable to the debtor and least hurtful to the creditor the honor of a state is surely very poorly provided for when in order to cover the disgrace of a real bankruptcy it has recourse to a juggling trick of this kind so easily seen through and at the same time so extremely pernicious  almost all states however ancient as well as modern when reduced to this necessity have upon some occasions played this very juggling trick the romans at the end of the first punic war reduced the as the coin or denomination by which they computed the value of all their other coins from containing twelve ounces of copper to contain only two ounces that is they raised two ounces of copper to a denomination which had always before expressed the value of twelve ounces the republic was in this manner enabled to pay the great debts which it had contracted with the sixth part of what it really owed so sudden and so great a bankruptcy we should in the present times be apt to imagine must have occasioned a very violent popular clamor it does not appear to have occasioned any the law which enacted it was like all other laws relating to the coin introduced and carried through the assembly of the people by a tribune and was probably a very popular law in rome as in all the other ancient republics the poor people were constantly in debt to the rich and the great who in order to secure their votes at the annual elections used to lend them money at exorbitant interest which being never paid soon accumulated into a sum too great either for the debtor to pay or for any body else to pay for him the debtor for fear of a very severe execution was obliged without any further gratuity to vote for the candidate whom the creditor recommended in spite of all the laws against bribery and corruption the bounty of the candidates together with the occasional distributions of corn which were ordered by the senate were the principal funds from which during the later times of the roman republic the poorer citizens derived their subsistence to deliver themselves from this subjection to their creditors the poorer citizens were continually calling out either for an entire abolition of debts or for what they called new tables that is for a law which should entitle them to a complete acquittance upon paying only a certain proportion of their accumulated debts the law which reduced the coin of all denominations to a sixth part of its former value as it enabled them to pay their debts with a sixth part of what they really owed was equivalent to the most advantageous new tables in order to satisfy the people the rich and the great were upon several different occasions obliged to consent to laws both for abolishing debts and for introducing new tables and they probably were induced to consent to this law partly for the same reason and partly that by liberating the public revenue they might restore vigor to that government of which they themselves had the principal direction an operation of this kind would at once reduce a debt of a hundred and twentyeight millions to twentyone millions three hundred and thirtythree thousand three hundred and thirtythree pounds six shillings and eightpence in the course of the second punic war the as was still further reduced first from two ounces of copper to one ounce and afterward from one ounce to half an ounce that is to the twentyfourth part of its original value by combining the three roman operations into one a debt of a hundred and twentyeight millions of our present money might in this manner be reduced all at once to a debt of five millions three hundred and thirtythree thousand three hundred and thirtythree pounds six shillings and eightpence even the enormous debt of great britain might in this manner soon be paid  by means of such expedients the coin of i believe all nations has been gradually reduced more and more below its original value and the same nominal sum has been gradually brought to contain a smaller and a smaller quantity of silver  nations have sometimes for the same purpose adulterated the standard of their coin that is have mixed a greater quantity of alloy in it if in the pound weight of our silver coin for example instead of eighteen penny weight according to the present standard there was mixed eight ounces of alloy a pound sterling or twenty shillings of such coin would be worth little more than six shillings and eightpence of our present money the quantity of silver contained in six shillings and eightpence of our present money would thus be raised very nearly to the denomination of a pound sterling the adulteration of the standard has exactly the same effect with what the french call an augmentation or a direct raising of the denomination of the coin  an augmentation or a direct raising of the denomination of the coin always is and from its nature must be an open and avowed operation by means of it pieces of a smaller weight and bulk are called by the same name which had before been given to pieces of a greater weight and bulk the adulteration of the standard on the contrary has generally been a concealed operation by means of it pieces were issued from the mint of the same denominations and as nearly as could be contrived of the same weight bulk and appearance with pieces which had been current before of much greater value when king john of france see du cange glossary voce moneta the benedictine edition  in order to pay his debts adulterated his coin all the officers of his mint were sworn to secresy both operations are unjust but a simple augmentation is an injustice of open violence whereas an adulteration is an injustice of treacherous fraud this latter operation therefore as soon as it has been discovered and it could never be concealed very long has always excited much greater indignation than the former the coin after any considerable augmentation has very seldom been brought back to its former weight but after the greatest adulterations it has almost always been brought back to its former fineness it has scarce ever happened that the fury and indignation of the people could otherwise be appeased  in the end of the reign of henry viii and in the beginning of that of edward vi the english coin was not only raised in its denomination but adulterated in its standard the like frauds were practiced in scotland during the minority of james vi they have occasionally been practiced in most other countries  that the public revenue of great britain can ever be completely liberated or even that any considerable progress can ever be made toward that liberation while the surplus of that revenue or what is over and above defraying the annual expense of the peace establishment is so very small it seems altogether in vain to expect that liberation it is evident can never be brought about without either some very considerable augmentation of the public revenue or some equally considerable reduction of the public expense  a more equal land tax a more equal tax upon the rent of houses and such alterations in the present system of customs and excise as those which have been mentioned in the foregoing chapter might perhaps without increasing the burden of the greater part of the people but only distributing the weight of it more equally upon the whole produce a considerable augmentation of revenue the most sanguine projector however could scarce flatter himself that any augmentation of this kind would be such as could give any reasonable hopes either of liberating the public revenue altogether or even of making such progress toward that liberation in time of peace as either to prevent or to compensate the further accumulation of the public debt in the next war  by extending the british system of taxation to all the different provinces of the empire inhabited by people either of british or european extraction a much greater augmentation of revenue might be expected this however could scarce perhaps be done consistently with the principles of the british constitution without admitting into the british parliament or if you will into the states general of the british empire a fair and equal representation of all those different provinces that of each province bearing the same proportion to the produce of its taxes as the representation of great britain might bear to the produce of the taxes levied upon great britain the private interest of many powerful individuals the confirmed prejudices of great bodies of people seem indeed at present to oppose to so great a change such obstacles as it may be very difficult perhaps altogether impossible to surmount without however pretending to determine whether such a union be practicable or impracticable it may not perhaps be improper in a speculative work of this kind to consider how far the british system of taxation might be applicable to all the different provinces of the empire what revenue might be expected from it if so applied and in what manner a general union of this kind might be likely to affect the happiness and prosperity of the different provinces comprehended within it such a speculation can at worst be regarded but as a new utopia less amusing certainly but not more useless and chimerical than the old one  the land tax the stamp duties and the different duties of customs and excise constitute the four principal branches of the british taxes  ireland is certainly as able and our american and west indian plantations more able to pay a land tax than great britain where the landlord is subject neither to tithe nor poors rate he must certainly be more able to pay such a tax than where he is subject to both those other burdens the tithe where there is no modus and where it is levied in kind diminishes more what would otherwise be the rent of the landlord than a landtax which really amounted to five shillings in the pound such a tithe will be found in most cases to amount to more than a fourth part of the real rent of the land or of what remains after replacing completely the capital of the farmer together with his reasonable profit if all moduses and all impropriations were taken away the complete church tithe of great britain and ireland could not well be estimated at less than six or seven millions if there was no tithe either in great britain or ireland the landlords could afford to pay six or seven millions additional land tax without being more burdened than a very great part of them are at present america pays no tithe and could therefore very well afford to pay a land tax the lands in america and the west indies indeed are in general not tenanted or leased out to farmers they could not therefore be assessed according to any rentroll but neither were the lands of great britain in the  th of william and mary assessed according to any rentroll but according to a very loose and inaccurate estimation the lands in america might be assessed either in the same manner or according to an equitable valuation in consequence of an accurate survey like that which was lately made in the milanese and in the dominions of austria prussia and sardinia  stampduties it is evident might be levied without any variation in all countries where the forms of law process and the deeds by which property both real and personal is transferred are the same or nearly the same  the extension of the customhouse laws of great britain to ireland and the plantations provided it was accompanied as in justice it ought to be with an extension of the freedom of trade would be in the highest degree advantageous to both all the invidious restraints which at present oppress the trade of ireland the distinction between the enumerated and nonenumerated commodities of america would be entirely at an end the countries north of cape finisterre would be as open to every part of the produce of america as those south of that cape are to some parts of that produce at present the trade between all the different parts of the british empire would in consequence of this uniformity in the customhouse laws be as free as the coasting trade of great britain is at present the british empire would thus afford within itself an immense internal market for every part of the produce of all its different provinces so great an extension of market would soon compensate both to ireland and the plantations all that they could suffer from the increase of the duties of customs  the excise is the only part of the british system of taxation which would require to be varied in any respect according as it was applied to the different provinces of the empire it might be applied to ireland without any variation the produce and consumption of that kingdom being exactly of the same nature with those of great britain in its application to america and the west indies of which the produce and consumption are so very different from those of great britain some modification might be necessary in the same manner as in its application to the cider and beer counties of england  a fermented liquor for example which is called beer but which as it is made of melasses bears very little resemblance to our beer makes a considerable part of the common drink of the people in america this liquor as it can be kept only for a few days cannot like our beer be prepared and stored up for sale in great breweries but every private family must brew it for their own use in the same manner as they cook their victuals but to subject every private family to the odious visits and examination of the tax gatherers in the same manner as we subject the keepers of alehouses and the brewers for public sale would be altogether inconsistent with liberty if for the sake of equality it was thought necessary to lay a tax upon this liquor it might be taxed by taxing the material of which it is made either at the place of manufacture or if the circumstances of the trade rendered such an excise improper by laying a duty upon its importation into the colony in which it was to be consumed besides the duty of one penny a gallon imposed by the british parliament upon the importation of melasses into america there is a provincial tax of this kind upon their importation into massachusetts bay in ships belonging to any other colony of eightpence the hogshead and another upon their importation from the northern colonies into south carolina of fivepence the gallon or if neither of these methods was found convenient each family might compound for its consumption of this liquor either according to the number of persons of which it consisted in the same manner as private families compound for the malttax in england or accoding to the different ages and sexes of those persons in the same manner as several different taxes are levied in holland or nearly as sir matthew decker proposes that all taxes upon consumable commodities should be levied in england this mode of taxation it has already been observed when applied to objects of a speedy consumption is not a very convenient one it might be adopted however in cases where no better could be done  sugar rum and tobacco are commodities which are no where necessaries of life which are become objects of almost universal consumption and which are therefore extremely proper subjects of taxation if a union with the colonies was to take place those commodities might be taxed either before they go out of the hands of the manufacturer or grower or if this mode of taxation did not suit the circumstances of those persons they might be deposited in public warehouses both at the place of manufacture and at all the different ports of the empire to which they might afterward be transported to remain there under the joint custody of the owner and the revenue officer till such time as they should be delivered out either to the consumer to the merchant retailer for home consumption or to the merchant exporter the tax not to be advanced till such delivery when delivered out for exportation to go duty free upon proper security being given that they should really be exported out of the empire these are perhaps the principal commodities with regard to which a union with the colonies might require some considerable change in the present system of british taxation  what might be the amount of the revenue which this system of taxation extended to all the different provinces of the empire might produce it must no doubt be altogether impossible to ascertain with tolerable exactness by means of this system there is annually levied in great britain upon less than eight millions of people more than ten millions of revenue ireland contains more than two millions of people and according to the accounts laid before the congress the twelve associated provinces of america contain more than three those accounts however may have been exaggerated in order perhaps either to encourage their own people or to intimidate those of this country and we shall suppose therefore that our north american and west indian colonies taken together contain no more than three millions or that the whole british empire in europe and america contains no more than thirteen millions of inhabitants if upon less than eight millions of inhabitants this system of taxation raises a revenue of more than ten millions sterling it ought upon thirteen millions of inhabitants to raise a revenue of more than sixteen millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling from this revenue supposing that this system could produce it must be deducted the revenue usually raised in ireland and the plantations for defraying the expense of their respective civil governments the expense of the civil and military establishment of ireland together with the interest of the public debt amounts at a medium of the two years which ended march      to something less than seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds a year by a very exact account of the revenue of the principal colonies of america and the west indies it amounted before the commencement of the late disturbances to a hundred and fortyone thousand eight hundred pounds in this account however the revenue of maryland of north carolina and of all our late acquisitions both upon the continent and in the islands is omitted which may perhaps make a difference of thirty or forty thousand pounds for the sake of even numbers therefore let us suppose that the revenue necessary for supporting the civil government of ireland and the plantations may amount to a million there would remain consequently a revenue of fifteen millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds to be applied toward defraying the general expense of the empire and toward paying the public debt but if from the present revenue of great britain a million could in peaceable times be spared toward the payment of that debt six millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds could very well be spared from this improved revenue this great sinking fund too might be augmented every year by the interest of the debt which had been discharged the year before and might in this manner increase so very rapidly as to be sufficient in a few years to discharge the whole debt and thus to restore completely the at present debilitated and languishing vigor of the empire in the meantime the people might be relieved from some of the most burdensome taxes from those which are imposed either upon the necessaries of life or upon the materials of manufacture the laboring poor would thus be enabled to live better to work cheaper and to send their goods cheaper to market the cheapness of their goods would increase the demand for them and consequently for the labor of those who produced them this increase in the demand for labor would both increase the numbers and improve the circumstances of the laboring poor their consumption would increase and together with it the revenue arising from all those articles of their consumption upon which the taxes might be allowed to remain  the revenue arising from this system of taxation however might not immediately increase in proportion to the number of people who were subjected to it great indulgence would for some time be due to those provinces of the empire which were thus subjected to burdens to which they had not before been accustomed and even when the same taxes came to be levied every where as exactly as possible they would not every where produce a revenue proportioned to the numbers of the people in a poor country the consumption of the principal commodities subject to the duties of customs and excise is very small and in a thinly inhabited country the opportunities of smuggling are very great the consumption of malt liquors among the inferior ranks of people in scotland is very small and the excise upon malt beer and ale produces less there than in england in proportion to the numbers of the people and the rate of the duties which upon malt is different on account of a supposed difference of quality in these particular branches of the excise there is not i apprehend much more smuggling in the one country than in the other the duties upon the distillery and the greater part of the duties of customs in proportion to the numbers of people in the respective countries produce less in scotland than in england not only on account of the smaller consumption of the taxed commodities but of the much greater facility of smuggling in ireland the inferior ranks of people are still poorer than in scotland and many parts of the country are almost as thinly inhabited in ireland therefore the consumption of the taxed commodities might in proportion to the number of the people be still less than in scotland and the facility of smuggling nearly the same in america and the west indies the white people even of the lowest rank are in much better circumstances than those of the same rank in england and their consumption of all the luxuries in which they usually indulge themselves is probably much greater the blacks indeed who make the greater part of the inhabitants both of the southern colonies upon the continent and of the west indian islands as they are in a state of slavery are no doubt in a worse condition than the poorest people either in scotland or ireland we must not however upon that account imagine that they are worse fed or that their consumption of articles which might be subjected to moderate duties is less than that even of the lower ranks of people in england in order that they may work well it is the interest of their master that they should be fed well and kept in good heart in the same manner as it is his interest that his working cattle should be so the blacks accordingly have almost every where their allowance of rum and of melasses or spruce beer in the same manner as the white servants and this allowance would not probably be withdrawn though those articles should be subjected to moderate duties the consumption of the taxed commodities therefore in proportion to the number of inhabitants would probably be as great in america and the west indies as in any part of the british empire the opportunities of smuggling indeed would be much greater america in proportion to the extent of the country being much more thinly inhabited than either scotland or ireland if the revenue however which is at present raised by the different duties upon malt and malt liquors was to be levied by a single duty upon malt the opportunity of smuggling in the most important branch of the excise would be almost entirely taken away and if the duties of customs instead of being imposed upon almost all the different artioles of importation were confined to a few of the most general use and consumption and if the levying of those duties was subjected to the excise laws the opportunity of smuggling though not so entirely taken away would be very much diminished in consequence of those two apparently very simple and easy alterations the duties of customs and excise might probably produce a revenue as great in proportion to the consumption of the most thinly inhabited province as they do at present in proportion to that of the most populous  the americans it has been said indeed have no gold or silver money the interior commerce of the country being carried on by a paper currency and the gold and silver which occasionally come among them being all sent to great britain in return for the commodities which they receive from us but without gold and silver it is added there is no possibility of paying taxes we already get all the gold and silver which they have how is it possible to draw from them what they have not  the present scarcity of gold and silver money in america is not the effect of the poverty of that country or of the inability of the people there to purchase those metals in a country where the wages of labor are so much higher and the price of provisions so much lower than in england the greater part of the people must surely have wherewithal to purchase a greater quantity if it was either necessary or convenient for them to do so the scarcity of those metals therefore must be the effect of choice and not of necessity  it is for transacting either domestic or foreign business that gold and silver money is either necessary or convenient  the domestic business of every country it has been shown in the second book of this inquiry may at least in peaceable times be transacted by means of a paper currency with nearly the same degree of convenience as by gold and silver money it is convenient for the americans who could always employ with profit in the improvement of their lands a greater stock than they can easily get to save as much as possible the expense of so costly an instrument of commerce as gold and silver and rather to employ that part of their surplus produce which would be necessary for purchasing those metals in purchasing the instruments of trade the materials of clothing several parts of household furniture and the ironwork necessary for building and extending their settlements and plantations in purchasing not dead stock but active and productive stock the colony governments find it for their interest to supply people with such a quantity of papermoney as is fully sufficient and generally more than sufficient for transacting their domestic business some of those governments that of pensylvania particularly derive a revenue from lending this papermoney to their subjects at an interest of so much percent others like that of massachusets bay advance upon extraordinary emergencies a papermoney of this kind for defraying the public expense and afterward when it suits the convenience of the colony redeem it at the depreciated value to which it gradually falls in      see hutchinsons history of massachusets bay vol ii page     and seq that colony paid in this manner the greater part of its public debts with the tenth part of the money for which its bills had been granted it suits the convenience of the planters to save the expense of employing gold and silver money in their domestic transactions and it suits the convenience of the colony governments to supply them with a medium which though attended with some very considerable disadvantages enables them to save that expense the redundancy of paper money necessarily banishes gold and silver from the domestic transactions of the colonies for the same reason that it has banished those metals from the greater part of the domestic transactions of scotland and in both countries it is not the poverty but the enterprising and projecting spirit of the people their desire of employing all the stock which they can get as active and productive stock which has occasioned this redundancy of paper money  in the exterior commerce which the different colonies carry on with great britain gold and silver are more or less employed exactly in proportion as they are more or less necessary where those metals are not necessary they seldom appear where they are necessary they are generally found  in the commerce between great britain and the tobacco colonies the british goods are generally advanced to the colonists at a pretty long credit and are afterward paid for in tobacco rated at a certain price it is more convenient for the colonists to pay in tobacco than in gold and silver it would be more convenient for any merchant to pay for the goods which his correspondents had sold to him in some other sort of goods which he might happen to deal in than in money such a merchant would have no occasion to keep any part of his stock by him unemployed and in ready money for answering occasional demands he could have at all times a larger quantity of goods in his shop or warehouse and he could deal to a greater extent but it seldom happens to be convenient for all the correspondents of a merchant to receive payment for the goods which they sell to him in goods of some other kind which he happens to deal in the british merchants who trade to virginia and maryland happen to be a particular set of correspondents to whom it is more convenient to receive payment for the goods which they sell to those colonies in tobacco than in gold and silver they expect to make a profit by the sale of the tobacco they could make none by that of the gold and silver gold and silver therefore very seldom appear in the commerce between great britain and the tobacco colonies maryland and virginia have as little occasion for those metals in their foreign as in their domestic commerce they are said accordingly to have less gold and silver money than any other colonies in america they are reckoned however as thriving and consequently as rich as any of their neighbors  in the northern colonies pensylvania new york new jersey the four governments of new england etc the value of their own produce which they export to great britain is not equal to that of the manufactures which they import for their own use and for that of some of the other colonies to which they are the carriers a balance therefore must be paid to the mother country in gold and silver and this balance they generally find  in the sugar colonies the value of the produce annually exported to great britain is much greater than that of all the goods imported from thence if the sugar and rum annually sent to the mother country were paid for in those colonies great britain would be obliged to send out every year a very large balance in money and the trade to the west indies would by a certain species of politicians be considered as extremely disadvantageous but it so happens that many of the principal proprietors of the sugar plantations reside in great britain their rents are remitted to them in sugar and rum the produce of their estates the sugar and rum which the west india merchants purchase in those colonies upon their own account are not equal in value to the goods which they annually sell there a balance therefore must generally be paid to them in gold and silver and this balance too is generally found  the difficulty and irregularity of payment from the different colonies to great britain have not been at all in proportion to the greatness or smallness of the balances which were respectively due from them payments have in general been more regular from the northern than from the tobacco colonies though the former have generally paid a pretty large balance in money while the latter have paid either no balance or a much smaller one the difficulty of getting payment from our different sugar colonies has been greater or less in proportion not so much to the extent of the balances respectively due from them as to the quantity of uncultivated land which they contained that is to the greater or smaller temptation which the planters have been under of overtrading or of undertaking the settlement and plantation of greater quantities of waste land than suited the extent of their capitals the returns from the great island of jamaica where there is still much uncultivated land have upon this account been in general more irregular and uncertain than those from the smaller islands of barbados antigua and st christophers which have for these many years been completely cultivated and have upon that account afforded less field for the speculations of the planter the new acquisitions of grenada tobago st vincents and dominica have opened a new field for speculations of this kind and the returns from those islands have of late been as irregular and uncertain as those from the great island of jamaica  it is not therefore the poverty of the colonies which occasions in the greater part of them the present scarcity of gold and silver money their great demand for active and productive stock makes it convenient for them to have as little dead stock as possible and disposes them upon that account to content themselves with a cheaper though less commodious instrument of commerce than gold and silver they are thereby enabled to convert the value of that gold and silver into the instruments of trade into the materials of clothing into household furniture and into the iron work necessary for building and extending their settlements and plantations in those branches of business which cannot be transacted without gold and silver money it appears that they can always find the necessary quantity of those metals and if they frequently do not find it their failure is generally the effect not of their necessary poverty but of their unnecessary and excessive enterprise it is not because they are poor that their payments are irregular and uncertain but because they are too eager to become excessively rich though all that part of the produce of the colony taxes which was over and above what was necessary for defraying the expense of their own civil and military establishments were to be remitted to great britain in gold and silver the colonies have abundantly wherewithal to purchase the requisite quantity of those metals they would in this case be obliged indeed to exchange a part of their surplus produce with which they now purchase active and productive stock for dead stock in transacting their domestic business they would be obliged to employ a costly instead of a cheap instrument of commerce and the expense of purchasing this costly instrument might damp somewhat the vivacity and ardour of their excessive enterprise in the improvement of land it might not however be necessary to remit any part of the american revenue in gold and silver it might be remitted in bills drawn upon and accepted by particular merchants or companies in great britain to whom a part of the surplus produce of america had been consigned who would pay into the treasury the american revenue in money after having themselves received the value of it in goods and the whole business might frequently be transacted without exporting a single ounce of gold and silver from america  it is not contrary to justice that both ireland and america should contribute toward the discharge of the public debt of great britain that debt has been contracted in support of the government established by the revolution a government to which the protestants of ireland owe not only the whole authority which they at present enjoy in their own country but every security which they possess for their liberty their property and their religion a government to which several of the colonies of america owe their present charters and consequently their present constitution and to which all the colonies of america owe the liberty security and property which they have ever since enjoyed that public debt has been contracted in the defense not of great britain alone but of all the different provinces of the empire the immense debt contracted in the late war in particular and a great part of that contracted in the war before were both properly contracted in defense of america  by a union with great britain ireland would gain besides the freedom of trade other advantages much more important and which would much more than compensate any increase of taxes that might accompany that union by the union with england the middling and inferior ranks of people in scotland gained a complete deliverance from the power of an aristocracy which had always before oppressed them by a union with great britain the greater part of the people of all ranks in ireland would gain an equally complete deliverance from a much more oppressive aristocracy an aristocracy not founded like that of scotland in the natural and respectable distinctions of birth and fortune but in the most odious of all distinctions those of religious and political prejudices distinctions which more than any other animate both the insolence of the oppressors and the hatred and indignation of the oppressed and which commonly render the inhabitants of the same country more hostile to one another than those of different countries ever are without a union with great britain the inhabitants of ireland are not likely for many ages to consider themselves as one people  no oppressive aristocracy has ever prevailed in the colonies even they however would in point of happiness and tranquillity gain considerably by a union with great britain it would at least deliver them from those rancorous and virulent factions which are inseparable from small democracies and which have so frequently divided the affections of their people and disturbed the tranquillity of their governments in their form so nearly democratical in the case of a total separation from great britain which unless prevented by a union of this kind seems very likely to take place those factions would be ten times more virulent than ever before the commencement of the present disturbances the coercive power of the mother country had always been able to restrain those factions from breaking out into any thing worse than gross brutality and insult if that coercive power was entirely taken away they would probably soon break out into open violence and bloodshed in all great countries which are united under one uniform government the spirit of party commonly prevails less in the remote provinces than in the center of the empire the distance of those provinces from the capital from the principal seat of the great scramble of faction and ambition makes them enter less into the views of any of the contending parties and renders them more indifferent and impartial spectators of the conduct of all the spirit of party prevails less in scotland than in england in the case of a union it would probably prevail less in ireland than in scotland and the colonies would probably soon enjoy a degree of concord and unanimity at present unknown in any part of the british empire both ireland and the colonies indeed would be subjected to heavier taxes than any which they at present pay in consequence however of a diligent and faithful application of the public revenue toward the discharge of the national debt the greater part of those taxes might not be of long continuance and the public revenue of great britain might soon be reduced to what was necessary for maintaining a moderate peace establishment  the territorial acquisitions of the east india company the undoubted right of the crown that is of the state and people of great britain might be rendered another source of revenue more abundant perhaps than all those already mentioned those countries are represented as more fertile more extensive and in proportion to their extent much richer and more populous than great britain in order to draw a great revenue from them it would not probably be necessary to introduce any new system of taxation into countries which are already sufficiently and more than sufficiently taxed it might perhaps be more proper to lighten than to aggravate the burden of those unfortunate countries and to endeavor to draw a revenue from them not by imposing new taxes but by preventing the embezzlement and misapplication of the greater part of those which they already pay  if it should be found impracticable for great britain to draw any considerable augmentation of revenue from any of the resources abovementioned the only resource which can remain to her is a diminution of her expense in the mode of collecting and in that of expending the public revenue though in both there may be still room for improvement great britain seems to be at least as oeconomical as any of her neighbors the military establishment which she maintains for her own defense in time of peace is more moderate than that of any european state which can pretend to rival her either in wealth or in power none of those articles therefore seem to admit of any considerable reduction of expense the expense of the peace establishment of the colonies was before the commencement of the present disturbances very considerable and is an expense which may and if no revenue can be drawn from them ought certainly to be saved altogether this constant expense in time of peace though very great is insignificant in comparison with what the defense of the colonies has cost us in time of war the last war which was undertaken altogether on account of the colonies cost great britain it has already been observed upwards of ninety millions the spanish war of      was principally undertaken on their account in which and in the french war that was the consequence of it great britain spent upwards of forty millions a great part of which ought justly to be charged to the colonies in those two wars the colonies cost great britain much more than double the sum which the national debt amounted to before the commencement of the first of them had it not been for those wars that debt might and probably would by this time have been completely paid and had it not been for the colonies the former of those wars might not and the latter certainly would not have been undertaken it was because the colonies were supposed to be provinces of the british empire that this expense was laid out upon them but countries which contribute neither revenue nor military force toward the support of the empire cannot be considered as provinces they may perhaps be considered as appendages as a sort of splendid and showy equipage of the empire but if the empire can no longer support the expense of keeping up this equipage it ought certainly to lay it down and if it cannot raise its revenue in proportion to its expense it ought at least to accommodate its expense to its revenue if the colonies notwithstanding their refusal to submit to british taxes are still to be considered as provinces of the british empire their defense in some future war may cost great britain as great an expense as it ever has done in any former war the rulers of great britain have for more than a century past amused the people with the imagination that they possessed a great empire on the west side of the atlantic this empire however has hitherto existed in imagination only it has hitherto been not an empire but the project of an empire not a gold mine but the project of a gold mine a project which has cost which continues to cost and which if pursued in the same way as it has been hitherto is likely to cost immense expense without being likely to bring any profit for the effects of the monopoly of the colony trade it has been shown are to the great body of the people mere loss instead of profit it is surely now time that our rulers should either realize this golden dream in which they have been indulging themselves perhaps as well as the people or that they should awake from it themselves and endeavor to awaken the people if the project cannot be completed it ought to be given up if any of the provinces of the british empire cannot be made to contribute toward the support of the whole empire it is surely time that great britain should free herself from the expense of defending those provinces in time of war and of supporting any part of their civil or military establishments in time of peace and endeavor to accommodate her future views and designs to the real mediocrity of her circumstances  finis books printed for and sold by t cadell in the strand quarto the history of england from the invasion of julius caesar to the revolution a
