printed for j roberts near the oxfordarms in warwick lane mdccxxvi price threepence  it cannot rain but it pours or london strowd with rarities being an account of the arrival of a white bear at the house of mr ratcliff in bishopsgatestreet etc we shall begin with a description of peter the savage deferring our other curiosities to some following papers  romulus and remus the two famous wild men of antiquity and orsin that of the moderns have been justly the admiration of all mankind nor can we presage less of this wild youth as may be gathered from that famous and wellknown prophecy of lillys which being now accomplished is most easily interpreted when rome shall wend to benevento and espagne breaking the assiento when eagle split shall fly to china and christian folks adore faustina then shall an oak be brought to bed of creature neither taught nor fed great feats shall he atchieve    the pope is now going to benevento the spaniards have broke their treaty the emperor trades to china and lilly were he alive must be convinced that it was not the empress faustina that was was meant in the prophecy  it is evident by several tokens about this wild gentleman that he had a father and mother like one of us but there being no register of his christning his age is only to be guessed at by his stature and countenance and appears to be about twelve or thirteen his being so young was the occasion of the great disappointment of the ladies who came to the drawing room in full expectation of some attempt upon their chastity so far is true that he endeavored to kiss the young lady w  le who for that reason is become the envy of the circle this being a declaration of nature in favor of her superior beauty  aristotle says that man is the most mimick of all animals which opinion of that great philosopher is strongly confirmed by the behavior of this wild gentleman who is endowed with that quality to an extreme degree he received his first impressions at court his manners are first to lick peoples hands and then turn his breech upon them to thrust his hand into every bodys pocket to climb over peoples heads and even to make use of the royal hand to take what he has a mind to at his first appearance he seized on the lord chamberlains staff put on his hat before the king from whence some have conjectured that he is either descended from a grandee of spain or the earls of kingsale in ireland however these are manifest tokens of his innate ambition he is extremly tenacious of his own property and ready to invade that of other people by this mimick quality he discovered what wild beast had nursed him observing children to ask blessing of their mothers one day he fell down upon his knees to a sow and muttered some sounds in that humble posture  it has been commonly thought that he is u  natural brother because of some resemblance of manners and the officious care of u  about him but the superiority of the parts and genius in peter demonstrates this to be impossible  though he is ignorant both of ancient and modern languages that care being left to the ingenious physician who is entrusted with his education yet he distinguishes objects by certain sounds framed to himself which mr rotenberg who brought him over understands perfectly beholding one day the shambles with great fear and astonishment ever since he calls man by the same sound which expresses wolf a young lady is a peacock old women magpyes and owls a beau with a toupee a monkey glass ice blue red and green ribbons he calls rainbows an heap of gold a turd the first ship he saw he took to be a great beast swimming on her back and her feet tied above her the men that came out of the hold he took to be her cubs and wondered they were so unlike their dam he understands perfectly the language of all beasts and birds and is not like them confined to that of one species he can bring any beast what he calls for and no doubt is much missed now in his native woods where he used to do good offices among his fellow citizens and served as a mediator to reconcile their differences one day he warned a flock of sheep that were driving to the shambles of their danger and upon uttering some sounds they all fled he takes vast pleasure in conversation with horses and going to the meuse to converse with two of his intimate acquaintances in the kings stable as he passed by he neighed to the horse at charing cross being as it were surpised to see him so high he seemed to take it ill that the horse did not answer him but i think no body can undervalue his understanding for not being skilled in statuary  he expresses his joy most commonly by neighing and whatever the philosophers may talk of their risibility neighing is a more noble expression of that passion than laughing which seems to me to have something silly in it and besides is often attended with tears other animals are sensible they debase themselves by mimicking laughter and i take it to be a general observation that the top felicity of mankind is to imitate monkeys and birds witness harlequins scaramouches and masquerades on the other hand monkeys when they would look extremely silly endeavor to bring themselves down to mankind love he expresses by the cooing of a dove and anger by the croaking of a raven and it is not doubted but that he will serve in time as an interpreter between us and other animals  great instruction is to be had from this wild youth in the knowledge of simples and i am of opinion that he ought always to attend the censors of the college in their visitation of apothecaries shops  i am told that the new sect of herbeaters intend to follow him into the fields or to beg him for a clerk of their kitchen and that there are many of them now thinking of turning their children into woods to graze with the cattle in hopes to raise a healthy and moral race refined from the corruptions of this luxurious world  he sings naturally several pretty tunes of his own composing and with equal facility in the chromatick inharmonick and diatonick style and consequently must be of infinite use to the academy in judging of the merits of their composers and is the only person that ought to decide betwixt cuzzoni and faustina  i cannot omit his first notion of clothes which he took to be the natural skins of the creatures that wore them and seemed to be in great pain for the pulling off a stocking thinking the poor man was a fleaing  i am not ignorant that there are disaffected people who say he is a pretender and no genuine wild man this calumny proceeds from the false notions they have of wild men which they frame from such as they see about the town whose actions are rather absurd than wild therefore it will be incumbent on all young gentlemen who are ambitious to excel in this character to copy this true original of nature  the senses of this wild man are vastly more acute than those of a tame one he can follow the track of a man or any other beast of prey a dog is an ass to him for finding troufes his hearing is more perfect because his ears not having been cofind by bandages he can move them like a drill and turn them toward the sonorous object  let us pray the creator of all beings wild and tame that as this wild youth by being brought to court has been made a christian so such as are at court and are no christians may lay aside their savage and rapacious nature and return to the meekness of the gospel  advertisement to warn all ladies and gentlemen who intend to visit this wild man not to carry any thing in their pockets that is indecent to prevent accidents for the future
