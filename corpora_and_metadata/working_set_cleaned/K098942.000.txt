indeed said lucid i have often heard fair rosalind of diverse fowly blamed for being to that swain too cruel hard that her bright glory else has much defamed spensers colin clouts come home again yet once again by wayward fortune led i view the sacred walls where dwelt my fair where blessed with her my days in rapture fled too soon alloyd and shaded with despair three years are past since first my yielding heart it is virgin vows to love and delia paid sincere itself it never suspected art and ah what changes those three years have made young corydon to whom the fair one gave her earliest faith and holiest union vowed sleeps in the silent chamber of the grave and for a wedding garment wears a shroud large tides of grief in delias bosom rolled but soon dametas dried the mourners tears dametas rich but petulant and old and damned with jealousy the crime of years what need i more  by treacherous friends deceived he marked each venial fault with jaundicd eyes each paltry tale with partial ear believed and construed indiscretion into vice now banished from a husbands board she mourns her woes embitterd by a parents frown condemned rejected for a crime she scorns and like a dream her transient glories flown fair daughter of the morn thy star is set thy star is set nor ever more must rise o may no wrongs of mine in judgment met swell thy full souls distress with added cries we might have lived  ah sadly pleasing thought vain recollection what art thou to me we might have lived as virtuous love had taught in unreproved pleasures ever free we might have lived  but execrable gold loves unsubstantial claims and tears outweighd for wealth her charms the venal delia sold for wealth her lover and her friend betrayed for me who now with pain review the place where once my delia called her colin dear each wellknown path with aching heart retrace think on her ickleness and drop a tear silent and sole i seek the accustomed bower the bower once sacred to my love and me where often with her i passed the enraptured hour and bore the siren charmer on my knee i seek the plane whose trunk with mine combined bears the dear letters of my delias name i mark their growth but that distracts my mind for such i once had hoped our mutual flame even while i write these scenes of former bliss such fond reflections in my bosom move what then my fortune was what now it is that though i cannot esteem i still must love i love but it is not with that youthful heat which once inflamed my soul to reason blind it is with that soothing grief that soft regret which those who think on friends departed find i grieve but it is a calm and virtuous woe by reason sanctified by heaven approved it is such as kindred saints in heaven might know seeing those fall whom when on earth they loved time and reflection long have chased away the painted phantoms that bewitched my sight gods wise behests submissive i obey and own convinced whatever is is right vain love farewell  for me should heaven design such added blessing to my future life soon may i call the ingenuous mira mine and meet unwarpt by love a virtuous wife colin to his friends exhorting him to the attainment of honors by a steady application to the law business too often the frivolous pretense of human lusts to shake off innocence business the grave impertinence business the thing which i of all things hate business the contradiction of thy fate cowleys complaint  the muse speaks my friends no more  your kind remonstrance spare your kind remonstrance your advice is vain conscious i shall not answer half your care it serves no purpose but to give me pain i cannot feel one wish for pomp or power i seek no titles i desire no place born as i was in unambitious hour i scorn the prize and can i run the race when westminster hall in the courts i take my silent stand unenvious i behold the judges state behold with pitying eye laws restless band and wonder man will bustle to be great onward i pass  a soberer scene succeeds westminster abbey it is the sad mansion of departed kings where every stone that blazons forth their deeds proclaims the vanity of earthly things proclaims the aspiring crowd i left behind mere insect swarms that shine but for an hour then nipt by cold or shattered by the wind fleet like the transient bow that gilds a shower shall i then sacrifice lifes happiest prime to gain employments i should wish to shun enslave the sacred freedom of my time to win a title i should hate when won no  let me live with independence blessed blessed with the sweets of no unlearned ease indulge the unruffld calm my soul loves best and eat my bread in privacy and peace one sole inducement could have roused my mind that sole inducement has been long no more delia was false  with her at once resigned fled all the schemes i ever formed for power had she been mine what could not i have done to give that wealth she now has bought so dear what prize so great that i could not have won when all my efforts were inspired by her now for myself i live  with books my morn with friends perchance my evening hours are spent the rich mans wonder and the proud mans scorn i envy neither for i feel content free unconstrained my countrys laws i choose those laws by which even monarchs are controlled their changes trace their origin deduce but do it for instruction not for gold thus let me live till manhoods steadier day matures the seeds that laboring youth has sown then might some favoring female chastely gay wise without pride and fair without a frown would such a one from mean coquetry free who held her word as sacred as her fame would mira plight her spotless faith to me and at the altar grace her colins name blessed beyond hope how gladly i would forswear the wild fantastic pageants london yields to breathe the countrys pure untainted air that sweeps with freshning breeze the newploughd fields me rural scenes me woods and streams can please that through the fertile vales irriguous rove here let me stretch my wearied limbs at ease for i inglorious woods and streams can love happy the man whose philosophic eye could to their causes natures workings trace could learn from thence deaths terrors to defy and joy to meet his maker face to face blessed too is he whom woods and streams can charm whose humble thoughts to lesser flights aspire who tunes his heart with thankful rapture warm to natures bounteous lord the rural lyre no toil of office ruffles his repose no purpled monarchs proud unyielding state unversd in public scenes he little knows the loud discordant senates vain debate he little knows the embattled powers that join from britains grasp her western world to rend nor sees her sickening genius droop and pine nor deems her lessening glories near their end untost by storms he gently glides through life his fields his trees give sweet though simple fare he scapes the madding towns unholy strife he scapes the noisy clamours of the bar the delights of fancy on the green bank i sat and listened long sitting was more convenient for the song nor till her lay was ended could i move but wished to dwell for ever in the grove only methought the time too swiftly passed and every note i feared would be the last my sight and smell and hearing were employed and all three senses in full gust enjoyed and what alone did all the rest surpass the sweet possession of the fairy place single and conscious to myself alone of pleasures to the excluded world unknown pleasures which no where else were to be found and all elysium in a spot of ground drydens flower and leaf imitated from chaucer again the summer shines with mightier flame the sun exults his lengthened course to roll and wide diffuses through the human frame a languid bliss that melts the poets soul it melts the soul but gives the power to sing those visionary scenes itself inspires tunes it to harmonies of noblest string and bids it glow with more than mortal fires great life of all the world and lord of day best symbol of our common makers might well might the unguided heathen thee obey and prostrate hail thy orbs returning light for often myself have felt thy rapturous heat steal over my senses like a fairy dream then when my yielding limbs have sought retreat and sunk in silence near some shaded stream my soul on fancys wing sublimely borne has mused of scenes too bright for mortal eye has seen white robes by saints and martyrs worn and heard the eternal carols of the sky often too luxuriant fancy reigns alone and calls from fablers old a varying band and scenes of bliss to waking life unknown rise change and vanish as she gives command imagination works with all her powers and gorgeous knights in glittering troops are seen and courteous squires and dwarfs and moated towers and all the splendours of the gothic scene bards too of other times resume their lyres the glorious tale that chaucers knight has told sounds in mine ears and fills me with its fires and now the jousting warriors i behold and palamon is to the stake conveyed now from the earth upstarts the infernal fiend now dying arcite wills the dear bought maid if she can ever love to love his friend anon see spensers faerie queen prince arthurs blazing shield oerthrows the giant conqueror of the red cross knight or ruthless talus drives his host of foes with unrelenting flail and iron might dear scenes of blessed delusion golden dreams and always innocent and always new where often with truths sublime the fiction teems and virtues noblest patterns strike the view ye feed the fancy nor seduce the heart for from our reach remote your actions lie no youth can now assume pyrochles part no modern maid like poor see sir philip sidneys arcadia parthenia die not so the spurious and destructive brood the graceless toys of more enlightened times that teach the child to languish to be wooed create her follies and contrive her crimes these clear the paths to ruin and to shame perhaps by these poor delia was undone delia whose lost and desolated fame friendship can only weep and virtue shun but o the gorgeous tales of earlier days where fancy shines in mystic fiction bright where chastity is womans fairest praise and virtues cause inspires the venurous knight be these my choice and who by these refined would bear the business of lifes public crowd would change these wandrings of the enchanted mind for all the splendid slavery of the proud but these to few are given  unknown they lie unsought unhonourd by the venal herd where purseproud wealth can injured worth defy and poverty alone is shunned and feared unknown they lie where sturdy labor lives and earns with ceaseless care his scanty meal often too where chance the powers of leisure gives superior fate denies the power to feel yet some perchance in this tempestuous time some still remain and sure not meanly blessed whose rambling thoughts have reached this rapturous clime and viewed these scenes of fancy and of rest for them all nature breathes elysian grace and sweets ambrosial stream from every flower fairies for them the greensward ringlets trace and magicks mightiest influence guards their bower and should blessed competence from heaven descend and from a patrons will their freedom save to such congenial with myself i will bend and consecrate the verse these visions gave the end
