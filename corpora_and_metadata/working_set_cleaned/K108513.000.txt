a token for mariners   a token for mariners containing many famous and wonderful instances of gods providence in sea danger and deliverances in mercifully preserving the lives of his poor creatures when in humane probability at the point of perishing by shipwreck famine or other accidents  uch enlarged with the addition of many new relations mostly attested by the persons themselves  also the seamans preacher ing a sermon on the right improvement of such mercies and  prayers for seamen on all occasions  london nted for h n and s h by the bookselles   0   the preface to the reader and particularly to mariners and other seafaringmen though gods wonders are every where visible and his mercies no where hid from the eyes of man yet more particularly are they evident to seafaringmen whose business is in the great waters and their lives exposed more than others to innumerable hazards and dangers of contending winds and seas rocks quicksands and inhospitable shores these as it were carry their lives in their hands and their best security is wholly to rely on the providence and protection of him whose power the wind and the waves obey seeing there is so small a partition between them and eternity the striking on a treacherous rock over which many times the flattering waves smoothly glide gives them their winding sheet in a rumpled wave nor  this all their danger the springing of  plank a leak not to be found nor suddenly stopped running on a shoal or the falling of a waterspout frequently carry with them the same inevitable fate and often makes them at their wits end before they en their lives for a certain prospect of unavoidable death must needs be terrible to flesh and blood and in a great measure remove that constant presence of mind that should support their spirits amidst all dangers from this there is no way to secure themselves but by laying hold on him that i mighty and able to save to the utmost  god who is a present help at need whose eyes are in all places in heaven and earth and in the great deep and those that cry t him in their distress he will surely hear them and deliver them out of all their troubles if they are sincere in heart and walk uprightly with him for a praying pauls sake w find though the ship was broken and perished on a rock on the coast of the island anciently melita now called malta all that were in it were saved when they expected nothing less than to be swallowed up in that dangerous ocean as we find in the acts chap    therefore the best thing i can recommend to mariners and others that navigate the deep is to have a steadfast reliance on god in all their dangers nay at all times for that is the best and surest anchor hold and security that recourse to can be had and therefore i have furnished this book with many wonderful and remarkable seadeliverances to show them that their hopes are not in vain for the wonders he has already wrought he will doubtless continue to all that fear and put their trust in him  this collection is taken mostly from the mouths of those who have experienced gods mercy this way and whose dangers have been as great as any could be on this side the grave yet god in his mercy delivered them out of all the rest are taken from such reverend authors that their credit and integrity is indisputable being purposely written to raise the minds of men to contemplate and adore the love and goodness of the all wise creator of the universe and may indifferently serve to this end as well at land as sea though chiefly intended for seafaring men to put them in mind when they read it of their danger and what they may expect in their danger from the death they apprehend in it if they apply their hearts to true wisdom when all help or hopes fail or seem to be at a loss then fix your hearts and eyes steadfastly on him who is able to do all things and to whom nothing is impossible on him in whose hands is all the breath of life who can stop the shafts of death in their winged motion check the bellowing thunder in the mid volley and turn the raging of the winds to a sudden calm  but not to be tedious in a preface i recommend this to you as a suitable companion in your voyages or travels nay in your houses or at all times that you may know these things are the lords doing though they are mavelous in your eyes and so conclude subscribing my self  christian reader your friend and servant jj  remarkable sea deliverances one major gibbons a man well known in new england a gentleman of good education good parts and of good conversation as the author has been credibly informed by them that knew him was bound upon a voyage to sea himself being super cargo with such commodities as those parts of america affords after going out from boston several days by hard weather and contrary winds the ships company were much distressed and by the continuance of contrary winds provisions now begin o fail them and o how feeble do spirits grow when bread the staff of life fails now hunger becomes more dreadful to them than the every moment treatning billows of the devouring ocean and they that one while feared drowning now fear starving they are brought to the last meal in the barrel and the last oil in the cruse and say we will eat this little that is left and dye and now when they thought they had eaten the last what conflicts must they needs have within themselves who knew not where to have another morsel to fortify their tired and spent spirits with the constant toil and hard labor how they look one upon another as men already under a sentence of death and by one another looks strike terror to one another hearts they look on every side psalm          as david says i looked on my right hand but there was no man that would know me refuge failed me or perished from me they look downwards and see nothing but the belly of destruction opening for them they look upwards the only and last refuge and remey in this deplorable estate and out of the depths they cried to the lord  but though they look out of the ship as noah did out of his ark upon the waters and send forth the dove of prayer that winged messenger to heaven yet she brings no olive branch no answer the waters assuage not the winds calm not they are like the prophets servant when he bids him   kings      go up now and look toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there is nothing and this strikes them into doleful and dismal lamentations out of which lamentations at last springs up a tragical and sorrowful motion the motion is that which the mariners in jonahs vessel put in execution come let us cast lots etc only with this difference they cast lots to find out the delinquent and these which of them should die first to be a sacrifice for ravenous hunger to feed upon concluding as he in that case john    0 it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole ships company perish not life being sweet skin for skin and all that a man has will he give for his life they at last bring it through many a sad debate to a result they cast the lot the disposing of which is of the lord one of the company is arrested by the lot here is the condemned prisoner o but where is the executioner to be found to act his office upon a poor innocent is it not death to them now to think who shall act this bloody part in the tragedy but before they fall upon their involuntary execution major gibbons calls them to prayer considering that in the moment the lord is often seen and that many times our extremity proves gods opportunity he also asks the poor man if he was willing to die but o what a hard question is that to answer he replies if it might preserve the rest of the lives he could be the more willing to which he has this answer all events are in the hands of god we must not dispute them to prayer they go and o sure these prayers must melt hearts of adamant and behold while they are at it god sends a visible commentary upon that scripture esa     then shall thou call and the lord shall answer thou shall cry and he shall say here i am for while they were calling god was answering there leaps a mighty fish into the boat and as it is said of the whale that swallowed up jonah god prepared a fish so the lord here prepared or provided a fish that a poor creature might not be swallowed up but o what joy was here at such a token for good it not only at present relieving and refreshing their hunger which no question made them quick cooks but when they looked upon the finger of god in it sending it as an answer to prayer they conclude it an happy omen of their deliverance and a pledge of approaching mercy but alas it is not long before their hearts grew faint again their countenances pale their spirits sink now as low as they were lifted up high and now the poor seamen are like their ship one while mounted up in hopes to heaven and another while they are sunk down again in despair as low as hell they know not now of another cake another morsel they are reduced to their former exigency which brings them to a resolve to steer in this strait their old course to lots they go again the second time only they have such an honor for the providence of god they will not put him into condemnation that god has acquitted the lot now falls upon another person and o now they receive the old trouble and intestine combats how they shall find in their hearts to punish one that never had offended any of them and while one thinks of it says he alas poor man what has he done to deserve this sentence another cries will not this blood cleave to my conscience another day though i went to this expedition a pressed soldier another says for his part he fees no way but death therefore he cannot take away life when he sees not any life can be preserved by it but they are called again to look upward before they put the knife to the throat of this sacrifice and they remember the last encouragement to put life into almost the deadmens prayers they pray now with a pledge in their hands and are ready to tell god the last time he gave them a pawn an earnest and o it is not in vain to seek the lord for lo while they are seeking to him he is sending to them as the prayers fly to heaven mercy is dispatched upon the wing from heaven  o turn aside and see this great sight while they are praying behold a second answer from above a great bird lights and fixes her self upon the mast which one in the company espies and up he goes and there he stands till he took her with his hand by the wing and brought her down to the company and o what life from the dead is this to them a second time sure they will hearken to the voice of the second sign if not to the voice of the first and now that which they hoped by the first providence viz that it was a forerunner of their complete deliverance now they are by this second confirmed in the faith and now they begin to think as i can easily imagine if god will save them out of this distress o what manner of persons they will become what manner of lives they will live what sacrifices of thanksgiving they will offer up to god but while they are thus thinking they have no visible hopes but that it must be a third miracle that brings them out of this their miserable condition they have the same disappointments upon them still only now they divert their hunger all they can by telling of and remembering the loaves as i may say their experiences in this extremity of theirs and comforting themselves that if they come to a third strait it would they hoped be an outlet from their present misery and calamity they are reduced the third time to their former course and strait to cast lots and when they were to go to the heartaking work to put him to death upon whom the lot fell they go to their old friend in a day of adversity to god by hearty and humble prayer and o now they do as the prophets man at the sea side look again and again but alas master they cry there is nothing prayer is done concluded nothing appears o but as the prophets man looked seven times so says this good man major gibbons look again as jonah i will look again toward his holy temple says he to one of the company go up to the top and see what you can espy and at last he makes a sail viz espies a ship this put new life into all their spirits they bear up with the vessel they man their boat they desire in the manner of perishing humble suppliants to board them which they are admitted the vessel proves a french vessel yea a french pirate major gibbons petitions him for a little bread to sustain their lives who had been several days wishing for death but could not find it in their extremity and to take the ship and cargo so sweet is life that all that a man has will he give for his life and now behold god draws forth to the poor perishing men his best wine at the last nay turns the water of affliction into the wine of consolation the commander of the vessel knows the major and replies readily and cheerfully major gibbons not one hair of your head shall perish nor any of your ships company if it lie in my power either to supply you or preserve you o the wisdom of god that has ways we know not of to relieve in the greatest straits and cause himself to be seen in the mount the commander of this french pirate was one that some years before major gibbons had shown signal kindness to when his life was in danger at boston in new england thus the lord appeared a god hearing prayers in extremities which appearances are not to be forgotten in succeeding generations o that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men  secondly about the year      there arising a storm and tempest of troubles in the church of scotland five ministers eminent for piety learning and their honorable success in the ministry were so hard born under by a prevailing party imposing upon their consciences that they were forced to embarque themselves for america three of their names were mr levinston mr mackleland and mr blaire with two more whom my author could not call to mind  these good men sailed half the channel over about  00 leagues where they met with great distress of weather which broke off the rudder of their ship and occasioned a desperate leak to spring in her which exposed them to imminent danger but they in this distress endeavor to hang on their rudder again but often were they frustrated in their attempt to a total despair of effecting it they also labored with the like unsuccessfulness to find out and stop the leak this poor ships crew had labored also by pumping to keep the ship above water until all their few hands were feeble and all their hearts faint so that as so many despairing persons of life they cease all endeavors and yield themselves to death expecting every moment to be entombed in the belly of the devouring deep during the time of this their great distress the ministers kept on their course as at other times of worship viz the reading of a chapter in course and taking observations from it with prayers and preaching which they did by turns at the crisis of this deplorable case it fell to be the lot of mr mackleland to perform this exercise a man austeer in his life reserved in his speech and of great piety who was often observed to let fall many remarkable prophetical expressions of future events the chapter that at that time came to be read in course by him was the    of exodus which he had read all along until he came to the   th verse where he made a full stop the verses run thus  and moses besought the lord his god and said lord why does thy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou have brought out of the land of egypt with great power and a mighty hand wherefore should the egyptians say for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth turn from thy severe wrath and repent of this evil against thy people  upon the reading of these verses over again he declared to them the case which moses was here interceeding for compared with his expostulation in the    verse did parallel their case and considering the happy event of that argument which moses used mentioned in the    verse which runs thus and the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people  he could not but comfortably hope that they might have the same effect nay he goes further and his spirit was raised into a peremptory prediction that he durst assure them from his great lord and master that not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground after this he went to prayer urging god with the same argument and then rose up comfortably assuring his stedfastness in believing the same he advises the seamen and the company in the ship to refresh themselve by taking some meat the long fasling and hard labor having much infeebled them then he encouraged them to make another attempt to fasten the rudder without which they could not possibly make toward any point for shore he after advised them to clear the ship as well as they could from water by pumping which they did happily effect the leak being stopped providentially of it self  whether it was some noak of a plank started by the distress of weather which occasioned the leak and by the surges of the sea clapped into the place again or what it was else could not be known but however this looks like life from the dead to these poor men who had received but a little before sentence of death in themselves that they might trust in him who raises the dead soon after this god who had heard in heaven their tears and prayers commands the wind to tack about to the west and to blow so strong a gale that they were forced to bear up before it and it continued so long that it brought them back to the north of ireland where they continued some time although but short they were very instrumental in the converting of many souls which seedplot remains to this day and soon after they passed into scotland this relation was given by several ministers of the north of ireland also the reader may take notice the author of that book called the fulfilling of the scriptures page     mentions this remarkable providence though not so largely with these two additional but very considerable circumstances first that a poor seaman was made the instrument to preserve the same vessel by fastening the rudder whose company they had all shunned others having given it over secondly several passengers being aboard who shipped themselves for america upon only external accounts expecting a fat soil and outward advantage in that place and not as the others upon the account of conscience to enjoy the purity of ordinances they did all die upon the sea save one being five in number and who is so blind as cannot see here the outstretchd arm of an omnipotent god commanding deliverance for his poor distressed persecuted praying believing servants and also for all them that sailed with them o who would not pray at sea and trust in him who raises the dead in the saddest of their extremities and distress and speaks forth much of the power and goodness of god calling upon all to trust in him let the dangers and straits be never so great    a vessel of ours about the year      being at newfoundland a fishing being somewhat of the latest in the year until the ice came in great flakes and being ready to hoise sail for their return home they sent out in the boat six of the men to weigh their anchor but while they were about it a sad providence prevents them a great flake of ice interposes between them and their ship and carries them adrift so that by all means that they and the ship could use they could not recover their vessel again whereby they were exposed to an inevitable ruin neither having food nor any other accommodation to keep them warm they having continued thus three days and three nights they began to be hungerstarvd and accounting themselves all dead men they began to consult one with another what course to take they at last though with great regret and grief resolve one of them must die to become food for the rest each person begged to have it his lot to die first to be freed from that torment that they languished under so that they were forced to determine it by lot he upon whom the lot fell desired to go to one end of the boat there to recommend his soul to god by prayer before he dyed the rest being in a deep agony upon the apprehension of shedding the blood of one of their comrades but while they were sat together lamenting and imploring gods favor to prevent such a fact according to that they wished and desired the person separated by lot for death dyed upon the place where he was praying which in their deplorable condition occasioned great joy to the rest that hereby they were not forced against their wills to take his life so looking upon this as a good omen they proceeded to satisfy their hungers upon the dead body the boat was still adrift not frozen up so that by that time their food was spent they were brought ashore many leagues o the northward of new england where the five landed alive and the poor barbarians did commiserate them and help them as they could three of them died with the distress they had been in the other two made a shift to get to new england and so at last by a good hand upon them came to their habitations in the west of england having both lost their heels with the extremity of the cold in the boat this relation my author had from one of these two seamen with whom he came afterward a passenger from ireland to whom he showed his heels so lost    a small vessel about    tun the masters name philip hangare coming upon the coast of new england they suddenly sprang a leak and so foundred there were in this poor miscarrying vessel    seamen and passengers    of the men got into the longboat and as that was suddenly brought to their minds in this surprise they threw into their boat also some small matters of provisions but they were wholly without fire these    men at that time of the year about michaelmas and as paul said in his voyage sailing was become dangerous sailed five hundred leagues and were to a miracle preserved all that time in this small boat five weeks but it pleased the lord who appears in our straits most to send them great relief by causing some flying fish to fall into the boat which they eat raw and were unto them more acceptable than the greatest rarities and dainties at another time gods providence now proving the caterer they caught a shark and that ravenous fish that uses to prey upon men now becomes a prey to these poor distressed creatures but they were glad of food in the want of fire and have an heat in their stomachs to eat that raw and digest at this time what would have made them sick at other times but alas another want they had was drink as well as fire but they were forced to open the belly of this shark and suck his blood for drink at last that god who has a desire to the work of his own hands gives them hopes to release them out of this insupportable misery by letting them come to a discovery of land in the west indies but alas they were so weak that when they came ashore one or two of them dyed but most of them lived to declare the works of the lord this the author had from one of the    that were thus miraculously preserved but since cast away at sea    captain jonas clark of new england going to virginia the vessel was cast away in a strange amazing manner about two hours before day among the indians where the shipwrackt men lay shore in great fear but three days after hey thought to get their ship off again o which end the master with some others went into the boat they came  0 fathom from the shore where there aose a great sea and broke in upon them ut the second sea came and turned the boat up four men under water all were rowned but capt clark who was kept under water by one of the men till his reath was near gone but then god apeard and set him at liberty from him in most miraculous way and enabled him  swim to the shore they that were ave now were in great straits and perlexities not knowing what to do but et some of their eyes were up to god t last they unanimously resolve to trael and when they had traveled one night and part of a day meeting with many swamps and thick places so that all hope failed them of going along so they stood still as wayfaring men astonished not knowing what course to take and though before they were afraid of any indians now they were glad to pray to the lord for the sight of an indian which in this extremity and perplexity within half an hour the lord was pleased to grant the indian was all alone which was observable also when they got to him they asked the way to the english and they did persuade him by entreaty to go along with them but within one hours time he carried them to a town of the indians which did sadly fright and amaze them but they still looked up to the lord to help and save them and at last they got to the english and so were preserved this relation the author had from captain clarks own hand a person of known godliness and integrity    the last providence called to mind a strange and stupendous passage of a godly gentlewoman who in the first breaking forth of the rebellion in ireland was forced to fly for her life with some other persons in her company especially three children one of them upon her breast but alas these poor trembling travelers had not gone long before they were stripped naked by the irish who to admiration spared their lives but passing on to the foot of a river others metem and would have cast em into the river but this godly woman not being dismayed asked a little liberty to pray and as she lay on frozen ground naked she got a little resolution not to go on her own feet to so unjust a death upon which having called her upon her resolution they dragged her by the heels along the ground with the rest of the company she turns upon them and on her knees says you should i am sure be christians and men i see you are in taking away our miserable lives you do us a pleasure but know as we never wronged you nor yours you must die also your selves and one day give an account of this cruelty to the judge of heaven and earth suddenly upon which an irish priest says let us not take their lives but we will put them in this island of the lake a boat being at the river all the eight naked and without meat are turned into that island where after four days staying some of the company died with hunger and cold but not this woman nor any of her children a day after the two boys found the hyde of a beast which had been killed at the root of a tree which they and the mother endeavored to cast ove them then lying upon the snow the next day a little boat goes by to whom she calls for gods sake to take her out but they refused being irish she desired a little bread but they had none she beg a coal of fire which she obtained for they had some fuel in the boat an thus with some fallen chips made a fire and the boys taking a piece of the hide laid it upon the coals and began to gnaw the leather but alas without an extraordinary divine support wha could this do thus they lived ten day without any visible supplies and tha good woman professed it was by faith and joy in god she lived nor had she any bread but ice and snow nor any drink but water but she thought god put more substance in it and found it as it were clammy the next day a boa carried her out to the side of the bandwater where yet she had been lost bu that she could not suffer to see her children die in her sight and therefore tho the two boys were young and so starved that they had no strength she pressed them to go out of her sight under pretense of seeking some fire the poo children had not gone far until they saw   or   great dogs eating a man who had been killed the children were not afraid of the dogs who needed not fear any thing but to live in such a condition and one of them came running and leaped upon one of the children without doing him the least hurt and would run a little before and then tarry until the children came up and so led them on to an house whence smoke appeared which was an irish mans protected by the english in antrum by which means they were marvellously preserved and the mother sent for and succored by a party from antrum although this providence be not a seadeliverance yet it is a remarkable preservation from danger by water and hunger by land    in the first settling of the bahama islands off of the cape of florida about the year      there were at that present great troubles in the burmudas one captain sale who had been governor the year before comes for london and here informing some of his acquaintance and persons of worth and estate how things then stood they undertake for him and got him a ship and all things necessary for the discovery of these islands which he had informed them of so they proceeded to burmudas where they took in several passengers capt sale being chief and capt lane and his family who came from london with him as his assistant in the management of the design so they in pursuit of the voyage came to an island called cicatra he lay down in the platts where they could not at present find an harbor so they sent out their shallop upon a discovery which upon return informed them of a better place to ride in  but sending out the shallop again upon a discovery before she returned there arose a dreadful storm that carried her immediately upon the rocks and stavd her with very much difficulty most of the people were saved and some provisions then were they reduced to very great straits formidable to flesh and blood a barren island no inhabitants no likelihood of relief little provisions left in this great strait most of them resolved to travel up to the western end of the island and there to abide capt lane and his family and son who was lieutenant resolved to seek for some kind of provisions and so staid on the island but captain sale and one mr bounly who had been master of the ship and some other seamen and one mr shadwel in all eight resolved to go to virginia and took what provisions they could get which was one shark but before they made to the land they were in very great want for from this island from whence they departed to virginia was  00 leagues in their now great extremity providence cared for them so that they got another shark and were glad to eat him raw they were    days going to virginia and the boat a very little one that they could scarcely steer in her for fear of danger yet the lord in this deep destress made his arm bare for their salvation and brought them safe to a place called nusemum to one mr rich brunkets house where they were courteously entertained and after the relation upon what account they were put to these hardships and necessities capt sale had a vessel provided laden with necessaries to go for cicatra to relieve those they had left there in such distress and they arrived there and o now what comfort must this be after such long wishing and gradual dying to see that there was no hopes of life brought to them but several of them were starved to death before their arrival capt lane is now sent to fetch some provisions who had been in unspeakable extremity he came down in a little boat his son also the lieutenant and two servants but when they had gotten in their provision and going home in hopes of a new life behold the stupendous providence of god all of a sudden death creeps in and arrests them for in a narrow place where the tide runs swiftly the boat is sunk all are drowned but one man who carried the desolate widow the sad tidings what an unwelcome messenger this was you may may easily conjecture about   months after arrived a vessel to them the master of her my author and so mrs lane her son and daughter maidservant and manservant were all brought up about  0 miles where they were entertained by my author for   weeks and gave an account of some notable passages of gods providence in preserving them worthy never to be forgotten her husband and the men went out to see what they could get for food every day and they had for the most part just for the day and she told my author that she as a tenderhearted mother would lay something by for her young children but she observed that the next day they never got any thing  and thus providence trained them up in the school of faith but further she gave an account of one remarkable thing in the last day of the week upon a time it proved a very stormy day and they being abroad a hunting for some support could get nothing the husband and son come home very much troubled and the men that were gone into the woods they could get nothing and they being very much troubled one took up a resolution not to come home knowing there captain would not suffer them to go and hunt on the lords day on the other hand they thought he would wonder what was become of them and fear lest evil had befallen them so they alter their resolution to come home but empty of relief this very evening before the sabbath in this perplexity of thoughts there fly over their heads three gray geese a wonder it was for such geese were never before seen there nor after o says she to her husband that we had some of them against to morrow observing they lighted in a bottom she acquaints her husband he says they have no shot left o says she here is a porrenger melt it or cut it into pieces which he did for expedition and charged his piece and at the first shot killed them all  these things and many more my author had from her own mouth after her mavelous preservation o that men would praise the lord for his wonderful works to the children of men    we have a very wonderful deliverance recorded an honest poor man in maulden in essex one gregory crow who with his man and boy was in his boat going to fetch fullersearth but by the way meeting a storm his boot was driven upon a bank of sand and there sunk the men were glad to hang upon the mast but poor crow seeing his new testament in the water which he prized highly caught it up and took it into his bosom the tide being gone they were left upon the sand at least ten miles from land now in this great distress they made their prayers to the lord that he would send some means of deliverance for now within half an hour it would be flood but in this little time before flood they found a chest wherein was five pounds six shillings eight pence but honest crow cast it into the sea again saying if the lord will be pleased to save our lives he will provide us a little food and so they went again up to the mast where they to admiration hung by the arms and legs for ten hours together only the boy was so weary and beaten with the waves that he fell off and was drowned now their fears increased upon them and they knew not what to do but crow advises his man to cut down the mast and when the flood comes again to sit upon it and so says he it may please god to drive us to some ship this counsel was taken they commit themselves to god upon the mast and thus continued tuesday night wednesday and wednesday night in which time the man was so tired out with hunger watching and cold that he dyed now was crow left alone in this sad and deplorable condition he prayed now the more earnestly for some succor and relief but durst not sleep lest the sea should beat him off the mast and when this distressed miserable object was almost spent his flesh sodden with sea water and his eyes almost closed up with salt now in his extremity the lord makes it his opportunity and steps in by his providence presents a ship going for antwerp observe here the finger of god the wind not being favorable she was driven out of the way and espied something a far off in the sea but supposing it to be some fisherboy steered from it crow seeing this held up his cap and shaked it over his head whereby at length they were moved to go to him and so they took him in when he came into the ship being half dead careful of his new testament he plucked it out of his bosom and gave it to some to dry they in the ship were careful of him and with great difficulty recovered him and carried him with them to antwerp where the fame of his being miraculously delivered drew many to see him and relieve him with necessaries foxs book of martyrs    a ship of holland being driven against her will came to a place called zembla where the pole is elevated    degrees they among many delays and great dangers scarce reached the aurange islands for now they were set fast in a consolidated body of continued ice which threatened them every moment at last being reduced to their ultimate hope they resolve to return the same way they came but now they find the ship quite frozen up not far from shore and now they think they should winter in zembla and wait for a better season wherefore taking out boards and planks they built for themselves and their stuff a poor shelter and by a good providence the tide bad thrown up a good quantity of timber they not knowing from whence it came it proved a great advantage to them during their abode here they had continual fights with bears which sometimes were driven away with making great outcrys other whiles with shot they found their flesh unwholesome for food for in this place the maritime wild beasts are the food to the wild beast of the land the fat of the bears they made use of to burn for lights in the night these poor creatures were at last after all other humane benefits left by the sun in this barren country and left amongst none but wild beasts the vast mountains of snow with great difficulty they remove lest the habitation should be overwhelmed and if at any time they went forth their jaws were so benumbed they could scarce recover their former heat now the bears in the dark being dull of sight did not venture out to disturb them but multitudes of foxes which they took in traps and made of them both victuals and raiment and yet after all these dangers and difficulties god preserved them though indeed some of them dyed they were    of them the chief of them was one jacob hamskerk who returned afterward to amsterdam grotius in his annals   0 in the year      a flemming named pickman well known in england and holland for the art he had for getting out of the sea the great guns of that spanish fleet that was forced upon the coast of ireland and scotland in the year      coming from dronthem in norway laden with boards was overtaken by a calm during which the current of the sea carried him on a rock or a little island toward the extremity of scotland where he was in some danger of being cast away to avoid a wrack he commanded some of his men to go into the shallop and to tow off the ship these having done so would needs go upon a certain rock to seek for eggs but as soon as they were got up into it they espied a man whence they imagine there were others lay there about and that he had made an escape thither to avoid some pirates which might surprise their ship so that they made all the haste they could to the shallop and returned to the ship but the calm continuing and the current of the sea driving the vessel against the island they were forced to get into the longboat and tow her off again the man they saw before was in the mean time come to the brink of the island and made signs to them with his hands entreating them to come nearer and falling on his knees and joining his hands together he begged relief from them at last coming near the island they saw something more like a ghost than a living person a body stark naked black hairy of a meager and deformed countenance hollow and distorted eyes which raised such compassion in them that they proferd to take him into their boat at last with some difficulty they took him in they found upon the island no grass nor trees nothing for food nor any shelter but the ruins of a boat wherewith he had made him an hut under which he might be covered from rain and injuries of the weather when they came to ask him who he was and how he came into that uninhabited place he replied to them he was an english man and that a year before he was to go from england to dublin in ireland in the passageboat and that they were taken by a frenchpyrate who by a storm that immediately arose was forced to let go the passageboat left us to the mercy of the waves which carried us between ireland and scotland into the main sea expecting to be cast away every minute as at last we were for the bark being split against the rock where you took me in i escaped with one of my comrades into the island in a more wretched condition than if swallowed up by the sea who then had been delivered out of the extremities we were in for want of meat and drink of some of the boards of our boat we made the hutt you saw and we took some seamews which we set a drying in the wind and sun and so eat them raw we found also in the crevices of the rock by the sea side some eggs thus were we kept from starving but what we thought most insupportable was thirst for there was no water but what fell from heaven we lived thus six weeks comforting one another and finding some ease in our common misfortune till that being left alone it began to grow insupportable to me for one day awaking in the morning and missing my comrade i fell into such a despair that i had some thought of casting my self head long and so put a final period to that affliction whereof i had but endured the one half while i had a friend suffering with me i know not what became of him but i am of opinion that he fell into the sea seeking for eggs i left with him my knife with which we killed the seadogs and the mews upon which we lived so i was forced to get out of my hutt a great nail which i made a shift to sharpen upon the rock that it served me for a knife i was also forced to lade a little stick with a little seadog fat and put it out of a crevice of my hutt and so got some mews to keep me from starving i lived in this condition and solitude eleven months and was resolved to end my days in it when god sent you to deliver me out of the greatest misery that ever man was in and this seaman after this misery and miraculous preservation lived to return to england ambassadors travels  a remarkable providence of god in wonderfully preserving of eleven or thirteen poor distressed mens lives    in the year    a ketch sailed from salom in new england for the barbados and when they came into the latitude of    it began to look like foul weather so they took in their topsail and because it was toward night they struck down the main sail and rased it and all this time there was but little wind which was remarkable if the ensuing story be observed but still it looked like bad weather so they sent up one to tallow the mast and made no great haste to set sail the man at the top thinks he sees some black thing float upon the sea and looking upon it very fixtly he conceives it to be a boat and so calls to the men below so they hastened to hoise sail and make toward it and when they came to them there was a longboat with    or    men my author could not absolutely remember the just number which poor distressed creatures had been bound for virginia and the ship in which they were proved very leaky and so exceedingly increased that in a very little time she was ready to sink so all hands hastened to get out the boat but the master stepped into the cabin to fetch a compass and took some canvas a sailneedle and twine which he thought might be useful to them in their need and extremity but while this poor industrious man was endeavoring to be useful to some other mens lives he was in danger to lose his own for the boat was put off and the ship was sinking so he cries to them in this distress if they would leave him and there let him perish so they came back and took him in they had in their boat a capsternbar which they made use of for a mast and a piece of canvas for a sail and so sailed before the wind and had no kind of food and now comes dreadful and inexpressible distress upon them making them wish for death it self to give them a deliverance now all hopes of relief failed them thus they continued five days some grew lame others feeble and all much disheartened by despair of life and now upon the  th day they had concluded to cast lots for their lives who should die to preserve others and they put their resolution into execution and that poor creature upon whom the lot fell begs for time but alas what will a reprieve be in this case where there is no hope of relief but o what difficult work is it to die what a strait was here live he could not and die he could not well a little time is deferred and behold a wonderworking god appears now for him and for them all before night they espied this ketch which raised them all to admiration but they had fears in this distress that the ketch did not see them but when they perceived the ketch made to them o what a new life did it put into these dying men so they all got safe aboard and see here the goodness of god in one hour after there arose a most dreadful storm which continued for forty hours and all of them safely arrived at barbados  the masters name of the ketch was thomas woodberry of salom this the author had from a very known person of integrity and godliness now living at salom     in the year   0  in the wars betwixt the netherlands and the spaniards upon the spanish ocean fell out this observable and remarkable action taken notice of by grotius in his annnals of the low country wars admiral hauteen being sent to intercept the spanish fleet coming from america and the indies he had with him four and twenty vessels but of these six were beaten back by tempests soon after frasciardo with eight great gallions having a prosperous gale fell upon them unprovided and ere they were aware but the galleys that were with him not being driven by the wind kept by the shore but one of them being grappld with a ship of zealand that was next the admiral so affrighted the rest that as soon as they saw it they in the very beginning of the night retreated with all haste hauteen thus left by his companions being a man of an undaunted spirit for two whole days did not leave off the fight though most of his men were in that time lost but with his torn ship casting off all fear of danger protracted the victory but after he saw no hopes of relief and that the waves poured in upon him that none of them might come alive into the enemies hands at once they unanimously agreed upon a resolute and terrible action for kneeling down upon their knees they like dying but desperate men beg of god that he would please to pardon them in that they sought to shun the mockeries and cruelties of the spaniards by that sad and lamentable death so they set fire to the gunpowder by which blow  0 men were killed   half dead lived a little while being taken up by the spaniards with wonder beholding their dreadful countenances and their words with their strange resolution and obstinacy in death     in the year   0  about the time when the plantations of virginia began to be a little settled by king james some britains went to guyana but a dangerous sedition arose in the voyage and the ship being lost part of the company remained in the island where continually vexing the barbarians with their unkind usage they at last were set upon by war as enemies by force of which and the want of victuals they committed themselves to sea in a boat made only of an hollow tree there these poor distressed creatures were tossed with continual tempests betwixt despair and hope of life but at last they were driven upon the rocks after great misery endured by them in their little boat for ten days together and now their danger was lessened for here they must fall into the hands of the spaniard who pardoned them in regard they came not to those parts of their own accord but by the stress of weather thus were these poor distressed men saved and preserved when all hope of being saved was taken away     the phaenix frigot in the time when captain whestone commanded her and mr may was master being commanded to carry some persons of quality from rye to diep in france the captain and several of the gentlemen that belonged to the frigot were ashore the captain sends the longboat aboard and ordered the frigot to weigh and come to sail and stand to and fro off in the bay and he would come out in his pinnace the gentlemen that were with him were sunebank giles his surgeon mr goodwin his chaplain mr perkins his barber and gentleman mr richards and some three more gentlemen reformadoes abraham car coxswain and about    seamen for his crew that set out of rye and crossed the bay to meet the frigot under sail and when they came near being a good way ahead waved to the frigot to keep her way and not to come  playse for her which she did with a resh top sail gale of wind till she came p with the pinnace and then the coxn would laid her aboard of the larord side but the captain supposing himself far enough ahead commanded im to sh ahead of her and lay her board of the starboardside which he assuming to do the ship giving a saw and having fresh way the pinnace was not past but the cotwater of the ship cut he pinnace in the middle and run right over that she lay in a moment of time n a hundred pieces and all the men floating for their lives in the interim of which time with a cry they gave a eap in which leap the captain caught old on the rails of the head mr rihardss on the captains heels mr giles he surgeon on richardss heels mr goodwin on giless heels and some other person on his so that with that spring r leap no less than   or   providentially caught about one the others heels or middle as boys when playing at truss and in hoisting in the captain they preerved   or   more with him the coxen sunk down and brought some of the tallow of the lower part of the ship on his clothes and came up again a the stern where he was taken up by the seamen some by swimming others by assistance of the oar and pieces of the boat by gods blessing kept them from drowning till the longboat took them all up except the captains barber mr perkins whom it seems had sunk it is thought his last time but providence so ordered it that the man in the main channel heaving the handlead there fell a chrockle in the dipseyline and in that very interim the lead fell in the very place where the barber was sunk and the chinckle of the line fell about the barbers fingers hitcht about his ring and so providentially fastened it self so that as the man in the scenes haling up his lead found it to come heavier than it used to do admiring at last up come the barber fastened in the chinckle by his ring which the spectators amazed at immediately took hold of him and pulled him into the frigot with his eyes fixed and teeth set and little appearance of life but by the blessing of god the immediate means used and care of him he soon came to himself and recovered so that notwithstanding this shrewd disaster which might have proved fatal to ll or most of them yet there was not one man of them all miscarried but was ecoverd to their health again as mouments of gods mercy for truth of his many of the men are alive at this day the surgeon now living in graysinnlane and at the very interim f time i was then aboard the said frigot and was not only an eyespectator but n instrument to help in preserving of ome of them and therefore may aver  to be truth  ezekiel fog     about  0 years ago in the island f barbados there did arrive one mr john blackleach from new england a ery honest man who gave account at in his then voyage his son being master of the vessel and himself merhant their men at sea did mutiny at which occasion he and his son were rcd to stand on their guard for some me casting his care on the lord but hilst under this trouble being in the ong reach in or near the latitude of arbadoes they all did see a great ship which stood toward them and while ey were looking on her to see how st she came toward them she being etty near vanished away which struck e men with great fear and made them humble themselves to the good old man and desired his prayers for them     in the month of november      the ship prosperous of bristol sailed from thence being bound for galloway in ireland but was forced into brutsbay in cornwall where the ship brake in pieces six persons being drowned and other wonderfully cast on shore and bruised amongst the rest john denny a skinne of bristol was cast ashore by a great sea being much bruised and almost dead and was by some stripped naked and laid amongst the other dead folks that were taken up being only covered with some straw or rubbish but by providence an old man looking on the dead people did perceive some life in the said denny and the lord opened his heart that he stripped himself of his own shirt and some clothes and put on him and tock him from among the dead through his labor and love by gods blessing the said denny is now well and lives at bristol this my author had from john dennys own mouth     in the year      i being at beston in new england i often went to see an acquaintance of mine one abraham darby a sober honest man a master of a vessel who relates the following story which he attests to be truth that some few years ago he the said darby being master of a small ketch was ound from barbados to virginia he having an irish woman a servant on board to be delivered in virginia but he was a vile person and having often offended at last was punished for which he said they should not carry her to virginia though the wind was very fair and carried them in sounding of the capes of virginia that they had bent one cable to the anchor thinking soon to got in ut she still said they should not then he wind sprang up of a sudden in a mere fret which ford them many days off and their provisions near spent it being if i mistake not in  then he wind came fair again a from gal and they before it in hopes to gain their passage but on a sudden there  a great sea that cas the vessel on  she having but little besides b  er that her goods and things  but it pleased god they  he helm a weather and she woe and ll hands as could in the hold brought er to rights and the wind continued air till they came near the place that it ook them short before and then took them as before that they were forced off again for many days having then but   or   pieces of beef and no bread nor i think a gallon of fresh water but after some time the wind came fair they making sail to get back it being fine weather there came a great sea and laid her down again and carried her mast away and a part of the partners that hold the mast that as she lay on one side the sea rushed into her but the master with his bed and rug stopped the force till it pleased god they had shifted the things in the hold and brought her to rights again now these poor souls were left as a wrack in the ocean and neither victuals nor drink but strong water and sugar to help them but finding a spar or oars in the hold made shift to get out a small sail i had like to have omitted that whilst they had any food they would have given this wicked woman a part but she would not eat any thing then it pleased god to send a fine gale and they got on the coast of new england and sounding found about forty fathom water and very calm then they chopped to an anchor there and that night got two or three fish wherewith they refreshed themselves but the woman would not eat but could get no more and finding a fine gale weighed anchor and thought to have got within capegod not being far off but the wind came fresh against them and drove them off again to sea and then twas calm and about that time the woman had fasted about    days and yet could curse and damn and say she should not go a shore but that night the master and some others being on the deck spied a great black thing rise out of the sea to their thinking much bigger than the ketch the sea being light all about and the woman in the hold made a great noise and when she had given a great screach or groan this great black thing vanished the water seeming like fire all round and made a great sea and noise and when the men came to themselves they looking for the woman found her dead but after they had flung her overboard they had a brave wind and weather and got safe to plimonth in new england     at new england in the year      i spoke with john grafting of salem and others of good repute who told me not long before the said grafting suffered shipwreck amongst the leward islands the name of the place i forget the ship or ketch being broken to pieces himself and mate and one or two were cast with the sea ashore amongst the rocks most wonderfully not knowing of each other till by providence they met amongst the rocks it being an island without inhabitants if i mistake not and they bruised yet the lord provided for them in a wonderful manner and not only there but in their getting off that place and bringing them safe to their friends and relations in salem in new england where praises were returned to the lord who wonderfully preserves the children of men i hope this ere long will be enlarged from the party himself    i being well acquainted with one jeffery howard a mariner who is a man of good repute he told me as follows that about    or    years since he was coming through the city of salisbury he was looking on the street rivers and spies something move on the water but looking earnestly saw it to have lise steps in and got it out and found it to be a manchild only inrapt as it came into the world from its mother and it was put to nurse and now is become a fine youth   0 at bristol a place well known not many years ago a man fell into the river near about the marsh and not being seen was carried down with the tide some way and i think could not swim but lay as dead on the water driving with the tide but by providence some being in the meadow going to work or coming from the lymekilns being by the waterside playing with a spaniel saw something floating flung in things to make the dog fetch it and the dog accordingly took hold of the man by the clothes and brought him a shore and finding some symptoms of life took care of him and he came to life and dwells in new bristol this i had from the spectators     in the year      one mr savage master of the societyketch bound from bristol to boston in new england met on the coast of n e the ship called the george of bristol being in distress spoke with them the ship having sprang a leak their men tired and spent with pumping the master and all his company went on board the ketch with speed and soon after the ship sunk this i had from mr savage and other passengers with him who affirmed it to be truth  david fogg     capt john trankmore commander of a ship belonging to apsom near exeter in one of his voyages of late years being at sea in a dark night and foul weather fell soul of another ship unexpectedly not then knowing what each other were but a sea parting them again in the interim cap trankmores ship shipped a great sea which washed the said trankmore overboard and another sea cast or hove him into the other ship which fell out to be an englishman bound for plymouth thus in the dark the wind and sea parts the said ship without having knowledge of each other capt trankmore concluding that his own ship was foundred and all his lost and god had wrought a wonder of mercy in his preservation but so it fell out that one samuel snytal who was his apprentice had obtained such knowledge of the art of navigation and his master being gone and as they supposed drowned being washed overboard was necessitated to improve his skill and by gods blessing he carried the ship safe home to apsom where arriving although they had made a good voyage yet the sorrow for the loss of the master eat up all the comforts and smiles a prosperous voyage otherwise would have made but so providence ordered it that about   or   days after the other ship arrives safe in plymouth where the said trankmore landed very sorrowful and dejected having as he supposed lost his ship wherein he was deeply concerned as an adventurer himself and all his men as he was in the morning walking on the hope at plymouth very dejectedly he providentially meets with one of his executors or apsom neighbors who looks him in the face with astonishment knowing him well and yet believing the report of his being dead or lost in amaze salutes him with these expressions what capt trankmore who replies a poor captain having lost my ship richly laden and after a good voyage with all my men not a soul saved but my self whom by a miracle god wrought salvation for as before recited giving the gentleman his neighbor an account of his providence toward him when after a little pause his friend embraces him and with admiring of the providence bids him be of good heart for his ship and all his company was well and safe arrived at apsom for his man samuel snytal had brought her safe home and all the sorrow and cry there was for the loss of him which reply made the said trankmore in as much amaze on the other hand being almost incredulous of truth till his friend positively affirming it and then consulting his own mercy saw and was made sensible there was no mercy too great for god to work and thence took heart recovering himself went home rejoicing where he found his expectation answered and a welcome given him by all persons with him concerned  for the truth i have heard it acknowledged by capt trankmores own mouth at my house in bristol and farther the same snytal was my predecessors son and i have heard his motherinlaw speak of it to several and has affirmed it to me for a truth     the bristol frigot when capt fenn was commander being in the straits in chase of capt popoctiene a spanish knight of malta who at that time our squadron took and brought prisoner to the tower in pursuit of which chase the wind began to rise the capt commands presently to get topgallant sails abroad and the yards being not then aloft   men run up presently where one stood on the top of the shroud under the maintopmastcrosstrees a second stood a top of the crosstrees and the other stood by the topgallantmast on the cape at the maintopmasthead all expediting their work in getting the topgallantsail abroad at which time the wind freshend and carried our maintopmast by the board in which disaster the man that was lowermost and least in danger fell over board and was drowned and the other two which were in greatest danger one of their names was roger dennis under the denomination of a quaker instead of bein bruised and their bones broken all to pieces which the eye of reason could not otherwise imagine by such a fall they both fell forward upon the bunt of the main course and one catches hold of the main buntlines and the other of the leechlines and slack of a bowling and so both come down to the deck and neither of them in the least prejudiced  for the truth of this my author was then aboard the said frigot and was an eyewitness of this providence     an account of two ships bound for new foundland from some part in the west of england who by distress of weather lost company some days after being fair weather one of the ships sprang a leak and foundred in the sea where every soul perished except one old man who had lasht himself on the main hatch and committed himself to the mercy of the sea and gods providence where he was floating three days and three nights in which time about the middle of the second day the devil assuming the shape of a marmaid starts up before him and bids him he of good heart for if he would but make a contract with him he would engage a deliverance for him in    hours the old man being sensible it was the devil and doubtless having been a proving of his heart to god as the circumstance of providence he was under more immediately called for found in himself a renewed strength put into him enabling him to hold up his head and looking the tempter in the face replies ah satan if thou can prophesy deliverance for me know my god in whom i trust will deliver me without thy help but however know i will dot comply to thy wiles therefore avoid satan avoid so immediately he vanished and appeared no more to him but so it fell out the other ship being at that time in the same place or latitude that night the cabbinboy dreams a dream that such a ship thereabouts was foundred and every soul lost except such an old man naming his name who was saved on a piece of the ship and floating in the sea which dream the boy in the morning confidently tells to the company and his master at last the boy began to show more confidence affirming it as if it must be true insomuch he received some checks from his master but however at last the boy grew so restless that he running up from one mast to another sometimes at foretopmasthead looking abroad that at last crying out aloud allow there i see him i see him under our leebow thus confidently affirming it some of the men stepped up and spied something at a distance no beggar than a crow to appearance floating and advised the master of it who presently commanded the helm to be born up and stood away to it and when they came near found it to be the old man as the the boy said so they hoyst out their boat and took him in who then was speechless and almost spent but by the care of the master and the surgeon with gods blessing recovered and gave a verbal account of his misfortune and yet wonderful deliverance together with satans temptation as before recited which ship in due time arrived safe at her port in new foundland where this man was well landed a shore  for confirmation i had this and heard it related at my fathers house in salom in new england by mr john blackledge a merchant who is a person of a sober life and in fellowship there who then came from new foundland and did affirm that he spoke with the man himself whom god wrought this wonderful deliverance for he being then at new foundland when the said ship arrived there and the man went first ashore     anno christi    0 may   the moscovy merchants of london sent a ship called the salutation of london for greenland which arrived there in safety june    following together with two other ships all which were commanded by captain will goodler the ship wherein the capt was stayed at bellsound this of the salutation at the foreland and the capt meeting with store of whales quickly made a great voyage and so sent for the salutation to take in part of his trainoyl by the way as they went to him meeting with crosswinds the master set eight of his men on shore to kill some venison in a place where there used to be good store these men taking with them a brace of dogs a snaphance two lances and a tniderbox went on shore and that day they laid fourteen good deer on the ground and then being weary and the night coming on they betook themselves to rest intending the next day to make an end of their hunting and so to return to their ship but the next day proved foggy and there was much ice between the shore and the ship and the wind coming southerly the ship was fain to stand so far off into the sea to be clear of the ice that they lost the sight of her and the weather growing thicker and thicker they thought fit to hunt along the shore to greenhurbour and there to stay aboard the ship till their own ship should come into the port  in this passage they killed eight deer more and so having laden their shallop with venison they kept on their course to green harbor but when they came thither they found to their great astonishment that the ship was departed being thus frustrated of their expection and having but three days to the uttermost expiration of their limited time for their departure out of that country they thought it their best course to make all speed possible to bellsound to their captain and lest delay should prove dangerous they lightened their shallop by heaving their venison over board into into the sea and so they hasted all they might and that night got halfway but the dark fog increasing they were forced to cove in a point of the land till the next day at noon at which time the weather being clearer they hasted forward but having no compass to direct their course by they wandered up and down so long till the ships were departed this filled them with fear and astonishment knowing that neither christian nor heathen had ever inhabited those desolate climates yea they had heard that the merchants had endeavored with proffers of great rewards and of sufficient furniture and provision of all things necessary to hire some to undertake to winter in those parts but could never meet with any that would adventure their lives in so hazardous an undertaking they had heard also that the company of moscovy merchants had once procured the reprieve of some malefactors condemned to death here in england unto whom they promised pardon together with rewards and provision of clothes victuals and all other necessaries if they would stay one winter there but when they came thither and took a view of the desolateness of the place they conceived such horror and fear in their hearts that they chose rather to return for england and there to satisfy the law with the loss of their lives than to stay in so desolate and darksome a country they remembered also a more terrible example of nine good and able men left there formerly by the same master that had now left them who all died miserably upon the place and whose bodies were fearfully disfigured by the savage bears and hungry foxes which are the only inhabitants of that comfortless country all which made them like amazed men to stand one looking upon another every one foreseeing the future calamities both of himself and of his fellows and that which much increased their horror was their want of all necessary provision for the life of man having neither clothes to keep them warm and for shift nor food to prevent the miseries of cruel famine nor a house to shroud themselves from the extremity of cold  but after a space knowing that delay in extremity is the mother of all danger they began to conceive hope out of the depth of despair and therefore they consulted together of the likeliest course for their preservation in that place and resolved upon the opportunity of the next fair weather to go to greenharbour to kill some venison for part of their winter provision which accordingly they did but found not so many dear as they expected yet the first day they killed seven and four bears to boot which they also intended to eat the next day they killed six deer more and as they returned they killed six more and then the weather proving foul and cold they laded their shallop with the deer and bears and finding another shallop left there as usually they do from year to year they laded it with greaves of whales that had been boiled there that year and so dividing themselves into those   hallops they took the first opportunity of returning to bellsound to their tent where they intended to take up the rest for the winter  but in their passage the night coming on and the wind blowing hard were forced to stay in the mid way at bottel cove for that night there they fastened their shallops one to another and casting out their anchor they left them riding in the cove  but here again for the trial of their patience and to teach them to rely more upon upon gods providence than than upon any outward means of their own this mischance befell them the wind blowing hard into the cove and their anchor coming home their shallop sunk into the sea and so wet all their provision and some of it they found swimming up and down by the shore the sight thereof wonderfully troubled them to see the best part of their provision the only hope of their lives under god in danger either utterly to be lost or to be spoiled by the seawater for which they had taken such pains and run so many adventures in the getting of it and in this their misery they saw but one remedy and that was a desperate one viz to turn into the highwrote sea to their shallops to save the remainder of their provisions now ready to be washed away by the billows this they did and by main force drew the shallops to the shore then they went along by the seaside to gather up such of their provisions as were swimming up and down and when the weather proved fair they went on to bellsound where being arrived they took out their provivision and viewed the great tent which was built of timber and boards and covered with flemish tiles the use of it was for the coopers to work and lodge in whilst they made casks for the putting up of the trainoyl and they resolved to build another smaller tent within that for their habitations and accordingly taking down a lesser tent that stood near to it wherein the landmen lay whilst they made their oil they fetched their materials from thence both boards posts and rafters and from the chimnies of the furnaces they took a thousand bricks they found also four hogsheads of lime which mingled with sand from the shore made good mortar but the weather was grown so extreme cold that they were fain to make   fires on both sides to keep their mortar from freezing then they raised a wall of one brick thickness against the inner planks of the side of the tent but by that time they had walled   sides of their house their bricks failed so that they were forced to build the other   sides of boards which being nailed on both sides the posts they were hollow between which they filled up with sand that made it so tite that the least breath of air could not possibly annoy them the length of this tent was  0 foot and the breadth    their chimney was the breadth of a dealboard and   foot high they cield it with boards of   or   times double that no wind could possibly get through the door they made as close as they could and lined it with a bed that they found there which came over both the opening and shutting of it they made no windows having no light but what came through the chimney then set they up   cabins quartering themselves two and two in a cabin their beds were the deerskins dried which was a warm and comfortable lodging for them in their distress their next care was for firing and finding   old shallops which were unserviceable they brake them up and stowed them over the beams of the great tent to make it the warmer and to keep the snow from driving through the tiles into the tent and by this time the cold increasing and scarce having any day at all they stavd some empty cask and brake two old coolers wherein they cool their oil providing whatsoever firing they could without prejudice to the next years voyage yet considering the small quantity of fuel the extremity of cold and the long time of their abode they husbanded it as thriftily as possibly they could  having thus fitted every thing in the best manner they could on the    of sept looking out into the sound they espied   seahorses lying a sleep on a piece of ice whereupon taking up an old harpingiron they hastened to them and first slew the old one and the the young and so bringing them ashore they flayed them roasted and eat them not long after they killed another but the nights and cold weather increasing on them and they viewing their provision found it too small by half whereupon they stinted themselves to one reasonable meal a day and agreed to fast wednesdays and fridays excepting from the greaves and fritters of the whale which was a very loathsome meat of which they allowed themselves sufficient for their present hunger at which diet they continued for about   months  having finished whatever they could invent for their preservation they found that all their clothes and shoes were worn and torn to repair which they had this new device of ropeyarn they made thread and of whalebones needles to sow their clothes withal but october  0 the nights being grown very long and the cold so violent that all the sea was frozen over and they having now nothing to exercise their minds upon were troubled with a thousand imaginations sometimes they bewailed their absence from their wives and children thinking what grief it would be to them to hear of their miscarriage then they thought of their parents and what a cutting corrosive it would be to them to hear of their untimely deaths etc and being tormented in their minds with fear and grief and pinched in their bodies with hunger and cold the hideous monster of desperation presented his ugliest shape unto them but thinking it not best to give way to grief and fear they doubled their prayer to almighty god for strength and patience in their miseries by whose assistance they shook off their former thought and cheered up themselves to use the best means for their preservation  then for the preservation of their venison and lengthening of their fireing they thought best to roast every day half a deer and to stow it in hogsheads which accordingly they did leaving so much raw as would serve to roast every sabbath day a quarter etc and when this was over they began again to think of their ensuing misery that in case god should give them life yet they were to live as banished men from all company and as if their sorrows had been too little they presently found an increase of it for their whalefritters after they had been drenched in the seawater lying close together were grown moldy and spoiled and again surveying their bear and venison they found that it would not afford them five meals a week whereupon they were fain to cut off one meal more so that for three months after four days in the week they fed upon the unsavory moldy whalefritters and the other three they feasted with bear and venison but beside the want of meat they now began to want light so that all their meals were suppers for from october  0 to febr   the never saw the sun so much as peep above the horizon but the moon when not obscured with clouds they always saw shining as bright as i england all which darksome time they could not certainly tell when it should be day and when night  in the beginning of this darkness they sought some means to preserve light and finding a piece of sheetlead and some oil in the coopers tent and ropeyarn they made a lamp which they kept continually burning which was a great comfort to them in their extremity yet their wants and miseries were so many and great that sometimes they brake forth into impatient speeches against the causers of them but then their consciences again minded them after their own evil deserts and so they took it as a just hand of god for their former wicked lives or that god intended to make them examples of his mercy in their wonderful deliverance humbling themselves therefore under the mighty hand of god they prostrated themselves in prayer two or three times a day which course they constantly held all the time of their misery  in the beginning of january as the days began to lengthen the cold began to strengthen which proceeded to that extremity that it raised blisters on their flesh as if they had been burnt with fire and if at any time they touched iron it would stick to their fingers like birdlime if they went out of doors to fetch in a little water it would so pinch them that they were sore as if they had been beaten in the beginning of winter with pickaxes breaking the ice daily they got some water on the seashore but after january  0 they had none but snowwater which they melted with ot irons which was their only drink ill may  0 following  by the last of jan the days were   or   hours long and then viewing their victuals again they found that it would not last above six weeks longer which made them fear further famine but they had recourse to god who they knew could supply them beyond their hopes  looking out on a bright day they saw a great she bear with her cub coming toward their tent whereupon arming themselves with their lances the went forth and staid her coming she soon cast her greedy eye upon them and hoping to devour them hasted toward them but with their lances they gave her such an hearty welcome that she tumbled upon the ground biting the snow for anger the cub seeing this escaped by flight the weather was so extreme cold that they were fain presently to retire into the tent and having warmed themselves they drew in the dead bear wherewith they dined merrily and this bear served them  0 days only this mischance they had eating her liver it made their skins peel off when she was spent they yet feared that their venison would not hold out till the fleet came out of england but god sent many bears to their tent by times at least  0 whereof they killed   one of which was exceeding great at least   foot high so that their food increasing they kept not themselves to such short commons but often eat two or three meals a day which much increased their strength  by this the cheerful days lengthened so fast that several sort of fowl resorted thither march    one of their mastiffs went abroad which they never saw after upon the coming of the fowls the foxes which all winter had kept their burroughts under the rocks came abroad to seek for their livings whereupon they set up traps which they baited with the skins of these fowls by which means they caught at times  0 foxes all which they roasted and found to be good meat then taking the bearskins laying the fleshy side upwards and making springs of whalebone the caught about sixty fowls as big as pigeons  may   the weather began to be pretty warm so that they went daily abroad to seek for provision but nothing they could find for many days till at length they met with abundance of willocks eggs of which the carried home thirty intending the next day to fetch a  000 more but the day proved so cold that they could not stir out of their tent the same day there came two ships of hull into the sound who knowing that some men had been lest there the year before being very desirous to know whether they were deat or alive the master manned forth a shallop to go as near the shore as they could and so over the ice to the tent when these men came near the tent they haled them with the usual word of the sea crying hey to which one of them in the tent answered again hoe which sudden answer almost amazed them all but perceiving them to be the very men left there with joyful hearts they embraced one another and so coming into the tent they showed the hul men the courtesy of the house giving them some venison that was roasted   months before and a cup of cold water which for novelty sake they kindly accepted of them  after a little discourse these   men resolved to leave their tent and to go with them to their ship where they were welcomed after the heartiest and kindest english manner and so they staid with them till the london fleet came which was three days after at which time they went aboard the admiral in which capt will goodler was who made them very welcome and gave order that they should have any thing that was in the ship that might do them good he gave them apparel also to the value of  0 pounds so that after    days refreshment they grew all perfectly well but when some of them went to their own master that had left them there he fell foul upon them calling them runaways with other harsh terms far enough from the civility of an honest man thus they continued in the fleet until aug  0 at which time with joyful hearts they set sail through the foaming ocean and though sometimes crossed with contrary winds yet at last they came safely to an anchor in the river thames and the muscovy merchants dealt very well by them  the names of these men were will fakely gunner edw pelham gunnersmate that wrote this story joh wise and rob

which mountains are all the year long covered with ice and snow the plains in part are bare in summer but there grows neither tree nor herb in it except scurveygrass and sorrel the sea is as barren as the land affording no fish but whales seahorses seals and some few small fishes     in june      the peachtree of london a small vessel of the burden of about  0 tons edw dixon master came into the downs bound for guinny intending there to take in negroes and to transport them to the barbados and from thence to come for london where john watts the son of john watts of eltham in the county of kent surgeon shipped himself with the consent of rich watts public notary of dal little dreading that his nephew being then not above    years old should meet with such a calamitous accident the ship had not been long in the downs but a fair gale presenting they suddenly hoisted sail gods providence seeming to fill their sails with prosperous success the first place they touched at was the gold coast where they staid not long but sailed to old calabar in the bith of guinny they entered a river called the cross river into pirates island after they had taken in their negroes and ready to sail their anchor being a peek the master calls up the boatswain and   men more whereof the relater was one and commands them to look out the copper bars that were left and carry them on shore to try if they could sell them the boatswain with his small company desired that they might have arms with them not believing the report of some that informed them they were a harmless and innocent people they took with them three muskets and a pistol and so rowed toward the shore but not far from it unhappily our match fell into the water and the ship being fallen down from that narrow part of the river nearer the sea quite out of sight we were consulting what should be safest for us to do we were not willing to precipitate our own ruin and were also ashamed to return to our ship before we had dispatched what we were commanded to at length the boatswain commanded the relater john watts on shore to the first house to light our match which we recovered out of the water after it was extinct which he readily obeyed but before he was  0 rods from the waterside he was seized on by   black or rather tawnymoors and by them haled above half a mile up into the country and thrown with great violence upon his belly and so compelled to lie till they stripped him and more company coming to them they were so eager for his poor canvas apparel that some they tore off others they cut off and with that several pieces of his flesh to this intolerable pain with these rags they made little childrens aprons to cover their privities linen and woollen being scarce there the boatswain seeing this joh watts was thus carried away was resolved with his other two companions to have him again or else to venture all their lives for him they arm themselves but whilst they were consulting what to do whether to venture on shore or not of a sudden they were beset with about    men in several canoes but they valianly maintained their boat about the space of   hours for after   of their   muskets were discharged they defended themselves with their oars and boathooks the boatswain received a mortal wound in his groin and fell down in the boat the other two adventured in the river endeavoring by swimming to escape the merciless hands of cruel infidels but the negroes with their swift canoes soon overtook them and brought them on shore to the place where the relater was the negroes took the boatswain out of the ships boat and instead of endeavoring at all to preserve the life which remained in him immediately they robbed him of it one of them with a keen weapon cutting off his head before his companions faces and then they prepare for their rare banquet while he was yet reeking in his blood they in a barbarous manner cutting off pieces of flesh from off his buttocks and his thighs and his arms and shoulders and broiled them on the coals and with a great deal of impatience eagerly eat it before our faces to our great astonishment about    days after one of the company fell sick and instead of being physicians to cure him they were his butchers to murder him they served him as they did the boatswain cut off his head and broiled and eat up his flesh and rejoiced exceedingly at this rich banquet about  0 days after the third fell sick whom they served in the same manner  this was no small cause of sorrow to the relater the thoughts of their inhuman and barbarous actions sometimes surrounded him with fears and sorrows hourly expecting to taste of the said cruelty death did not seem so terrible to him as the violent manner of it being left now alone in a strange country destitute of friends or acquaintance or any thing that might keep up his spirits die he would fain but not by the hands of infidels and barbarous monsters but the great god that is most compassionate in the greatest extremities had pity on him and notwithastnding the alteration of the climate and the want of clothes and the strangeness of his food which was only herbs he continued in good health and had time enough to lament their direful providence the natives who were daily expecting another banquet met with a disappointment either their cuostms or the overruling power of god would not suffer them to destroy him he continuing still in health therefore they resolve to sell him his arannia or master was pretty free to discourse him which the relator was capable of being about   years before in the west indies where he had learned the tata language which is easily attained being comprehended in a very few words and all the negroes speak it he began to discourse his master to know the reason of their cruelty who told him that he should rest himself contented who if he were not sick should not have his head cut off in the boat which in the beginning they took with them was a musket saved of the   which was not discharged which his master some time after he had been with him brought to him to know the use of it he endeavored as much as he could to make him apprehend the use of it but still they professed their ignorance but they commanded and threatened him to show the use of it the fear of his masters displeasure and their inhumanity caused him to shoot it off but the negroes which expected some delightful thing were frustrated and at the sudden noise and flash of fire which they very much dread ran from him and were greatly affrighted but quickly after hearing no more of that noise they came up to him again and commanded him to do the like he told them he had not powder which was the cause of the noise but this would not satisfy these barbarians he not being able to answer their expectation they concluded he was not willing they proceed to threaten him and were about to murder him had not his master rescued him upon discourse after with this arannia or master he began to understand the reason of their barbarous dealing with him and his friends he telling him that naturally the people were civil and simply honest but if provoked full of revenge and that this cruelty was occasioned by some unhandsome action of carrying a native away without their leave about a year before they resolving if any came ashore they should never go off alive he had not been above   weeks in the country but his master presented him to his king whose name was e fnme king of the blackamoors who immediately gave him to his daughter whose name was onijah and when the king went abroad he attended him also as his page throughout the whole circuit of his dominions which was not above    miles yet boasting extremely of his power and strength but glorying exceedingly that he had a white to attend him whom he employed to carry his bow and arrows at several places remote from the seaside the people would run away from him for fear others would fall down and seem to worship him and and use those actions as they do to their gods their pregress was never so long but they could return home at night but never without a handsome load of a cup of the creature during all the time of the relaters servitude there he never knew him go abroad and come home sober they drink of the best palmwine and another sort of strong liquor called penrore the relater quickly knew how to humor this profound prince and if any of the natives abused him upon his complaint he had redress as once by striving with a negroe his arm was broke which by providence more than skill was set again after some months the king of caal nanch whose name was efn mancha hearing of this beautiful white courted his neighbor prince that he would sell him to him at length they struck a bargain and the relator was sold for a cow and a goat this king was a very sober and moderate person free from treacheries and mischiefs that the other was subject unto and he would often discourse the relater and ask him of his king and country and if his kingdoms and dominions were as big as his which were not above    miles in length and and    in breadth he told him as much as his understanding and years made him capable of keeping still in the bounds of modesty and yet relating as much as possible to the honor and dignity of his sovereign first informing him of the greatness of one of his kingdoms the several shires and counties it contained with the number of its cities towns and castles and the strength of each the infinite number of inhabitants and valor of his subjects one of these kingdoms was enough to amaze sufficiently this petty governor that he need not to mention any more of his majestys glory and dignity it put him in to such a profound consternation that he resolved to find out some way to tender his respects to this mighty prince and no way could he find so convenient as to tell the relater that if he could find but a passage he would let him go to england to tell his majesty of the great favor and respect he had for him this did not a little rejoice our englishman withal the king told him that he would send him a present which should be two cabareets or goats which they do value at a very high rate the king having not above    or    he tells the king that the k of england had many thousands of his subjects that were under the degree of genlemen which had a thousand of sheep apiece the flesh of which they valued at a very much higher rate than goats though our english man lived very handsomely with this efn mancha king of the calananch yet his desires and his hopes were still for his native country at length he obtained a promise from his king that the first english ship that came into that road should have liberty to release or purchase him this very much rejoiced his heart now he thought every day a year till he could hear of or see some english ship arrived many times when he was alone his heart would be oppressed with sighs and sobbings when he thought of his relations and the comfortable society that they had together that it should be his sad lot to be captivated amongst barbarous infidels oftentimes did he walk down to the seaside sometimes with hopes sometimes with fear earnestly expecting the wind of gods providence to blow in some english ship thither his often recourse to the seaside was discerned by one jaga a wizard and the chiefest in   or   kingdoms thereabouts they are persons that the natives give very much credit to and on any difficult occasion run to them for satisfaction the famous delphian oracle was never had in greater adoration than the prophetical speeches of these moorish wizards though they have infinite numbers of them in every place yet this jaga had the most renown amongst them and one day he comes to him and very kindly asked him why he so very often frequented that place he told him to see if he could discover any english vessel to come in there but he being not acquainted with his great fame asked him when he did belive there would one come in not that he was willing to give credit to any of their divinations but supposing that he thereby should please him and answer his expectation ja ga immediately told him that the    day after an english ship should come into the road then he asked him whether that ship should carry him away to which he answered doubtfully but told him that he should be offered to the master of the ship that they would not agree that he should come to shore again and he should not be sold but in a very short time after he should die for grief these    days seemed very long and tedious many a look did he cast on the sea with an aching heart the    day he went to the highest hill thereabout but to no purpose for he could discover no ship the next morning he went again   or   times but saw none about   or   hours after came running into efnmancha some of the moors and told him there was a canoe coming so they called our ships at which our englishman heartily rejoiced hoping then to be released forthwith yet durst not show his joy for fear of punishment or of death for though he lived better now than with his first master yet his service was far worse than the slaves in turkey and their diet worse than dogsmeat therefore had he cause enough of inward joy the ship came immediately in and he highs away presently to jaga to know if it were an english ship who resolved him that it was it happened to be the st maloes merchant capt royden commander who hastened to dispatch his business took in his negroes and was ready to sail and our english man heard never a word what should become of him the king never offering to sell him this put him on a resolution to endeavor to make an escape and to that end had prepared a piece of timber which he had drawn near the waterside on which he intended to paddle to the ship which then lay about a league from the shore just by the seaside as he was about to launch his little floating stick he espied a great aligator which will devour a man at a mouthful this made him alter his resolution and resolve rather to live with inhuman infidels than to throw himself into so imminent a danger which would have been little less than selfmurder but the next day which i may call a day of jubilee almighty god opened the heart of the king to let the poor english man go he sent him in a canoe placed between a negroes legs with some others to guide this small vessel for fear he should leap overboard and swim to the ship at a distance from the ship he haled her in the english tongue which was no small cause of admiration to those on board to hear an english tongue out of their canoes the negroes gave him leave to stand up and show himself to the captain to whom he gave an account how four were left there and only he preserved it was a pretty while before they could strike a bargain though the captain was resolved not to leave him behind several times the negroes padled away with their canoe resolving not to part with him but what with his entreaties and promises he persuaded them to the ship again and they delivered him on board for    copper bars and iron bars each copper bar being about the bigness of a youths little finger the iron bars a little bigger now were his joys completed he thought himself as it were caught up into the third heavens he could hardly persuade himself but it was a dream or vision and that he did not really see english faces or embrace english bodies it was some time before he could throw himself at the captains feet and acknowledge his infinite cause of joy in himself and thankfulness to him for his deliverance from such a severe captivity that he that lately was a slave to infidels that worship they know not what should now see the faces of christians and join with them in worshipping the true god and to him first he offered up the sacrifice of hearty thanksgiving that had sent his angel to redeem him from so cruel a bondage when he came on board his hair was very long and his skin tawny  malattolike having gone naked all the time he was there and frequently anointing himself with palm oil he looked like a tawnymoor but immediately the seamen aboard with christianlike hearts apparelled him the master commanded to hoist sail and having a fair wind they sailed to barbados where capt royden was to tarry some time but the relator earnestly desiring to go to his native country and his ralations got passage to the downs in the katherine of london capt south commander which through gods goodness in a few weeks arrived in the downs where the relater was put on shore to his uncle mr rich watts of deal to his great joy and satisfaction who took this relation from his own mouth  the relation of dr william johnson concerning a most remarkable seadeliverance in his own words    we went aboard from harwich on michaelmasday sept         in the william and john of ipswich daniel morgan master and having a fair wind we set sail i being seasick went to bed but about   a clock in the afternoon the master of the ship came into our cabin with more haste than he was wont which made me ask him whether all was well who like a tenderhearted man who is loath to tell his dying friend that he is so nigh his end replied all is well yet when i saw him shift himself with such haste i rose from my bed and crawled upon the deck where i saw a sad spectacle the ship having sprang a leak or rather a plank was ready to sink upon which every man was affrighted one was at his prayer another wringing his hands a third his eyes shedding of tears when he had no need of more salt water but after this they fell to work but were busy in doing nothing the masters mate who went to search the leak told us with a sad countenance trembling hands gnashing of teeth a quivering tongue and words half spoken that the leak could not be stopped and the water came in so fast upon us that we must perish in this noment upon which we presently cast out our longboat and shot off   or   guns to another ship who came out with us to come to our relief then with some difficulty we all got into the boat and god be thanked came clear of the ship whose sails now lay flat upon the water and now we were rowing we know not whither for the other ship came not to our relief which made us have hard thoughts of them without cause for we understood that both the ship and all the men perished in the same hour now were we without all hope for it blew half a storm and we were in a small vessel many leagues from the shore without compass or provision to sustain us being starved likewise with cold as well as for want of victuals having nothing in our boat but a small kettle which served to cast out the water and   bags of pieces of eight of  00 pound serling which would neither feed us nor keep us warm in this distress we went to prayers and it pleased god to hear us and send a ship to us even in the moment of death which we endeavored to come to and he likewise to us but the storm was so great we could not reach one another though when it was dark he hung out a light and we to let him know we were alive ordered that when a wave took us up we should give a great shout which we did so loud that i helieve our cry was heard to heaven for by gods miraculous assistance we got near the ship and soon after all safe into it the next day it blew fair for norway whither we were bound and about    at noon we saw the coast which being ragged and full of rocks we resolved to stay till next morning before we went in and then sat down to meat and eat very heartily being kindly entertained by the honest norwegian about ten a clock at night we laid us down to rest after having prayed and set our watch but immediately this our second ship ran with full sails upon a rock and gave so great a crack as was able to awake the most dead asleep among us and the mariners cried out mercy mercy it pleased god that the ship struck it self so fast in the clift of the rock that the former part of her stood firm but breaking in the storm one of the seamen leaped from the bow of the ship upon the rock with a rope in his hand which was fastened to one of our masts and held it with so stiff a hand that another slipped down by it and so all our company that escaped being    in number came safe to the rock i was the last that came down the ship that way for in that very moment she gave way which the master perceiving who was still aboard made lamentable moan to us to help him which we endeavored to the utmost but the ship broke and sunk immediately there was this good man and four of the mariners drowned i saw the master with a lightin his hand fall into the sea the saddest sight that i ever yet beheld in this world and that which pierced my soul to see him that saved our lives lose his own now were we in the dark upon the rock but knew not where our feet being cut upon the sharp stones at length we happened of a hole in the rock which which was a warm shelter against the wind and when morning came where we could see no land only had a glimps of the coast of norway at a great distance we grew hungry but had nothing to fish with but our arms with which we drew up some small muscles and they we eat heartily but we burnt with thirst and i would have given all i had for a draught of fresh water which would have been more welcome than the gold of ophir though nothing is so mean in our esteem but we were forced to drink salt water which increased our thirst we now saw a ship coming toward us with full sails and we waved our hats at them but they went off and never came near us we betook our selves to our old remedy prayers the danes first singing one of luthers psalms fell to their prayers and i prayed as long as i was able to speak and then laid my self down on the rock thinking i should rise no more in this world but i overheard one of the seamen say let us make a raft and venture to sea i had rather be drowned than lie here to be starved they all concluded of it though dangerous and the sea having fallen from the rock had left our sails masts and anchors with part of the ship thereon wherewith they soon made a slight boat and it being a great calm the rest past through the beaches with   men in it and had it touched only on them they would have rent it in pieces however through gods goodness they arrived safe in norway and returned with several boats so that we came all of us once more to land and were entertained at an honest lutheran parsons house where after we had continued for some days with little money and much thanks we parted and came to frederick stadt where the people ran after us in the streets and with compassionate eyes gave us what we wanted without asking from whence we went to oftersondt and there went aboard an english ship we had not been above   or   hours at sea but there was a sad distraction the mariners again crying for mercy mercy for we had almost fallen soul on a rock under water which we did not spy till we were upon it but by the mercy of god we sailed close by it and yet escaped it the least touch of it had been our ruin about noon we came clear of all the rocks on the coast of norway and were sailing for england with a fair gale of wind but in this prosperity another sad ancident befell us this third ship sprang a leak and began to swim within as well as without and we had no way to relieve our selves but pumping for the leak could not be found which we did day and night for four or five days together when it pleased god we came safe though in a great deal of danger because of our rotten ship into yarmouth road for the wind being very high had like to have driven us upon a scotch vessel who cried out as well as we but we happily mist him and so safely arrived in yarmouth town through the wonderful mercy of god deus nobiscum  the great dangers and merciful deliverances of william okely and his company from slavery in a canvas boat etc in the year      we took ship at gravesend in the mary of london mr boarder master bound for the isle of providence in the west indies five weeks we ay in the downs waiting for a wind and then we set sail and came to an anchor near the isle of wight but by this time all the beer in our ship stunk and we were forced to throw it overboard and so take in vinegar to mix with water for our voyage the next lords day we set sail again and coming between the island and the main land we stuck fast in the sands but the tide coming in heaven us off the sixth day after our setting sa from the isle of wight we discovered thre turks men of war who chased us and a break of day boarded and took us having kept us close prisoners at sea at the end of five or six weeks they brough us to algiers where i was sold for a slay the first market day to a patron wh told me i must allow him two dollars month and live ashore where i would an get it where i could though i knew no where to levy the least mite of it wa dring up and down i met with an englishman in his little shop who trade with tobacco and a few other things i became his partner with a little money had reserved and a small modicum m patron had allowed me for my stock here i got money and hired a cella where i laid up some other of my good when weary of my slavery i formed design for my liberty and communicated it to john anthony carpenter wi adams bricklayer john jephs seaman john a carpenter and two others me of able bodies and useful in the intende project which was to contrive the model of a boat which being formed i parcels and afterward put together might be the means of our escape they approved the proposal and in my cellar we began to work we provided first a piece of timber of twelve foot long to make the keel but because it was impossible to convey it of that length out of the city but it must be seen and suspected we therefore cut it in two pieces and fitted it for jointing just at the middle and then we provided ribs after which we made the boat watertight and because boards would require much hammering and that noise was like to betray us we bought as much strong canvas as would cover our boat twice over upon the unequal of the carine we provided also as much pitch tar and tallow as would serve to make it a kind of tarpawling cerecloth to swaddle the naked body of our infant boat of two pipe staves sawed at the corners we made two things to serve for oars and for our provision we had a little bread and two leather bottles full of fresh water we also remembered to buy as much canvas as would serve for a sail we carried out these in parts and parcels fitted them together in the valley about half a mile from the sea whither four of our company carried the boat on their shoulders and the rest followed them at the seaside we stripped put our clothes into the boat and carried it and them as far into the sea as we could wade and then all seven got into the boat but finding she was over laden two of the seamen were content to stay on shore having bid them farewell we lanched out june  0      the bill of lading was john anthony will adams john jephs john the carpenter and will okely four of us wrought continually at the oar the fisth was to free the boat of that water which by degrees leaked through our canvas our bread was soon spoiled with the soaking in the salt water our fresh water stunk of the tanned skin and owze yet we complained not three days with good husbandry our bread lasted us but then pale famine stard us in the face water indeed we might have but it must be salt out of the sea or that which had been strained through our own bodies and that we chose of the two but we must not have that after a while unless we would accept of the other first and the misery was that did not assuage our thirst but inerease it the wind too for some time was full against us but god rebuked it and made it our friend a second inconvenience was that our labor was without intermission and a third the extremity of the heat by day the season raging hot the beginning of july and we wanted fresh water to cool the heat our labor made it insupportable to our bodies and our little hope made it as grievous to our souls one help we had a poor one he that emptied the boat threw the water on the bodies of the other to cool them but our bodies thus scorched and cooled rose up in blisters all over great pain we felt great dangers we were in great miseries we endured great wants we were under and had nothing but a little hope food and strength if any ask by what directions we steered our course to mayorck whither we designed to go for the day a pocket dial did supply the place of a compass by night the stars when they appeared and when not we guessed our way by the the motion of the clouds four days and nights were we in this woeful plight on the fifth all hope that we should be saved was perished so that we left off our labor because we had no strength left only emptied the boat of water but then god sent us some relief for as we lay hulling up and down we discovered tortoise not far from us asleep in the sea had drake discovered the spanish fleet he could not have more rejoiced we took up our oars silently rowed to our prey took it into the boat with great triumph we cut off her head and let her bleed into a pot we drank the blood eat the liver and sucked the flesh it wonderfully refreshed our spirits and we picked up some crumbs of hope about noon we thought we discovered land it is impossible to express the joy of our raised souls at this apprehension we wrought hard and after further labor were fully satisfied that it was land and proved to be mayork which we kept within sight of all day july the  th about ten at night we came under the island and crept as near the shore as we could or durst till we found a convenient place where we might thrust in our weatherbeaten boat when we were come to land we were not insensible of our deliverance but though we had escaped the sea we might die at land we had no food since we eat the liver and drank the blood of the tortoise therefore john anthony and my self were sent out to scout abroad for fresh water because we spoke some spanish we came to a watchtower of the spaniards spoke to him on the watch told him our condition earnestly begged some fresh water and some bread he threw us down and old moldy cake but so long as it was a cake hunger did not consider its mouldiness then he directed us to fresh water which was hard by we stood not telling of stories we remembered our brethren left with our boat and observing the centinels directions came to a well where there was a pot with strings to draw with we drank a little water and eat a bit of our cake but the passage was so disused that we had much ado to force our throats to relieve our clamorous stomachs we return to our boat and acquaint them with the good successes of our embassy and all prepare to make to the well so tying our boat as fast as we could to the shore we left her to mercy nw w are at the well which has water therein and we have something to draw with but god must give us a throat to swallow for will adams attempting to drink after many essays was not able to swallow it but still the water returned so that he sunk down to the ground fainting saying i am a dead man but after much striving he took a little so refreshed with our cake and water we lay by the well side till the morning when it was clear day we again went to the watchman entreating him to direct us the ready way to the next house or town where we might find relief he civilly pointed to us to one about two mile off and long it was ere our blistering feet could overcome the tediousness o that little way when we came thither the honest farmer moved with our relation sent us bread and water and olives and seeing us thankful beggars inlarge his civility to us called us into his house and gave good warm bean pottage which seemed to me the most pleasant food that ever i eat in my life then we advanced to the city of mayorck about te miles from that place that night we lay by a well side and in the morning we eed the suburbs the viceroy was informed of us and we were commanded to appear before him who after he had examined us and heard our story ordered we should be maintained at his own cost till we could have passage to our own country but our english ships seldom trading thither we petitioned the viceroy for passage in the king of spains galleys which were in the road bound for alicant which he graciously granted us after some other troubles we met with contrary winds and it was five weeks ere we could reach the downs where we arrived in sept      the commader of the ship was capt smith of rotherhithe mr thomas saunders my wives brother being in mayorck not long after we came from thence saw our boat hung for a monument upon the side of great church there and mr robert hales was there      and assures me that he saw the naked ribs and skeleton of it then hanging in the same place wanlys hist man p      the merciful preservation and deliverance of capt blose and his ships company who were cast away in an island of ice near russia this present year      october the  th      we came from archangel in russia in the riga merchant burden  00 tuns    guns samuel blose commander the  th we had the wind at north west by west we plied to windward and it blew very hard the  0th we took two reefs in our topsails the   th we took in our topsails and reefe costs the   th about one in the morning we sprung a leak in so much that we were forced to set both our pumps to work and bear away before the wind yet still the water increased and the   th we cut our mainsail from the yard and let him fly overboard the weather being so excessive thick by reason of the extraordinary much snow that then fell that we could not see the land nor any place where we could run our ship ashore to save our lives the    in the morning about one of the clock by fortune unexpected of us before we saw any land we struck upon an island called by the russes mussoves lying in the missen gulf which by the miraculous hand of god we light on and were all gotten well ashore for as god of his wonderful goodness so ordered it we struck about high water and as the water fell away our ship dried so that we got safe to land without any harm and if it had pleased god we happened ever so little either to one side or the other we should have all perished among the islands of ice when we got all ashore we made us a tent and when it was day looking about us saw something like houses so our captain and a dutch merchant passenger that we had on board of our ship and our doctor went to see what they were thinking to find some inhabitants but they could find none then we went aboard our ship and got all our beef ashore that we could find about one hundred weight of biscuit bread which was all the bread we could find then we calculated that our beef at four pieces a day would serve us till the middle of may and every man one biscuit a day but that would last but a small time besides we got ashore three boxes of candles which was a great comfort to us in our necessity by reason we had not above three hours day then we got all our things we had saved to the house that we saw and going about discovered a great many houses and we went to them to see what we could find expecting to see some people but there was none but empty cask so we came home to the place that we had carried our things to again but as god would have it just against the house that we had taken for our habitation in the snow we saw two cask and we went and found them both full of rye meal which was a joy beyond measure to us in our extremity and then we found another cask with a kneadingtub in it december the first the dutch merchant and four more of our hands went out and took a compass and provision with them upon discovery hoping to see some body to speak to that we might know where we were but they could find no inhabitants the course they steered was s e but when they came to turn back their compass unhung and they not minding it went up and down a long time and at length came to the same place where they were when they first turned back then they looked more earnestly upon their compass and found it unhung they hung it and came the direct way home again but when they came in sight of a house that was about two miles off of our house the merchant and one more traveling better than the other three went before and promised them to make a fire against they came but the weather being so severe they were not able to come along but were starved with the cold before they got up to us so the lord of his great mercy made provision for us until the first of march it being a sabbath day and we at our devotion one of our boys being at another house broiling of our victuals saw some men upon the island he fell down being much surpised but soon got up again and run and told us upon which we left our prayers and run to see what they were our merchant could speak the language which was the preservation of all our lives for otherways they would have murdered us for breaking down their houses and eating their provisions that we found upon the island for they would not be persuaded but we were pirates and robbers by reason that we were building of a small vessel for our own security to carry us to the main when the ice broke up but our merchant speaking their language persuaded them and promised them to make them satisfaction for what damage we had done them for we broke down two of their houses for firing so they turned us out of our houses and took our meal from us the men that came over were in number  00 ten men in a boat they came there to kill seals they asked us what we had seen we told them nothing but two ravens they made very strange of it and would not believe it for they told us that none of them live there but six weeks in the year whether they catch fish or not the island was so haunted soon after the russians came there that man that saved his life and got well home with the merchant when the other three were starved with the cold died which made four that were dead our compliment at first was    but then we had but    living then our merchant went to the russians and desired them to put us over and he would satisfy them for it they granted we should have six boats and  0 men to drag us over the ice for it was seven leagues from the main and all full of islands of ice between insomuch that they were    hours coming over when they came upon the said island but it pleased the lord so to order it that after they had dragged us over two small islands of ice that as god parted the red sea for the children of israel to pass through so he parted the ice from us insomuch that we got over in six hours time which the russians told us was never so before but when we came over we lay where there were  000 men a fishing the first night and the next morning we hired sledges to drag us to some place inhabited the beasts that dragged the sledges along they call roeys they are like deer but larger we were forced to be dragged we could not travel our limbs were so disabled with the cold before we got off the aforesaid island besides the snow was of such a vast thickness and so hard frozen that we could find no path if we could travel never so well if the shamake as they call them had not shown us the way the first night of our journey upon the sledges our carpenters mate died so we made a hole in the snow and put him in and left him then our captain and the merchant and the doctor being but single in a sledge and we near double went faster than us to the next town to provide victuals and fresh sledges for us against we came and when we came to that town we got sledges that had horses to draw them along so we rid night and day till we came to archangel the third day of our travels another of our men died and the  th day another the former we buried in the ground because we were nigh a town but the other we buried in the snow so that when we came to archangel out of our    men we had but  0 left march the   th we came off the aforesaid island and we traveled night and day except the first night until the   th of the same month two days after we came to archangel we lost another man at archangel our captain got stoves for us to inhabit in and sent us provision where we remained till the  th day of june when there came in six sail of hollanders being the first that came that year who divided us amongst them and brought us to greenland and from thence some of us were brought to holland and some to hamborough from whence    of us got passage to england where we arrived the    of nov      two went to the straits and our dutch merchant tarried in holland  this account is given by francis lee who was boatswain of the ship and attested by others now living in london  the seamans preacher or seadangers and deliverances improved in a sermon acts          0    and being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next day they lightened the ship     and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship   0 and when neither sun nor stars appeared and no small tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken away   in this chapter we have a full narrative of pauls voyage to rome in all the circumstances of it it seems paul kept a journal and so recorded this memorable voyage for the use of succeeding generations   we have the occasion of his voyage viz paul being then a sufferer and a prisoner he appeals to caesar and so is sent to rome and there bears a faithful testimony for jesus christ  verse     we have the dangers that occurred in the voyage and these are also carefully commemorated  ver   now much time was spent and sailing was now dangerous because the fast was already past this was the yearly fast of the jews on which the atonement for all the people was made by the high priest in the holy of holies which day was the  0 of the  th month  lev      which partly agreed wih our september and october in which time the sea was not sailed in by the ancients until the beginning of march because of the shortness of the days and violence of the tempests they were prone to in those parts this is the sense of interpreters upon the place the   danger of the voyage we read of is this the winds were contrary  ver   this is spoken of the voyage of the disciples the winds were contrary the   danger there arose not only a contrary wind but a violent wind called an euroclydon  ver    some read it a whirlwind but it is meant of an eastwind which raises the sea mightily   the tempest was so great and violent upon them they were glad to let the ship drive  ver       we have not only the danger in this voyage but their mavelous deliverance and preservation for they came of all of them with their lives  ver    the particulars whereof you may see  in the text we have three things observable   their endeavors in this great distress to preserve themselves   they lightened the ship and what was it she was laden with it was wheat  ver    they lightened the ship and cast the wheat into the sea thus did jonahs mariners cast ou the wares alas what are these things but lumber to lives if it were gold i must go for life skin for skin and all tha a man has will he give for his life then what should a man give for his soul what will a man give in exchange for his soul the   endeavor they cast ou the tackling of their ship any thing they part with to save their lives though never so useful to them even that which was necessary for their voyage they are under a necessity to part with it for the preservation of their lives    we have their dangers as well as endeavors   it is expressed in the violence of the tempest they were exceedingly tosse with a tempest   it was dark weather neither sun nor stars appeared which used to be great comforts and helps to poo men at sea   their danger is expressed n this they were brought to the brink of he black pit of despair all hope now was taken away o what a sad distressed conition was this their hope which is alled the anchor of the soul was lost hey gave all their lives over for gone and ost and oh what could now a comany of men do that had lost their hopes and hearts could these that had lost their hopes find their hands they were ow saying as the jews did in the capivity our hope is lost we are cut off for our arts  ezekiel         we have their deliverance and preervation coming in at such a time and season as this was now that they are brought o an extremity god makes it his opporunity and now that all hope of being aved is taken away salvation will be most easonable and now the angel appears to paul and tells him all their lives are ensured nly the ship shall be lost  observations are these    dangers and deliverances are to be carefully recorded and remembered therefore paul takes an account of both here in this voyage    salvations and deliverances many times are not sent until persons be left hopeless in themselves  i shall speak a little to both these upon this present occasion that what you rea here may be remarked and remembered   dangers and deliverances are to be carefully recorded and remembered this observation has two paats   dangers are t be remembered   deliverances are to b remembered   thus the lords poor people used to d in all ages when jacob was in danger o his brother esau you see how he commemorates it and gives us an exact narrativ of it and tells us how he feared him lord i fear my brother esau  psalm     how often was david in danger by saul who was his sworn enemy and how many psalms have we taking occasion to remember what danger he was in and how comfortably he was brought off i sough the lord and he heard me and delivered m out of all my fears   cor    0 as paul tells the corinthians what danger they were in they were pressed out of measure ou of strength insomuch that they despaired of life etc and so at sea as well as land he would have dangers remembered how that they go up to heaven one while and sink into the deeps another their soul melted because of trouble and they were at their wits ends etc peters danger at sea is recorded when he began to sink and cried out master save me or i peresh  matt          0 and the disciples when they cried out carest hou not that we perish mark     it s observed the ship now was full and ow comes salvation and deliverance here was their danger recorded the ship was full and christ asleep in the hinder part of the ship    query is how dangers should be emembred   how deliverances should be rememred   dangers should be remembered considering we may come into them again many when dangers are not they sing to their souls that song and delude themselves the bitterness of death is past they think they are out of one storm and they shall never come in such another just as persons do with their sickness at land o many do with their dangers at sea if god bring them off o they grow harded and secure again but if god has brought us home one dangerous voyage we should think it may be the next will e as dangerous have i escaped one at sea one at land if i do not improve it if i do not walk suitable under it o how easily can god bring me into another you never were in such dangers but you may come to the like again whether at sea or land    dangers should be remembered with consideration to the greatness of them great things should be remembered a great god great mercies great deliverances great sins and great dangers how should we think o what a danger was i in a this time by such a storm at sea by such a sickness ashore not only my life is danger was i fit to die at such a time  had i gotten an interest in christ if  had been cast away at such a time me think dangers great for their bodies bu they do not think them so for their souls they think them great for their ships for their estates but they do not think them so for their eternal condition o had not my body soul ship and all perished together and was not this a great danger thy souls danger was the greatest danger had thou been drowned a such a time thy soul had been shipwrackt to all eternity    dangers should be remembered with consideration to their suddenness how many times do they come suddenly upon us as there is sudden fear so there is sudden danger when the lord send the winds out of his treasury suddenly and threatens men at sea with sudden destruction when desolation seems to come as a whirlwind etc we should think that if sudden death had come upon me what a condition was my poor soul in what a dreadful thing would it have been if i had been surprised on a sudden and sent into an eternal condition in the twinkling of an eye i to be threatened to be swallowed up only with a formal god have mercy upon thee in thy mouth not to have time to pray repent reflect upon thy past life o what a sad thing is this    we should think of our dangers with consideration to the frames of our hearts what frames of heart we were then under   to the frames of our hearts when in our dangers   the frames of our herats when brought from under them   the frames of the heart when in and under them were not you under great fears and hurries of soul it may be not knowing how it would go with your souls if you had gone off the stage of this life at the present david when he was in danger took especial notice of the frame of his spirit innumerable evils have compassed me about psalm  0      he was compassed about on every side with danger and how was it with him then he calls to mind mine iniquities have taken hold upon me so that i am not able to look up psalm     and what then o see how he prays be pleased o lord to deliver me o lord make have to help me remember what the frames of our heart were in dangers in reference to our fears and secondly what in reference to ou faith so also did david when pursure in danger by saul my heart is fixed my hear is fixed i will sing and give praise we ar to remember our fears under our dangers that we may be prepared better for futur trials we are to remember our faith under dangers past that we may be encouraged for the time to come in after straits    we are to remember our frames o spirit when god brings us out of our danger how then we were melted with the present sense of the mercy as those israelites when god brought them out o danger they believed god they sang and gav praise o what resolutions were ther then upon the soul to be given up anew to god to walk before the lord in the light of the living thus also did david when brought out of danger thy vow are upon me o god etc and at another time the lord preserves the simple i was brough low etc and thou helpedst me psalm         and then what a frame of heart wa upon him return unto thy rest o my soul etc  psalm        then he was al for returning to god these we are to remember that we may not wear totally the sense of them off our spirits    we should remember our dangers with consideration to the frequency of them how frequently we were in them paul remembered this in perils by sea often in perils by the heathens etc   cor      o how often have we been near drowning near taking near sinking near dying and yet god brought us off these things we should call to mind often who go out upon dangerous voyages and often come home he oftener and more frequent our dangers the more should we think upon them    we should remember our deliverances but how   we should remember them so as to admire them thus did the people of the jews in ezra who has given them such deliverance as this o they admire it and write a nonsuch upon the head of it as david admired the goodness of god when he had spoken of his house to come is this the manner of men o god he was in an holy ecstasy of heavenly admiration so should you say ow to carry out and bring home in such a dangerous time as this to hide from enemies when sought for in such a time such a voyage as this oh who am i and what is my fathers house that he should bring me hitherto you should turn he deliverance on every side and admire the goodness of god the wisdom of god the mercy of god the power of god the faithfulness of god in it and say o lord what a deliverance is this what a voyage is this god loves to have his mercies admired by us    we should remember our deliverances to have our hearts raised up it gratitude and thankfulness to god for them thus did david i will pay my vows unto the lord in presence of all his people i will take the cup of salvation and will cal upon the name of the lord psalm             we are to remember to pay our thankofferings unto god after our deliverance from god what forget such a deliverance as this what not be thankful for such a preservation as this    we should remember our deliverances so as to endear our hearts to god thus we find david i will love thee o lord i will love the lord dearly so the heb the lord is my rock my fortress and my deliverer etc psalm     o now how should souls after their deliverance boil and burn in love to god how are we engaged to a friend that is at any time but an instrument in gods hand to deliver us and shall we be endeared to the instrument and not to the author o how was david endeared to god when he said he having redeemed him he would walk before the lord in the land of the living psalm    ult    we should remember our deliverances to improve them in a way of acting faith when the next danger and straits come i will remember thee from the land of jordan from the hill missar psalm       this was to encourage him from his former deliverances in his future straits and exigencies what now distrust god who has delivered in six troubles and now shall we give way to unbelief in the seventh did not holy david thus he has delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear and he wi deliver me out of the hand of the uncircumcised philistine thus paul remembers his deliverance from nero and i was delivered ut of the mouth of the lion and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work   timothy          we should remember our deliverances to be often inculcating and imprinting them upon our own hearts as when we receive them they are a little fresh it may be upon our spirits but o ow soon do they die because they are ot written upon our hearts they are not ngraven there as a man that would remember a thing beit a notion or an resolution he will be often turning it over in his thoughts alas if we write o deliverances is it not in the dust where as we should write them in marble we should write them with a pen of iro and the point of a diamond    we should commemorate our dangers with our deliverances because god gives them to that end the lord does not give us our deliverances to cast them at our heels nor brings us out of our daers that we might forget them as tho w had never been in any of them god expects that we should faithfully registe and record them therefore it was a great provocation to the lord that the children of israel so soon forgot his works if you do but forget the kindness of friend you think it is disingenuous bu o then what is it to forget that god that has delivered you out of six troubles and in seven troubles god loves and expects his kindness should be kept upon record    we should commemorate our dangers and deliverances because it was freely of his grace to bring us out of the on and put us under the other is it not o his mere mercy that he rescued and pulled us out of our dangers might not we else have been swallowed up by them and may not we all say in this case as the psalmist in that had it not been the lord who was on our side then the waters had overwhelmed us the stream had gone over our soul then the proud waves had gone over our soul psalm        may not you who have been so often delivered at sea in imminent dangers sing this song what and now forget such dangers and cast behind your backs such deliverances oh the freer any favor is the more it should be remembered does god see any thing in us or in our families more than others to bestow such deliverances for one man goes to sea and he is taken another goes to sea and he is sunk another goes to sea and he dies the time of the voyage and why does the lord preserve you is not this free grace not because you are more righteous but because he is more gracious and should not this be remembered    our dangers and deliverances should be remembered because god has gracious ends and designs both in the one and the other what ends has god to bring us into dangers   he by this has an end and design to quicken us up to duty it may be there may be some ommitted duty neglected duties often bring men into great and imminent dangers it may be a person is convinced of the duty of prayer but it may be neglected oh then god will bring him into danger to quicken him to his duty oh says god in their affiction they will seek me early the very heathen mariners called out for prayer in time of danger observe it that persons convinced of duties either personal or domestical and yet neglected god usually whips them to their duties by one danger affliction or another the proverb is good if you wonld teach a man to pray send him to sea   god by bringing us into dangers has a design upon us to convince us of sin many convictions have come into the soul at this door dangers have often proved inlets to convictions oh what convictions have many poor souls lain under while in danger when it may be the dangers have given them a view of eternity when dangers have presented death to the man and conscience has cried now thou art sinking now there is but a step betwixt thee and eternity betwixt thee and and another world oh then what convictions has the soul lain under and yet it may be when the danger is over the conviction is over too well though we may forget all yet god remembers all   god has a design upon us in our dangers to prepare us for our latter end the danger thou were in and have escaped calls for thee to prepare for thy death which must certainly come to pass shortly god by dangers would have you prepare for death and oh what a cutting consideration will this be when thou come to die that thou who have been in so many dangers by sea and land should have no more learned to die nor art yet ready to die alas you escaped the last that you might prepare for the next   god has a design upon our graces by bringing us into danger danger is to evert and draw forth grace thus the disciples dangers at sea were to draw forth their faith faith and patience come most visibly upon the stage in times of most imminent danger    god by bringing us into dangers has a design upon our souls he sometimes by danger of drowning the body has saved the soul and has caused it to say periissem nisi periissem i had perished if had not perished some have escaped shipwreck of soul by shipwreck of body and shall we forget such dangers when god has such gracious designs in them upon us    he drives on gracious ends and designs in our deliverances and shall we then forget them etc   he spares us that we may account his longsuffering salvation he gives by sparing of us space to repent and oh what a dreadful thing is it not to remember wherefore we are spared and delivered he gave her space to repent but she repented not psalm    ult the prisoner is reprieved that he might sue out his pardon and will he forget the end for which he is reprieved   he delivers that we may live to him why were davids feet delivered from falling it was that he might walk before the lord in the light of the living he gives us our lives that we might give them back again to god jer   0 men are not delivered from dangers to live to themselves to live to their lusts to drink and swear and rant and roar as a great many poor wretches do that say as they did we are delivered to do all these abominations psalm  0     god has another end of deliverance that we might glorify him in paying our vows to him i will deliver thee and what then when out of trouble never remember it more cast it behind thy back o no and thou shall glorify me he aims at a revenue of glory out of your deliverances   god has another end of delivering of us that we might enter into new engagements to be more the lords a in times of great dangers there use to be great engagements betwixt god and the soul so in times of great deliverances there are great engagements pass betwixt god and the soul new dedications to god new deliverances call for new dedications of the soul to god now the soul should be set apart for god more than ever   god has another end in delivering of us that we might break off our league with sin thus it was with them shall we break his commaandments after such great deliverance as this   application is it so that our dangers and deliverances should be remembered by us then it is a word of information    learn we here how acceptable it is to god that we thankfully congratulate our mercies no music like a sound of trumpets off the waters so o what sweet music does it make in gods ears that you thankfully record seamercies and seadeliverances this is the music of the waters this makes melody in gods ears seaprayers and seapraises come up acceptably before the lord he is so pleased with them that he has called them sacrifices o that men would offer the sacrifice of praise this is the sound of trumpets you should carry to sea with yon outward bound and homeward bound    learn we hence what a great evil it is to lose the remembrance of our dangers and deliverances what do many families what do many persons with the seadangers with the seadeliverances do not they write them in dust do not they bury them in the grave of oblivion do not they cast them behind their backs do not they trample them under foot o poor souls they little know what they do   such deliverances will have a resurrection in their consciences one day though they bury them now o they will rise again and oh how will they then dread and terrify a poor soul   such deliverances will another day be witnesses and evidences against you oh what a cutting testimony will they give in against the soul have not thou been graciously and wonderfully delivered in such a voyage in such a storm at sea is such a sickness at shore and yet walked unsuitably under all these to be cast out by mercy o what a dreadful thing is this   such deliverances forgotten by us harden us either they soften or harden these providence are like gods ordinances in this respect they either harden or soften oh what a dreadful thing it is to be hardened by deliverances and preservation and yet many are sentence being not speedily executed the hearts of men are fully set in them to do evil   such deliverances will be great aggravations both of mans sin and misery if forgotten by them the goodness of god was the aggravation of the sin of david says god when i had done so and so for thee nay and i would have done more wherefore have thou despised the commandment of the lord to do evil in his sight   samuel       what for you that had such deliverances as these to break his commandment as ezra says o this is an high aggravation   deliverances and dangers forgotten will cause the lord to pull in his hand in a way of mercy will cause god to give up persons and take his protecting presence from them take them from the shadow of his wings souls by forgetting past dangers and deliverances may put themselves from under gods protection for the future   use   is it so that we are to remember our seadangers and deliverances then it is a word of exhortation be exhorted then to call to mind and keep in mind what god has done for you and in this exhortation i address my self to seafaring men whose lives are a course and series of wonders in their frequent salvations and preservations witness this treatise as you see the wonders of god in the deeps viz the wonders of his creation so do you see the wonders of his salvation how often may wonderful be written upon the head of salvations that you are every voyage receiving from god you never go out and come home but god works wonderfully and appears wonderfully for you is not he a wonderworkinggod for you every voyage  the exhortation is to call to mind and keep in mind to record and register your dangers and deliverances and not to do as israel is said to do who soon forgot his works how often does god bring this sin of theirs in one psalm they forgot his works and the wonders he had showed them psalm  0    psalm         keep them in mind for they are wonderful dangers and deliverances they are wonders these are to be remembered mavelous things did he for them in the sight of their fathers etc he divided the sea and caused them to pass through and he made the waters to stand as an heap psalm         and it is brought in again in that psalm they remembered not his hand nor the day when god delivered them out of the hand of the enemy etc psalm      and in another place they forgot god their savior which had done great things in egypt wondrous works in the land of ham psalm  0       this heightens the and sin exceedingly to forget such great wonderful dangers and deliverances    your dangers are wonderful in this respect they are often such as threaten a sentence of death to be executed upon you may it not be said of poor seamen as was of them for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength insomuch that we despaired of life but we had the sentence of death in our selves that we should not trust in our selves but in him that raises the dead who delivered us from so great a death and does deliver   cor       0 o how many seafaring men may say thus our dangers have been such as we have often despaired of life there has been but a little betwixt us and death nay betwixt us and eternity and shall we forget such dangers when we have been so near death in them as he said to david as the lord lives there is but one step betwixt thee and death o how often have you been near sinking near drowning and yet god has then appeared for you with an outstreached arm and in the mount has he been seen and will you not remember this    your dangers are wonderful in this respect they are sudden and surprising they are wonderfully sudden threatened with nothing but present death and destruction it may be said of seamen as of those in job snares compassed them about and sudden fear troubled them job    0 it does not only trouble them but all on a sudden trouble them before they know almost where they are as we say we read of some whose calamity shall come suddenly suddenly shall he be broken without remedy prove     o how terrible is such a case or such a danger and has not god often threatened to make this your case and condition o then do not forget such dangers that have so suddenly looked you in the face    your dangers are wonderful in this respect they are not dangers in which your bodies are concerned only but they are dangers in which your souls are concerned it is not only the danger of a shipwrackd vessel and a shipwrackd estate and a shipwrackd body but a shipwrackd soul here is the great danger lest thou make a lost voyage for thy soul if thou had died in such a storm or died in the time of such a voyage oh what would have become of thy soul thy precious thy immortal soul had not thou died in a carnal in a christless state and condition had not they poor soul perished to all eternity if thou then had miscarried wast not thou then a stranger altogether to christ and a work of saving grace upon thy heart had not thou then the guilt of all thy sins upon the back of thy soul unpardoned and o what danger was this and will thou forget such dangers    your dangers are such at sea as none but a god can deliver from all your skill cannot o then is the greatest artist at his wits end the psalmist tells us  psalm  0    the mariners in their storms are at their wits end or as some read it all their wisdom is swallowed up they know not what course to steer the dutch annorators carry it now their very pilots are at a loss now all their courage cannot contribute to their deliverance though men of the greatest natural courage and magnanimity in the world yet now their hearts melt because of troubles as it said of the mariners in jonahs ship the mariners were afraid o now when death and eternity the grave and judgment to come looks them in the face then they are magormissabibs terror to themselves and to all about them o then the danger is such it must be only the finger of god that can help i have heard of a ship in yarmouth road that in a great storm they feared the anchor would come home and the master discoursing with a youth in the ship that god had begun lately to work some convictions upon o says he master if god do but lay a finger upon one strand of the cable it will hold and in the morning many ships were lost near them and there was but one strand in the cable left o the singer of god only can save in some dangers it was a good saying of a godly commander of a ship in imminent danger none now but that god that saved the children of israel at the red sea can save us out of this distress and as soon as he had said it the wind altered and saved them and will you forget such dangers as none but a god can save from    your dangers at sea are such as many thousands have perished in how many have gone to sea that never returned more that have been swallowed up in the belly of the great deeps how many have perished by the sword at sea how many by violent storms and that god should put a difference betwixt you and others and you should forget it this exceedingly heightens and aggravates the guilt how many have lost their lives how many have lost their limbs and yet in such dangers god has brought you off this is never to be forgotten    your dangers are not only wonderful but your deliverances are so too and therefore should be remembered there is never a deliverance but you may read a wonder in it so many deliverances and salvations at sea so many wonders god saves you in a miraclous way    is not this a wonder that persons of such great sins and provocations should be persons of such great salvations and preservations that such as sin every voyage nay it may be at an high rate sin every voyage should be saved and delivered at such an high rate every voyage is not this a wonder that men of such sins should be men of such salvations that men that sin against these salvations should not have these deliverances shorten upon them oh what a wonder is this we should wonder if a person should be continually disobliging any of us and yet we should be still heaping up kindnesses upon him this made the prophet ezra say shall we again break his commandments after such deliverances as this o do not you provoke the lord every time that you go out and still he delivers you still he returns you to your relations to visit your habitations in peace and is not this a wonder    your deliverances are wonderful if you consider your deliverances are great deliverances we read of such and the lord saved them with a great deliverance or with a great salvation thus said sampson thou have given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant judge      now any great transactions are remembered and recorded your deliverances are great if we consider these things   they are commanded deliverances by the great god his word of command brings all our deliverances about whether at sea or land which made the church in distress pray thou art my king o god command deliverances for jacob  psalm     he commands every thing tending to deliverance at sea in order to deliverance he commands the winds he makes the storm a calm psalm  0     he also commands the seas he says to the proud waves so far and no farthar you read of a decree set to the sea to command the sea that it cannot pass though the waves thereof toss themselves yet can they not prevail though they roar yet can they not pass over it jer     it is the great god only that rides lord admiral at sea to command the seas and the waves thereof god is said to shut up the sea with doors and set bars upon it hitherto shall thou come and no further and here shall thy proud waves be stayed job        xerxes presumed he could tame the hellespont for attempting his bridge of boats but all this was in vain this is a flower in gods crown alone to command the sea your deliverances are a fruit and effect of gods commanding power therefore great   they are great deliverances as they are the curious workmanship as i may call them of the attributes of a great god deliverance is said to be wrought for us it is the handy work of god if god will work who can let as the prophet says isa         and he seems to speak it upon the account of the deliverance of his people for your sake i have sent done to babylon and have brought down all their nobles and the chaldeans whose cry is in their ships in every deliverance there is the excellent work of the attributes of god we may in such a deliverance say here is the power of god and here is the wisdom of god and here is the wisdom of god and here is the love of god and here is the faithfulness of god etc for as god in the confounding of the languages at babel said go to let us go down as if he directed himself to his glorious throne come let us go down genesis     or as some take it of the trinity as in the creation so when god sends us deliverances in our distresses he sets his attributes at work go power go mercy go love go faithfulness go and act your respective parts in this deliverance and must not this be then an excellent and curious piece that gods attributes brings forth   they are great deliverances if we consider the great sins and provocations they come over the heads of the great unworthiness of the received heightens much the mercy and favor received the reason why persons do not greaten their deliverances is because they do not greaten their sins in the deep sense and aggravations of them o such a soul would say as david is this the manner of men o god is not this a great deliverance for such a great sinner to receive   they are great deliverances if we consider the time and season of their coming in as this deliverance of the ships company where paul was it was when all hope of being saved was taken away and so were many of the deliverances mentioned in this treatise so peters seadeliverance when he began to sink christ stretched forth his hand immediately he was now sinking and going but see how ready christ was to save he stretched forth his hand and caught peter  matthew          0 our sinking time is jesus christs saving time in the mount is the lord seen our extremity is gods opportunity and are not then the great deliverances never to be forgotten   they are great deliverances if we consider they are not only deliverances of the bodies and ships and estates sometimes but souls and where the ship is lost and the estate is lost yet for the life to be saved and the soul delivered is a very great deliverance a reprieve when a prisoner is under the sentence of death is a great mercy o when god reprieves a poor prisoner this is some deliverance we read of some deliverance god gave to israel in the days of shishak a reprieve is some deliverance but if it end in suing out the prisoners pardon then it is a great deliverance if it be such a deliverance in a storm at sea as hezekiah had from a sickness at shore thou have delivered me in love to my soul and cast all my sins behind thy back isa    this is a double deliverance and sure such deliverances as these are worth recording these are to be written in marble and not in dust with the pen of iron as the prophet says and not with the point of a diamond     your deliverances are wonderful if you consider the many thousands that have perished in less dangers to an eye of reason they are distinguishing deliverances and therefore wonderful has god dealt with all men that go to sea as with you have not thousand perished by the sword at sea in bloody engagements miscarried at sea in dreadful and terrible storms has not the sea been a sepulcher for thousands are not there millions of the dead that the sea must one day give up and yet you delivered and yet you spared o what distinguishing mercy is this and shall this be forgotten by you should not you keep records of distinguishing mercy how many sunk sometimes and perished by your sides how many that went out with you that never returned one taken and another left one sunk and another saved    your deliverances are wonderful if you consider the way that sometimes god takes to bring them about o what strange ways does god take to deliver when he has a mind to deliver sometimes he brings down to the very gate of the grave he brings to the doors and bars of the sea and then shuts these doors as job speaks he brings to the next door to perishing and then he delivers master save me or i perish and then he lends an arm witness many of these deliverances here mentioned sometimes he does it by strange means low and contemptible as the poor man that we read of that delivered the city  eccles     sometimes by unthought of and unexpected means as he that relieved major gibbons as this story mentions he was a french pyrate as that ship i have heard of that when she sprang a leak and they all had like to have perished and all on a sudden the leak stopped and they knew no reason but when they came into the next port to search her there was a great fish ha wrought himself in the leak that they were glad to cut him out was not here a miraculous deliverance that jona should be swallowed up by the whale  what a miracle was this and so he was preserved and how have some been saved by sudden shifts of winds when near sinking and perishing these are to be remembered to the lord while you live oh methinks this one motive should set on the exhortation if i should use no more to remember your dangers and your deliverances  but secondly another motive is this to remember your dangers with your deliverances this will in your great distresses and extremities contribute some hope to you to read over your register your ancient records how good god has been at such a time and such a time how seasonably he stepped in and delivered in such a strait and such a strait oh then says the soul why then should i despair and cast off all hope now has not he appeared and saved in deaths often before now for past experiences are good supports for hope in present exigencies and extremities thus david argues when at a great strait thou have delivered me and wilt deliver me and thus st paul thou have delivered me and wilt deliver me haman found this a good way to remember the years of the lords right hand    remember your dangers and deliverances for god records them they are filed up by god and he will mind you of them another day if you forget them now he keeps his journals and records he has his book of remembrance of your forgotten mercies as well as your forgotten sins god will one day read over all those deliverances you have forgotten oh poor soul did not i deliver thee in such a danger in such a distress in such a death when there was no hope when there was no help yet all this have thou forgotten forgottenthy mercy and forgotten the god of thy mercy oh will not this sting you to the heart when god shall cause your strangled and murdered mercies to walk in your consciences when he shall give them a resurrection there    motive to remember your dangers and deliverances the vows of god are upon you oh what did you say to god in the day of your distress and calamity lord if thou will appear and be a present help in time of trouble it shall never be for gotten it shall he remembered to the lord as long as we have a day to live but when god brings poor souls off many do not only forget their vows but deny them in ancient times it was usual in imminent dangers whether a sea or land to make vows we read that jonahs mariners they vowed vows  jonah     david did thus thy vows are upon me o god i will render praises unto thee etc psalm      and in another place i will pay thee my vows which my lips have uttered and my mouth has spoken when i was in trouble psalm         but because this is so ordinary to make vows at sea and break them a shore let me enlarge a little upon it   why should you forget your vows after your deliverances they were not ash vows there might have been some excuse if you had made them rashly you might then have had a plea for saying it was an error but in times of distress men are serious when death and eternity are set before them and they upon the brink of another world dare you sinners rashly vow in this day of your distress o no your consciences will bear witness against you that you were in sobersadness at that day   why should you ferget your vows after deliverances for god will require payment nay this is not only the reason why we should not forget to pay but why we should not delay the pay when thou vowest a vow to the lord thy god thou should not be slack to pay it for the lord thy god will require it yea will surely require it of thee and it would be sin in thee deuteronomy      take it for granted he will do it so as to call to a payment day he will demand it he will send unto you a summons to pay the vows you made to him in the day of your distress oh how often is conscience gods officer that he sends to you to demand payment o says conscience sinner pay what thou owe to the god of thy deliverances it not he a god to whom thy vows must be performed   he will require it so as to punish the nonpayment and so requiring is here taken and in many other places the lord does very often severely punish vowbreaking breaking of vows does cause god often to destroy the works of your hands say not before the angel it was an error wherefore should god be angry at thy vows and destroy the works of thy hands eccles      some expositors refes this to the priest before whom the sin of rash vows was to be confessed others carry it to christ the angel of the covenant who sees through all our subti excuses and equivocations and punishe them o god is angry when men go so flatly against their vows o there god is angry and destroys the work o their hands viz disappoints their endeavors and denies their success  lastly to forget your deliverances and dangers is the greatest ingratitude and unthankfulness in the world has god given you so many wonderful deliverances so many miraculous preservations to be buried in the grave of oblivion will you murder your mercies and then bury them it is commonly said murder will out murdered mercies will one day make terrible work in walking in your consciences  the next observation is this that salvations and deliverances many times are not sent until persons be left helpless and hopeless i shall give you a touch of this now all hope of being saved was taken away no small tempest lay upon upon them now they were gulft in despair of ever coming off with their lives yet this often is the condition of nations shipcompanies and persons where god intends to save and deliver the proofs of the last observations about dangers and deliverances being recorded and remembered proves this also thus was peter saved the disciples saved when just at sinking  but why does god stay so long before he sends deliverances and salvations   because he delights to draw forth a spirit of prayer if men will not pray when sinking when drowning when dying they will never pray o see how jonah prays in his distress and jonah prayed to the lord out of the fishes belly and said i cried by reason of mine affliction unto the lord and he heard me out of the belly of hell cried i and thou heardest my voice etc when my soul fainted within me i remembered the lord and my prayer came in unto thy holy temple jonah          o sirs god loves prayer so well that he stays with his deliverances that he might sue them out by prayer out of the depths have   cried unto thee says david psalm   0   driven to it by deep and bottomless straits into which i am plunged and it seems to be an illusion to mariners in their distresses and dangers of being shipwrackt crying unto the lord what will any man perish and never pray for it die and never cry for it what and not say as peter did master save me or i perish what was it that did draw forth prayer in many of these distressed ship companies in this treatise mentioned but their dangers and distresses    god does not bring our deliverances and salvations until we be hopeless because he will exercise his peoples graces therefore the disciples were not saved until the ship was full that their graces might be exercised o now is a time for faith and patience to be exerted there is nothing more pleasing unto god than to see how poor souls exercise their graces when they are reduced to extremities god has a great revenue of glory arising to himself out of the exercise of his own grace in the souls of believers o how does faith act its part when mercy and deliverance is delayed it was one of luthers wonders to believe for mercy that was long delayed it is an high exercise of faith to look up to god long together and nothing to come to say with the prophet jonah i will look again toward thy holy temple jonah      and with the prophet isaiah though he hide his face from the house of jacob i will wait upon him and look for him isaiah    what though thou be as the prophets servant who went down to the sea to look and he said master there is nothing but what then does he give over o no the looks again and the seventh look he saw he cloud so faith in its exercise will look again and again and never give over until it epsy the mercy coming upon the wings of prayer so might i add of patience o how does it act its part while the deliverance tarries it quietly waits for the salvation of god saying as david my soul waits for the lord more than they that watch for the morning psalm   0  the soul of the believer possesses it self in patience until the mercy come    god does not bring our salvations and deliverances until we be brought to an extremity because they are most prized and welcomed then o now deliverance will be prized the longer that a mercy tarries the more welcome it is when it comes god loves to make all his mercies welcome to us o how welcome is life to a person under a sentence of death o how welcome is a discovery of the love of christ to a poor soul that has long groaned under the burden of unpardoned guilt o how welcome was the prodigals fathers house when he had so long been starving in the fields with his husks amongst the swine    because god will have all his salvations and deliverances look like his own hand and arm his arm brings salvation with him he will have the print of his own hand upon it that poor sinners may say this is the finger of god the doing of god and it is mavelous in our eyes alas men would attribute it to themselves if salvation did not come in such a way when all hope of being saved is taken away oh every thing is beautiful in its season is not salvation and deliverance now in season now they begin to despair as to probable or visible hopes o now god works like himself now he appears in a deliverance to be god which set the disciples a wondering what manner of man is this that the winds and the sea obey him mark     and at another time when he delivered his disciples at sea and calmed the winds then they that were in the ship worshipped him saying of a truth thou art the son of god            because he will by such salvations set off his love to poor souls was not the love of christ set off highly in taking that season to save the ship when it was full to save them when they were sinking is not that great love that steps forth to save in an extremity o what love was this to save this ships company when all hope of being saved was taken away love always chooses the fittest times to appear and evidence it self  lastly because he will have his deliverances endearing deliverances to souls o how does such an appearance of god at such a time endear the soul of the receiver therefore says david i will love the lord or love the lord dearly my rock and my deliverer etc  but i will proceed to give you also ataste of the application and not to be large because i have been large upon the former which was mainly intended    then learn we hence that god may for gracious ends known to himself delay a mercy or a deliverance and yet fully intend to give in that mercy jacob may wrestle all night and yet be put off but in the break of day the mercy comes the woman of canaan may cry to christ for her daughter and at present be put off yet at last she shall carry it the believing soul may not have the dove come with an olive branch in her mouth until evening christs manifesting of his love to poor souls is called his supping with them and i will sup with you now supper comes not up till evening    learn we hence that gods timing our deliverances and salvations is best for us his time is the best time our time is always ready but says christ my time is not yet if we had our mercies in our time we should not see that beauty in them for every thing is beautiful in its season and god chooses the fittest seasons to send them because he will put a beauty upon them    learn we hence that no case is desperate to god though it be so to man one would have thought this a desperate case in such a storm lightning the ship the casting cut of the tackling of the ship neither sun nor stars appeared and all hope of being saved taken away yet all this was but desperate to them it was not so to god now their extremity becomes gods opportunity and he takes this juncture of time to appear in thus david psalm        all gods waves and gods billows had gone over him a desperate case yet god then he believes would command his loving kindness in the daytime and the song should be with him in the night faith is an excellent grace at a desperate stand    learn we hence that gods thoughts are not as our thoughts when  think of nothing but sinking and perishing then does god think of saving and delivering they thought all hope of being saved was taken away but god looks through the storm and cloud and comforts them as the disciples when they thought it had been a spirit in their storm that appeared to them no says christ be not afraid be of good cheer it is i mark    0        use   is it so that the salvations and deliverances that many of us have are not until we are brought to extremities then it is a word of exhortation then look up to god in the most desperate case when you know not what to do in your storms at sea in your straits at land o then let your eyes be up unto the lord you see how many deliverances have come down in extremities as answers to prayer o pray hard let going to sea being in storms at sea being brought to extremities at sea learn you to pray  finis prayers to be used by seafaringmen the mariners prayer o god the great creator of heaven and earth thou do whatsoever thou please in the sea and in all deep places i the most unworthiest of all thy servants am at this time called upon to behold thy wonders in the deep and to perform my duty in great waters guide me i beseech thee in all times and in all places be thou our skilful pilot to steer us and protect us from all dangers and rebuke the winds and the seas when they molest us preserve our vessel from being rent by the loud cracks of thunder or from being burnt by lightning or any other accident keep us and save us from tempestuous weather from bitter frosts hail ice snow or whirlwinds and from captivity and slavery  teach me o god to remember thee my creator in the days of my youth to continually think upon thee and to praise thy name for all thy mercies bless all our friends i beseech thee that are on land and let their prayers for us be acceptable in thy sight and grant that our next meeting together may be for the better and not for the worse even to the praising and magnifying of thy holy name and salvation of our own souls in the great day of the lord jesus to whom with thee and thy blessed spirit be ascribed all honor power and glory adoration and subjection now and for evermore amen  a prayer before a voyage oeteranl god even the god of our salvation the hope of all the ends of the earth and of them that remain in the wide ocean under the shadow of whose wings we are always secure and without whose protection we cannot expect safety i have been o lord preserved by thee until this moment from many dangers for which i have not expressed my thankfulness in acknowledging those daily blessings i have received from thee but o lord forget and forgive those manifold sins which i have committed against thee and blot them out of thy book of remembrance  purge me o lord i beseech thee from all vile affections and grant i may bring forth the fruits of thy spirit go along with me with thy blessed spirit in this my voyage preserve me from pirates robers and enemies defend me from rocks sands and shelves and keep me from thunder and lightning storms and tempestous werther or any other danger that may dismay me to thee o lord i commend my body and spirit to dispose of me according to thy holy will and pleasure if thou art pleased to call for my life upon the surface of the waters i know thy almighty word can command the sea to give up her dead at the last and great audit  but if thou have determined to bring me safe to my desired heaven give me thy grace which is sufficient for me to walk according to thy holy will in all things make me to lay hold of eternal life which as the anchor of hope is both sure and steadfast keep me from all temptations ghostly and bodily and from sudden death and in thy good time bring me to the land of the living there to reign with thee for evermore amen  a thanksgiving after a voyage oimmortal god i have seen thy works o lord and thy wonders in the deep thou spakest the word and the stormy wind arose which lifted up the waves thereof but when we cried unto thee thou made the storm to cease so that the waves thereof were still then did we rejoice because we were at rest and thou broughtest us safe to that haven where we would be o that men would therefore praise thee o lord for thy goodness and declare the wonders thou do continually for them  i bless thy holy name for conducting me through those many dangers which encompassed me and praise thy thy mercy that the deep has not swallowed me up and that i am not gone down into the place of silence i also praise thy holy name and admire thy loving kindness toward me that thou have not delivered up my body and goods s a prey into the hands of unrea ole men but have brought me to my desied haven and at last returned me back in safety to my habitation  o let me never forget to pay those vows i made to thee when i was in trouble but give me an awful sense and apprehension of thy great power and possess my soul with a true reverence of thy divine majesty that i may evermore serve thee in holiness and righteousness all the days of my life endue me with thy holy spirit that i may become acceptable in thy sight and may be fitted at length for future glories this i beg for thy son jesus christ sake my only savior amen  a prayer in a storm o lord our god thou have commanded us in the day of calamity to call upon thy name and thou have promised to hear us lord i fly unto thee who art a sure refuge thy floodgates are opened and the floods lift up their lofty waves but thou o lord most high art mightier than the noise of many waters yea than the mighty waves of the sea thou can in a moment if it stand with thy divine will and pleasure rebuke the winds and the sea and turn this storm into a calm  i know i justly deserve to be cast away and utterly to be rejected by thee but lord save us or else we perish accept of my unfeigned sorrow for all my sins and transgressons and endue me with a steadfast resolution to forsake them be merciful unto us o god be merciful unto us and save us from perishing in these deep waters o refresh us with thy mercy and that soon lest we go down ito the place of silence o comfort us in this great distress that though the sea rage and swell our hearts may be quiet and still in this time of our disconsolation  and as i earnestly desire to be protected from this great peril and danger which now terrifies us so i earnestly beseech thee that thou will for ever fill my heart with such an awful dread of thy name and praise thy power in the great congregation awake my dull and drowsy soul from the sloth of sin and renew a right spirit within me fill me with the gifts of graces of thy holy spirit that i may live the life of the righteous and never forget thy lovingkindness save us now from death i beseech thee from the merciless waves who are now ready to swallow us up and bring us home in safety for thy son jesus christ his sake our only lord and savior amen  a thanksgiving after a storm i praise and glorify thy holy name o lord for all thy mercies and blessings vouchsafed unto me especially for this thy last great deliverance wherein i was encompassed in that wide ocean whom thou have set bounds and limits to if thou o lord had not been on my side the sea had swallowed me up quick and i had gone down into the deep silence but thou have been my god and my deliverer and have put a new song into my mouth a song of praise and thanksgiving unto my god  i acknowledge o lord that thou art the god of all the earth and of them that remain in the broad sea blessed for ever and magnified thy name that thou have not cast me out of thy sight nor turned thy mercy from me i have escaped the raging sea and the noise of the proud waves have done me no harm if thy almighty providence had not protected me streams had gone over my soul but the stormy wind and tmpest i have narrowly escaped the storm is ceased and i am safely delivered  and now what shall i render to thee o lord for this and all other thy great benefits i will offer up unto thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will pay my vows i so solemnly made unto thee when i was in trouble i will evermore remember that my help is in the lord who made heaven and earth and that thou art that god that can and will deliver me let this thy mercy and loving kindness never depart my memory but let me praise thy goodness and sing of thy power unto my lives end amen  an hymn of praise and thanksgiving after a dangerous tempest o come let us give thanks unto the lord for his mercy endures for ever  great is the lord and greatly to be praised let the redeemed of the lord say so whom he has delivered from the merciless rage of the sea  the lord is gracious and full of compassion flow to anger and of great mercy  he has not dealt with us according to our sins neither rewarded us according to our iniquitirs  but as the heaven his above the earth so great has been his mercy toward us  we found trouble and heaviness we were even at deaths door  the waters of the sea had well nigh covered us the proud waters had nigh gone over our soul  the sea roared and the stormy wind lifted the waves thereof  we were carried up as it were to heaven and went down again into the deep our soul melted within us because of trouble  then cried we unto the lord and thou did deliver us out of our distress  blessed be thy name who did not despise the prayer of thy servants but did hear our cry and have saved us  thou did send forth thy commandment and the windy storm ceased and was turned into a calm  o let us therefore praise the lord for his goodness and declare the wonders that he has done and still does for the children of men  praised be the lord daily even the lord that helped us and poured his benefits upon us  he is our god even the god of whom comes salvation god is the lord by whom we escaped death  thou lord have made us glad through the operation of thy hands and we will triumph in thy praise  blessed be the lord god even the lord god who only does wondrous things  and blessed be the name of his ma for ever and let every one of us say amen amen  glory be to the father and to the son and to the holy ghost  as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be world without end amen  a prayer to be said before a fight at sea against any enemy o most powerful and glorious lord god the lord of hosts that rulest and command all things thou sit in the throne judging right and therefore we make our address to thy divine majesty in this our necessity that thou would take the cause into thy own hand and judge between us and our enemies stir up thy strength o lord and come and help us for thou give not always the battle to the strong but can save by many or by few o let not our sins now cry against us for vengeance but hear us thy poor servants beging mercy and imploring thy help and that thou would be a defense unto us against the face of the enemy make it appear that thou art our savior and mighty deliverer through jesus christ our lord amen  finis
