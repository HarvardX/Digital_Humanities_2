the school for rakes a comedy  as it is performed at the theater royal in drury lane  london  printed for t becket and p a de hondt in the strand mdcclxix  price one shilling and six pence  to david garrick esquire dedications are generally meant to to do honor to the patron by revealing their private virtues or recording their public merits but neither of these subjects occasioned the present address for while the undivided applause of a nation proclaims the latter my small plaudit must be lost in the general voice and while the friendship and esteem of so many of the first personages of the age are at once the strongest testimony and most pleasing reward of the former my simple concurrence must be deemed superfluous  to neither of these motives then is to be attributed my publicly placing this play under your patronage but to a desire of acknowledging my gratitude for the great trouble you have taken with it and of indulging a much higher vanity than that of being its author by declaring to the world that you are my friend and that i am  sir your much obliged and most humble servant the author  advertisement the hint of this comedy was taken from a much admired performance of monsieur beaumarchais styled eugenie which mr garrick was so kind to put into my hands some time ago i was immediately struck with the elegant simplicity of language and sentiment which characterizes that work and which indeed should do the same in all dramatic writings where neither the persons or situations of the drama are elevated above the common degrees of life  i immediately adopted the plan and set about adapting it to the english stage but as i proceeded in this work i found i had great difficulties to encounter for though mons beaumarchais had laid the scene of his play in england he had unluckily adopted spanish manners this circumstance appeared an unsurmountable obslacle to me and i should have immediately relinquished all hopes from my project if mr garrick had not in the most friendly manner lent me his assistance to overcome this otherwise insuperable difficulty  how far i have succeeded in rendering this piece worthy of the english stage must be left to the candor of the public i shall only add that the characters of frampton willis loyd i may add mrs winifred also are of english growth the character of lord eustace too has received some additions and i hope that his compunction for the crime he had committed will render him more worthy the favor of a british audience whose generous natures cannot brook the representation of any vice upon the stage except in order to have it punished or reclaimed as the situation of harriet would not admit of any change i have not attempted to deviate from the gentle and interesting eugenie of monsieur beaumarchais  i had written thus far before i could have been informed of the very kind and favorable reception with which the public have honored this piece and i think myself extremely happy at having this opportunity of assuring them that i shall ever retain the most grateful sense of their indulgence to me  i am particularly bound to mrs clive on this occasion who undertook the study of a new part at a time when she had determined to quit the stage and whose kindness to the author and attention to the public made her hazard her health by performing it  i need not say how well  when her physicians would have confined her to her chamber  i acknowledge myself also much obliged to the rest of the performers in my play for having acquitted themselves so much to the advantage of the piece and the approbation of the public to whom i have the honor to be  a much obliged and most obedient servant the author  prologue written by a friend spoken by mr king  the scribbling gentry ever frank and free to sweep the stage with prologues fix on me a female representative i come and with a prologue which i call a broom to brush the critic cobwebs from the room critics like spiders into corners

mrs winifred mrs clive harriet mrs baddeley betty servant to harriet mrs smith the school for rakes act i scene an apartment in lord eustace s house enter mr frampton and willis fram well willis they are come   will yes sir but i am quite of opinion they will soon be gone again at least out of this house for as i assisted in carrying in their trunks and bandboxes merely to contemplate their countenances i could perceive the strongest marks of dissatisfaction in sir williams face and when the servants retired from the parlour i overheard him and his sister winifred in high disputation  both their welsh bloods were up and a fine splutter there was between them but though you might have heard them into hydepark they spoke so quick that i could only pick up an odd word here and there as if sir william did not like this part of the town   fram i wish they had staid in the country with all my heart   will i believe there are more people of that mind than you sir i fancy my lord would give a good round sum that they had remained fixed to the freehold at langwillan  though to be sure miss harriet is by many degrees the handsomest girl that ever his lordship was fond of   fram you must not willis talk of her in that style  she is a young woman both of character and family   will so much the better for her sir if she has a good family of her own for i am pretty sure she never will belong to ours   fram i must again desire you mr willis not to speak so lightly of this affair  the real friends of your lord will not be much inclined to mirth or ridicule upon this occasion i can tell you   will as we were both placed here by my lord to manage this matter for him i thought there could be no great harm to argue a little upon it mr frampton   fram i am not at present in a humor for conversation   will o sir another time will do as well   fram i would have you go immediately and acquaint lord eustace with their arrival  let him also know that i shall wait upon the ladies and make his apology for not being here to receive them   will you have been very obliging to his lordship upon many such occasions mr frampton but i fancy he never stood more in need of your assistance and mine too than he does at present   fram though in the same cause i believe our services will tend to different purposes  i shall not flatter his vices   will lord mr frampton you are grown so prudish of late   fram you are grown too familiar mr willis  you will oblige me and obey your lords commands at the same time by going directly with the message i desired you   will i did not mean to offend you sir by observing how useful your friendship has been to my lord  has your honor any farther commands   fram none but those i gave you   will aside here is more to do with these shabby ruined hangerson of my lords than all the family beside  i think myself as good a man as he and if he had not a little too much spirit for me i would tell him as much  exit grumbling fram to what a state have i reduced myself when even such a wretch as that dares to upbraid me what now remains of all the scenes of mirth and revelry which i have been partaker of beneath this roof a ruined fortune a disturbed mind and a broken constitution are the only mementos that are now left me  yet i think i have fortitude sufficient to bear all these  but to be obliged to minister to another mans vices for a wretched subsistence is to degrade human nature below the brutes  thank heaven however i have escaped being concerned in this iniquitous affair and though my friendship for lord eustace will not suffer me to desert him in his present difficulties i am determined to proceed no farther than is consistent with my honor and my peace  i have consented to see the lady and excuse his absence  i must wait for sir williams going out and then hasten to fulfill my promise  exit scene changes to another apartment  sir william mrs winifred  harriet in traveling dresses  trunks  bags etc betty attending sir wm i tell you again and again sister wini i am not satisfied   mrs win as to that matter brother you know you never are satisfied with what any person does  yourself i shall therefore make myself perfectly eay on that head   sir wm that is more than i shall be while i am n this house i can tell you  i have very solid objections to staying here  a young idle rakish lord    mrs win what a vulgar objection i declare sir william if i were not acquainted with your ancestry i should suspect you to be descended from mechanics but i hope the family of ap evans is known to be quite as ancient as    sir wm adam at least sister  but let me now inform you that lord eustace is placed in a much higher rank than any of your boasted ancestors have ever been and that i hate obligations to persons above me for the only satisfaction i ever felt in receiving favors arose from the prospect of repaying them   mrs win pride absolute pride brother   sir wm it is an honest one at least you must allow that inclines persons to discharge their debts of honor as well as of law   mrs win pray sir william give me leave to ask you where is the mighty matter of interchanging civilities between persons of a certain rank  lord eustace spent some months at your house in the country    sir wm not by my invitation sister but yours  you know i was at my estate in devonshire the greatest part of the time he spent at langwillan  i have therefore neither right nor inclination to accept of his house  besides it is extremely inconvenient to me as i have so much business to transact in lincolns inn   mrs win you should have written to your broker then to provide you apartments in some of the stoves on the other side temple bar sir william  but as to my niece and me we dont choose to be suffocated i must inform you   sir wm why this place as you say is airy enough  when i was last in london about twelve years ago there was not a house within a mile of it  but all the fools in the nation have now crowded up to the capital and made the head too large for the body and this very place where i used to send my horses to graze begins now to look something like a street   mrs win like a street sir william   sir wm let us have done with wrangling sister i give it up  this air may be better for my girl  i shall stay here therefore for the short time i remain in town though i dont like it  you are content i hope  but what says my harriet why so grave i expected to have seen you as blithe as one of the kids upon our mountains at your arrival in london   har i find myself a little fatigued sir   sir wm you were all life and spirit during our journey  the bad air of this town cannot have affected you already child but tell me how you like this house   har i think it very retired sir   mrs win why really miss harriet i dont believe my lord intended following business or opening shop when he took it but surely for persons of distinction it is the very spot one would desire i am astonished at your want of taste child  sir william i know loves noise  i think there is nothing else left to wish for here   har aside except the owner of the mansion   betty pray madam which is to be my young ladys appartment   mrs win that upon the right hand child  you had better go with her harriet and adjust your dress  o betty bid em look in the coach for my snuff box they will find it on the seat or in the pockets exit harriet and betty dont you think you shall be full late for your lawyers sir william   sir wm yes as i have so far to go to them  who is there  enter betty with the snuff box betty here is the box madam  gives it to her and exit enter robert send david for a hackneycoach  take this key and bring me a parcel of papers which you will find tied up in my strong box robert   rob yes sir  exit robert mrs win i hope sir william you have your address written upon your cards and that you have ordered your letters to be directed to lord eustaces house as his lordship honors me with his friendship i think it necessary that our acquaintance should be informed of his great politeness   sir wm aside his lordship honors me with his friendship  how well the traffic is kept up in that phrase between vanity and vanity i had ordered my letters to serles coffeehouse but since it is determined that i must stay here i shall direct them to be sent to me   mrs win i must beg sir william that you will order all the newspapers and magazines to be sent here also my mental faculties are quite at a stand  i have not had the least political information these four days  enter robert rob here are the papers sir   mrs win are they of this day robert   sir wm they are of much older date sister and will not i fancy afford you much entertainment  get me my hat and cane do you know robert where captain lloyd lodges   rob in cravenstreet sir they told me at trevallin   sir wm direct the coachman there  exit robert mrs win for heavens sake sir william what do you loiter for it will be monstrous late before you can return  you will not be back by dinner   sir wm you seem so very impatient for my setting out sister that i cannot imagine you should be very anxious for my coming back again i shall go first to captain lloyds   mrs win you are doubtless at liberty to go where you please sir william  but i hope you will not think of incumbering us with his visits here   sir wm you amaze me  not receive the uncle of the man who is to marry my daughter   mrs win that may be sooner said than done i fancy sir william   sir wm you are mistaken  i never yet have falsified my promise   mrs win a pretty alliance truly for my niece and your daughter but let me tell you sir if harriet had not a shilling her family and her beauty would entitle her to a much better match than your colonel who has nothing but an old tottering castle a scarlet coat and a sword to settle by way of jointure   sir wm your absurdity distracts me what has your family and beauty done for you and i dare say you once rated them as high as you do harriets   mrs win you will pardon me brother i understand genealogy better than so  though there is not a very great difference between my nieces years and mine she has one generation more in her table than i which let me tell you is of no small consequence to those who know how to set a proper value upon family   sir wm family nonsense let those who have no other merit to support them build on that but know that i despise it and to make an end of this ridiculous altercation for ever i shall inform you that eight years ago when harriet was but a child and the colonel was sent young abroad to serve his country i liked him so well that i promised his father if the young fellow returned with life and honor my daughter should be his   mrs win i have ever disapproved of that method of affiancing young persons  have you no idea that it is possible the colonel may dislike your daughter   sir wm i am not very apprehensive on that account   mrs win have you no fears of her refusing him   sir wm none  bred up in retirement and innocence she can have formed no attachment and her obedience to a fond father will certainly incline her to dispose of both her hand and heart where his prudence shall direct  enter robert rob sir the coach is ready   sir wm looking at his watch it is later than i thought it was  why i shall not be back to dinner  i shall go nowhere but to the captains if i dont meet with him i shall return directly put up these papers robert  exit sir william mrs win desire miss evans to come to me and pray good robert send out for the last gazette directly there may be a thousand treaties on foot that i am ignorant of exit robert what an absurd man is my brother his ideas are dreadfully confined  his daughters hand and heart will follow her obedience thank heaven they are not now to be disposed of  enter harriet what not begun to dress niece   har my spirits are too much agitated madam to think of dress   mrs win for heavens sake child dont talk in this doleful strain to me  i can easily conceive that your fathers presence may distress you as he is so totally ignorant of your good fortune  but with me it appears ridiculous   har i am indeed madam infinitely distressed by my fathers ignorance of my situation   mrs win what a fuss is here about your father you know he would never have given his consent to your marrying lord eustace if he had been asked  he hates men of quality and as my lord is not yet in possession of his fortune i doubt if he would even have thought it a good match   har i wish he were acquainted with it be it good or bad   mrs win i tell you child i lost two excellent matches myself by waiting for advice and by that means giving time to the parties to consider of it so it came to nothing  but i now tell you that by my prudence your good fortune does not admit of a doubt   har would to heaven it did not   mrs win you are the very counterpart of your father never content with any thing  are you not entitled to supporters and coronets upon your coach and when the evanss arms are quartered with my lords and well emblazoned there will not be so handsome an equipage in london   har yet the possessor may be wretched madam   mrs win wretched and a countess i think that scarce possible but what is it you would have child have i not with the greatest address imaginable managed matters with my headstrong brother and triumphed over his obstinacy are you not at this instant lodged in your husbands house   har what is his house while he is absent from it i hoped to have met him here  my letters must have informed him    mrs win perhaps his and your father my lord delville harriet may have claimed his lordships attendance it is only people of no consequence who are masters of themselves and therefore pretend to dignify their insignificance with the title of independence but persons of quality my dear never presume to rebel against the laws of subordination  but this is a political secret which you are yet ignorant of child   har he appeared to be perfect master of his own time when we were first acquainted nor did his engagements seem to interfere with his inclinations till after you had commanded me to receive his hand   mrs win till after i commanded you really miss evans any person who was to hear you talk in this manner might suppose that i had compelled you to marry lord eustace but perhaps miss you had rather have been sacrificed to your fathers ridiculous attachment to colonel loyd and been buried alive in the old castle of trevallin   har notwithstanding all your attention to my happiness madam if my lord no longer loves me i must be miserable   mrs win can he hinder your being a countess simpleton but prithee what can have put all these melancholy thoughts into your head did ever any man appear to be more in love than he   har o no he was all tenderness he wept at our parting i wept too yet found a pleasing softness in that grief he seemed to share  what a change   mrs win revolutions are common in all states child and if you understood politics you would not be so much surprised at them  enter robert rob mr frampton madam desires to see my young lady   har mr frampton i dont know such a person do you know him robert   rob i know nothing more of him madam than that he lives in this house and has a fine man to attend him there are a power of people coming and going but i cannot tell who they be   mrs win aside to harriet he must certainly be a friend or relation of your lords  i think we had better step into the parlour to receive him lest your fathers return should interrupt us we will see the gentleman below robert and wait on him directly  exeunt scene changes to a garden parlour enter mr frampton fram i feel myself extremely shocked at this affair both for lord eustace and the unhappy girl  it is an infamous business and i am certain it must turn out ill  enter robert rob the ladies will wait upon you immediately sir  exit robert fram would the interview were over  if she is but half so amiable as lord eustace has described her i fear i shall acquit myself but indifferently of his commission  beauty that makes most men knaves makes me honest for i hold it the lowest baseness to be capable of admiring and betraying an innocent creature in the same moment  enter mrs winifred and harriet fram i come madam from lord eustace to your ladyship    mrs win by acosting my niece in that manner sir i suppose you are one of his lordships particular friends but pray be more guarded sir and do not call my niece ladyship  that time is not yet come   fram i stand corrected madam   har how does lord eustace sir i hope he is well   fram perfectly so madam though extremely concerned at having it not in his power to receive your ladyship    mrs win again sir   fram  the moment of your arrival  but his attendance on his father who is at present ill in berkshire prevented him that happiness   mrs win aye i knew it  did not i tell you so miss harriet   har pray sir when may we expect to see lord eustace i hope his fathers illness is not dangerous   fram no madam i hope not though old mens lives are certainly precarious i am sure your lord will leave him the first moment it is possible as i well know he burns with impatience to throw himself at your feet   mrs win i hope your mind is easy now child  she may be a countess sooner than i thought for and if my lord can get into the ministry i may be of some consequence to my friends  aside har i am much obliged to you sir for the trouble you have taken  i by no means wish that lord eustace should neglect his duty to lord delville or distress himself in any other way on my account though i sincerely desire the happiness of seeing him   fram his inclinations madam i am satisfied more than keep pace with yours and you may with great probability expect to see his lordship either today or tomorrow morning   mrs win you alarm me vastly sir i would not have his lordship catch us in this deshabille for any consideration i beg child you will go to your toilet  bless me what figures we are   har i shall attend you madam you have made me very happy sir  but do you think that he will come to night   fram i fear it is not in his power madam   har come when he will i shall rejoice to see him   mrs win pray niece come away now sir your humble servant  you dont know but his lordship may be here in a few minutes  to harriet exit mrs win and har fram i never lied with a worse grace  by heaven that girl is an angel and lord eustace of course a devil what a delicate sensibility in her countenance what softness in her voice the man who could first injure and then forsake such a woman deserves to be marked as the most infamous because he must be the most cruel of his sex  i have some consolation in thinking that lord eustace though ten years younger is ten times a greater   enter lord eustace behind ld eust  what what frampton  i will lay ten thousand pounds that is impossible though you did not finish the sentence  do you think i should lose frampton   fram i certainly do my lord though you were to determine the bet yourself but this is no time for fooling i am astonished at your imprudence  i thought you had determined not to come this night what can have changed your purpose   ld eust have you seen harriet frampton and can you ask that question my mind restless distracted and impatient has impelled me hither  but tell me have you seen her   fram i have seen lady eustace   ld eust you startle me dont talk so loud  are you sure that no one can overhear us   fram not a creature  sir william is gone abroad and the ladies are retired to dress   ld eust what said harriet to my absence   fram the tears which seemed to have dimned her lovely eyes reproached you silently but not an angry word escaped her lips   ld eust do not add to my distress frampton by heaven my heart bleeds for the unhappy harriet had i like you been born a private man and not at once bound down by the vile tramels of family and dependence the world should not have bribed me to forsake her   fram the sense you now seem to have of your own situation should have operated sooner my lord and prevented your involving an innocent young woman in certain ruin   ld eust no frampton no that was beyond my power i loved her to distraction  nay i do love her still  but let us talk no more upon this subject it softens me into weakness and as i am dependent on my father i must obey him  i hope she has not heard of my intended marriage   fram no no the devil is too great a gainer by your schemes to blast them   ld eust dont you think it is rather too late in the day for you to turn methodist ned   fram it is never too late my lord for a man to condemn and forsake his follies and young as you are i heartily wish this was the time appointed for your doing so likewise   ld eust these sentiments have at least the grace of novelty to recommend them from you mr frampton   fram my sentiments my lord are of little consequence to you but the time draws near when you must justly suffer in the opinion of one who ought to be dear to you miss evans cannot be much longer deceived  and when i reflect upon the vile artifices that were used to draw her into a feigned marriage by heaven i cannot help detesting you and every one of the infernal agents who were any way concerned in it   ld eust o frampton my heart tells me that i deserve your detestation  why why were you not with me to save me from the sad effects of my wild youthful passions  the wretches who were near me but inflamed them   fram the attachments of mean persons are always founded in selfinterest my lord nor was there ever yet a solid friendship formed in vice   ld eust dont upbraid me with my miseries frampton but think what a situation is mine though i feel the errors of my conduct and would repair them i am so much involved in my own toils that i find it impossible to break them  what would i not give even to postpone this fatal marriage   fram postpone it aye for ever   ld eust could i do that i might yet be happy frampton but matters are gone too far  every thing was settled between my father and lady annes guardians before i came to town and i am certain he never will be brought to relinquish the great advantage of her immense fottune   fram and can you my lord be brought to consider those advantages as an equivalent for your peace and honor   ld eust what would you have me do   fram avow your situation to lord delville   ld eust were it a common folly i had committed frampton i might hope for his forgiveness but the infamy which must deservedly attend my conduct in this affair would probably make him cast me from his heart and fortune for ever   fram you are certainly in very difficult circumstances my lord nor can i discover any means of extricating you from them   ld eust the only miserable hope i have now left is founded on the gentleness of harriets nature which may enable me to prevail on her to return into the country before she hears of my intended marriage   fram it is rather shameful my lord to erect a sanctuary for our vices upon the virtues of others   ld eust i acknowledge it frampton but were harriet removed from the probability of hearing of this hateful marriage my mind would be more at ease and i might then possibly think of some expedient to break it off   fram there is some merit in that thought my lord and now let me know how i can serve you   ld eust you shall hear  that villain langwood my fathers steward who persuaded me into this sham marriage and personated the clergyman on that occasion is now dying and writes me word that he is distracted with the horrors of his conscience and is determined to ask the young ladys forgiveness  a letter from him to the family would discover all   fram that would indeed be fatal but how can i prevent it   ld eust you must remain in this house and take care that my servants prevent their receiving any letters without bringing them first to you i will order willis to intercept them   fram he is fit for the office but this is a very odious affair my lord however i have promised to assist you and if i can prevail upon myself i will go so far as to prevent langwoods hastening the catastrophe which i much fear will be a sad one   ld eust you know not how you torture me but let me now indulge my fond impatience and see my lovely harriet   fram you must not think of it i would advise you to retire directly   ld eust it is impossible i should obey you i long yet dread to see her frampton   fram it will require a good deal of courage my lord to support the interview for i really think that an injured innocent woman is a very formidable object  but though you may be brave enough for the encounter i must prevent it for the present as i have but just now apologized for your absence by telling her you were in berkshire with your father and the inconsistency of your immediate appearance might justly alarm her  i would therefore have you withdraw immediately lest any of the family should see you   ld eust you have a right to direct me and at your desire i will defer my visit for a little time but i can have no rest till i behold her   fram i dont fancy your meeting will contribute much to the quiet of your mind   ld eust i do not hope it should  but never yet was that mind so distressed since it had first the power of thinking   fram peace and guilt seldom cohabit my lord   ld eust true frampton true  and if young men like myself would but calculate the pains and difficulties which are the natural consequences of vice and how much they overbalance its transitory joys they would be shocked at a traffic where certain loss must be the reward of their industry   fram the being sensible of our errors is the first step to amendment for no man ever sets seriously about getting out of debt till he is thoroughly apprized of the vast sum he owes  but come my lord let us retire immediately i hear some of the family in motion  this way quickly  exeunt end of the first act act ii scene a drawing room in lord eustace s house enter lord eustace ld eust i feel the force of framptons sentiments and tremble at the thoughts of seeing harriet and yet i cannot deny myself this last indulgence if my father were acquainted with my distress perhaps  o no i must not think of that  cursed ambition  detested pride of family  that makes us sink the man to aggrandize the peer  enter robert rob the ladies will wait on your lordship immediately  exit ld eust i am glad the aunt comes with her  her folly and impertinence will help to interrupt what i most dread my harriets tenderness and sensibility she comes  i feel her superiority and shrink to nothing  enter miss harriet she runs a few steps toward lord eustace then stops suddenly in confusion ld eust my harriets first motion was surely natural why then does she restrain the feelings of her heart have i been so unfortunate as to deserve this coldness  enter mrs winifred ld eust i hope madam to mrs winifred you will be so good as to excuse my absence at the time of your arrival and that you have found every thing in this house agreeable and convenient to you   mrs win ceremony my lord is quite unnecessary among persons of rank and breeding especially where they have the honor of being so closely allied to your lordship and i have great reason to believe that every thing in your house is like your lordship perfectly complete   ld eust you are very polite madam and if my harriet knew what i had suffered    har  i might then have been more concerned than i am at present and that my lord is needless   mrs win i hoped we should have had an end of your sighs and your tears when you saw lord eustace  i declare child you are a perfect niobe  one would imagine that you were the most unhappy creature in the world   ld eust you alarm me extremely madam  speak my love and tell me what affects you   har your lordship may remember with what great reluctance i consented to a private marriage   ld eust my harriets scruples cost me too many sighs ever to forget them   har yet your too powerful persuasions conquered them and while you remained in wales your presence silenced my reflections nor suffered even a painful thought to intrude into that heart which was engrossed by you what a delirium   ld eust may it last for ever   har it fled with you my lord  left to myself the offense i had committed against an absent father  the clandestine air which accompanied the awful ceremony    mrs win pray niece could that be avoided   har  the painful necessity of your absence    ld eust let me i entreat you flatter myself that my presence now may be sufficient to remove the anxiety my absence caused  what would i not do to make my harriet happy command me task my power    har i would entreat but not command my lord   ld eust then name the soft request and think it granted   har since you permit i wish you to employ that dear pursuasive art which you possess so amply to reconcile my father to our marriage   ld eust my dearest harriet    har you madam sure will join us and assist in bringing about an event which cannot longer be deferred without injury to your honor and my peace   mrs win i am his lordships guarantee that this treaty shall be kept secret harriet and i shall preserve my promise as inviolably as if the peace of europe were concerned and to avoid the least infringement of the articlcs i will prevent sir williams surprising you in this state of altercation and give you notice of the enemys approach  exit har if ever i was dear to you my lord this is the time to prove it remove the veil of mystery which i blush to wear and give that love which is my highest boast a sanction to the world   ld eust never was man so embarrassd  aside i will obey my harriet though in opposition to my own judgment which had determined me not to reveal the important secret to sir william till our return into the country lest the warmth of his resentment for what he will style an act of disobedience might tempt him to discover our marriage to my father   har must it be ever kept a secret then and must we always live thus separated   ld eust by no means  i can make a pretense to my father of joining my regiment and then can i retrace those paths that brought me first to langwillan and the moment i arrive there sir william shall be made acquainted with my happiness   har do you mean to come there soon my lord   ld eust i should have been there in a few days if you had not come to town   har why did you not tell me so the least hint of your design would have prevented my coming to london   ld eust does my harriet think i would delay my own happiness by deferring an interview i so ardently desired even for an hour   har you can persuade me to any thing i acquiesce in your determination  there is but one thing more disturbs my mind but that is a trifle   ld eust it cannot be so in my estimation if it affects you  let me know it   har where there is much sensibility the heart is easily alarmed  it has appeared extraordinary to me that your lordship in any of your letters to me has never honored me with the title of your wife   ld eust and can my harriet blame me for such a caution meant to secure her happiness if my fortunes only were at stake i should now boast what i so much endeavor to conceal nor fear the consequence of lord delvilles resentment the miscarriage or interception of a letter signed your husband would precipitate the discovery of our marriage and ruin me with my father    har i would not have you suffer for my sake   ld eust it is only through you that i can suffer  had my fortune been independent i should at once have asked you of sir william  nay situated as i am i can forego all the advantages of wealth without regret and blessed with you only lament its loss for your dear sake  you weep my harriet let me kiss off those tears   har no let them flow my lord  joy has its tears as well as grief and these are tears of joy  embracing him ld eust my lovely softness  how severely she distresses me  aside har i will not trust this simple heart again and blush to think it was so easily alarmed  enter mrs winifred in a hurry mrs win softly softly here comes my brother  have done with your loveprate  what always a pouting harriet  enter sir william speaking to robert sir wm give the coachman half a crown  and do you hear robert let there be springs put to our coach  every one has them now  luxury luxury every alderman and apothecary skims over this newfangled pavement without so much as a jolt  one of these city sparks would be shook to death if he were to ride my bay bolton a fox chase   mrs win my brother is always his own herald and proclaims himself by the noise he makes  how detestably vulgar how unlike a man of fashion  here is lord eustace come to wait upon you sir william   sir wm i am glad to see your lordship you have been a good while absent from quarters  but you young men of quality can have leave of absence when you please i suppose and all you have to do is to appear handsomely on a field day or at a review it was not so in my time  but discipline of every kind is relaxed nowadays   ld eust i have been a truant sir william but i mean to make up for lost time and return immediately to my regiment and then look to your partridge   sir wm you shall be welcome to my manor my lord  how does my harriet i think you look pale dont you think her altered my lord   ld eust rather improved sir   sir wm she used to be remarkably lively but as girls grow up they affect gravity in order to appear women before their time  her brother and she are all i have left and when harriet is married    mrs win lord sir william are you entering into familymatters   sir wm well well we will not talk of that now but since we are upon the subject i think i ought to congratulate your lordship   ld eust it must be then sir william upon the happiness i at present enjoy in the company of these ladies   har what does my father mean  aside sir wm no no my lord i meant to give you joy of your approaching marriage    har surely my ears deceive me  aside ld eust you jest sir william   sir wm by no means i assure you  i have it from undoubted authority   mrs win ridiculous   sir wm i tell you sister that it is in one of todays papers  i know what i read sure    mrs win did it mention how things go in the mediterranean that is an article which concerns us more  we shall not have a port left us there soon    sir wm i speak only of domestic news and mind no other  the paragraph i saw ran thus  we hear there is certainly a treaty of marriage on foot between lord eustace and lady anne mountfort which will be concluded in a few days  and then a great deal more my lord about both your accomplishments which i have forgot   mrs win i never knew any thing come of a we hear yet  but i wish you had brought home the paper   ld eust ha ha ha  and is that your undoubted authority sir william why at this season of the year when occurrences are rare the news writers couple half the nobility in england to fill up their papers  but as there are no other papers filled up by the parties themselves  your marriages in print are not allowed good in law   mrs win how can you be so easily disconcerted child  aside to harriet sir wm i think it highly insolent in them my lord to take these liberties without authority as such reports may sometimes happen to be prejudicial to one party or the other   ld eust the freedom of the press sir william though sometimes injurious to individuals must never be restrained in this land of liberty it is the very magna charta of freedom   mrs win so it is my lord   ld eust however there have been some slight grounds for the report you mention   sir wm so i should imagine   ld eust lady annes large fortune was rather a desirable object to my father  he did therefore propose my paying my addresses to her but upon my declaring that love should be my first motive in an engagement of that nature and that my heart had never given me the least hint of her ladyship he had the goodness to sacrifice his project to my happiness the affair had been whispered in our family and even whispers have echoes sir william   sir wm your lordship has taken more pains than was necessary to explain this matter to us for though you should not marry lady anne it is to be supposed that you will soon marry a lady betty or a lady mary somebody  such an accomplished young nobleman will not be suffered to remain long single    mrs win lord sir william how can you talk so oddly there are many instances of persons who have lived single in spite of temptation and solicitation too and that to your certain knowledge i believe   sir wm you will pardon me sister i am really not acquainted with any of these coy these sensitive plants   mrs win you seem inclined to be witty brother and therefore i shall retire   ld eust i should oppose the severity of that resolution madam but that an engagement of business calls me away at this moment may i hope for your permission to wait upon you frequently while you stay in town   mrs win your lordships visits must always be considered by us both as an honor and an obligation   ld eust my sweet harriet  ladies your servant  i hope we shall often meet sir william bows to harriet nay no ceremony   sir wm your lordship must excuse me  exit ld eust and sir wm mrs win with what nice delicacy and honor has my nephew explained away this idle report but i am amazed how you could be affected with it child   har chide me as you please i own i deserve it for doubting the most amiable of men yet when my father hinted the subject i should have fainted if the tenderness of my lords looks even more than his words had not convinced me of his love and truth our fears are proportioned to our treasure you cannot therefore condemn my apprehensions without lessening his worth   mrs win that i shall never do persons of a certain rank in life are always worthy  but come child i am in a monstrous dilemma at present   har what is the matter   mrs win i want your assistance to calculate the distance from persia to america for i have great apprehensions that the sophy may join the czarina sail down the baltic together and strip us of all our settlements    har dear madam how can you trouble yourself with things so foreign either to your knowledge or interests   mrs win i beg your pardon why niece now that you are married to my satisfaction i know nothing in the domestic way worth being concerned for and ones affections you know child cannot lie idle  therefore i beg you will go immediately and search for salmons geography which i believe you will find in my trunk along with collinss peerage which are books i never travel without and which no person can pretend to keep company without being thoroughly conversant in  exeunt enter sir william and robert sir wm prithee robert was that man in the hall my lords valet de chamber of what use can he be to his master here   rob of a great deal i fancy sir there are numbers of people come here after his lord a fine lady just now wanted to gain admittance but mr willis had dacity enough to make her disbelieve her own senses and persuaded her that his master was down at bristol though she said her eyes saw him come into the house o these londoners are cunning folk   sir wm you told me of another person that lives here a gentleman i think    rob yes poor fellow i believe he may be an honest man because willis dont seem much to like him  but it is hard to say which is good or bad amongst them   sir wm aside there is something very mysterious in all this  i desire robert that you will have as little communication as possible with his lordships servants and that you will prevent the rest of my family from having any also   rob your honor need not fear  they are not kindly to any of us   sir wm i am glad of it  civility is the most dangerous mask of art aside my sisters folly in forcing us into this house can only be equaled by my own in submitting to come to it but i will get out of it as fast as i can i hope robert to finish my business in a few days and i shall not remain in london an hour after   rob your honor makes my heart glad   sir wm do you know where harriet is robert i left her here just now   rob i saw her go up stairs with madam winifred as we came hither sir i think with submission our young lady likes london as little as either your worship or myself she mopes mightily to be in the country again   sir wm she shall not mope long for that robert nor when she is there neither for i intend to settle her soon both to her happiness and my own by marrying her to colonel loyd immediately and when the wedding is over and i am once more sat down safe at langwillan i shall think all my troubles are at an end  i will go to harriet directly and talk the matter over with her   rob and i will go and write the good news to my friends in wales  exeunt scene mr framptons apartment enter mr frampton and willis fram to barricade the doors and deny admitance to their friends   will these were his lordships orders sir  willis says he with an arch look which i understand pretty tolerably you must be my cerberus and not suffer the devil himself to get through the keyhole for a few days but as soon as i am married and gone off to the country your care will be needless  yes says i to his lordship i will then make my escape out of the gulf leave the doors open for all the devils to enter and pursue your lordship to the elysian fields   fram you are very poetical mr willis  but i fancy his lordship is rather over cautious and that you will have no great employment for your extraordinary talents for i dont think the family have any acquaintance in london   will more is the pity for the girl is devilish handsome it would be a good deed to bring her a little into life  i should like to have the introducing her   fram stop your licentious tongue  i have already told you that this is no common affair  she is a young lady of unblemished character   will this the old story mr frampton i never knew a woman in my life who had not an unblemished character  till she lost it  this fellow is turned puritan he will preach presently  but i hope his canting will not be able to corrupt my lord  this would be no place for me then i fancy he likes the girl himself  aside fram believe me willis lord eustace will find it a very difficult matter to get clear of this unhappy adventure  sir william is a man of sense and spirit and the young lady has besides a brother in the army who is esteemed a brave young man   will as to don pedro the father i think my lord had better get commodore loyd to take a short walk with him upon the quarter deck and as to the young spaniard his lordship cannot well refuse to take a bout of tilting with him if he should insist upon it  but i have been pretty well used to things of this sort as you know mr frampton and i never yet knew a wounded reputation cured by a sword or pistol  perhaps they may think as i do and so let the matter rest in peace   fram i should imagine their sentiments to be very different from yours upon this occasion  but pray who is this captain loyd that you talk of for sir williams antagonist   will there i was out a little  i forgot his being a welchman and a particular friend of the ap evanss   fram but how came he connected with lord eustace   will they were acquainted before the captain went to sea and a jolly buck he was but he has now lost his ship and to solicit another he is as constant at lord delvilles levee as an old maid at her parish church  the simile holds farther too for his head is cast in so peculiar a mould that he believes every thing he hears and repeats it as matter of fact   fram what an infinite deal of falsehood must this honest man utter in the course of a summers day   will i will save his poor conscience for this one day at least by keeping him out of our fortress   fram it will be more necessary for your purpose to prevent telling his truths at present i imagine   will your honor knows it is not to be spoken at all times he has told a thousand for my master himself aside knocking at the door i must fly to my post sir  exit fram a fit one for such an office it is such wretches as these that corrupt us all that clear the thorny paths of vice and strew them over with roses  these agents for perdition can remove mountains that obstruct our passage till we are sunk in the abyss of guilt and then their weight falls on us i would willingly persuade myself that lord eustace is not so far gone in baseness as to conclude his marriage with lady anne and desert this amiable unfortunate yet can i not at present foresee how it may be possible for him to avoid it there is some time however to think about it i will seek him out directly and try how his heart beats after his interview with harriet  exit scene sir williams apartment sir william and harriet discovered sir wm i am sorry to find you so cold upon this subject harriet but i flatter myself when you come to know the colonel you will have no objections to him believe me my child he is the only man i know deserving of an heart like yours untainted with the follies or vices of the world and unsullied with the image of any other man   har this is too much i cannot bear it aside  sir  enter robert rob captain loyd is come to wait upon your honor   sir wm desire him to walk in  and do ye hear robert  they walk aside har to be obliged to compound with my duty ashamed to look my father in the face to blush at his confidence and be humbled by his kindness to feel the irksomeness of receiving praise which i am conscious i do not merit what a state for an ingenuous mind  exit robert enter at opposite doors mrs winifred and captain loyd mrs win o heavens that monster here  but it is impossible now to escape  aside capi good morrow my good friend fair ladies your servant   sir wm i am extremely glad to see you captain   capt why so i thought you would be baronet or i should not have been here and yet it has not been without some difficulty that we are met i fancied just now that i should have been obliged to tack about without seeing you   sir wm i dont understand you captain   capt why to say truth sir william i dont rightly comprehend it myself but one of your lazy hall furniture  the most obstinate puppy i have seen him before though i cannot now recollect where took it into his head to deny me admittance and if old robert had not come to the door and cleared deck of this fellow i should have sheerd off directly   sir wm what can this mean was it your orders sister that we should be denied   mrs win as our arrival in town has not yet been annonced to any one i did not expect visitors so soon and therefore gave no orders about the matter  though i wish to keep him and all his family out of the house  aside sir wm there is something very extrordinary in this proceeding  aside capt since the wind sits so i am glad i came aboard you i should not choose to run foul of a ladys orders especially any that belong to you   sir wm you seem to have forgot these ladies captain this is my sister and this will soon be your niece i hope   capt they are both much altered since i saw them for one is grown a young woman and the other an old one   mrs win you are not grown a brute for you always was one   sir wm have a care captain you are very near splitting on a rock   capt not at all  time brings every vessel into port at last that does not founder  but faith my nephew has had an excellent look out i could almost envy him such a station a fine full sail truly  well prosperous gales attend their voyage  but where is harry i expected to have seen him here   sir wm whom do you speak of captain   capt why of your son the young colonel  i met him yesterday in the park not in his regimentals though for he told me he was a little incog at present and had even changed his name for fear of being known i think it was weston he called himself as he had quitted quarters without leave of absence and at the hazard of losing his commission   sir wm and he deserves it  what can have brought him here   har i rejoice at the thoughts of seeing him does he look well good captain   mrs win do you know where my nephew lodges sir  aside capt i should have as many tongues as there are swivels on the quarter deck to answer such a broadside of questions but one at a time i beseech you  as to you madam i answer no and to you fair lady yes and as to you sir william i think one need not have doubled the cape to be able to find out his errand hither a fair woman and a fair wind certainly brought him from ireland   sir wm rash inconsiderate boy   capt that may not be quite the case neither sir william but i should not have mentioned this matter to you if i had not thought it had been all aboveboard between him and you for harry was never kept under hatches i know  but never fear man keep a stout heart and i warrant you he shall weather it he shall not lose his commission   mrs win i fancy sir it may require the interest of a person of rather more consequence than you to preserve it but there are such who are ready to interest themselves for any one who belongs to my family the ap evanss are neither unknown nor unallied to the nobility   capt as to that madam i should think the loyds    sir wm for shame for shame  can you who are a man be infected with this folly   capt why it is not right or becoming a man of war to attack a frigate to be sure  but the loyds sir william    sir wm pisha   mrs win pray brother let the gentleman value himself upon what he pleases but it is rather unlucky that a person of his weight and importance should not be able to inform us where my nephew lodges as that is the only thing in which the captain could be any way serviceable to us   capt not so fast miss winifred if you please there are many people in this town who are apt to make offer of their services without either will or power to be of the least use to us now if you will tell me madam who those people are that you reckon upon i shall be better able to judge of your interest with the great   mrs win what do you think of lord eustace did you ever hear of him captain   capt i suppose i may why he is one of my most intimate friends madam and i will speak to him about the business directly   mrs win pray now good captain spare yourself that trouble for he is one of my most intimate friends also it is he who has been so obliging to lend us this house while we stay in london   capt i do remember this place now as well as my own cabin  but the impertinence of that footman whom i now recollect to be his put it out of my head  yes my lord and i have had some jovial parties here   sir wm what in this identical house   capt why aye  this used to be the place of rendezvous  but those days must be all over with him now that he is going to be married   mrs win and har how married   capt yes  the ceremony is to be performed immediately he will soon be in the bilboes  but you seem surpised  it is odd enough truly that he has not mentioned it to you miss winifred in particular who are one of his most intimate friends  when did you see him pray   mrs win what again alarmed at the same story  aside to harriet sir wm he was here this morning and i knew it was so then though my sister chose not to believe it   mrs win nor do i now  but pray mr intelligencer extraordinary to whom is lord eustace to be married   capt why really madam it is no extraordinary intelligence that he is to marry lady anne mounfort for it is just as public as the arrival of a kings ship in the downs or an indiaman at blackwall  the newspapers tell these things and every one in london knows them   har gracious heaven where shall i hide my head  aside mrs win we have heard this choice account before sir but though i have as implicit a faith in the veracity of the public prints as any person can have i would however take my life on it that this is a falsehood   capt you are not serious madam but if you choose to deny the fact i have nothing further to say about it   sir wm it is very odd that lord eustace should disown it to me and yet it is certain that he did so   capt that may be possible but i who am every day at his fathers and have seen the liveries equipage and jewels brought home for the wedding cannot easily be persuaded that all this rigging should be prepared before there is a bottom on stocks for it   har it is too true undone unhappy harriet  aside to mrs winifred sir wm what think you now sister   mrs win that the captain has dreamed all he has said or may be perhaps infected with a calenture for i think i have very good reason to know that lord eustace is otherways engaged   capt aye aye engaged to be sure say rather that he has taken another frigate in tow to add to his squadron i know the man pretty well i now recollect my having heard some time ago that he had some attachment to a pretty country girl he was a long time absent from london   mrs win a country girl truly   sir wm some poor simple creature i suppose who had youth and beauty enough to attract his inclinations but neither sense or virtue sufficient to preserve herself or them   capt this is probably the real truth of the matter   sir wm though i lament the unhappy victims of their own folly i cannot say that i am sorry such adventures happen sometimes as these examples may possibly have their effect in abating the presumption of young women who are often too apt to fancy themselves much wiser than their fathers and mothers   har i can no longer sustain the agonies i suffer  aside faints sir wm my harriet my dear child what is the matter   har i am suddenly taken ill i hope you will excuse me sir   mrs win was there ever any thing so absurd let us retire my dear and leave these wondermaking gentlemen to compose some other marvelous anecdotes  exit mrs win and har sir wm i am extremely alarmed aside  you will be so good as to excuse my staying longer with you captain at present harriets illness distresses me extremely   capt doubtless sir william  i will now go and give chase to the colonel and if i can hail him shall pilot him hither   sir wm i shall be much obliged to you   capt but you must not play old squaretoes upon us baronet remember you were once as young and i will warrant as frolicksome too as any of us your servant your servant sir william  exit sir wm there is something very singular in this affair of lord eustace  my sisters absurdity in denying the fact i can account for from the peculiar obstinacy of her character but why should harriet be affected with it her aunts folly may have operated there also perhaps persuaded her that his lordships common address of galantry and politeness was a professed declaration of passion for her but this marriage will soon put an end to such illusion and restore my child to her sense and duty again i will therefore go now and sooth not wound her mind with my surmises  the soibles of youth should be rather counteracted than opposed lest in endeavoring to weed them out we may destroy a kindred virtue  exit end of the second act act iii scene framptons apartment enter frampton fram it was unlucky i could not meet with lord eustace i perceive i am more anxious about

gillian and john james and mary lewellins ap griffiths ap owens and the lord knows who then my terrors about robert surprising us but luckily he was out of the way so i carried the lad to a beerhouse

precipitate her wretchedness it was to save her from it frampton that first induced me    fram talk no more of it my lord  mr willis   enter willis will so they are friends again i see aside  did your

carefully till i call for it   ld eust come my dear frampton i have a thousand obligations to you and a thousand things to speak to you about  ex ld eust and framp will my dear frampton  there is a fellow for you that without half a crown in his pocket talks as much stuff about honor and such nonsense as if he were a duke  they have not broke the seal i find that is framptons fault if he had not returned the instant he did i would have satisfied my lords curiosity and my own  well cannot i do so now a good servant should prevent his masters wishes  my lord i am sure would be glad to know the contents egad and so should i too  but how shall i come at em  this cursed seal flirts it with his finger zounds what have i done  what an accident why the letters open  why if it is one may read it without offense  so by your leave good mrs winifred  reads madam as i am sensible the dreadful moment now approaches when i must render an account of all my actions  a stewards account will be tolerably long i suppose continues reading i wish even by this late confession to atone for the crime i have been guilty of in aiding lord eustace to impose upon your niece by a feigned marriage  the devil this is a confession indeed for which like all other meanspirited whimpering rascals he deserves to be hanged my lord was in the right to look sharp after this business  we must have been blown up if it had come to light but as i hope to be well paid for the contents of this i may let the others go free  exit scene changes to sir william evanss apartment harriet seated on a couch leaning on her arm har i cannot pierce through the mystery in which i am involved i strive in vain to recover my confidence in lord eustace these fatal reports unhinge my very soul  yet nothing can abate my love one false step has involved me in a thousand difficulties i can endure my situation no longer and let the consequence be what it may i will reveal the secret to my father but then my lords entreaties

to follow him   har what shall i say to him  aside sir wm i wish i knew who my future daughterinlaw is to be harry tells me she has a great fortune but that i suppose is a sweetener  but if she has worth and virtue sufficient to make him happy i shall be content  but what is the matter harriet i thought your illness was quit gone off  you look as if you had been weeping  my sister i suppose    har no sir indeed her goodness to me as well as yours is graved upon my heart   sir wm she is a very odd woman  she would fain persuade me that i distressed you by jesting with captain loyd about lord eustaces mistress  i begin to think that she is in love with him herself  of what consequence are his galantries to her i dare say he has had a hundred of the same sort and that the lady to whom he is now going to offer his hand can have but a very small remnant of his heart   har i have heard him say sir they should never be divided   sir wm fine talking for a libertine truly  however i agree with you that it is not right to make a jest of those unfortunate women he may have ruined  and i commend your delicacy upon this occcasion as i well know it is the result of the most amiable female virtues modesty and compassion   har o sir  rises sir wm what ails my child   har falls at his feet my father   sir wm what is the matter you amaze me harriet   har i am    sir wm what   har you see

your duty and affection to me   har my future conduct sir shall prove them both   sir wm o harriet what a disappointment is mine i hoped to have seen you united to a man of sense and worth who would have respected as well as loved you  instead of that you are now joined to one who from his too intimate knowledge of the vicious part of your sex is likely to despise them all   har i flatter myself sir that the goodness both of his heart and understanding will make him readily renounce any light errors he may have fallen into   sir wm i wish it most sincerely  but    har do not sir injure him by doubting it   sir wm i fear my child you flatter yourself in vain with any change in your husbands conduct  that last amor which captain loyd spoke of    har how blessed am i to be able to acquit my lord  though blushing i avow it it was his mysterious attachment to his wife that caused that vile report  o sir let me again upon my knees entreat you to pardon what is past and give lord eustace leave to prove the sincerity of his affection to me by his respectful tenderness and gratitude toward you   sir wm rise rise my harriet since it is so  i forgive and bless you  embraces her har you

say    sir wm i cannot hear you now my thoughts are all engaged to himself  i must write to colonel loyd directly  i shall have a sad piece of work with the old gentleman at trevallin  he doats upon my girl as if she were his child    rob aye sir and so does every one who knows her except some of the folk in this house  i wish indeed i do that we were fairly out of it   sir wm well we shall leave it soon  but for the present robert    rob your honor little knows what is going forward in it  such quarrelling such high words aye and such fine words too as i never heard before though if i understand them right they have but a black meaning   sir wm robert well talk of this some other time  i say again i am not at leisure now    rob i cannot be easy till i tell you sir as i am sadly afraid there is something a plotting against your honor or my young mistress  i have heard that wicked willis talking of her to his fellow servant  o sir that fellow knows all his lords secrets he is at the beginning and ending of all mischief and he says as how miss harriet has been only imposed upon sir wm starts  yes sir imposed upon  and that his master will be married to a fine lady in less than a months time    sir wm how imposed upon what can this mean lord eustace dare not think of any thing so base  i injure both myself and him by the suspicion   rob all i know of the matter is sir that the gentleman that lives here whom i believe to be a very honest man though willis calls him a poor rogue and my lord eustace had a sad quarrel and they talked so loud that i could not help overhearing mr frampton  for i scorn to listen  reproaching my lord with having behaved very ill both to you and your daughter  but they were friends afterward and went out together  but willis said a great deal more to james my lords footman to the same sense  and whatever mischief there is a brewing i am sure he knows all about it   sir wm i cannot comprehend the meaning of all this  imposed upon  i will be satisfied  his scoundrel servant talk of my daughter and of his marriage with another lady  i have not patience to wait the meeting with lord eustace  is that fellow in the house  that willis robert   rob yes sir james and he have been taking a hearty glass i believe he looks pure and merry   sir wm bid him come to me directly   rob i am afraid he will be too cunning for your worship   sir wm do as i bid you   rob i will sir  exit robert sir wm the happiness or misery of my child seem now suspended in an equal balance  let my impatience to turn the scale in her favor

it to be sincere   will there he has hit the mark aside  o to be sure sir i have been remarkable for truth and sincerity all my life sir my mother taught me from a child never to tell a lie   sir wm truth is certainly the foundation of every other virtue and i hope i may depend upon yours to answer a few questions that i shall ask you   will o yes you may depend upon me  what the devil is he about he is certainly going to hear me my catechism  aside sir wm i shall think myself obliged to you if you will acquaint me with what you know in relation to lord eustaces marriage   will me sir how is it possible i can tell  all is out i suppose  o that cursed langwood  aside sir wm no trifling with me friend i will be answered   will yes to be sure sir all servants ought to give civil answers to gentlemen but really sir i cannot possibly tell you any thing about it   sir wm since fair means will not prevail upon you this shall extort the truth  draws his sword will for heavens sake sir dont terrify an evidence in this land of liberty   you will either frighten what i do know out of my head or make me confess any thing without knowing any thing at all of the matter   sir wm no prevarication sir  men like you who are bred up in vice and idleness are to be influenced by nothing but their fears  therefore tell me i say again what you know of this marriage   will yes yes they have had another letter from langwood so i may as well make a merit of giving up ours since there can be none in keeping it from him  aside sir wm what are you muttering villain dont urge me farther i have lost my reason and will not answer for the consequences   will i will do any thing sir if you will be pleased to drop the point of that ugly piece of cold iron  what you have heard from langwood is most certainly true  but a good servant you know sir ought to keep his masters secrets till his life is in danger   sir wm langwood  masters secrets  explain yourself this moment   will dear sir be patient  what need you have the trouble of hearing it over again when you know it all already   sir wm dare you again insult me with your trifling   will why really sir i cannot say it was a right thing of my lord but none of his servants were in fault except langwood we must do what our masters bid us and he poor devil is sorry enough as you know sir and may see sir  takes the letter out of his pocket sir william snatches it sir wm langwood again  who is langwood and what has he to do with your lords marriage and what is this letter   will it is for mrs winifred sir and as to langwood he was the mockdoctor the counterfeit parson that married my lord i was only the clerk indeed sir and i hope your honor will be so good to forgive me and not leave all the sin and the shame too upon my poor conscience   sir wm why villain rascal what is all this stuff if your lord be married to my daughter how dare he think of any other wife   will so i have made a fine piece of work on it  i find he did not know it was a sham marriage till now  aside why really sir you terrify me so that i dont rightly understand you i thought you knew all about it before i opened my lips to you   sir wm i asked you wretch about your lords intended marriage   will o lord sir it was very unlucky i did not understand you i shall be obliged to fly my country my lord will never let me live in england after this i shall lose an excellent place sir   sir wm be gone thou profligate fly from my sight this moment   will i am an undone scoundrel that is the truth of it  but this comes of muddling in a morning  had i been sober i should have been an overmatch for his worship or any justice of peace in england i will even retire till my master and this welsh family have so reconciled matters between themselves that a gentleman may be able to live with some satisfaction amongst them  aside exit sir william reading the letter sir wm what am i now to think my child is dishonored let me contain my

evening   har i write to him you make me shudder at the thought   mrs win it must be done child  i insist upon it  this is some trick meant to impose upon us   har i feel the imposition here  lord eustace has betrayed us   mrs win i tell you harriet it is impossible  he is at least the ninth peer of his family in a direct line   har though honors may be  honor is not hereditary madam   mrs win no matter write to him i say you are and must be lady eustace at any rate i tell you   har and can you think me vile enough after such perfidy to receive his hand can i vow to honor the man whom i no longer esteem shall i go to the altar with him and swear to be faithful to a perjured wretch again repeat my vows of everlasting love for him who has abandoned and undone me no i would sooner die a thousand thousand deaths   mrs win you are just as obstinate as your father  now you have taken this into your head nothing can get it out again   har do you think my father could be so inhuman without just grounds to stab me to the heart it is it is too true   mrs win i will not believe a word of it  i never was mistaken in my life my brother is ever in the wrong  i desire harriet you will write to lord eustace directly   har indeed i will not  exit mrs win then positively i will  i am determined to know the truth from him i own i begin to be a little doubtful about this matter myself this letter may be forged  but those eternal reports confound me  it is impossible he should dare to deceive me  but if he has he shall find that the ap evanss are not to be injured with impunity   end of the third act act iv scene the park enter capt loyd and col evans col my father in london you surprise me captain  what can have brought him here   capt nay as to the matter of surprise my young hero your father was quite as much astonished at hearing of your being in the same port as you can be and as to your aunt winifred she started with as much amazement as the sailors that spied the first patagonian your sister indeed seemed more pleased than any of them at the news and inquired whether i had met you in healthy condition and if i knew your moorings   col my gentle harriet  i am impatient to see her   capt hoist sail and away then i will be your convoy though i should like better to drop anchor and take in refreshment for an hour or so at the admiralty coffeehouse where i have appointed captain blast of the boreas and some other jolly lads to meet me   col i am much obliged to you captain but will by no means suffer you to break your engagement  i have a little business to dispatch before i can see my father and shall easily find out the house without troubling you   capt why that you may readily do as it is enclosed by a very high wall and has a large handsome gateway with a bell at the door  aye aye that bell was not placed there to call the crew to prayers but to prevent the neighbors from knowing who comes in and out as they might do if there was a rapper only   col i cannot see why that caution should be necessary   capt it is of no great use at present  but time has been  harkee me harry there is a devilish storm brewing over your head you may look for dirty weather i can tell you  your father is in a confounded passion at your having quitted the regiment and is strongly persuaded that you will spring a leak my boy   col i wrote to my father some time ago to acquaint him with my motives i have also written to my colonel to account for my conduct   capt never fear i will take care of you as i am sure you did not desert from cowardice  but it was a silly trick harry  some girl i suppose is in the wind they make fools of the wisest of us  i remember when i was stationd at gibraltar a donna isabella    col would you were there now i know not how to get rid of this tiresome man  aside capt a spaniard you may guess by the name had a devilish mind to come off with me as she said to see foreign parts  but i weighed anchor slily one moonlight night and left the poor signiora on shore  but all men have not the gift of discretion though i was a younker then harry not much turned of thirty i will assure you    col i think it was rather cruel in you to forsake the lady captain   capt why i did hear afterward that there was a ballad made about it entitled the cruel captains garland and set to a very woeful tune  i laugh at these things harry but i find you are a truer lover and have come here in spite of wind and tide in pursuit of your mistress  you cannot expect however that sir william will be highly delighted if you should happen to make a losing voyage of it   col i hope sir it will be the most prosperous one of my life and i shall be able to give my father a satisfactory account of my conduct   capt why if your mistress be well freighted a sixty thousand pounder or so he will have no objection i suppose  but come my boy tell me a little about it is she maid or widow harry i like to hear lovestories mightily   col she is a maiden young and beautiful and of a rank and fortune beyond my expectation captain we have loved one another long her guardians are upon the point of disposing of her to another she has desired me to free her from their tyranny and accept of her hand as my reward  glorious recompense    capt why harry this is running before the wind with a vengeance  not so fast not so fast my boy you go at the rate of twelve knots an hour  this story sounds a little romantic though and puts me in mind of the lady that the flying man comes to save from the monster  but it is odd enough that i should not know this lady prithee harry what is her name   col you must excuse my not answering that question captain as you might possibly become my rival   capt why to be sure if she had applied to me she should have been far enough from her guardians by this wed have run gunnel to all the way my boy and left them and you on the dry land harry   col i shall tell her of your intended galantry captain and i hope you and she will be better acquainted  for the present i must wish you a good evening   capt nay if you have a mind to sheer off colonel i wish you a fair gale  i never grapple with any thing but a pretty lass or an enemy and so your servant your servant colonel  exit capt col my meeting with this blundering sailor was unlucky as my father may perhaps be displeased at my not waiting on him the moment i knew of his being in london  but i cannot break my engagement with lady anne  every thing must give way to that charming woman  i will fly to her directly and if possible find time to pay my duty to my father before i sleep  exit scene sir williams apartment enter mrs winifred and robert mrs win he will come then you have staid a great while robert   rob my lord was not at home madam and as you desired i should bring an answer i was obliged to wait his coming  every thing seems in confusion in the family his lordship it seems is to be married in a few days they are all packing up and the servants scarce knew where to find pen ink and paper   mrs win this startles me  it is but too plain i have been deceived aside  hearken to me robert and do exactly what i command you  go and place yourself by the private door in the garden and the moment you hear a key turn in the lock come and tell me   rob i shall obey you madam  i am sure all is not right aside  exit mrs win i must if possible prevent sir williams knowing of this interview  but here he comes   enter sir william  i hope you have vented all your rage brother and that one may talk a little calmly to you now   sir wm o yes i have great reason to be calm   mrs win i can tell you that a little more of your outrageous fury would have killed your daughter nor do i know what fatal effect it might have had upon my own constitution   sir wm that is not very easily shocked i believe   mrs win that is more than you know at least brother but a person so entirely given up to their passions never once reflects upon consequences   sir wm i wish you had reflected upon consequences but those who have erred themselves are ever ready to reflect on others   mrs win a truce with reflections on all sides and in case that there should be any truth in this infamous story let us set about forming some scheme for redressing the affront that he has dared offer to our family   sir wm i shall not stand in need of your assistance i am determined how to act   mrs win pray sir william do not be headstrong but for once be advised by me  i have thought of a scheme and i am sure it will answer   sir wm what is it   mrs win it is happy for my family that i have a little sense brother though i do not boast of it   sir wm your wisdom in this matter has been conspicuous but what new proofs of it are we to expect at present   mrs win suppose we were to send for lord eustace and try what effect harriets tears and my reproaches would have upon him  he has always had the greatest deference for my opinion   sir wm your opinion  is this your boasted scheme  he will not come base as he is it is impossible he could endure her sight   mrs win your affected sagacity is enough to set one mad  you are mistaken as you always are   sir wm i know it cannot be the consciousness of his vile treachery will keep him far from hence  he dare not see her   mrs win i cannot bear this contradiction aside  for once let conviction conquer your obstinacy i wrote to him myself in harriets name i have had his answer he will be here this night   sir wm and shall my daughter sue to him for justice implore him to receive the hand he has rejected and the heart he has betrayed shall she be sacrificed to make his peace i tell you no  i will have other vengeance   mrs win i see these horrid punctilios will ruin all  if we can make up this matter quietly what does it signify whether he be a man of honor or no   sir wm i never ust forget that i am one   mrs win i wish you would have a little patience and hear me out  if this should fail i have another project in my head which i am certain must succeed  my imagination has not been idle and i think it full as active as your own   sir wm i believe it may be rather more so  but i have no leisure for imaginary matters now  going mrs win pray sir william dont be so positive  you know lord eustace has a place at court   sir wm what then   mrs win i would at least let the king know what a servant he has about him and as i may reasonably suppose that his majesty may have heard of our ancestors though he knows nothing of you sir william i would advise you to throw yourself at his feet  he is himself a father   sir wm blessed may he long be in that honored title though i am rendered wretched by the name  but what can he do for me   mrs win disgrace and displace the man who has wronged you although he be a lord   sir wm what is his title has he not debased it  but know there is no difference of rank before the throne  degrees of elevation are only seen by those who look above them kings must look down and therefore see all equal and in our monarchs sight the rights even of the meanest subject are precious as his own  but yet he cannot heal my wrongs   mrs win though i can never believe that a knight baronet is upon a par with a lord sir william   sir wm absurd distinctions i will hear no more  the man who has the means of justice in his own hands and seeks for it elsewhere deserves to be the sport of chance and dupe of his own weakness  then let him come this night  i will meet him as i ought   mrs win you are exactly in the same case of the dissidents at warsaw nothing but force of arms will content you and like them too you may be undone by it  suppose you were to meet lord eustace and he should kill you   sir wm i shall not then outlive my honor  exit mrs win this selfwilled man distresses me extremely  he is for ever disconcerting my schemes  there never was such a race of idiots as the family of the ap evanss myself excepted  there is not a head in this house but my own  to be sure i have been a little overreached in this affair of the wedding but the greatest politicians are liable to

meaning of this conversation  and i must say i think it rather severe to be condemned unheard   mrs win i can contain my rage no longer read that  gives him langwoods letter ld eust langwoods letter all is discovered then  aside mrs win i perceive that even a man of quality may be disconcerted  your lordship did not use to be at a loss for an answer   ld eust have patience madam i confess that appearances are against me   mrs win aye and realities too my lord   ld eust i do not mean to justify myself  no i plead guilty the fear of losing you my harriet whom i loved more than life and the apprehension of disobliging my father tempted me to make you mine in an illegal manner  but here i swear i will repair the injury   mrs win i think it will do matters are in a right train now if i can but prevent sir william from interrupting them  aside exit ld eust you are offended harriet and have cause  but let not your resentment turn against yourself   har could i forgive myself my lord i then might pardon you but while i think my punishment severe i own i have deserved it   ld eust you judge yourself too hardly  has either your virtue or your delicacy suffered by my crime nay even your reputation is still free from stain and if you will now condescend to accept my hand my future life shall be devoted to your happiness   har and can you think i will be again deceived   ld eust by heaven you shall not    har nay i will not  your poor evasions have no weight with me  leave me for ever leave me  i will not be united to you by any ties  going ld eust yet hear me harriet   har would i had never heard you  but though i were to listen to you now you cannot shake my purpose no  i can die   exit ld eust no live my harriet live to make me happy   sir william within sir wm where is he i must and will see him   ld eust ah sir william this is unlucky i am not prepared for this encounter  aside enter sir william sir wm what is it possible that you should dare to enter underneath this roof   ld eust what should i fear sir william   sir wm your own base heart and my much injured honor which calls upon you now for justice   ld eust so then i find the pride of injured virtue was assumed  your daughter would secure me by compulsion  but i despise assassins   sir wm do not my lord insult my patience farther i did not know you were without a sword on that account i put up mine but know young man i shall not rest till it has done me justice   ld eust sir william though i cannot pretend to justify the injuries i have done your daughter i neither must nor will be compelled to make the reparation i should indeed be unworthy to become her husband if fear could make me so   sir wm at the first hour you saw her sir i should have deemed you so  it is not your birth young man can varnish over vices such as yours  your rank renders them the more obnoxious   ld eust i readily allow myself to blame sir william   sir wm you cannot then be base enough to refuse the sole atonement which is now within your power    ld eust i will confess i felt my heart fubdued by harriets grief and tenderness  they had more power than armies  she might have triumphed over me but    sir wm you surely do not think i mean to give my daughter to you what to reward your vices with a heart like hers  to have my child become a second time a sacrisice to that vain idol title  no sir it is another kind of reparation i demand and i will have it   ld eust a brave man sir william never thinks meanly of anothers courage and as i know you to be so i hope you will not think me otherwise if i decline your offer   sir wm on what pretense my lord have you not wronged me   ld eust for that reason only i cannot dare not draw my sword against you   sir wm these are new rules of honor formed on the principles of fear my lord   ld eust fear sir william   sir wm yes my lord i say it none but a coward ever will decline to meet the man he has injured and should you still persist in your refusal i will proclaim you one   ld eust this is too much  but consider sir you are  my harriets father   sir wm that consideration would brace a nerveless arm  but look upon me sir i am not bent beneath the weight of years  my mind and body both are firm as yours and the first shock that ever reached my heart except her mothers loss is the disgrace you have brought upon my child  the stain must be effaced my lord   ld eust i know not how to act should i declare my intention to marry harriet he would despise me and if i fight him that renders it impossible  aside sir wm come come my lord this is no time for musing  you must determine instantly to give me the satisfaction i require or see your title posted up with the honorable addition of coward to it   ld eust nay then sir william though with reluctance i must accept your offer  name your time sir   sir wm at eight tomorrow morning    ld eust i will call upon you sir and bring a friend  but let me once more add that you are the only man on earth that i should fear to meet upon such terms  exit sir wm i am glad my son is ignorant of this affair  had he been here he must have fought lord eustace  he has i hope a long and happy life before him mine though not quite worn out is of less value and if i lose it in defense of my childs honor it is well disposed of  enter mrs winifred mrs win so she was or might have been very well disposed of but for your intemperance  you have managed your matters very cleverly to be sure  you have driven lord eustace away and the family of the ap evanss are disgraced for ever   sir wm thou weak vain woman whose folly has undone me and my child   mrs win not i truly sir william  it is her own highflown principles that have ruined her  my lord offered to marry her over and over again it seems but she with her nonsensical romantical notions affected to despise him and refused to be his wife on any terms   sir wm has she i rejoice to hear it    mrs win rejoice at what at her being a mad woman i think in her situation she needed not have been so nice  it would have been much better for her to have been lady eustace even against his will than miss harriet evanss against her own   sir wm how nearly pride and meanness are allied you would obtrude your niece upon a man who has abandoned and dishonored her then vainly think she might receive distinction from a title which force not choice bestowed   mrs win brother i neither understand logic nor sophistry but i am very sorry matters are as they are  as to harriet i believe it will be of no great consequence to her she will soon break her heart i imagine  but the scandal of this affair will rest upon the survivors  i dont think i shall ever be able to show my face at monmouth again   sir wm away the moments now are too precious to be wasted where is harriet   mrs win in her chamber like a distracted wretch tearing herself to pieces i endeavored to comfort her as much as i could by telling her how wrong she had acted and that she might have lived to be a countess if he had followed my advice   sir wm was this the consolation you offered to her grief how could you be so barbarous the proper spirit she has shown in refusing that worthless lord has replaced her in my heart  i will go try to comfort her  exit mrs win aye so you may you are the fittest to go together for my part i disclaim the mismanagment of this whole affair and remember i will no longer be accountable for measures that i am not suffered to guide  exit end of the fourth act act v scene mr framptons apartment ld eustace and mr frampton

suppose you think the worst is over   ld eust no frampton it is to come  sir william has insisted upon my meeting him this morning   fram impossible my lord you must not fight him think on the consequences if you should be so unhappy as to kill the father of the woman you have highly injured the world would certainly unite against you and drive you from society   ld eust in that case i should be but ill qualified for solitude i confess  now my dear frampton as i know you are my friend and as i would not wish any other person should be acquainted with this story i must desire you will be my second   fram it is much beneath a man of honor to make professions either of his friendship or his courage but on this occasion i must tell you that i would hazard my life for your service in any other cause but i will not be concerned in this infamous affair and i say again you must not raise your arm against sir william   ld eust you do not know how i am circumstanced he has compelled me to this duel said he would brand me for a coward if i declined it  what would you have me do   fram marry his daughter   ld eust no  though i love her with the truest fondness i will not wed her upon such terms nor suffer her to think so meanly of me as to suppose i poorly bartered a cowards hand to save his worthless life   fram yet consider my lord that let the consequences of this duel be what they may nothing can acquit you of that justice you owe both to her and yourself   ld eust i own that i have greatly wronged her   fram it is now within your power to make reparation by becoming her husband but should you deprive her of a father she never can be united to the man who killed him   ld eust i will not kill him frampton  urge me no farther  my mind is torn to pieces   fram believe me my lord you are not in a right course to heal it   ld eust no matter you have refused to be a witness of my conduct mr frampton   fram and do so still i never had the least reason to doubt your bravery and as this is an affair in which only principals can be concerned i hope it will be no imputation upon mine if i decline seeing your lordship engaged in a strife where i cannot wish you success   ld eust i shall not press you but have yet a request to make   fram name it my lord   ld eust if i should fall deliver this letter to my father and  if there be any circumstance of my misconduct left untold which may do harriet justice inform him of it fully  i must now go seek for a less cautious friend than mr frampton   fram your lordship will scarcely ever find a sincerer exit lord eustace of what opposite qualities is this young man compounded what a mixture of good and evil but are we not all made of the same materials the devil himself cannot always mislead a man that has principles they will recur in spite of him and make their owner act rightly upon trying occasions  this letter to his father shows him to be a man of honor  something must be done to preserve him

heaven preserve me from distraction perhaps in a few moments my fathers sword may pierce my husbands heart  why has that tender name escaped my lips resentment should have stopped its passage to my tongue and sighs opposed its utterance   mrs win i dont see any harm child in your calling him your husband though to be sure he is not so in law  but i would have you hope the best harriet   har no i will hope no more  what should i hope  my pride my reason might have scorned him living but i will love him and lament him dead  would i had died the hour before i listened to your counsel and set at naught the authority of my father  your cruel kindness has undone me   mrs win i should not have thought of meeting such a return for that kindness from you miss evans   har forgive and pity my distraction madam it is i that have brought ruin on ye all  but if you ever loved me think of some means to find my brother out he may prevent this duel and save me from the lowest depth of misery   mrs win really child you are extremely ignorant you talk as if you were at mohmouth where our family are known and properly respected  but in such a place as london it may possibly be as difficult to find out an ap evans as any of those mushroom gentry whose table does not contain above three generations   har my dearest aunt do not place bars before my only hope let all our servants be sent out to seek him   mrs win well child if it will make you easy they shall go directly though i am of opinion it will be but a fruitless inquiry but the being too easily prevailed upon is my greatest foible  i wish i had a little of sir williams obstinacy about me   har consider madam i am on the rack do not lose time i beg of you   mrs win well be composed i will send them they shall search all the genteel coffeehouses at the west end of the town  it is impossible he should be in the city  but dont let your father know that i told you of the duel he thinks women are never to be trusted with any

captain must have given you to understand the reason of my desiring to see you at present i am unhappily engaged in a duel and the opinion i have both of your bravery and friendship made me look upon you as the properest person of my acquaintance to be my second   capt as to that matter sir william i think i have discharged as many broadsides as any gentleman in the navy  though i never yet drew a trigger out of the line but powder and ball i suppose do pretty much the same execution by land as by sea though standing fair to the windward is sometimes of great use to us baronet   sir wm it is of little consequence which way the wind sits at present captain   capt i cannot say much to that sir william  but i wish you had acquainted me with this business a day or two ago i should have liked to have made a little will  but it is no great matter neither  for if i should pop over you daughters husband will be my heir   sir wm there is not the least occasion for that precaution captain as your life will not be endangered   capt how so when the ship is once engaged must not every man aboard her fight all but the chaplain and he should be busy in his way too   sir wm in this case my friend

carrymy politeness so far as to make him a compliment of mine   ld eust there is something much higher than politeness in the question at present  justice colonel  a man may dispense with the one but not the other   col i am entirely of your opinion but as your sentiments are so very delicate and that you really love the girl why may not i as your second step in and save the explosion of gunpowder

saw the distress and anxiety of your mind i was fully satisfied of your honorable intentions toward this lady from the letter you entrusted me with which yet remains unopened  i determined if possible to preserve both your life and honor for her sake by preventing your duel with her father and your marriage with lady anne mountfort   col the first event sir has been prevented without your assistance and i will venture to promise that the second shall never take place   framp i am quite of your opinion sir as i came this moment from lord delville to acknowledge this fair lady as his

lady anne mountfort will be very ready to forgive your want of passion for her as her partiality for me might perhaps have been the cause of her blindness to your superior merits   ld eust i
