the characters and conduct of sir john edgar etc  the characters and conduct of sir john edgar and his three deputygovernours during the administration of the late separate ministry in a third and fourth letter to the knight with a picture of sir john drawn by a pen exactly after the life  london printed and sold by j roberts in warwick lane    0 price six pence  to his grace the duke of newcastle my lord adresses of this nature are but too often petitions for favors to come but the intention of this is to return thanks to your grace for the favor you did me the honor to confer upon me in november last your grace perhaps may inclined to believe that my acknowledgment comes somewhat of the latest i therefore being concerned to vindicate the reputation of my gratitude take the liberty to assure your grace that i knew nothing certainly of the favor which by your order was conferred upon me in november last till within this fortnight and as i had heard nothing certain of it till so long after your grace had commanded it for that very reason i had believed nothing of it when i did hear of it if a gentleman of undoubted honor had not assured me that he was present when you were pleased to give directions about it as i knew nothing of it till within this fortnight so all i know of it now is the assurance which that gentleman has given me that your grace has ordered it for tho depending upon that gentlemans honor and his integrity i have endeavored to have evidence of sense in the case as much as i could endeavor it with any manner of decency and without subjecting my self to be treated in my messengers with repeated and intolerable insolence by that servant who received your graces command to convey your favor to me i have found to my infinite surprise that at the very time that i have been laboring to unmask and expose an hypocritical wretch who has had the impudence and the ingratitude publicly to affront your grace as far as animals of his species can affront you at that very time one of your own domestic servants your errant creature who subsists entirely by your bounty has been diligent and industrious in giving me all the disappointment and all the disturbance that it has been in his power to give me and consequently all the diversion that he could possibly give me in favor of your graces declared and mortal enemy  but as your graces conferring this favor consisted in your ordering it to be done and not in my receiving it i am obliged to return you my humble thanks for it as much as if i were in actual possession of it  i am very sorry that upon addressing my self twice to your grace after this manner i have been obliged each time to make a complaint to you but i cannot absolutely despair of your pardon for it when i consider that your graces honor has been more concerned in each complaint than any inrerest of mine since i made the first complaint to you i have had the satisfaction to see that your grace has retrieved the jurisdiction over our theaters which is annexed to your office as lord chamberlain of his majestys household and have had the pleasure to hear that you have mortified four insolent wretches who had dared to usurp it from you  as for the complaint which i lay before you at present i must leave it to be determined by your graces wisdom and justice whether the insolence of the late separate ministry whether the insolence of sir john edgar himself was ever so flagrant or so insupportable as that of your domestic and menial servant who has presumed to abuse your graces service in the most injurious manner to treat a person insolently whom you had treated favorably to intercept and retain your favor and betray the trust reposed in him and to control you in your very domain where because you are most independent you ought to be most uncontrollable  my lord if your grace should be in the least surpised at the uncommon method of conveying this complaint to you i am inclined to believe that you will have the goodness to consider that the subject matter of it is a great deal more strange and more extraordinary than the manner of conveying it to you for i appeal to all those persons of condition who have been used to receive addresses of this nature if they ever knew or ever heard of any thing like it in any of their servants before  besides i had a great deal of reason to believe that i had no other way of approaching your grace for he who has had the assurance for four months together to intercept and retain your graces favor would certainly have ventured to intercept any letter that should have come from me or to hinder my having any personal access to you but i believe he dare hardly do that by the little book to which this is prefixed and which i have here the honor to send you if his presumption should extend so far my comfort is that your grace will hear of the contents of this epistle from a hundred of your humble servants  i am my lord your graces most obedient and most humble servant  letter iii to sir john edgar my dear knight since i perceive that there is like to be a long commerce of paper civilities between us two i think we could not do better for the making the correspondence perfectly easy to us both than to continue as we have begun to throw off all manner of ceremony and to treat each other with that familiarity which is so becoming our long and old acquaintance this is then one branch of the cartel established between us that thou should seem not to remember that the king has made me a gentleman and that i should not fail to forget that he ever made thee a knight so that for the future i shall be downright what do you call with thee and thou my dear knight shall be plain jack edgar with me in which branch of the cartel thou have by much the advantage of me for my diminutive honor was establishd by no less than two patents the one granted by the late queen and the other by his present majesty whereas thine was conferred only by a transitory blow given upon shoulder blade which when some jeering malicious persons heard of they said they rejoiced that honor was got so near as within a foot of thy pericranium  but now to enter upon business how agreeably was i surpised with that notable distinction in the beginning of thy eleventh paper which makes thy apology for thy going by an alias and that is that when a man goes by an alias in order to commit a robbery or a murder or lie with his neighbors wife why that is not so well but when an old soldier of the queen takes up a nomdeguerre only for the promotion of virtue why that is a laudable action now here cannot i forbear for my life using the same expression to you which was formerly used to another old thraso in the eunuch of terence soldier di vostram fidem quanti est sapere nunquam accedo quin abs te abeam doctior for my part i have all along been weak enough to believe that to go by an alias is a manifest cheat and that every impostor means interest and not virtue but this notable distinction has almost convinced me that if the writer of a libel puts but a sham name to it he has a dispensation by that alias to injure slander and threaten all that is powerful and noble in great britain but that if any one pretends to write even a just satire upon the vilest poetaster or politicaster between dover and the orcades without putting any name at all to it why the action is abominable it cries aloud for the extremest vengeance and deserves death without mercy but honest jack edgar i have one scruple in my head boileau was certainly a man of true judgment of nice honor and a very just and admirable satirist his censures were always just and so were his praises if you except a very few addressed to his great monarch merit and virtue were always sacred to him and vice and folly the objects of his scorn and hatred now when he published a book of satires which were chiefly levelled at the edgars and ironsides who flourished then at paris that is at a number of coxcombs who dared to appear upon parnassus without any lawful summons thither or in plain english without either genius or judgment you know very well jack edgar that he put no name to his book  the violence and virulence of the contending parties in england have i am afraid been one great cause why we have had no just satire in england since the author of hudibras published his which seems to me to be a very just one on hypocrisy but you are not to be told that the author of it put no name to it we have since had libels which have passed for satires as absalom and achitophel the medal mac fleckno and the dispensary they are indeed if you please beautiful libels but they are every where full of flattery or slander and a just satire admits of neither in the two first how many were abused only for being true to the religion and liberties of their country and on the other side some were extolled only for being false to both the attempt to lessen shadwell in mackflecno is every whit as unworthy of satire for shadwell pretended to no species of poetry but the comic in which he was certainly very much superior to dryden as the latter acknowledges by a very fair implication in his preface to the state of innocence which was writ before the quarrel between them began the business of sir samuel garth in his dispensary was to expose much better physicians than himself for no other reason but because they were not of his opinion in the affair of the dispensary now though these were libels and very injurious yet the authors justly thought it more creditable to suffer them to be published without any name rather than to make use of false ones  i am heartily glad my dear friend that i have pleased thee so by saying that thou have done more harm to the stage than any hundred men in all england for say thou the world is so wicked that it is hardly a disparagement to be great even in ill but i am afraid honest jack thou mistakest me for when i accused thee of doing this harm to the stage i did not affirm that thou did it altogether through a sinister design or a wicked motive of interest but that there was always a mixture with the other two of want of knowledge and judgment and though it may be reputable in this wicked world to be great in ill i believe it will hardly ever be creditable to be great in folly i do not say but that there may be a very wise man who may know nothing of theatrical matters but then this person who does not know them must not pretend to know them nor to dictate to the world in an affair which he does not at all understand for there is a wise and a knowing ignorance an ignorance that reflects upon its self and restrains him who has it from exposing or hurting himself or others by undertaking things which he does not in the least understand  and now my dear friend thou art for mounting that war horse afresh from which i showed thee descending methinks i see thee upon him in all thy accoutrements thy cocked hat thy broad sword thy shoulder belt and thy jack boots and a hugeous merry figure thou make upon him but when thou talkest of planting thy self behind king william the third against lewis the fourteenth does not thy memory fail thee a little if thou meanest planting thy self behind the coach of king william i have nothing to say against that but i never heard a great deal of thy attendance on him when he got on horseback he seldom held the honor of thy company to express my self in the quaint dialect of thy elder brother of brentford either on the boyne or the shannon or the maese or the sambre thou had that aversion for the effusion of christian blood that rather than go into the field with thy broad sword and thy dead doing hand to make piteous slaughter of the enemy thou made it thy choice to stay here at home and make wicked jokes with thy irish goose quill upon the funerals of thy friends  but here my dear friend thou art in a terrible fuss about going to law thou pretendst to be even mad that thou art hindered from going to law the law is not open to thee thou have not the freedom of the law but quaere peregrinum vicinia rauca reclamat for do not we all know that thou art up to the ears in law that thou have been up to the ears in law these twenty years and wilt be up to the ears in law if thou should live these hundred years can we forbear laughing then to hear thee cry out that thou should be the happiest man in the world if thou could but go to law ah my dear friend i could name some certain persons who if they were no more restrained from going to law than thou art would be happy indeed but what is it that hinders thee from going to law the gate of madam justice like that of hell is open at all hours free ingress is denied to none that have but money to pay their entrance egress i must confess is not altogether to easy what is it then that thou pretendest should restrain thee from going to law have thou not money to pay thy lawyers or art thou suing some unaccountable debtors who having money to spare for their liberalities and their profusions have that irregular greatness of soul that they scorn to pay a just debt till it comes to execution and who instead of discharging or so much as owning the obligation they have to thee pretend to keep thee at arms length and bid thee open defiance should that be the case i believe i can give thee wholesome advice know then that there is a certain notable sergeant at law with a hard name who if thou repairest to him will instruct thee in an admirable method of dealing with such persons but at the same time i cannot help acquainting my dear friend that he ought to be ashamed to have the word law in his mouth as long as he pretends to undo an act of the legislature by an act of the executive power  we are come now from law by a whirl of imagination to conjurers and hoop petticoats but why will you go abroad for intelligence which you may have at home or go for counsel to the deputy when you may be advised by the principal for does not every mortal who reads your papers say the devil in hell is in you besides how come you so earnest to get a patent for the hoop which you were so eager to demolish in your wonderful speculations  but my dear friend thou have been pleased in this thy eleventh paper to return the title of pedant by which i saluted thee in one of my former according to thy usual method of giving what is thy own to those who do not in the least deserve it though i plainly perceive that thou art not quite so proud of this title as thou art of that of knight yet to show thee that i saluted thee with proper greeting i shall endeavor to prove that however disagreeable the sound of pedant may be to thee thou art certainly the thing and in order to this will endeavor to show thee what a pedant and pedantry are of which in thy lucubrations and speculations thou have so often treated in proper terms such as men smatter when they throw out and miss the matter hud  the pedant then is literally and originally speaking he who has the instruction of boys and the pedant in the figurative appellation which is now come to be the common one is he who in his conversations with men or in his writings to men shows the qualities of an instructor of boys now boys not being come to the use of their judgment nor the force of their imagination are chiefly instructed by memory their instructors therefore never argue with them but only dictate to them and make use of authority instead of reason with them and to exert their authority the more and to cause it to make the stronger impression they dictate with a haughty and imperious air which sometimes is augmented to such a degree by weakness illbreeding pride and choler that it becomes insupportable even to their dearest friends and relations and if their pupils are backward in receiving their instructions or give them the slightest provocation they treat them with all those flowers of rhetoric with which those persons are always inspired who frequent the sonorous nymphs of the flood that haunt the banks of the vocal thames between the bridge and the tower  thus have i shown that the pedant in the acceptance in which the word is commonly used has the same qualities with an instructor of boys the chief of which qualities are a dogmatizing spirit a presumptuous arrogance and a soaring insolence  now the man of sense and the gentleman being diametrically opposite to the pedant must be one who in his conversations and in his writings has the qualities of one who converses with or writes to men now he who knows the world and converses with or writes to men always argues and never dictates as well knowing that reasonable creatures are to be convinced by reason and not by authority and as reason and truth are calm and modest things he never assumes the dictatorian air is never haughty never insolent  but if at any time he barely asserts he does it with modesty if not with diffidence as very well knowing that though a man by an insolent decisive air may pass upon those who are governed by fancy or opinion it never fails to render him suspected to those who are resolved never to submit to any opinion till they be convinced by reason which latter sort only may be truly said to be men he therefore treats his companion or reader with respect and would look upon it as a scandalous indignity the breaking out into those tropes and figures which are so much in use with those who converse with or who write to boys of what age or rank or condition whatsoever those boys are whether they are in infancy or youth or virility or gravity or decrepitude whether they are ignorant or learned boys of the lees of the people or of equestrian dignity  and now by applying all this to my very worthy friend i make no doubt but to make it appear not only that thou have the spirit of pedantry in thee equal to any of thy contemporaries or predecessors but that thou have by nature and genius what they have acquired by industry and hard labor for thou art certainly an illiterate pedant and art the very cock pedant of all the nest of pedants for besides that in all thy writings whether papers or pamphlets whether lucubrations speculations guardian lover or englishman i hardly ever knew thee argue once thou have carried authority to a more ridiculous height than ever pedant before thee did for if the rest of thy brethren have had the extravagance and the presumption to bear down human reason by downright human authority they have still had so much shadow of modesty left as to attempt it by the authority of others and not by their own if shoals of modern pedants have arrived to that height of extravagance as to pretend to decide disputes where reason alone ought to prevail by an ipse dixit yet none before thy self has had the arrogance and the impudence to do it by an ipse dixi but thou have often set up thy own authority not only against human reason but against all other human authority thou have thought thy own dogmatick assertion enough to establish any opinion which thy private interest required and like an absolute monarch upon the throne of pedantry have believed it sufficient to say car tell est notre plaisir  i must confess that several of the tatlers have wit and humor in them a fine raillery and an agreeable pleasantry and some of the spectators likewise have some of these good qualities but i have powerful reasons to believe that for the most part the good qualities in those writings are derived from thy correspondents and that only the pedantry of them is thine for when thou endeavourdst to entertain the world with a paper called the guardian after that mr addison had abandoned thee and mr manwaring was entirely employed against the examiner i found nothing in that paper of the qualities of the other but only thy eternal dogmatizing and the haughty and pedantick air of a schoolmaster nay in this paper thou were dwindled into a pedant even according to the litteral acceptance of the words and appeardst every morning with thy formal instructors amidst thy boys and thy girls  i come next to the vindication of thy beauty but here my dear jacky boy let us be serious a little thou know i am thy friend and wish thee well i would not have thee make thy self a jest and a byword and a butt to all the world thy beauty man why thou may as well brag in thy old age of thy dancing a jig i never heard thee mentioned by any woman for these three years last past but thou either wentst by the appellation of the black knight with her or she said she could resemble thee to nothing so nearly as to the knave of clubs i received the following letter from a friend immediately upon the publication of the   th and   th theater  dear sir yours of yesterday i received this morning i have seen the noble knights production which you mention and could not but laugh to read of the knights tears i suppose they were produced by the author of the two letters questioning his beauty which he takes some pains in a most ridiculous manner to vindicate he seems patient enough under the confutation of his reason and understanding to which he replies not one word but the beau garcon of sixty cannot bear an attack on his beauty and is forced to write letters to himself like other old beaux from supposed ladies to vindicate what he never possessed the knight has discovered a great deal of malice and uttered a great deal of slander in his last paper but this verse of drydens will fit his performance  in his felonious heart though venom lies it does but touch his irish pen and dies i am etc   this is only under one mans hand but this you may depend upon it is the voice of the people and whereas thou say that thou art so far from having a dusky countenance that all orders of men smile on thee thou putst me in mind of part of a dialogue between monsieur nathaniel paris and his cousin hippolita in the gentleman dancing master of the late mr wycherly it is in the beginning of the third act  mons am i so happy den cousin in the bon quality of making people laugh   hipp mighty happy cousin   mons degrace   hipp indeed   mons nay sans vanity i observe that wheresoever i come i make every body merry sans vanity da   hipp i do believe you do   mons nay as i march in de street i can make de dull apprentie laugh and sneer   hipp this fool is as apt i see as an ill poet to mistake the contempt and scorn of people for applause and admiration   thus far the gentleman dancing master but tell me one thing my dear friend has an owl a dusky countenance most certainly a very reverend dusky countenance now does not an owl wheresoever it appears make every mortal smile  and now if i should call upon thee according to thy pretended desire to see what treatment a ghost would give a mortal i have reason to question very much whether thou would appear to me for thou know i am in the number of those things which during thy whole life time have always been most terrible to thee i mean in the number of thy creditors thou have owed me these two years twelve guineas for the first payment of twelve certain receipts which upon taking the receipts thou did promise to pay in a week but since that time i never could see either the money or the receipts so that if i should enquire for thee the answer that snug thy servant would make would certainly be the ghost will not appear to day  i am etc  letter iv to sir john edgar my excellent friend i come now to consider thy twelfth paper in which thou pretendst to draw pictures for which thou art just as much qualifyed as thou art to criticize for to draw characters and to criticize requires the same talent that is judgment which god and nature have never vouchsafed to endow thee with and therefore all who know thee an errant bungler that is all who do know thee are very well satisfied that they are no more to expect any more resemblance in thy draughts than from a sign post painter nay not the twentieth part so much for no sign post painter was ever yet such a blockhead as to draw the picture of a rat when he designed that of an elephant or to draw the figure of an elephant when he designed that of a rat but now to whom is it not known that thou have given us the picture of a wren instead of that of an eagle and the picture of an eagle instead of that of a wren and after thou have called thy dead friend wren and thy self eagle does not every body know that thou have not the knowledge of adam in thee nor art qualified to give names to creatures agreeable to their natures but as thou art able to draw no body no body can have any occasion to draw thee thy name alone is thy picture and comprehends as severe and as entire a satire in it as boileau says that of the ass does  dont le nom seul en soy comprend une satire thou can draw no picture but it wants a name to distinguish it no one who names thee has occasion to draw any picture of thee  what art not thou the famous distinguisher the celebrated knower of the world and of merit who art continually endeavoring to bespatter and expose ministers of state of admirable abilities and who have done the most important services for their king their country and the whole christian world and among whom i have convincing reasons to believe there are such who are as much thy superiors in solid learning or in polite litterature in wit and graceful courtlike behavior and the fine conversation of gentlemen as they are above thee in sagacity and penetration in the profoundness of state affairs and the depths of politics art thou i say the famous distinguisher the celebrated knower of the world and of merit who at the same time that thou art vainly and impertinently endeavoring to expose and ridicule these illustrious patriots art most ridiculously attempting to make two or three paultry players pass upon the world for men of manly generous elegant ornamental qualities after this need any one care whom it is thou censurest and whom it is thou commendest and yet to make thy judgment manifest still further at the same time that thou art endeavoring to expose those whom the king most confides in and whom he most values thou art at every turn printing thy insipid madrigals in the praise of his majesty and still the burden of thy song is the same with that of an old starling who is moulting his borrowed plumes in a cage dick is a bird for the king dick is a bird for the king but how much preferable to thine is the song of the starling tho it does not mean what it says like thee yet it does not like thee mean something contrary to it the bird itself is not such a beast as not to know that a libel upon all a mans best friends can never be interpreted a panegyric upon the man thus we see that thou never censurest and never commendest by reason and by judgment because reason and judgment are things which thou never had but thy dislike or approbation proceeds perpetually from thy passions thy malice and thy interest but especially from the last which is thy great diana  i come now to an error of thy understanding about which i shall use the more words because thou say thou have so often repeated it and that is it is generally for want of judgment that men set up for the character of being judicious  and here i cannot for my soul forbear talking to thee in the language of thy brother of brentford thou art mighty ignorant poor man my dear friend is very silly i gad he is for to what purpose can this jingle of words serve but to rattle in the noddle of a wrongheaded fellow for was there ever any mortal who was not reckoned a beast and an idiot by his own acquaintance but who set up for the character of being judicious in the profession which he had embraced does not a shoemaker a tailor a hosier set up for the character of being judicious in the nature and fashion and make of shoes and stockings and coats and breeches and cloaks does not a mercer set up for the character of being judicious in the nature and fashion of stuffs and silks and brocades does not a stockjobber or an exchange broker set up for the character of being judicious in the turns the rise and fall of the public funds when ten or more clergymen preach for a vacant benefice does not each of them pretend to be more skilful and judicious in the ways of salvation than his other antagonists would thou fee a lawyer in an important cause who should tell thee seriously that he did not set up for having more judgment than his neighbors in statute and common law would thou trust thy life upon a dangerous crisis in the hands of a physician who should assure thee that he had no more judgment in physic than one of his patients but to come to authors does not every one who publishes a book in any art or science pretend to instruct at least some of his readers but which of his readers can he pretend to instruct but those who are more ignorant than himself in the matters of which he treats but if he supposes that some of his readers are more ignorant than himself in the matters of which he treats does not he set up for the character of being more judicious in those matters than they are  when copernicus published his system of the world did not he pretend to a little more judgment in astronomy than some who had gone before him and others who lived at the same time with him and who still adhered to the piolemaick system when des carts published his system of natural philosophy did not he by those wonderful discoveries of the motion of the earth and others pretend to a little more judgment in that science and to penetrate further into the secrets of nature than those who had gone before him when the celebrated harvey gave the world his treatise of the circulation of the blood could he have obliged and adorned the commonwealth of learning by that noble and useful discovery if he had not set up for the character of having more judgment in anatomy than either his predecessors or his contemporaries and when sir isac newton whose merit is above what the muses themselves can commend obliged and astonished the learned world by his immortal and unparalled treatises those treatises which have made him an honor to his country an advancer of the noblest learning and an enlarger of the empire of the mind what did he pretend to no more judgment in mathematics than the herd of mathematicians  is it not now most apparent that every one sets up for the character of being judicious in his own profession and his own art why then should not that be allowed to a poet which is granted to all the rest and why should it be denied by thee of all men and be denied in a paper in which you are doing the very same thing which you pretend to ridicule in others for are not you pretending to write a paper here for the improvement ofthe stage and how do thou pretend to improve it by endeavoring to impose upon the world according to thy laudable custom and setting up for the character of being more judicious in theatrical matters than most of your readers or by speaking the truth and telling the world that thou art a very silly fellow and an eternal jabberer about matters of which thou understandest not a syllable what is become now of that fine maxim that it is generally for want of judgment that men set up for the character of being judicious why thou errant trisler thou ridiculous maxim monger thou have a hundred such pretty jingles in thy wonderful speculations i mean the speculations which are peculiarly thine and to which thou have let thy mark maxims which are calculated for understandings of the same latitude with thine and which are under the same elevation of pole maxims which showed thee as blind as hector or pompey or caesars offspring that came into the world but yesterday but as i have now some leisure to consider them i will try if by my little art i can couch the cataracts of thy understanding  but the mischief of it is that there is this difference between a four legged puppy and a two legged one that whereas a four legged one is blind but for nine days a two legged one does not only come into the world blind but for the most part continues to be blind when he comes to be an old dog  to this blessed maxim thou art pleased to subjoyn these words every body of any standing in town knows that the dullest and most stupid writers we have had have set up for critics why yes truly this has been the cant for forty years together among persons of thy noble understanding the cry has gone round that it is impossible for any one who has shown himself a critic by his prose to show himself a good poet by his verse which was occasioned first by the late mr rymers publishing a very dull tragedy of edgar after he had published a book in prose in which there was a great deal of good and just criticism it is true indeed edgar was so absurd a monarch that he seemed to be a forerunning type of thy self who were to strut upon the stage in the succeeding century under the same heroic name from this accident the poetasters of the age who believed it their interest to fix a brand upon criticism immediately cried out and made all their disciples repeat after them that no critic could be a poet not considering that one of the greatest of the roman poets and one of the greatest of the french were critics by professon as well as poets and set up for the character of being judicious in their own art nay and had the impudence to appear publicly out of humor with some popular scriblers who had had success but to return to mr rymer whether that gentlemans ill performance proceeded from his want of imagination without which no man can make a poet let him have what judgment he will or from his want of exercise and practice we should have been better able to determine if that judicious gentleman had writ more if mr rymers tragedy is an ill one neither shakespeares or ben johnsons first damatick poems were masterpieces and neither ben nor shakespeare they had left nothing behind them but these would have passed with posterity tor great poets but whatever was the reason of mr rymers miscarriage if these authors had only inferred from it that a man may sometimes have the theory of an art which yet he may not be fully qualifyed to practice with success nothing could have been more just but for them to draw not only a general inference from a particular fact but an inference so very absurd as that a man cannot practice an art with success for no other reason but because he has shown that he understands it was bestial and abominable i am afraid my dear friend that it will be found upon enquiry that the very contrary of this is an eternal truth he who practices an art with success which he does not understand is most infallibly an ill artist notwithstanding all his success and is indebted for that success to the gross ignorance and barbarity of those whom he has the luck to please  if ever that assertion that the dullest and most stupid writers which we have had have set up for critics is proved it must be by thy example for as there is not one author alive who has set up for criticism so much as thou have there is not in all great britain so stupid and so dull a writer as thou art when thou art left to thy self  to make good both the branches of this assertion when old bickerstaff published his tatlers did he set up for a critic did he set up for the character of being judicious or not let us see what he says himself in his dedication to the late mr maynwaring  the general purpose of this paper is to expose the false arts of life and to pull off the disguises of cunning vanity and affectation and to recommend a general simplicity in our dress our discourse and our behavior no man has a better judgment for the discovery or a nobler spirit for the contempt of all imposture than your self which qualities render you the most proper patron for the author of these essays  thus far old bickerstaff now this as i take it is setting up for something more than the character of being barely judicious it is setting up for sagacity it is setting up for penetration which are the accomplishments and the perfections of judgment now if it be true that it is generally for want of judgment that a man sets up for the character of being judicious what shall we say of the man who sets up for the character of sagacity for the character of penetration for such a one arrogates a hundred times more to himself than one who sets up for the character of being barely judicious in passing his judgment on the works of authors to know the hearts of men requires infinitely more capacity than barely to know books a book alas has but one meaning whatever it speaks it thinks but the heart of man has folds and doubles and recesses innumerable yet through all these have thou pretended to pierce and consequently have pretended to criticism of a nobler and more difficult nature than any author living but though thou did pretend to do all this what thou really did of it was by the sagacity and penetration of others and when thou had got ingenious tools to write thee into an income of two thousand pounds a year thou coulst not be satisfied till like the most dull and stupid of all writers thou had writ thy self out of it again  the courtship which sir martin marall made to mrs millesant and that which thou did formerly make to dame fortune and to madam fame will certainly make a parallel that will run upon all four sir martin had a mind to mrs millesant but not having capacity nor address to gain her he prevailed upon warner to do that for him but to do it in such a way that sir martin was to have the credit and the benefit of it now the lady being a lover of music sir martin was to give her a lesson upon the theorbo and a song in order to this sir martin is to appear in a balcony at a distance from her with a lute in his hand and the motions of a thrummer and the grimaces of a singer while warner is to sing and to play for him behind the curtain well all this was very well concerted but the success of all was to depend upon the signal agreed upon between them and that was that sir martin should leave off his grimaces and his thrummings upon his dumb lute upon the ringing of a bell but the foolish knight was so full of his mistress and himself that though the bell rung twice yet his hand and jaws still went and exposed him to the scorn of his mistress and the chambermaid  i will leave thee my dear friend to apply all this to thy self but i cannot forbear taking notice that it was very imprudent in thee not to leave off upon the bells ringing twice that is upon the bell that rung for mr maynwarings and mr addisons funeral  i come now to some of the pretended facts of which thou have been pleased to accuse me and i will begin with that which relates to mr congreve and mr addison upon whom thou say i have been more severe than upon any other persons as for being severe upon mr congreve it is a figure in speech which jeremy says in love for love interlards the greatest part of his conversation as for mr addison i must confess i did write the remarks upon cato but i did not basely flatter and sawn upon mr addison while he was living and then more basely insult him as soon as he was dead i did not while he was living write a flattering fulsom dedication to him in which i made him a thousand times greater than my self and then as soon as he was dead write a flattering fulsom dedication to my self in which i made my self a thousand times greater than him a little below there is another extraordinary figure where thou pretendst to insinuate that i have been used by some people so as a man of honor ought not to be used who are those people thou can not thou dare not name them because then the lie would appear too gross and palpable i will tell thee whom i have used at that rate and that is thy friend thy priest thy worshipper thy viceroy thou either know or ought to know that i have beat him and i do not know but i might have been provoked to do as much by his wooden god if he had dared to offer to my face what he has basely writ thou say that my pamphlet is so cruel that it could be writ by none but a coward i believe i have given other sort of proofs of my courage than one who in the time of a bloody war for twenty years together took the kings pay as a soldier and never was in any action than one who for twenty years together fought as he writ by proxy the cruelty of a coward consists not in words but actions then then was the cruelty then was the cowardice when upon a certain night in november last three villainous footpads robbed a poor defenseless passenger of all that he had and said that they did it by a deputation from thee and thou were afterward pleased to abet this action and call those footpads men of manly elegant generous ornamental qualities hinc illae lachrymoe from hence arose those crocodile tears which thou have showed in some of thy papers  did thou not snew thy courage in a notable manner by giving such language in thy theaters after having declared against single combat by thy lucubrations and against siege and battle by thy conduct was it not bravely and heroically done to call upon both the living and the dead to revenge thy cause upon one of sixty five and to endeavor to set both the kings horse and foot guards upon one of sixty five for my part i have always firmly believed that i have more true courage than any one than whom i have more understanding for if fortitude is a virtue of which i know no man who doubts it must depend upon the reason and not upon the complexion but if it depends upon the reason then the stronger the reason is the stronger must be the virtue and i have always thought that as god and nature have given to man the dominion over beast they have so far given to reasonable men the dominion over blockheads that they are rather born to scorn them than to fear them and i appeal to all my acquaintance in town of whom there are several living of  0 and  0 years standing if these sentiments were ever contradicted by any action or accident of my life  but if by the continual fears thou have given me thou meanst as thou seemst to insinuate my apprehensions of persons to whom i may owe money thou of all men have as little reason to upbraid me with these fears as the others for who was it that lay skulking so many years at the tiltyard sutlers when he was so strongly possessed with fear that he could not think himself in safety unless he had the horse and footguards for his security when the late facetious daniel purcel gave him the name of major general hide and the chief maxim of his life seemed to be qui latuit been vixit if i had the misfortune to be an insolvent debtor i should have this apology to make for my self that my insolvency would not be owing to any extravagance or want of taking pains but to the hard not to say the unjust usage which i have met with in the world and in great part to your injustice and barbarity and the injustice and barbarity of those who derived their power from you the being an insolvent debtor is rather to be pitied than condemned when it has not been occasioned either by profuseness or idleness but tho being in debt is both odious and contemptible in one who is at the same time a squanderer a bankrupt and an oppressor but yet to show you that i am not in the condition which you imagine i have for these last four years lodged continually in the neighborhood of white hall and i appeal to the honorable board of greencloth if during that time so much as one complaint as been preferred against me  i should now say something of the falsehoods of which you accuse me in my two former letters and of the ingratitude of which thou pretendest to accuse me for writing against those who have endeavored to serve me as these two letters will be shortly followed by a fifth and a sixth i shall endeavor to show in them who are the lovers of truth and who are the slanderers who are the benefactors and who the unjust and oppressors and then if with thy little understanding thou have not lost all sense of shame i shall cause thy dusky countenance to turn red as the morning does or as a lobster boiled  but having said more already than i designed to do at present and you having heard more than thou had a mind to hear i shall take my leave for a little time only adding that as thou have formed a fantom in thy mind which thou would pass upon the world for thy friend and which every impartial man who has seen it has declared to be just as like to me as a wren is like to the late mr addison or as thou art like to an eagle i shall by way of gratitude or acknowledgment subjoin to these letters the picture of my dear friend and i appeal to all who shall see it if i am not the happier painter of the two and draw the livelier resemblance and so at present my very worthy friend i heartily bid thee farewell  the picture of sir john edgar sir john edgar the county of  in ireland is of a middle stature broad shoulders thick legs a shape like the picture of somebody over a farmers chimney a short chin a short nose a short forehead a broad flat face and a dusky countenance he used to compare himself to an eagle and to oblige the first fool that he met with to give it under his hand that he was so but neither his nose nor his eyes nor his discernment nor his broad flat face nor his dusky countenance were held to be aquiline he was believed to be in all these more like to another bird than an eagle yet with such a shape and such a face he discovered at sixty that he took himself for a beauty and appeared to be more mortified upon his being told he was ugly than he was by any reflection that was ever made upon his honor or his understanding  he is a gentleman born witness himself of a very honorable family certainly of a very ancient one for his ancestors flourished in tipperary long before the english ever set foot in ireland he has testimony of this more authentic than the heralds office or than any human testimony for god has marked him more abundantly than he did cain and stamped his native country upon his face his understanding his writings his actions his passions and above all his vanity the hibernian brogue is still upon all these tho long habitude and length of days have worn it from off his tongue  he is the greatest pretender but one of the age in which he lives a pretender both to understanding and virtue but especially to the latter but some malicious people have thought that he made constant court to that venerable lady not out of any affection which he had for her person but because he was struck by the charms of the jointure which he believed might follow her and they were confirmed in this opinion by observing the quarrels which he had every day with one or other of her four daughters yet this pretended passion did him great service it was to him major domo factotum housekeeper cook butler tailor and sempstress because we live in a noble climate where persons who are universally known to be cheats and sharpers keep their coaches by being so  yet to one of the daughters of that venerable lady he paid great respect in public videlicet to madam justice and to gain her favor and obtain her protection he thought it not beneath him to admit the meanest of her servants and officers into the greatest familiarity with him so that there was no respect of persons among them but it was jack and tom and will and hal and dick with them but he always combined with these her servants to injure and abuse her in private and unknown to her played a hundred pranks with them to the prejudice of her interest and reputation which were not long kept so very private but the world took notice that neither he nor the servants cared one farthing for the mistress they pretended to serve he would very often do extravagant things very seldom generous ones and never by his good will just ones yet was he a great pretender to generosity but generosity with him was squandring away his money upon knaves and fools who flattered him thus a bubble is a very generous creature to the shark who preys upon him and a beggar is generous to the vermin that feed upon him  he had that seeming respect for the laws of his country and appeared to be so delighted with them that though he had the happiness of enjoying them as much as the most zealous of his fellow subjects even as those to whom one may say the zeal of the law has eaten them up yet that he might be sure the correspondence between them might be for life he had through a greatness of soul peculiar to him assumed a noble resolution that would never suffer him to pay any one a farthing till it came to execution yet notwithstanding all this he was not satisfied but was always crying out law law more law more law  he appears to be mighty zealous for the rights of the people and to be terribly afraid of the return of the old aristocracy by which he has got the nick name with some of aristocracy edgar no man had ever so much in his mouth benevolence and beneficence to mankind as he which to his creditors seems a great fable for say they since he hates us who have most obliged him to that degree that he cannot endure to see our faces how can he possibly love the rest he used one while to call himself the christian hero till it grew a public jest for the people would not allow him to be a hero because tho he had been a soldier so many years in the time of a bloody war he never had been present either at siege or battle and he could not possibly they used to say be a christian because he used constantly to spend the mornings in cursing the household of faith though they came in shoals to his levees out of pure zeal to exhort him to do his duty  he valued himself exceedingly upon being a great improver and a great reformer though the truth of the matter is that he never had half skill enough to improve any thing nor half virtue enough to reform any thing during the time that he was governor of the beargarden the diversions of that place were more stupid and barbarous than ever they were known to be before and the wild beasts more mischievous and untractable and he was especially so far from reforming any thing that it was generally observed that the greater part of those who had been most intimate with him were very far from being more virtuous than their neighbors though he never failed of doing one thing in order to the making them so and that is entering them in the school of adversity  now as for temperance another daughter of the abovementioned venerable lady he caresses and courts her all the livelong day and compliments her as the queen of morals and the empress of life but as soon as the night approaches then sparkling champaign puts an end to her reign  he judiciously believes that by preaching abstinence up by daylight he has made an honorable composition for his drinking three bottles by candlelight  we may say of his fortitude what butler said of hudibrass wit he may be master of a very great deal but through abundance of modesty is shie of making any parade of it but reserves it for an occasion which no body can diving for he has declared against single combat by his writings and against siege and battle by his conduct and actions that is by staying at home in a time of war with a commission in a pennyless pocket and choosing rather to run the risk of being taken prisoner by the english than of being killed by the french  now as for prudence the fourth daughter he has a magnanimity which teaches him utterly to despise her and to regard her as an abandoned person that prostitutes her self to the lowest mechanics he therefore makes it the business of his life to affront her and abuses her in all his conversation his writings and his actions of which there can be ho stronger testimony than his mortally disobliging his cordial though partial friends who raised him and going over to a party whom he had exasperated beyond any possibility of a sincere reconcilement  he is so great a friend to union that almost all orders and ranks of men are united in his person for he has been poet orator soldier officer projector newsmonger casuist scribe politician fish monger knight and gold finder and what is never enough to be admired he has been all these by virtue of other mens capacities like a very patentee he has performed the functions of all these by proxy and by deputy as an author he writ by proxy as a soldier by proxy he fought he is so given to do every thing by proxy and by deputy that one would swear he lies with his mistress by proxy and by deputy as several honest worthy gentlemen of his antiquity are used to lie with theirs  tho no man in great britain is so fit a subject for satire as himself yet has he been always writing waggish lampoons upon others and whenever he exposes a lord in one of his libels he has got a trick of affronting him ten times more by way of begging his pardon  he has been always begging something of the government and tho he has obtained ten times more of it than he deserved yet he grumbling thinks they have given him nothing because he has retained nothing and is outragiously angry with some of the great officers of the crown because they have refused to wast the whole time of their administration in pouring water into a sieve  he had one while as i hinted above obtained a patent to be governor of the beargarden tho that patent was invalid and void by virtue of a previous statute yet when he thought himself established in that post he chose a bear a baboon and a wolf for his deputy governors but partly growing lazy and being partly convinced that the deputies were fitter for government than the principal he abandoned all to them who conducting themselves by their bestial appetites played such pranks that both governors and deputies were all removed and the beargarden turned into a theater which conduct of his puts me in mind of one sempronius a roman knight who was made director of the ludi fescennini a rough sort of beargarden drama in use among the uncultivated romans before they were polished by the grecian arts into which employment he introduced three wretches as his deputies who were the utter ruin of that diversion for these four persons had not among them all as much judgment as a ballad maker and yet upon having this paultry office conferred upon him sempronius most vainly and impertinently usurped the name of censor which coming to alarm the true censors they inquired into his life upon which finding him to be the greatest fourbe and the greatest impostor that had appeared among them since the foundation of the city they turned him with disgrace out of his government dismounted him and took his horse from him and not contented with this banished him from rome it self and upon his departure caused the same general lustration to be made that was used when a certain boding broad flat duskyfacd prodigy had been hooted from out the walls  postscript if upon perusing this piece of painting or upon reading the preceding letters any honest impartial gentlemen shall say as they did upon reading the two former that i ought not to enter into the private concerns of life i desire them to consider that these letters tho written in prose were designed to be just and legitimate satires and that the private concerns of life are the just and adaequate subjects of satire and make the chief beauties of the ancient satirists that is of lucilius horace persius and juvenal  the unmasking of hypocrites is the great business of satire according to that of horace in the first satire of his second book   est lucilius ausus primus in hunc operis componere carmina morem detrabere and pellem nitidus qua quisque per ora cederet introrsum turpis  but how is it possible for the most part to unmask a hypocrite without entering into the private concerns of life  juvenal tells us in his first satire that all human actions all the passions of men all their desires and all their inclinations are the constant subjects of his satire  quidquid agunt homines votum timor ira voluptas gaudia discursus nostri est farrago libelli now will any one pretend that the private concerns of life are not included in these verses  i must confess the celebrated french satirist has been a little more retentive but yet they must know very little of him who are to be told that he sometimes enters into the private concerns of life which once more are the just and adaequate subjects of satire but then the satirist ought to take care that the censures are always just and that either the vices satirizd are very flagrant and of pernicious example or the persons egregious hypocrites  finis
