timor dei nobilitas    the story of lady juliana harley  a novel  in letters  by mrs griffith  vol ii  london printed for t cadell in the strand  mdcclxxvi  the story of lady juliana harley letter xxxviii mrs stanley to charles evelyn why thou dear don all dons excelling from don bellianis of greece to don dismallo thickskullo halfwitto of spain how shall i be able to accommodate my style to thy romantic strains upon my life charles a few such lovers as you would be sufficient to restore the golden age of chivalry once more and reinstate our mortal sex in their former rank of deities altars and oblations would soon become the ton and the grand tour be exchanged for pilgrimages to our shrines  but for my own part i should never be able to endure such formal modes of proceeding  i should hate to be stuck up in a niche to be prayed to i dare swear that as music is generally a concommitant of devotion i should be tempted on the sound of a fiddle to step down take my kneeling votary by the hand and frisk a cotillon with him  your julianas and your emmas are the right sort of people for such platonic courtship  gentle creatures who are apt to sigh and look pale by the hour without being able to tell why  but now to relieve part of your fond anxiety i shall acquaint you that the fair julianas health is better than when i wrote last to you though i cannot flatter you with the least hope that her disposition toward you is the least amended by her getting the better of her indisposition  and therefore my dear dear brother let me seriously entreat you to resolve upon conquering this same  i was very near calling it a nonsensical passion  hopeless you acknowledge it to be and there needs nothing more to render it synonymous  why you outdo petrarch himself in constancy  for dame laura notwithstanding the sublimity of her virtue coquetted a little with him now and then and whenever she thought that her cruelty would kill  or cure him  she treated him with a kind glance or a few civil speeches to keep him and his hopes too from expiring  have you met with this charming book the life of petrarch i mean  it is universally and i will say justly admired because mr stanley who you know brother ecce signum has a good taste agees with me in thinking it one of the most entertaining works that has been published these many years  and yet i would not have you read it because i fear the delicate and tender sentiments it abounds with might serve to superrefine you too much  i am all impatience to know whether miss harley went with you to ireland and how you like the people and the country etc etc etc  i showed your letter to emma and she seemed to feel a little jealousy at your not addressing it to her instead of me but i told her what i believe to be true that the hint was equally meant sor us both and may say with regard to madame dupont that it was needless to either for from a thorough knowledge of her character in which i confess i had been much deceived we have conceived a mutual dislike to her  this however she either does not or will not see for she continues to visit my sister desmond very frequently who is much too gentle to express her disapprobation of madame by any stronger means than cold civility which would be to me as forbidding as rudeness  but madame laughs away with sir james and takes not the least notice of emmas pouting  upon my honor if i was in emmas situation i should do something more than pout i am sure i should go so far as to shut my doors against her and indeed every one ought to discountenance her for it is certainly true that lady morton who was one of the fondest mothers is at this moment boarded and lodged in a little hovel near london to prevent her being thrown into gaol for debts which she contracted to indulge the vanity of her worthless daughter who neither sees nor affords her any other kind of consolation  from my heart i pity the young man who is married to her  a bad daughter never did or will make a good wife  a defect in principle runs through the whole mass in morals as well as chemistry gratitude is the most natural of all virtues because it is the first affection that children become susceptible of  do you know that emma and mr stanley are both jealous of our correspondence though i show them your letters  but not my own  for i hate to be corrected and my husband is a critic you know and so adieu  my dear charles lucy stanley p s lady juliana is gone to her brothers seat at richmond for a few days    letter xxxix william stanley to charles evelyn though you have changed hands and seem more inclined to address yourself to lucy than me i will not even to her my other better self relinquish the pleasure i have always received from your correspondence and though she and i are but one in the common interests of life i must insist upon preserving a separate and exclusive claim to the continuance of your former friendship  the fullness of my heart requires a confidant  happiness admits of participation more than sorrow   for grief is proud and makes its owner stout while felicity looks humbly round for objects on which it may diffuse itself grief contracts but joy dilates the mind  then let me pour into your breast the effusions of my own and tell my friend with transport tell him there never was a happier man than your brother  o charles the treasures of my lucys mind have been concealed till now beneath the mask of gaiety she hid the tenderest noblest feelings of the heart the justest sentiments and the most perfect female understanding  i glory in doing justice to her sex  wherefore do blockheads affect to compliment a woman of sense by saying she has a masculine understanding learning cannot bestow either sense or genius if it could we should not have so many drones and boobies issue from our colleges  sense is the common of two and not confined to either sex  suppose it then equally bestowed on both women must surely have the advantage over us the purity of their minds and morals must render it less sophisticate than ours which is even in our early youth debauched by vicious indulgences and clogged with scholastic systems  did you imagine that i should ever become such a champion for the ladies but what cannot a charming woman do the discovery of your sisters uncommon merits which were concealed by modesty alone have rendered me such an enthusiast with regard to women that i cannot address a chambermaid without some degree of respect  you may laugh if you please but i speak truth upon my honor  is miss harrison a woman of sense if she be i should wish you were united to her i think you formerly mentioned her being very lively  what a charm when added to propriety and gentleness of manners  i sincerely long to see you as happy as myself if that be possible for i cannot help doubting whether to take her for all in all there is such another woman upon earth as my lucy  it would be the art of sinking to mention any other subject i shall therefore conclude with entreating to hear from you speedily and subscribe myself  your happy friend w stanley  letter xl charles evelyn to william stanley dublin most willingly my friend do i return to my colors and renew a correspondence from which i have ever received the sincerest pleasure though no part of it ever afforded me more than your last letter  o stanley how much are you to be envied but envy is a mean contemptible vice and utterly incompatible with friendship i therefore do not envy but rejoice in your felicity though certain that i am for ever barred from tasting bliss like yours for well i know that heartfelt happiness is only to be found in a tender and virtuous connection with the object of our love and esteem and that alas can never be my lot  my youth must pass away in gloomy dreary pining discontent would it were passed and that like aetna though my bosom flamed my head was crowned with snow  here let me drop the painful subject and never never reassume it more  after a very agreeable journey which would have been still more so had we not been encumbered with miss harley  heavens that any thing which bears that name should be to me unpleasing  we arrived at holyhead  but i shall not attempt to describe the delightfully romantic wildness of the country through which we passed to it  from thence we embarked for dublin and without storm tempest or any other sinister accident arrived there in about eight hours as miss harley has taken up her abode at captain harrisons i have declined his friendly entreaties to become his guest but am lodged very near his house in kildarestreet  yes stanley miss harrison is very sensible she has what i call a true feminine understanding and is therefore more capable of inspiring love than those ladies who are complimented with a masculine one for i must dissent from your opinion that there is no characteristic distinction between the understandings of the sexes  manly sense has something awful in it when dr johnson speaks we listen with respect and admiration and feel our minds impressed with such an attentive kind of veneration as i imagine was paid to the oracles of old when mrs montagu in the purest and most elegant language delivers sentiments equally just and sublime as his we are surprised and delighted the gracefulness of her manner seems to add beauty to her thoughts her words sink into our hearts like the softest sounds of the most perfect harmony and produce the same placid effects  i have now illustrated my opinion by the two most striking characters in point of understanding that this or any other age has produced the difference between masculine and feminine understandings appears to me as perfectly distinct as the contrasted style of excellence which is observable in the apollo belvidere and the venus of medicis  i am extremely distressed by miss harleys conduct or rather misconduct  she certainly obtruded herself upon the harrisons contrary to their inclinations though their humanity and good breeding would not permit them to refuse her accompanying them to ireland during our journey and ever since our arrival here she has seemed to affect a particular attachment to me yet talks perpetually in an ambiguous and rancorous style of lady juliana  simple woman were i even indifferent to her charming sisterinlaw i should detest her for the malignant disposition she hourly betrays  she throws out frequent hints of her having something particular to communicate to me but i am resolved never to listen to the envenomed tale for such i am sure it would be  in a short time i shall be freed from the irksomeness of her company as captain harrison and i have agreed to make a tour of this country and visit some of the natural beauties it contains  this scheme i trust will answer a double purpose for i have such a perpetual source of disquiet in my own breast that rest is grown painful to me and a state of agitation only affords me relief by rescuing me as it were from myself  in a few days i shall answer lucys lively letter and am to her and you a sincerely affectionate friend and brother  c evelyn  letter xlii miss harley to madame dupont dublin o maria how do i curse the day that i left my own country for this land of savages  though to be just i must allow that the once highly favored evelyn is a more inhuman being than any i have yet seen here  what an escape had you my dear girl of this same isicle i really begin to think that his heart is soused in snow as madame de lenclos says of sevigne which neither your bright eyes or mine can thaw i am sincerely sorry that i have given myself so much trouble about such an insensible wretch  i could almost go mad with vexation if it were not for the comfortable remembrance of his having slipped through your fingers when you thought yourself almost sure of him  pardon me maria for confessing that this circumstance abates my mortification a little  to you i will further own that i was prompted full as much by spite as love to endeavor at this conquest and i would still give a finger nay a whole limb to rob that affected insipid lady juliana of his affections even if i did not care six pence for the man  heavens how i hate her and lady desmond i am sure they are both hypocrites  but the men are such idiots as to admire these flat pictures of stilllife and prefer them even to you or me  but i beg pardon for abusing your friend lady desmond for though i am certain you cannot really like her yet i hear you are vastly intimate  for my own part i detest the whole race of the evelyns next to my sisterinlaw  you will i dare say expect some account of these harrisons that i came over with  the girl is naturally lively and tolerably agreeable i fancied at first that she was in love with evelyn and hated her accordingly but i begin now to think i was mistaken though she professes a tender friendship for him  ridiculous  captain harrison is handsome and wellbred but has a strong turn to ridicule which i believe is a national qualification  he sometimes rallies evelyn who is really the knight of the sorrowful countenance upon his melancholy and reserve but his rallery has no effect  how should it nothing can penetrate that obdurate heart  i now wish that i had bestowed my affections on the captain my fortune at least would have been a desirable object to him though it is none to the savage evelyn  but it is too late to think of that at present for both the brother and sister have observed my attachment to this iron man  i dont know why but i dont believe either of the harrisons like me though they are extremely civil to me but that is no proof of regard from the people of this country as their hospitality is unbounded to strangers who generally laugh at and despise them for their officious kindness  i shall avail myself of their generofity by staying here some time if it were only to persecute evelyn for alas i am persuaded that all my perseverance will answer no other end  write to me my dear maria and give me a full and true account of every thing that you think will raise my spirits and enable me to support the mortifications i daily suffer  you know the sort of intelligence from whence alone i can derive comfort  how does your caro sposo is he as civil and as silly as usual or has he assumed the lordly airs of an english husband you were very fortunate maria in meeting with such a pis aller     dont be angry my dear girl for i am so much out of temper that i cannot help being peevish even to you i really am nevertheless your sincere friend  anne harley  letter xlii lady juliana harley to mrs stanley richmond the transient gleams of returning health and cheerfulness which i boasted to my lucy are again vanished like the morning dews before the rising sun  the joy i felt at seeing a much loved and long absent brother was of that species that i hoped might have been indulged without fearing to taste of those bitter dregs that have ever been largely mingled in my cup for above these three weeks in this sweet retirement with him and his friend lord summers did i enjoy such a tranquil kind of happiness as made me almost forget that i had been wretched  the unhappy separation between our parents on account of their religion had occasioned the same misfortune between my brother and me  my mother who was a catholic when she parted from my father took me with her to dijon where i remained till heaven was pleased to deprive me of this most indulgent parent and teach my youthful heart to feel too early sorrow  at twelve years old i returned into england to my father who though possessed of every virtue had an austerity of manners that rendered him more the object of my fear than love my brother was all kindness to me heard all my little complaints and soothed my private griefs judge then my lucy how i loved him  when i was about seventeen we underwent a second separation  he was sent to travel  had he staid in england i think i should not have been what now alas i am  but that is past  after what i have said will you not doubt my veracity when i tell you that within these ten days that once kind and tender brother is become cold distant and reserved to me and treats me like an alien to his heart and all because i cannot bestow mine upon his friend lord somners  hourly i am persecuted with the flippant addresses of this ungenerous peer  how highly is mr evelyns conduct toward me exalted by so marked a contrast  lord somners is about seven and thirty and has lived abroad these twenty years his dress manners and attendants are all exotic his person is far from being disagreeable but then he seems to think of it more highly than it deserves and has sometimes dropped hints of my being engaged in a prior attachment from my regarding his attractions with so much indifference he bows sighs and sings in a regular routine and is in short the most complete petitmaitre i ever had the misfortune to converse with  you will naturally imagine that i might easily silence such a lover or at least bear his impertinence with silent contempt but with all the seeming volatility i have described he possesses a dark subtle and i fear a treacherous heart  he has gained the strongest ascendancy over my brothers mind and is perpetually poisoning it with the most acrimonious resentment against me  how this affair will end with regard to the latter i mean i know not but this i am certain of that no power on earth shall ever compel me to enter into any engagement with such a man as lord somners having once been led a trembling victim to the altar where all my peace and happiness were sacrificed i never will renew that scene of guilt and its attendant misery again  i would quit richmond instantly and go  i know not whither  but that i fear to offend my brother my tenderness for him is so mingled with respect that there is but one subject on which i should feel it possible to dissent from his will or to know that i had one of my own i ask no dominion even over myself but of the negative kind and surely every independent being has a right to that at least yet if my brothers infatuation should tempt him to abandon me what would become of your unhappy friend  j harley  letter xliii mrs stanley to lady juliana harley i wish i was a conjurer for your sake my dear juliana but as i happen not to be invested with any of the occult qualities and do not know a word of the cabala i find it impossible to comprehend your incomprehensible ladyship  i confess myself such an absolute ignoramus as not to understand why your health and spirits should decline because your brother has proposed your marrying a foolish lord whom you dislike  for my own part i think i love charles evelyn as well as any sister loves her brother but had he taken it into his head to propose my marrying any noble lord whose name and title was registered in the court calendar i should have answered no brother i thank you i beg leave to choose for myself and not be directed by an almanac  and had he thought proper to grow sulky upon such denial i might have been a little sorry for the disappointment of his vanity but i will venture to say i should neither have lost my rest appetite or spirits upon the occasion  and yet you know that till the other day i was but a simple spinster and you are a grave and i wish i could say wise relict and have therefore a better right to judge for yourself particularly as i believe your inclinations were not much consulted in your former connection  indeed lady juliana you treat this matter much too seriously and from thence it has acquired a degree of importance which it is by no means entitled to  surely you have not only a negative but an absolute power over yourself and if your brother is worthy of that respectful tenderness you feel for him he cannot resent your exerting your right where your happiness and yours only is concerned  be assured of this my good friend that it is our submission which enables men to become tyrants  we have ourselves only to blame  and yet you gentle ones are not entitled to the merits you affect to have as you yield more from indolence than resignation and never comply without repining  there is emma for instance who i think has caught the sighing sickness from your ladyship she spends all her mornings in lamenting the mortification she will suffer in the evening from receiving madame dupont and some others of sir jamess gang whom i think as bad as highwaymen merely because she has not resolution to order her doors to be shut against them  in vain do i remonstrate to her that an appearance of habitual melancholy is more likely to alienate her husbands affections than her venturing to express her dislike of his companions can possibly do  she answers  she never did nor ever will oppose his inclinations  so broods over this moral sentiment and sits pining all day in a corner  like to the culver on the bared bough perhaps it is because i am plentifully gifted with both that i think spirits and spirit too absolutely necessary to render the marriage state happy   not minds of melancholy strain still silent or that still complain can the dear bondage bless as well may heavenly concert spring from two old lutes with never a string or none besides the bass i would not wish you to imagine from what i have said that i have a mind to play termagant myself or that i would wish any woman i love to undertake the role far from it i assure you  but i would wish my whole sex to think act and speak like rational beings and not furnish the men with an excuse for treating us like babies while we are young and despising us as idiots when we are no longer so  but to return to your present situation  i would by all means advise you to throw off the selfimposed restraint you labor under and seriously acquaint your brother with your dislike to lord somners at the same time gently requesting that he will prevent his right honourableness from persecuting you with his addresses if after this they should still persist in their obstinacy order your carriage directly and do not stay moping and fretting at richmond  i rejoice that any thing has made you think favorably of my poor charles for my own part i condemn his conduct as being infinitely too romantic but the object or heroine of his romance ought to see his folly in a kinder light and i am pleased you do so how much do i wish it was in my power to improve that kindness into love  be assured i would not desire to do so if i did not think that your union would contribute as much to your own happiness as to his remember my dear juliana that this is the first time i have ever gravely touched upon this subject  and i will now drop it for ever if it offends you  i know i need not apologize for the length of my letter  country ladies love to have a great deal for their money and i am sure you will esteem this a tolerable pennyworth  adieu my dear languid friend rouse your spirits and come amongst us or i shall very shortly step to richmond and use a little gentle force to draw you from beneath the mournful cypress or the weeping willow  l stanley  letter lxiv madame dupont to miss harley surely my dear miss harley this unfortunate passion of yours has disturbed your mind a little for in your sober senses you could not have imagined that i ever had any serious thoughts of such an animal as charles evelyn  slipped through my fingers say you give me leave to tell you that if i had chosen to have held him neither you nor your delicate sisterinlaw would have been able to have wrested him from me  but i hate your water gruel whining sentimental men and therefore never could have been your rival  however i sincerely pity you because i am convinced that yours is an hopeless passion and to be sure it is rather mortifying to be rejected especially at a time of life when one cannot hope to make many new conquests  excuse me my dear but after thirty you know the bloom does wear off a little and then the fruit is not quite so tempting  my pisaller as you are pleased to call him is the very best husband in the universe  foreigners in general are better tempered than englishmen and not so much infected with jealousy  this is a lucky circumstance for me as i confess that i have still a little remain of coquetry and cannot find in my heart to quarrel with a man for thinking me handsomer than his wife particularly when poor lady desmond is so horridly mortified at the preferences i receive  the secret is out and i know you will thank me for communicating it to you  your sisterinlaw is at her brothers seat at richmond  lord somners has proposed for her a great match i assure you and which she poor simpleton has refused because she dont like the man  as if dans ce siecle it signified who one married provided there be a good fortune to help one to support it a handsome woman will always have a number of admirers and she must be hard to please indeed if in a crowd she dont meet with one she can like marriage formerly my mother says used to put an end to gallantry but in these happpier times it commences even with our bridal days and many a girl who passed unnoticed while she was only miss is courted and followed from the moment she is styled mrs  therefore my dear harley get rid of the forbidding appellation as soon as you possibly can  the hibernian swains are generally supposed ready to assist a monied lass upon such emergencies and i am sure you cannot make a better use of your fortune than by sinking the opprobrious title of an old maid under the name of mrs  any thing   apropos of hibernia  i wish you could find out some part of that country no matter how wild or remote where i could place my mother to diet and lodge at a cheap rate  for my dear dupont is sometimes unhappy at hearing of her distressed situation and if she was removed into another kingdom he might know nothing of her circumstances and i would endeavor to persuade him that she was perfectly happy  besides the old lady has still some friends living who speak hardly of my want of attention toward her and though i dont value the censure of the world my husband is made uneasy by it for he wishes every one to think as well of me as he does himself but you know that is impossible in such an illnatured world and i therefore only laugh at all their malicious reflections on my conduct  i perfectly agree with you that the ladies juliana and desmond are a couple of hypocrites but i think mrs stanley worse than either of them though hypocrisy indeed is not one of her failings  she has written me a card in answer to an invitation of mine civilly forbidding me her house while lady desmond who has i own some cause to hate me receives me with such an icy kind of politeness as would freeze or rather petrify me if the warmth of sir jamess reception did not make ample amends for the bleakness of her ladyships air and manner  i am grown extravagantly fond of play  unluckily dupont dislikes it  in truth he knows nothing of the matter but his politeness makes him easily prevailed upon to fill up a corner at a whisttable while i enjoy the delights of loo or pharo without control  you dont know how much you are obliged to me for devoting so much of my time to you at present for as i am the only female of my party i am sure they wait for me and so does my carriage to whisk me to them  adieu my dear harley remember to enquire for some place to stuff my mother into and believe me  yours m dupont p s if lady juliana had not marred her own fortune by refusing lord somners i should have done it for her by dropping a few suspicious hints to his lordship who is an intimate acquaintance of duponts and frequently visits here  there is no pleasure like demolishing a prude  but half my satisfaction is destroyed by knowing that she dont like the man  yet it may mortify her pride a little to know that he thinks ill of her  it shall be done    letter xlv mr stanley to mr evelyn i take up the pen to address you in the same manner that queen annes ministers used to lord peterborough and write rather at than to you  i hope you are by this time set out on your tour and think it highly probable that this may find you measuring some of those stupendous lusus naturae vulgarly called the giants causeway  as if dame nature who is an admirable oeconomist ever used two means to produce one end and first made giants merely to lift these massy piles of quarry which most assuredly grew in the very spot where you will find them we have some such superstition i think with regard to stonehenge also but like all other traditions it is only believed by the ignorant though by the way the learned have not yet been able to tell us how those huge pillars were conveyed to salisbury plain and i can hardly suppose them to have started up there of their own accord though there are a sort of philosophers who liberally endow stupid and sluggish matter with both thought and action  now for matters less conjectural  the case is pretty plain i think with regard to miss harley yet on the face of the evidence i am apprehensive she will be nonsuited for i well remember that hers was not a beautiful one some dozen years ago  i pity her sincerely however all unsuccessful passions are entitled to compassion and the distresses of a female interest our humanity much more than those of our own sex there certainly cannot be a more awkward or mortifying situation for a woman than that of being in love with a man who dislikes her there is in this as well as many other cases an unjust distinction made between the sexes as there is a certain degree of disgrace attached to the idea of a rejected female while a man may be refused by half a dozen ladies and pay his addresses to a seventh with as good a grace as if she had been the primary object of his affections  i am ready to agree with you with regard to the effects produced by different modes of masculine and feminine elocution for that is the sole distinction you have made in your favorite instance between the two great geniuses you have named  there is no sex in souls and though milton has been pleased to tell us that on woman nature has  bestowed too much of ornament in outward show elaborate of inward less exact for well i understand in the prime end of nature her the inferior in the mind and inward faculties which most excel i must beg leave to dissent from him nay more to say that he accuses providence of a particular partiality in the disposal of his intellectual gifts between the human race which is by no means visible in any other part of the animal creation all instinctive qualities appearing to the full as strong and as acute in the female as the male through every species of the animal world  why then should we conceive that the highest order of beings that inhabit this terrestrial globe should be more unequally dealt with it is clear at least that milton did not reason from analogy  superior strength of body appears to be the portion of the male through all degrees of existence from hence and hence only they have arrogated to themselves an authoritative command over the weaker part of their species  but providencc ever equal in the distribution of its bounty to his creatures amply atoned for this seeming partiality by endowing the female part of the creation with beauty to subdue the strong tame the ferocious and make their boasted strength of no other value but as it serves for the preservation and protection of the favorite female and her helpless offspring  i think i have now established the sexes upon an equal scale and fixed my proposition beyond the reach of controversy i mean with regard to their natural endowments without the least attention to the adventitious circumstances of education which i am thoroughly persuaded makes all the difference between what is styled a masculine and feminine understanding from you who are a lover i cannot expect any opposition to the opinion i have advanced but rather a folio of thanks for having raised the dignity of your fairones nature to an equality with that of the selfnamed lords of the creation  i have devoted so much of my paper to the honor of the ladies that i have scarcely room to tell you that i earnestly wish for your return to london there is something the matter between sir james and lady desmond though she is much too good a wife to reveal the cause of her discontent either to mrs selwyn or my lucy but that there is a cause is perfectly apparent to them both and they fancy she would be more communicative to you than she is to them  indeed i fear sir james is posting to destruction the company he keeps must sink his mind as well as his fortune  lady desmond is much to be pitied she is now in the drawing room with both her sisters they all join me in wishing your return and in sincere affection  w stanley  letter xlvi mr sewell to mr simpson the deed is done jack the reversion of lady desmonds jointure is sold manor house and all chancellor henley used to say that a marriage settlement without trustees was one of the cobwebs of the law for there never was a woman who might not be kissed or kicked out of her consent to part with it henley was a wise man and peace be to his manes  but though this point has been gained i am not much the richer for it as sir james has been admitted of the club at boodles and has played pretty deep with his usual ill luck so that if it was not for his attachment to madame dupont which keeps him often at home i should not have shared any part of the spoil  he has entirely got out of my hands and therefore i must take care of myself i shall put his bond in force while he has any money left to pay it but as this will make an absolute breach between us and that i hate quarrelling with an old acquaintance i shall set out for bath a few days before the money is demanded and if it is not paid on demand i shall leave orders to have him arrested immediately  i rejoice to hear you have such a noble harvest and reap so plentifully another labourer in the field may i think now be of use as even fools are apt to suspect a player who always wins  i think it would be prudent in you to lose a little if you can do it with a tolerable grace but as you are apt to be peevish you had better stay till i come and let me win from you  you know we are to pass for strangers to each other  but all these matters we shall adjust at meeting  till when i am yours  g sewell  letter xlvii lady juliana to mrs stanley it is all in vain my lucy your kindness your friendship and advice are all thrown away upon one who is fated to be unfortunate  if i can i will methodize the story of my present distress i begin from the receipt of your last letter  as i had not resolution to speak to my brother i wrote to him in the tenderest terms expressing the sincerest concern for having offended him yet positively persevering in an absolute refusal of lord somners  soon after he had received my letter he came into my dressing room and spoke more calmly on the subject than i expected  he told me i should be released from his friends importunities but that in return for his giving up a point he had so much fixed his heart upon he insisted upon my answering truly any question he should ask me  i promised to comply with his request  he then fixed his eyes steadfastly on me and asked did you never receive the addresses of a mr evelyn i was all confusion and hesitatingly answered yes  before i was married  aye and since too juliana  or my information is false alas my brother i replied that mr evelyn is no more he died within a fortnight of mr harley  he answered i am satisfied and left me  we dined teteatete  and were tolerably cheerful in the evening some company came i exerted my spirits to the utmost of my power and retired to rest rejoicing that the impending storm was blown over and flattering myself with a succeeding calm  yesterday we dined at lord h  s and did not return till pretty late in the evening my brother received a parcel of letters the moment we came home and retired to read them i amused myself with playing on the harpsichord till i was informed that supper was served  on my entering the saloon i saw no one but the servants and enquired where their master was i was told his lordship was writing and did not choose to sup  i sat down for formsake and in a few minutes desired them to take away  during the short time i sat at table i heard a little bustle in the hall and the sound of a chaise driving off  i felt somewhat like curiosity upon this occasion but asked no questions  when the servants were withdrawn i took up a book and waited with an anxious kind of expectation for my brothers coming into the room till i heard the clock strike twelve  then rang the bell for watson to attend me to my chamber  when she came into the room i fancied she had been crying but as i could not guess for what i made no enquiry but on my dressingtable i found a letter directed to me and knowing the address to be my brothers hand i opened it with infinite perturbation  the contents were as follow  i have received the strongest confirmation of your falsehood mr evelyn lives  lives to detest a woman who lost to all sense of her own and her familys honor is become as much an object of contempt to him as to her injured brother  r  p s i have quitted my house to avoid seeing you nor will i ever receive a line from your contaminated hand     now lucy judge what i must have felt what i still feel from this envenomed dart yet i know not the shaft from whence it came for heaven so help me at my greatest need as i with truth affirm i do not know a person living that i have ever injured  yet i will own my punishment is just and would with patience bear all that the hand of malice can inflict were i the only sufferer  but my loved brother he is wounded too even in the nicest point wretch that i am i have undone his peace  do not write to me lucy the moment i have sealed this i shall quit this house for ever  watson is a perfect niobe i cannot prevail on her to go to bed though it is five in the morning  with the dawn i shall depart  i have left a few lines for my brother  i entreat you to conceal my distress from mr evelyn i know it would afflict him  the morning breaks  while night even in the zenith of her dark domain is sunshine to the color of my fate  adieu my truly valued friend j harley  letter xlviii miss harley to madame dupont dear maria the men say that the purport of a ladys letter is always contained in the postscript and were it not for that part of your last favor i could not have forgiven the matronly airs you assumed in the rest of it  but the kind assurance you give me of mortifying that hateful prude my sisterinlaw has bound me for ever to you  i am persuaded if we were acquainted with her real history we need not be obliged to invention to blacken her character but she is a consummate hypocrite and has cunning enough to keep her own secrets so that a shrewd guess is all we have for it and i think we have a right to make free with that  do not spare her maria i entreat you  i am sure if she was to be married to lord somners it would break my heart  though i shall soon be entitled to be called your ladyship as well as she you see i am resolved to take your advice and not like jephthas daughter continue to bewail my virginity any longer  though the bloom is a little worn off as you say the fruit is still tempting enough to captivate a baronet of one of the first families in this land of genealogers  sir john oshaughnasy has laid his laurels at my feet and opened his honorable trenches in due form before me  he has been a soldier in the empress of germanys service and has reaped more honor than wealth from the field but that is of little consequence as my fortune is quite sufficient to maintain us in affluence in this country where every thing is much cheaper than in england my swain has all the manners of a foreigner speaks french and german fluently is above six foot high and comely with all  these little circumstances are not amiss in my mind for i cannot quite agree with you that it dont signify who one marries i only wish i could change his name for the sake of my english friends who i am sure will pronounce it horridly though i am certain my spouseelect would as soon part with his life as alter a single letter of it  but every one has their foible and this i think is my baronets only one  do you know that the brute evelyn has left dublin without even bidding me farewell  he carried off captain harrison with him and their intentions were kept as profound a secret from me as if they were going to invade an enemys country  i believe the sly miss harrison was in the plot against me but i am sufficiently revenged on her by robbing her of sir james oshaughnasy who had dangled after her for some time  a pretty miss indeed with her three thousand pounds to think of being a lady thank heaven i have ten times that sum to bestow upon my worthy knight  i will if possible be married before evelyn returns for to say truth i would not wish to see him in company with my lover as i fear the comparifon might shake my resolution and if he were but to speak kindly to me i might perhaps be fool enough to break with the baronet  but do you think there is much danger of such an event  i rejoice also at your mortifying lady desmond  she is the second object of my aversion  you are very lucky in being married to a frenchman i fear if i was to amuse myself with a little coquetry my baronet would be jealous as he is so distractedly in love with me and it is not enough the mode here for married women to be galant to familiarise the idea to him  when i go to my husbands castle in the country i shall obey your commands by looking for a proper place to settle lady morton in but take my word it shall be far enough from me for i hate poor relations and i think her ladyship claims kindred with my mother  as you love me maria proceed with caution against lady juliana too much zeal often hurries us into mistakes a hint well thrown out is frequently more successful than a story unsupported by evidence and as i have already said we have no other foundation to build upon but guesswork  i have returned your compliment by devoting time to you that is extremely precious to me as i am certain my fond lover is now waiting with impatience to behold me enter the rotunda which you are to know is an humble imitation of ranelagh  in haste yours ever  anne harley  letter lxix mr evelyn to mr stanley killarney your letter my dear stanley found my imagination more agreeably occupied than you predicted as i was just then returned from viewing the beauties of the lake which takes its name from this town  believe me they are past description and every attempt that has been made to express the various effusions of nature in the different scenes that constitute the whole falls infinitely short of the originals  neither the poets pen nor painters pencil have yet been able to give an adequate idea of this transporting spot   here nature wantons as in her prime and plays at will her virgin fancies the beautiful and sublime are here mingled in the superlative degree the great creators works unspoiled by art rush on the mind and fill it with delight and awe  these mixed sensations overcame my spirits nor do i blush to say i found relief from tears i should look upon a man who could behold this scene unmoved to be deficient in some part of his organization and pity him for his natural incapacity  i shall not fear to be thought an enthusiast upon this subject by you who have sublimed your ideas as far as they can reach upon a more exalted object    fairest of creation last and best of all gods works believe me i am highly charmed with your arguments upon this charming subject and think with you that if we reason from analogy we must give up our boasted superiority and admit of an intellectual equality between the sons and daughters of adam this position granted give me leave to say the scale must necessarily preponderate in favor of the softer sex since all we have left to put in equipoise against their beauty winning softness and attractive grace amounts to nothing more than bodily strength and the few advantages that may be derived from a liberal education  the first can never be opposed to them and the latter by refining our ideas renders us but the more susceptible of their charms and endearments to sum up all women are and ever have been the sovereigns of the world but even monarchs are sometimes rendered unhappy by the vice or folly of their subjects and the hint you give me with regard to my beloved emma has alarmed me vastly  not that i doubt her reigning sole and absolute in her husbands heart it is his weakness not her strength i fear  perhaps he has again been drawn into play and in consequence of his folly his circumstances may be again distressed i know that emmas tenderness will share his sorrows without upbraiding she will mourn in secret nor even to a sisters ear reveal her husbands faults  gentle sufferer thou shall be relieved   be assured that emma would take as much nay perhaps more pains to conceal any difficulty she may labor under in pecuniary matters from me than any other person and that from a point of delicacy  it was honest sewell not she that informed me of sir james desmonds circumstances while i was at bath from him then i wish you to find out the situation of the baronets finances i think they cannot be much embarrassed as his debts were all cleared upon his going to london and if he is not quite a lunatic he cannot have involved himself greatly since   but no matter what the sum is if it be within my power  for of what use but to make others happy can my fortune be alas it cannot render me so  your not mentioning lady juliana in any of your letters i take unkindly it is treating me like an infant who forgets his plaything when it is removed from his sight  can you suppose that i should cease to think because you do not speak of the sole object that occupies my mind  my agreeable friend and fellowtraveller grows impatient to return to england as we have the pleasure of hearing that mrs williamss health is nearly established  i shall be sorry to quit this kingdom with which i am extremely charmed as much with the people from whom i have received infinite civilities as with the place  but notwithstanding my reluctance i shall accompany captain harrison to bristol and use my utmost endeavors to put him in possession of the greatest treasure this world can afford an amiable wife  i think it is almost needless to tell you that i mean to resign captain williamss legacy in favor of his widow surely i have no title to his fortune and only held it in trust till she was able to enjoy it  the value of the gift will be enhanced by the pleasure she must necessarily receive from bestowing it on a man whose fortune though by no means contemptible is far from being adequate to his generosity  captain harrrisons estate lies in a different province from this he has business there i shall attend him and therefore soon bid adieu to this eden  as i am selfbanished from london it is of little consequence in what part of his majestys dominions i reside  your letters will be forwarded to me with punctuality and i shall with impatience expect you to put it in my power to relieve my loved emmas distress by acquainting me with the means that are wanting to her happiness  i beg to be indulged with an account of lady julianas health and of every thing that relates to yours and my sisters welfare  i live but in ye all  charles eveyln  letter l charles evelyn to william stanley roscommon the post is come in without bringing me a letter which is a real disappointment because i fear the delay may retard the happiness of others as well as mine  harrisons business will oblige us to stay some days in this town which is a very dull one and the country round it less cultivated than any part of ireland that i have yet seen  the lands are entirely given up to pasture and we have rode over plains of five or six and thirty miles in circumference without seeing the face or even the vestige of any human creature excepting a few miserable huts made up of mud and straw which appear to be scarcely habitable yet this country is not without its curiosities  we went yesterday to see a beautiful lake about twenty miles from hence which runs above twelve miles in length and eighteen broad in many parts of it like that at killarney it is bordered with flowering shrubs of various kinds which grow spontaneously and on its banks are situated a number of gentlemens seats  i acknowledge the scene beautiful yet it falls far short of the one just mentioned it wants variety and that luxuriant wildness that transcends the efforts of art  but here i was presented with a curiosity of another kind and of the first magnitude as harrison and i were riding on the edge of the lake i observed a small brick house of two stories high that seemed to have no window or at least not one that looked upon the prospect i have described though it stood within a few yards of the richest and most beautiful part of it  i immediately enquired what could that edifice be designed for he replied it was the palace of a prince to whose presence he would endeavor to introduce me  of a lunatic you mean i answered who is selfinvested with royalty  you are mistaken said my friend he is a real prince the prince of coolavin his ancestors were lords of this wide domain and his proud spirit cannot bear to look upon those lands which he considers as by right his own though cromwell tore the inheritance from his family and reduced his patrimony to the scanty pittance of two hundred pounds a year for this reason he has turned the back of his house to this fair prospect and looks with more delight upon his farmyard  but come continued he as i am acquainted with the young princes i will try if i can obtain admittance for us to the monarch  when we came near the house it appeared in front a very decent building with sash windows close by it stood a smaller one only one story high at which we alighted and on our entrance were received by four young gentlemen with such politeness as would have done honor to an higher roof  the eldest of these was heir apparent and married to a very pretty young woman of the name of oconnor descended from the kings of munster  the second son had been educated in france and taken his degrees as a physician there  the third was an officer in the spanish service now on a visit to his family and the fourth was i understood designed for the service of the catholic church  on captain harrisons expressing our desire of paying our respects to the prince the eldest mr odermot said he would signify our request to his father and as mr harrisons mother was of a true milesian family he did not doubt his compliance we were offered a variety of refreshments most hospitably invited to dinner and informed that we might immediately be introduced to the dowager and princess consort  we were then conducted by the spanish officer into a small drawing room where my eyes were struck with the most venerable female figure they had ever beheld  i declare stanley i was almost tempted to bend the knee before her she was tall and of a majestic appearance yet had infinite sweetness in her countenance she was clothed in a blue damask dress made like a mans nightgown on her head she wore what they call a kercher of thin cambrick and from that head hung down even to her seet a profusion of the finest silver tresses that time had ever blanched this reverend object brought to my mind that beautiful epithet in shakespeare of timehonoured lancaster  to my surprise we were first presented to the young lady who received us with a kind of dignified sulkiness which was very disgusting while the elder ladys manners and appearance at once attracted our affection and respect  she entered instantly into conversation with us and amongst other things informed us that she had been full forty years a wife and that during that time she had never passed the bounds of her sovereigns estate though she owned she had once made an attempt to see a little more of the world when she was young her lord she said was then from home but the moment she had passed the line her horse threw her and she broke her arm in the fall  she considered this incident as a judgment on her disobedience and had remained a contented prisoner of her husbands mockstate ever since  at length we were admitted to the princes presence his person was large and seemed to have been well made his figure was erect his eye piercing and his countenance severe he was seated in an oak great chair from whence he did not deign to make the smallest inclination of his body on our appearance but sternly asked the cause of mr harrisons desiring to see him  my friend was a little disconcerted by the question but soon recovered himself and with infinite politeness replied his visit was only meant as a mark of the sincere respect he had been early taught to feel for the prince of coolavin  the old mans features became then less austere and he talked in an enraptured strain of the beauty of harrisons grandmother who had it seems the honor of being allied to him and bore the name of odermot  he scarcely deigned to turn his eyes on me and mine did not solicit his attention for they were attracted by an immense large coffin covered with black cloth that stood on one side of the chamber there was an inscription on the plate in a language i did not understand and therefore suppose to be irish and over the plate was a something like a coronet but not appertaining to any rank of heraldry that i was acquainted with over this gloomy apparatus was a shelf filled with some hundreds of wooden cups neatly turned which might each contain something less than half a pint their appearance puzzled me as they seemed to be rather a part of the furniture of a turners shop than of a princes presence chamber on enquiry i was informed they were designed to be used at the princes funeral when they were to be filled with whisky a species of malt spirit the common beverage in this country and given to each person who should attend his royal obsequies to the ruins of an old monastery which was about an hundred yards from his present mansion  when his highness thought proper to dismiss us we were conducted back to mr odermots and had the honor of dining with the rest of this most extraordinary family  the old lady informed us that not being royally descended she had never been permitted to eat with the prince or to sit in his presence unless in case of sickness though he often indulged his daughterinlaw with these special honors  but she is a princess added she and is therefore entitled to such distinctions  from the instant i heard this anecdote i took an aversion to the old savage and could easily conceive that he wanted nothing but power to be an admirable tyrant i thought of him in the same light as one of the caribbee islanders who as lord kaims tells us do not suffer their wives to eat in their presence while the women of that country are so remarkable for their sweetness of manners obedience and respect to their brutal husbands as never to give them occasion to remind them of their duty  o stanley what a falling off is here from the pinnacle on which you and i have been laboring to place the female party of our species but let it be remembered that savages only treat women with haughtiness or contempt  during the time of dinner we had an old blind harper who played and sung ditties to us in the irish language some of the tunes were uncommonly sweet and expressive of the deepest melancholy i was extremely charmed with the music great part of which the minstrel told us was extempore as well as the words  if i could have spoken his language i should have been tempted to try if i could have prevailed on the old bard to have accompanied me to england though mr odermot assured me that ofarrel that is the harpers name would not quit the barony of costello for a thousand pounds a year but very politely added that he should if i pleased attend me while i staid at roscommon  i accepted his offer with thanks and he returned in our fuite to this town  during my stay at coolavin i was extremely amused with the singularity of the characters i there met with but my trusty asiatic scipio was a much greater object of surprise to the lower class of the family than the heads of it were to me  they had never seen a black man before and the princesss waiting gentlewoman sent off an express for her sister who lived at the distance of eight miles to come and see kouli khan the king of the blackmen who she said was come all the way from turkey to visit her master  this was her geography about the matter  it was very late when we got back to our inn the night was fine and the roads good and we traveled as safe as at midday for there are no such beings as highwaymen throughout this country the robbing a henroost stealing a sheep or a little whiskey being the utmost of their misdemeanors  adieu my dear stanley i have written a long and i hope amusing history and left you at liberty to make your own comments for were i to transcribe the numberless reflections which occurred to me upon this ancient mixture of pride and simplicity of manners i should swell my letter to the size of a volume  yours as ever c evelyn  letter li mrs stanley to charles evelyn so all inconstant swains ought to be served my good mr evelyn here lie two of your letters to my spouse unopened and of course unanswered  had they been addressed to me the case would have been otherwise for i love to read letters exceedingly but you grew tired of my correspondence forsooth and have left me off so that if i was not the best natured sister in the world i should not now take up the pen to acquaint you that my husband has eloped  it is true charles  i have not seen him these ten days  and who do you think has spirited him away from me why truly his grandfather sir john stanley  he is turned of ninety and the express that came from devonshire informed me that the good old gentleman could not hold out much longer so that i presume he is now gathered to his fathers and grandfathers and i may be a lady at this present writing for ought i know  his knightship commanded me not to send his letters after him as he should not stay a moment longer than decency required for the old gentleman took care that affection or esteem should be entirely out of the question by behaving like a savage to his family all his life  but peace be with his soul and i am now glad that he has saved his grandsons feeling heart from being too much affected at his death  i had like to have said loss from a figure of speech that you scholars term lapsus linguae  there is perhaps a latent kind of goodnature in behaving ill to ones near connections for the reason i have hinted but for my part i am selfish enough to wish to be lamented when i die and am therefore maliciously resolved to behave as well as i can while i live  i never was so tempted to do a wrong thing as i am at this moment to open your letters  but avaunt foul fiend though i know my sweet william will say  why did you not my love  the temptation does not arise from mere curiosity neither but i wish to know how far you are acquainted with certain subjects that i may not tire you with a twice told tale  but even with the fear of repetition before my eyes i will venture to say that our dear emma is extremely happy  i have made many guesses at the cause but though it is too plain that she is on the rack she will not confess  o charles how grateful is my heart to providence for having blessed me with such a husband as my stanley it is true we have not been long married and it may therefore appear presumption to expect a continuance of my present happiness  it might be so with any other man  but were his heart estranged which heaven avert i know he would from principle lament his own defection and hide his weakness from me  i must not trust myself upon this subject for it is a theme on which my grateful heart could dwell for ever  as i have an extreme good opinion of your understanding i flatter myself you have by this time triumphed over your only weakness and that you can now read the name of juliana without tremor or palpitation  i will therefore venture to inform you that she has refused a match her brother proposed to her and in consequence of her refusal a brouille has happened between them  she acquainted me with these circumstances before she left richmond  i fancy she is gone into yorkshire as i have not heard from her lately though i live in daily and anxious expectation of some further intelligence from her upon this subject  it is a sad thing that this poor lady is not allowed to live single if she chooses to do so but that right or wrong you men will marry her whether she will or no  seriously i think it cruel to persecute her into matrimony because i really believe she is one of the few widows who wish to continue so and as i am sincerely interested for her happiness i earnestly wish she was suffered to possess it on her own terms  a letter from stanley  i give you joy of my ladyship charles but feel much more from knowing that the dear dispenser of all my happiness is well and will be in town in a very few days  i wish i knew when i was to rejoice in your coming for we all think that emma like hamlets ghost though dumb to us will speak to you  haste then my prince to finish your travels and keep your court amongst us here  l stanley  letter lii madame dupont to miss harley joy double joy to you my dear harley you are now triumphant in every thing  good and bad fortune flow in a stream and the current runs at present in your favor  our enemy is fled and has left us mistress of the field  i plied my battery so close that lord somners either was or affected to be convinced that lady juliana is every thing we wish to represent her and yet were his lordship to repeat every word i have said it would not amount to a consistent story  there lies the true art of doing mischief with impunity  and who think you was the hero of my tale the very man she despised and rejected your obdurate swain charles evelyn  we are no longer rivals now nancy but sincere friends i will therefore honestly confess to you that i have borne the strongest hatred to lady juliana from the moment that idiot evelyn fell in love with her not that i loved him but i would have married him for he is immensely rich and yet i know not whether lady juliana was the sole cause of my disappointment  i was weak enough to quarrel with him about a wretched prostitute for such i am sure she was that he picked up one evening in the park even before his saucy sister lucy and me  but away with the remembrance  i detest him and all that belong to him and some of his family shall yet feel my vergeance  but i am delighted transported my dear with your good fortune  you have waited to good purpose i almost wish i had not been in such a hurry myself a title is a delicious thing and even a baronets wife has as good a right you know to be called ladyship as a countess  in truth one should have something to make one amends for being plagued with a husband for even the best of them are but an encumbrance  dupont is not half so agreeable as he was he sulks sometimes as much as any englishman but i suppose it is owing to his extreme fondness that he cannot bear to have any other person admire me but you know it is not in my power to prevent a mans being in love with one if he chooses it though i could almost wish that the party did not show his attachment so openly  i thank you a thousand times for your promise of settling my mother i dont care where so it could be done speedily for to let you into a secret i am much afraid her creditors may get at her where she now is and it would be rather disgraceful to have it known that her ladyship was in gaol and what is worse i fear dupont would release her though at the expense of my diamonds  hasten your enquiries then my dear nancy as i have now let you into the whole truth of this matter and dont let your own happiness engross you so far as to be unmindful of yours ever  m dupont p s you will again say my postscript is the most material part of my letter for i had forgot to tell you that lady juliana is turned out of her brothers house by my machination and as we suppose retired into yorkshire    letter liii george sewell to mr simpson dear jack i shall not see you as soon as i intended the tide has turned in sir james desmonds favor and he is once more afloat with a full sail  a lucky night at boodles has put him in possession of some thousands but it will soon be low water again with him i fancy as he has found out more ways than one of dissipating his cash  i shall stay till i find it near ebb one should not fly from a friend while he is happy nor incumber him with company when he ceases to be so  i shall endeavor to nick the time of my retreat as exactly as possible  my fair ally has i think duped me  can you believe that i was silly enough to grow fond of her but i have seen my folly and am certain that all women are as surely jilts as the changeable goddess we worship  i hope you still continue in her favor dame fortune i mean no matter for the rest of the sex  yours g sewell  letter live lady oshaughnasy to madame dupont thanks to you my dear dupont for your congratulations they arrived most critically upon my wedding day  my dear baronet was so extremely pressing that i found it impossible to resist and gave him my hand last thursday  his fondness is quite romantic he would not wait for settlements but has assured me that i shall have an unlimited power over my own fortune and that he will endow me with a noble jointure  the irish are all generous but i think my spouse rather too much so  miss harrison who is i believe bursting with envy said every thing in her power to prevail on me to defer my marriage till her brothers arrival in town i am certain she had some sinister view in wishing to delay my happiness and yet i cannot guess what it could be for it is impossible to suppose she could be vain enough to think of inveigling sir john no matter what her schemes were i have put it out of her power to do me any injury  i have not yet seen any of my husbands relations they are all in the country and indeed there are few people of quality in dublin at present  i am impatient till we go to our castle though sir john says it is a good deal out of repair and therefore he seems inclined to purchase a small seat within a few miles of town but i love the grandeur of an ancient familymansion and have no doubt but he will indulge my wishes  i am at present so much engrossed by my own happiness that i have hardly leisure to rejoice in lady julianas misfortunes yet i am sincerely glad she is banished and to the spot she hates to harleyhill  i give you infinite credit for having brought about a breach between her and her brother that brother whom she used to boast of as being all perfection but she was always insufferably vain of the merits of her family and used to talk of her mother as if she had been a phoenix though i suppose she was neither better nor worse than yours or mine except her being a countess  apropos of your mother i shall look for a proper place for her amongst our tenants but you must excuse my repeating that i dont choose to have her very near our castle  i suppose her ladyship will be rather in the plaintive tone and one dont love to hear sorrowful tales that they cannot remedy  that viper evelyn is expected in town next week i will set out for our seat before he comes  for o my dear dupont i feel i cannot bear his sight my baronet though tall and handsome would be annihilated in his presence for though both you and i detest him we must acknowledge he is charming in his figure at least his foolish companion captain harrison is returning to england to marry the widow of a man who was killed in a strange way at evelyns lodgings at bath but thank my stars i have done with the whole set for i dont intend to visit miss harrison when i come to town next winter  for heavens sake my dear dupont take care of yourself and dont be caught tripping unless you are sure of a divorce and even then you know sir james desmond cannot marry you unless you could contrive to detect his saintlike dame at a retaliation which i believe to be impossible for she has not spirit enough for a frolic unless she is mightily altered since i knew her she was then called the gentle emma and i think can never rise higher than tagos praise  to suckle fools and chronicle small beer sir john is all impatience at my staying so long out of his sight i hope you will excuse my quitting you for him and permit me to subscribe myself my dear duponts sincere and happy friend  a oshaughnasy p s i dont think my name quite so terrible as i used to do    letter lv sir william stanley to mr evelyn dear evelyn the hurry of business i have been engaged in since my return to town will i hope be a sufficient excuse for not having sooner acknowledged the pleasure i received from both your letters  the first has inspired me with an earnest desire to see the beautiful lake which you modestlysay you cannot describe though you have contrived to give lucy and me such an idea of it that we have both resolved provided you will accompany us to visit killarney next summer and when we are safe landed on the irish shore we shall also expect you will do us the honor of presenting us to his royal highness of coolavin and all the noble personages of his family  if the old savage as you justly call him should have retired into his coffin before our arrival i shall hope to be indulged with a sight of his spouse of whom i have formed so venerable an idea that i would travel some hundreds of miles to have the honor of kissing her fair hand and addressing her with that respect which is due not to her husbands mock royalty but to her sex and age  had i met with the relation you have given of this extraordinary family in a book of travels or as it is now more politely styled a tour through ireland i should have thought the author a bad chronologer and that he had stepped back at least a couple of centuries in order to characterise the national weakness of the irish that of uniting pride with poverty  your veracity however is sufficient to prove that even in this enlightened age it still subsists in a superlative degree amongst the illustrious inhabitants of coolavin  i was much pleased with your account of the blind bard i wish you understood his language who knows but he may be a second homer and might sing the prowess of the progenitors of the odermots in as lofty strains as the grecian poet bestowed upon that of achilles and agamemnon  be that as it may i am persuaded that those ditties which are framed in honor of their ancestors serve to inflame the pride of the descendants and make them prefer indigence in a genteel profession to affluence in a meaner rank of life  this may appear from the destination of the younger sons who are devoted to poverty and can never be of use to their country  i heartily pity their misguided youth and think it amazing how such a family of gentlemen even in the cheapest country can be provided with food and raiment out of so small an income as two hundred pounds a year  i have purposely deferred mentioning the most material subject of your letter the unhappiness of lady desmond because i am by no means certain of the cause  a trifling circumstance has convinced me that it does not arise from any pecuniary difficulty nay i have reason to suppose sir james desmond must be rather in affluence though i hate gossiping i think you have a right to be informed even of this trivial matter lest you should think me tardy in the execution of your generous intentions toward our dear emma as i have received a very considerable addition to my fortune by the death of my grandfather i meant to surprise my lucy by presenting her with a set of jewels which should correspond with the earrings you gave her and called upon bellis in pall mall to bespeak them  he showed me many beautiful ornaments and amongst the rest a diamond sprig for a ladys hair that was both rich and elegant i enquired the price which he told me was four hundred guineas i would have paid for it directly but he would not part with it as he said it was bespoke by sir james desmond whom he expected to call for it every moment as he had expressed the utmost impatience to have it finished  i immediately directed another to be made exactly like it and felt myself extremely pleased with the information i had received upon a double account both with regard to the state of sir jamess finances and his affections  luckily i did not mention this matter to lucy as i meant to keep my transaction with bellis a secret till my design was complete in the evening i proposed our going to sir james desmonds lucy with her usual condescension complied yet i could perceive a something more like reluctance in her manner of assenting than i had ever before observed to any request of mine  when we came into lady desmonds drawing room we found her embroidering a waistcoat for sir james their little fanny playing by her side  at a cardtable were placed sir jame your friend sewell two other men and madame dupont most elegantly dressed the finery of her whole appearance attracted my eyes which were soon fixed by surprise on the identical diamond sprig i had seen at belliss in the morning conspicuous amongst the other ornaments of her hair i looked so long and steadily at her headdress that i fancied she became confused but as she is not easily put out of countenance my own disagreeable sensations upon this subject might probably occasion my thinking so  sir james who is always polite pressed us to join their party at loo and the galant mr sewel offered to resign his place at the table either to lucy or me  we declined their civilities and sat about an hour conversing with emma who appeared more cheerful than i have seen her for some time past yet still an air of melancholy dwelt on her lovely face and like a summer cloud slightly obscured the luster of the sun  while i turned my eyes alternately upon lady desmond and madame dupont i was ready to exclaim with hamlet could thou on this fair mountain leave to feed and batten on that moor but granting this affair as bad as i apprehend we must leave it to time to cure  men will not be schooled out of their vices and corrosives but inflame wounds  all that can now be done is to guard the infamous secret from emma the only means of doing which is to get her as much out of the scandalous set where she is only a cipher as possible  this thought immediately occurring to me i proposed her going to the opera with lucy and me tomorrow evening she did not venture to reply to my proposal but turned her dovelike eyes upon her husband as if to solicit his consent which to do him justice he very graciously gave adding that he was extremely sorry a prior engagement must prevent him from being of our party  he is neither a fool nor a brute we may therefore have hopes of his reformation  remember my dear charles that all i have said of sir james and madame dupont is founded merely on conjecture she may have employed him to purchase this jewel for her and it would be cruel to rob her of the immediate jewel of her soul upon a slight surmise  the more i reflect upon this affair the more pleased i am at your absence  the warmth of your nature would not suffer you to wait till time shall unravel this mystery you would precipitately call for an explanation of your doubts and by so doing injure the very person whom you wish to serve  the idea of mystery recals lady juliana harley to my mind  it is above six weeks since she left her brothers house at richmond neither lucy nor any other person except old watson her steward has heard from her since  he it seems has received her orders to dispose of her house and furniture in berkeleysquare upon being questioned he told me his lady was not at harleyhill but he either does not know or will not tell where she is  lucy is inconsolable about her she fears some accident has befallen her and is hourly making fruitless enquiries after her friend  i confess there is something very extraordinary in her conduct time only can tell us more than we know already which is that she is amiable and unhappy  since we are upon the subject of private history i should be glad to know what miss harley is doing in ireland and whether she has yet made any impression on your obdurate heart but if she has failed i should hope that either miss harrison or some other of her fair countrywomen have been more successful  i communicated some part of your letters to mr selwyn and he is determined to visit ireland  he says if your accounts are genuine there are more strange sights to be seen there than in any other part of the world  he longs to converse with the prince of coolavin and show him the sinfulness of pride and says if he will permit his youngest son to take orders in the established church he will appoint him to a curacy  i have filled my paper with such a deal of tittletattle that i have barely left room to subscribe myself ever yours  w stanley  letter lvi charles evelyn to sir william stanley dublin believe me stanley i most sincerely rejoice in every acquisition of wealth and honor that can accrue to you and my loved lucy to whom i must entreat you to make my apology for not answering her letter as the contents of yours have so entirely engrossed my thoughts that i cannot direct them to any other objects but the dear suffering ones of my tenderest affection  my sister selwyn and lucy will i hope forgive me when i own that even from my boyish days emma has been the darling of my fondness but had i never known a partial regard for her till the present time i should have felt it now  she is unhappy  thank heaven my other sisters are not so  lady juliana too  where can she be fled wherefore should she fly or why conceal the place of her retreat from her loved friend your wife  sir james desmond is  what i have ever thought him i will allow that our affections are not always in our power they may change from the most charming to the most odious object but a man of honor will not add insult to injury and triumph over the heart that he has wronged  i think with you that violent means will not recall a wandering affection and sure i am that emmas gentle spirit will suffer all her husband can inflict in silent sadness she will not reproach him nor wound his ears with her complainings her tears will flow in secret their traces may perhaps be seen on her pale cheek and by her husbands conscious heart they may be deemed upbraidings  it is extremely fortunate that i am not in london i could not with patience have endured the scene you saw at sir james desmonds  how dare he bring his paramour into the presence of his wife it is past conjecture stanley i have no doubts of their infamous connection you say he is neither a fool nor brute and therefore we may hope for his reformation  that is when his vitiated taste grows sick and weary of his present folly he will behave less cruelly to his wife from conscious shame of having used her ill but can the heart return when once estranged can she have that unbounded confidence in his affection which constitutes the charm of wedded love will she not fear a second change of his affection and can she look with fond respect upon the man who has taught her to think slightly of him impossible the human heart was formed to feel and when oppressed by unmerited sufferings it will resent times lenient power will no doubt abate the keen anguish of disappointed love  its cure at length is found in cold indifference and she who had a right to hope for happiness gladly compounds for ease such is the state of many a female heart no wonder then if it should sometimes stray and when rejected by its lawful lord seek consolation in an aliens breast  i have no fears of this kind for our emma she will as i have already said too tamely acquiesce in her hard fate but here i swear she shall not be insulted  madame dupont shall be banished from sir james desmonds house their scenes of galantry be played elsewhere  this is a point on which i entreat lucy to interfere  it may not be so proper for you to appear in such a matter  depend upon it emma is perfectly acquainted with her husbands folly her sister therefore may speak freely to her and i entreat she will  there surely must be some cause for lady julianas conduct  why is it made a mystery to me my tenderest wishes for her happiness accompany her flight and ever shall attend her  but yet i am not weak enough to form a thought of pursuing her nor would i obtrude myself into her presence were it this moment in my power to do so  then do not keep me longer in the dark but freely tell me all you know about her  that very silly woman that was miss harley has married a man who calls himself sir john oshaughnasy but from all the accounts that i can learn he is a selfcreated baronet and equally deficient in manners morals rank and fortune she has not been acquainted with him above a month miss harrison used every argument in her power to delay the marriage till her brother returned to dublin in order that he should make some inquiries into the mans character but the lovers were impatient and married they were they left this town on the morning of the day that captain harrison and i returned to it they set out with a very pompous equipage to a waterdrinking place called mallow and no person has heard from them since i hope the husband is not so bad as he is represented for though i dislike i bear no malice to her mockladyship  no stanley neither miss harrison nor any other woman i have seen in this kingdom has made any impression on my heart though i acknowledge i have beheld much beauty here and that the lady i have named has charms sufficient both of mind and person to inspire the tenderest passion in a vacant heart but mine is filled with one adored idea and never shall another enter there  i wish not to renew the painful subject  let your next letter be directed to bath where i hope to hear that my loved emma is at least set free from the mortifying triumph of her detested rival and also what part of the world lady juliana has retired to love to my sisters i think i would not have emma know that i am acquainted with her present situation her delicacy will be wounded at knowing that i must despise her worthless husband adieu  my dear stanley c evelyn  letter lvii lady juliana harley to lady stanley the continent do not imagine my dear lucy that i have not fully shared the anxiety you must have suffered from my unaccountedfor absence thank heaven this is the only time i have ever wittingly given you pain since the first happy days we spent together in youthful innocence  ah why do i recall the fond remembrances  i have heard it said that at the approach of death we become insensibly weaned from our dearest connections the fibers of the heart grow relaxed and those dear ties which were so closely wound about it loosen and decay so as to make us willingly resign what we can no longer retain  how highly favorable must such a dispensation be to the sons and daughters of sensibility but why may not a living wretch partake of this indulgence why must the absent forms of those from whom she is banished haunt her retirement obtrude into her solitary cell and skim along before her laguid eyes  why do i still behold my lucys face see the bright drop stand trembling in her eye or silent steal along her blooming cheek drawn forth by pity for her juliana why does my brothers form appear before me why does contempt shoot from his angry eyes even through my sinking heart but i have other visions still more dreadful  specter indeed that have long stamped indelible impressions on my heart and mind  would i could tell you all  but soon i will  this bursting bosom shall have vent and pour forth all its sorrows into yours  a sad and cruel proof of friendship yet when you know how dearly it must cost me my lucy will esteem it as she ought  judge by your own feelings what i must have suffered at tearing myself from you without informing you of my intentions  too well i knew that you would plead against my purpose and i also knew that even you must plead in vain  deprived of the only stay in life that fate had left me my unkind brother on whom could i rely for comfort or protection a little twig bending beneath the blast without one fostering tree to shelter or support it  i have at length escaped the storm and never never will i brave it more  my rank and connections in life unhappily for me placed me in such a situation that it was impossible for me to indulge my sincere wish of living in retirement whilst i remained in england i was by many mistaken for an object of envy and malice pursued my steps though their traces were marked by sorrow  what then have i to regret in the world i have left ought i not rather to rejoice in the idea of being forgotten by every acquaintance and by every friend except yourself who ever knew or loved me  the pains i have taken to conceal even from you the place of my retirement must convince you that my resolution is not to be shaken  but though determined on an entire seclusion from the world i still wish to preserve the tender attachment that has so long subsisted between us and which is now the sole remaining charm that can render life supportable to me you may therefore conclude that i desire to hear frequently from you for when we say we wish to be forgotten by the whole universe there is still one tender bosom where we would repose one dear and faithful friend in whose memory we desire even to survive ourselves  i did not bring a single servant with me from england  i have settled watson who was so many years my maid with her father at canterbury  the old man was my fathers steward and still is mine his long and faithful services amply deserve the independence which he now enjoys if i were capable of tasting pleasure i should feel it from the recollection of having rendered a very worthy family happy  watson is the only person to whom i have confided the place of my retreat you must enclose your letters to him and he will forward them to me  you see how strongly i rely upon your friendship  i cannot fear that i shall ever be neglected or forgotten by your tenderness and virtue  when i write next i hope i shall be more composed  peace has began to dawn upon me since the determination of my purpose and may perhaps again revisit my sad heart  soon shall its faults and follies be laid open to your friendly eye  but oh my lucy judge me not severely and guard the fatal secret of  your unhappy friend j harley  letter lviii lady stanley to lady juliana how have i trembled for the life or what is dearer still the reason of my beloved juliana and though your letter has relieved my fears on the first subject you must pardon my saying that i am not yet at peace upon the last  say my unkind mysterious friend what are those cruel ills your youth has suffered that have determined you to quit a world you scarce have entered blessed as you are with every outward sign of happiness with beauty rank and fortune what are those secret pangs that prey upon your heart a life of innocence should be a life of peace and sure i am my juliana knows no guilt  the only misfortune that has ever attended you was the death of mr harley or perhaps i might rather say your marriage with him but those events are passed long since and had you loved your husband with the tenderest fondness time would ere now have softened your distress  the youthful eye bends not its speculation always on the grave  yours should look forward to long smiling scenes of happiness that wait you  such should your visions be because you have a right to hope they would be realized  i cannot think so slightly of your understanding as to suppose your quarrel with your brother should disgust you with all the rest of the world  indeed juliana you want not his support but you want firmness to support yourself  the little tittletattle relative to my brother must have quickly blown over  you have sunk beneath a whisper not a storm  return my friend return and face your foes they will vanish at your presence their malice shall recoil upon themselves and your fair fame appear more bright from their attempts to sully it flight is always construed into a confession of guilt there is no retreating from slander we must confront the blatant beast or never hope to quell it  i flatter myself this hint will have due weight with you and make you reflect that you ought not to let your enemies triumph over you for the sake of your friends your family and yourself  i am firmly persuaded that a great part of your unhappiness is constitutional and proceeds from the weakness of your nerves and hence arise those specter that you say haunt your retirement they are fancybred juliana and would quickly vanish in the dissipation of the gay world  it is only in the gloom of solitude they ever dwell  do not then mortify me by preferring such horrid company to mine  i believe it is near a dozen years since we were first acquainted and during that whole time have i been striving to enliven your spirits for you have been addicted to melancholy even from your childhood and of all persons breathing are the most unfit for solitude  there may be truth in a paradox  i shall not comment upon the unkindness of concealing your design of quitting england from me nor on the childishness of your continuing to make a mystery of the place of your retirement i shall only say that whatever other proofs of your friendship you may think proper to honor me with i shall still think it deficient if i am to be kept in the dark with regard to your present situation for i think you know me well enough to be certain that i can keep a secret  my desire to be informed of this particular arises from an higher motive than curiosity for that alone might well be satisfied with the unbounded confidence you have promised to repose in me  but indeed my dear visionary i think you can have no secrets that i do not know  perhaps i am mistaken but at all events you may safely rely upon the sincere and faithful friendship of your ever affectionate  l stanley p s my brother is not yet returned to london  i imagine he is now at bath and has truly shared in my distress for your unaccountable flight  i shall remove his apprehensions for your safety by this post  would to heaven i could as easily relieve the pangs he suffers from disappointed love    letter lix lady stanley to charles evelyn dear charles the business of administration and a hundred and fifty other plaguey businesses prevent my stanley from answering your letter by this post and i though again rejected as a correspondent have resolved to share my joy with you at finding our lost sheep  i have had a letter from lady juliana she is somewhere on the continent but as yet thinks proper to conceal the place of her retreat  why i know not but i am certain you will rejoice to know that she is safe in any place  though i am less unhappy on her account than i have been i shall not be easy till she returns to england  if the eloquence of my pen should fail to bring her back i think my stanley will be so indulgent as to suffer me to try my persuasive powers in person provided we can discover her retreat  i would go to the antipodes for her service and i think the most material one i can do her and myself is to restore her to her friends  i fear self mingles much in my affection for her i cannot bear to think of losing the companion of my youth and the friend of my heart but away with the ungenerous suggestion  will you believe me when i tell you that my lordly spouse has absolutely refused to communicate the contents of your last letter to me though he has had the modesty to enjoin my writing to you and bids me tell you every thing i know  no truly sir said i i beg to be excused for i shall take this opportunity of convincing my husband and my brother that i can at least keep my own secrets  so mum is the word with regard to myself  we have had more of emmas company of late than usual and i have the pleasure to tell you that her spirits seem to be much better than they were  i wish i had a nostrum that could cure low spirits then should lady juliana lady desmond and charles evelyn be as well and happy as your affectionate  l stanley p s madame dupont fell from her horse in hyde park and strained her ancle about a fortnight ago and has been ever since confined to her house where she has my consent to remain as long as she thinks proper for i like being sure of not meeting her either in public or private    letter lx mr sewell to mr simpson dear jack the scene is changed we have removed our coterie from charlesstreet berkeleysquare to burystreet st jamess and i highly approve of our new settlement for we have now no lookers on  monsieur dupont is not in town and madame his lady has met with a slight accident that confines her at home though it does not prevent her being in perfect health and spirits  her house is now our nightly rendezvous and we have made some very agreeable additions to our party particularly a lord somners who is rich and fond of play  as we are all pretty sharp set his lordship stands but a bad chance of increasing his wealth amongst us but that is his lookout you know  i earnestly pray that monsieur dupont may remain in the country for i have a shrewd guess that he would disturb the nest if he were to see how prettily we build under his roof  sir james desmond is still a doting enamorato of madames and she coquets it away at a great rate  there is a good pretty girl a distant relation by way of companion in the house she makes tea admirably and sings agreeably when we can spare time to listen to her  in short all is mirth and jollity and the peers guineas chink sweetly in our pockets yet i still keep my eye fixed on the proper time for decamping for i am quite certain this party is too pleasant to last and that it will end sorrowfully to some of us  i am resolved to take care of one and let the rest shift as they may  sir james as i predicted is again out of cash and has borrowed five hundred more from yours  g sewell p s i have taken care to get a fresh bond from the baronet payable on demand for the fifteen hundred  as both you and i are in cash now suppose we looked out for a good mortgage jack you may have many opportunities where you are young heirs are the people to deal with  we should strike the iron while it is hot    letter lxi mr evelyn to lady stanley bath i am truly grateful to my dear lucy for her kind attention to my happiness which has received a considerable increase from the pleasing accounts in her letter  i am indeed sincerely rejoiced to hear of lady julianas safety though i own our apprehensions on her account could have no foundation but that of uncommon and sinister accidents for surely there does not exist a savage in the wildest part of the universe that would injure her  i am still extremely perplexed by her conduct in concealing her retreat from you  it is not from me that she now flies my word has ever been inviolable nor for my own sake would i renew the pangs i have already suffered by hazarding another interview  i am highly pleased with your resolution of endeavoring to bring her back to england what cause can she possibly have to shun a world that must adore her i am lost in the conjecture  our emma too you tell me is more cheerful  pleasing intelligence never may gloom again oppress her gentle spirits or sadness cloud the sweet serenity of her complacent brow  i wish you to amuse her lucy carry her from home  sad recipe to seek for happiness by flying from the only spot where it is most naturally to be found and yet in hers as in many other cases disappointment blasts it in its native soil while dissipation steals its fading colors and wears a faint resemblance of it to the world  for this i fear our emma must compound  captain and miss harrison returned hither with me  in a few days i hope i shall prevail on mrs williams to make a very deserving man happy by bestowing her hand and heart upon the captain  soon after their marriage they purpose going to the south of france for the entire recovery of mrs williamss health which is far from valid though she is better than i ever hoped to see her miss harrison and a young man a very good family and fortune who is her sincere admirer will accompany them  she has not yet recovered the vivacity she possessed before her attachment to captain williams but time they say can conquer every thing and will i trust erase the memory of that disagreeable event from her mind  i know not why but my spirits are uncommonly low at present there is no nostrum for a mind diseased and therefore your kind wish for your suffering friends is vain  may you long enjoy those charming spirits that contribute so much to your own and your friends happiness  my sincere regards attend sir william stanley lady desmond and the selwyns  accept the same from your affectionate brother  c evelyn  letter lxii lady oshaughnasy to madame dupont mallow ruined and undone maria deceived stripped and deserted can you believe there was ever such a monster in nature as this beggarly baronet that has imposed on me i shall keep my title for a knight he surely is of some foreign order or other but the being styled your ladyship is all i have got for twenty thousand pounds luckily for me there is a reversionary heir to the other ten and i could not bestow it on my vile husband  i will be calm if i can and acquaint you with the whole process of his villainy  he brought me to this place under pretense that his castle one in the air was in this county and that he could have frequent opportunities of seeing how the workmen went on with the repairs by making short excursions from hence  when i had been here about a week i expressed my surprise at not having received the usual compliments of visits etc from his family he told me that most of them lived at a considerable distance but he would take care they should not be wanting in respect to me and he would set out next day to acquaint them with my arrival in the country  he took the carriage with him and returned in two days accompanied by a couple of the strangest female frights i ever beheld the one old and ugly the other young and rather handsome these vulgar figures he introduced to me as an aunt and cousin i received them civilly but the sight of these quite cured me of my impatience to be acquainted with the rest of his kindred  these women got their persons and dress a little new modelled in a few days and one evening we went to the rooms together for this you must know is a waterdrinking place  i had sat down to cards with some ladies of fashion here when my cousin catty came to the table and whispered me that sir john had sent to desire i would let him have my keys for a few minutes as he wanted some paper out of my writingbox she said she would carry them to him and return immediately  i complied without hesitation and more than an hour elapsed before i grew uneasy at not seeing sir john or his young kinswoman  the old one who stuck close to my side said she believed sir john and catty were gone to visit a relation of theirs that lived about three miles off for she had seen them drive by in the chariot  though i was by no means delighted with this intelligence i concealed my chagrin and waited in expectation of their sending the carriage for me as it happened to rain till every creature had left the rooms but had i staid till it came i might have remained there for ever  when i returned to my lodgings i found the doors of my apartment locked and upon enquiring for the servants i was told the men were all gone with sir john and the young lady and they believed my woman was in the bedchamber as they had heard an odd noise in that part of the house  i called to my maid several times but received no answer and upon having the doors forced open i found her locked up in a dark closet where she could scarcely breathe and from whence it was impossible she could be heard or convey me any intelligence  my trunks were all lying open my papers jewels money and the best part of my wardrobe vanished  i became almost distracted  the old jezabel of an aunt either was or pretended to be ten times more outrageous than me  she tore her hair and uttered a thousand imprecations against sir john with whom in her fury she disclaimed all relationship  but i found the great source of her sorrow was the being left behind by her hopeful daughter  in this dreadful exigence i knew not how to act but as soon as i was a little calm i applied to a gentleman of the law for advice he assured me there was nothing to be done for my service as my husband had a legal claim to all my effects  i fancied that even this grave sage of the law and all the people about me seemed rather to laugh at my distress than pity it till i informed them that i was still possessed of ten thousand pounds which happily it was not in my husbands power to alienate they then changed their manners toward me and the counselor would fain have persuaded me to institute a suit in the ecclesiastical court against sir john  i shall not take his advice but mean to return immediately to england and try what better information i can pick up there  o maria what vile hypocrites are these men would to heaven i had remained single and yet it was impossible to doubt the apparent fondness of this cruel wretch who seemed perfectly to dote on me and i am such a fool i cannot help lamenting the loss of his tenderness it must have been that cursed catty that seduced him from me how will my prudish sisterinlaw and all the other puritans of my acquaintance laugh at my being taken in at this time of my life i cannot bear the thought  i think i had better retire into some place where i am not known than expose myself to the ridicule of those who pretend to style themselves my friends  no i will pursue my husband perhaps i may yet recover his affections or my effects and get him to discard his infamous accomplice  if you had seen how handsome he looked the very day he left me you could not have believed him a deceiver  i know not what to do my spirits are quite broken  i will hasten to you as i am certain you will pity your sincere friend  a oshaughnasy  letter lxiii lady juliana to lady stanley why will my dearest friend add pain to my affliction by making a request i cannot must not grant full well i know your generous motive lucy nor have i once suspected that the inquiry owed its birth to curiosity merely  your kindness would attempt to rescue me even from myself but in vain my friend for i am selfdevoted soon will those vows have passed my lips which cannot indeed should never be recalled and then your fond solicitude shall be indulged you then shall know the spot where i shall be irrevocably fixed this is no sudden start believe me lucy  long has the idea wandered through my mind  long have i languished for that peaceful haven in which this tempestbeaten bark can only anchor  too much a slave to all the fond affections of the heart love for my brother tempted me to hope that his society might sooth my griefs and lull my cares to rest  the thought was weak and vain  blessed be the disappointment i have met with  had it not happened the arrow must have festered in the wound and rankled there for ever  it may now be drawn forth and the allhealing power of true contrition soften every pang  this language must appear obscure to you who judging from your own unspotted life must have pronounced mine innocent  alas you know me not  peace flies from hidden guilt nor can even penitence reclaim the wanderer back while close concealment bars the door against it confession must be added to contrition and for such an act of humiliation the season now approaches  commune with yourself my friend and try your fortitude before you open the enclosed recital if you shrink back from pain commit it to the flames and let the remembrance of the sad reciter perish with it  o no that will not be the tear of pity glistens in your eye and purity like yours will weep for faults it could not have committed  when you have read my story you will be convinced that it is not the weakness of my head that has conjured up specter to haunt me  and yet i trust in the unbounded mercy of that gracious power whose eye alone pervades the human heart that these sad objects shall be banished from me and peaceful visions bless my nightly slumbers  my hopes thus raised i cannot will not doubt of more than pardon of pity from my friend  it is all i now can ask or you bestow on the unhappy  j harley p s to any one but my lucy the enclosed narrative would afford little entertainment it is not a series of events but a continued conflict of the mind and is a history of passions not of persons  story of lady juliana harley though my loved lucy is alalready acquainted with all the little events of those blessed days we passed in youthful innocence together and that i have already informed you of the cause of the separation that took place between my parents while i was a child you must allow me to recur back again to that fatal circumstance from which i have cause to date my every misery  my mother as you know died at dijon a real martyr to the catholic religion which she professed  to that she sacrificed all earthly ties the tender wife and the fond mother sunk before the idea of a higher duty the conflict was too great for her soft nature  the saint sustained it but the woman died  when the period of all her sorrows drew near she called me to her and with her dying lips enjoined me to pay the strictest obedience to my father in every point except that of renouncing the religion in which i had been bred and which she added i trust my julia will never forsake for something tells me that you may at some time or other of your life stand in need of such an asylum as can only be found in the bosom of our church  too prophetic were her words but ever blessed be the guardian spirit that inspired them the deep melancholy which succeeded to the violent sorrow i felt for the loss of such a parent marked my countenance with a timid and dejected air which my father at my return to england unkindly misconstrued into a sullenness of disposition or a personal dislike to him and this opinion inspired an haughty coldness in his manners toward me  i trembled whenever i approached him his hand was not stretched forth to sustain my feeble steps nor did the encouraging smile of parental fondness ever smooth the severity of his naturally austere brow  my brother was his darling and my only consolation  cruel as he is now become my heart avows its gratitude to him for all the little happiness that dawned upon my youth  when i had been about a year at my fathers he proposed sending back the governess that had come with me from france as he justly imagined that she kept up my attachment to the catholic religion which he was determined i should renounce this was a severe stroke to me i loved madame duval as a second parent she had been a favorite of my mothers and many pleasing melancholy hours we used to spend together in mingling our tears to her memory  on this occasion her dying commands occurred to me and i submitted without appearing to lament my loss  her place was supplied by a very different sort of woman unpleasing in her person and vulgar in her manners  but you must remember mrs winterman  i conceived a very strong aversion to her from the first sight and therefore from the moment that my poor duval left me i never had a female friend older than myself whom i could consult upon any difficult occasion or to whom i could pour forth the sorrows of my oerburthened heart  about this era i had the happiness of becoming acquainted with you the vicinity of our houses in the country produced an intimacy between our families and soon very soon my lucy became the adopted sister of my love  about two years after our friendship had commenced my brother went to travel my father who could ill bear his absence determined to visit his estates in scotland and leave me with mrs winterman and the servants at home  i know my lucys kindness then prevailed on mrs evelyn to request my father that i might be permitted to pass the winter with her in london  his consent to this proposal was the only mark of his affection i ever had received  would to heaven he had been obdurate as he was wont to be and confined me at fairfield yet let me not unjustly charge him with the sad effects that sprung from this indulgence  the faults are all my own the merit his  about the beginning of the following spring you may remember that your eldest brother returned to england on account of your mothers ill health though he had not finished his travels nor been abroad above three years  o lucy do you recollect his form alas to me it is for ever present he had such eyes as yours and emmas gracious smile  never till then had i beheld what manly beauty was yet had his charms been merely personal i think they could not have obtained my heart the tenderness he showed his dying mother his fond attention to her slightest wish the ease the grace that marked his every action his kindness to my lucy and her sisters joined to the passion he avowed for me soon wonmy youthful heart nor did a thought of blame obtrude itself upon my mind when i bestowed it on such worth as his  on mrs evelyns death my father sent for me imediately  sad was the parting lucy yet i own my tears had different sources and flowed perhaps even more from love than friendship  though your amiable brother had offered every argument to sooth my grief and solemnly assured me he would solicit my fathers consent of which i could not entertain a doubt as soon as it was decent after the loss of so good a mother yet i could not command my sorrows they were impetuous i continued to weep and neither eat or slept during the journey on my arrival at fairfield my father in the same breath inquired of mrs winterman what illness i had just recovered from and presented mr harley to me as a particular friend of his and my brothers  i was struck with horror at the sight of mr harley yet could by no means account for my disgust both his person and address were pleasing yet i shuddered when he approached me as if he had been some noxious animal  my father in a few days perceived my dislike to his friend and spoke of my behavior with resentment  i told him i would endeavor to alter my manners though i could not conquer my feelings which i confessed were unaccountable even to myself  he sternly replied i would advise you to get the better of your prejudice for it is beginning at the wrong end to set out with an aversion to your husband i was struck motionless at this expression and stood for several minutes as if i had been petrified  all the sorrows i had ever felt vanished from my remembrance swallowed up in the superior gulf of miseries that my foreboding mind then warned me to apprehend but tears came to my relief and soon a ray of hope beamed through the gloomy prospect my father was severe i knew but i could not believe he could be so inhuman as to sacrifice the peace and happiness of an unoffending child  my brother would i hoped solicit for me and sure i thought my evelyn could never plead in vain  i retired to my chamber and wrote you an account of every circumstance that had happened i was certain you would acquaint your brother with my situation and i had no doubt but that he would hasten his application to my father  that letter never reached you lucy the cruel mrs winterman delivered it into my fathers hands and he became the more incensed against me  while i daily waited in anxious expectation of hearing from you i endeavored to assume a more placid air and manner toward mr harley than i had at first put on unfortunately he construed my behavior into liking and addressed me with all the warmth of a declared lover my letter had betrayed me to my father he saw through the thin veil of affability and as he after told me rejoiced at my becoming a sacrifice to my own deceit  when a whole month had elapsed without my receiving a line from you or my loved henry i grew almost distracted  i could no longer conceal the agonies of my mind  despair inspired me with courage  i threw myself at my fathers feet revealed every sentiment of my heart implored his forgiveness and in the humblest but most earnest terms besought him not to devote his child to certain misery  he heard me with composure and calmly replied he did not think himself indebted to my confidence for revealing the secrets of my heart as he was already apprized of the weakness of my conduct in attaching my affections without his consent to mr evelyn but though he had no power over my passions i should find he had some over my person  he then in the most solemn manner swore he would never bestow his daughter on a man who had made her guilty of a breach in her first duty and meanly strove to steal her foolish heart after so clandestine a manner i attempted to exculpate my henry but he commanded my silence and sternly vowed i should accept of mr harley for my husband or from that hour be loaded with his curse then left me drowned in tears and sinking on the earth  o had it opened wide and taken me to its bosom i had been blessed indeed  after this dreadful interview my spirits were so entirely depressed by sorrow that i was utterly unable to leave my chamber for above a week during which time i wrote to your brother and my own but both these letters met the same fate as my former one to you and served if possible to increase my fathers rage though heaven is my witness i spoke not harshly of his cruel conduct he intercepted every letter that was addressed to me and except the indulgence of pen and ink to vent my sorrows i was treated in every respect like a criminal confined in the bastile  in this deplorable situation you found me at your arrival in the country when i was permitted to receive the transport of seeing you but mrs winterman you remember never quitted the chamber but sat like the figure of curiosity with eyes ears and mouth wide open to catch every syllable that passed between us  though i of course was silent with regard to my situation your perspicuity easily discovered that some unhappiness of mind was the source of my illness and my poor sally watson who had been banished from my sight as she afterward told me acquainted you with all the particulars of my distress  in consequence of your visit to me i know that mr evelyn immediately waited upon my father and made the most liberal proposals for his alliance  i also know to my everlasting sorrow that my unkind i will not call him cruel father refused them with disdain yet still my faithful henry persevered bore all the haughtiness of causelessly offended pride and offered even his whole estate to be settled or disposed of at my fathers pleasure alas it was in vain i was not sacrificed to interest but caprice and resentment which carried him so far as to command that all intercourse of visits messages etc between your family and ours might cease from that instant  during the time of my voluntary confinement to my chamber i received several polite and tender billets of inquiry after my health from mr harley from these i formed a romantic idea that the gentleness of his nature might be prevailed upon to relinquish his pretensions to my person if i could have resolution sufficient to acquaint him that my heart was engaged to another i anticipated in my mind the pleasure he would feel in rendering two persons happy and my eyes often overflowed with gratitude and esteem for mr harleys supposed generosity this simple scheme became the darling of my imagination and i resolved to put it in practice as a last resource  from the time that this thought occurred to me my spirits grew better and i rather wished than feared a meeting with mr harley  it was not long delayed soon after his total rejection of mr evelyn my father came into my chamber and acquainted me with every thing that had passed between them in order as he said to reconcile me to my duty by totally destroying every vain imagination i might have conceived of an union with a family whom he disliked for having attempted to seduce my affection without the sanction of his approbation  i replied not to this severe determination but with my tears but when he added with the most peremptory tone that he expected i should be ready to bestow my hand on mr harley without reluctance that day sennight i again threw myself at his feet offered to renounce all connection with my loved evelyn with you my lucy with all my world provided he would recall his harsh command and suffer me to live and die his daughter he looked upon me sternly and taking up a bible that lay upon my table swore by it that nothing but my death should prevent my fulfilling the engagement he had made to mr harley at the time he had already mentioned then left me without waiting my reply  the little hope i had conceived of mr harleys generosity was now my sole support and i resolved to put it to the proof immediately  i saw him from my window walking in the garden i called for my hat and with my tearswoln eyes descended to him  he seemed surprised and rejoiced at seeing me but took no notice of those strong marked traces of sorrow that appeared on my countenance  i tried to speak to him but tears stopped my utterance and the imperfect words died on my trembling lips  i returned to my chamber convinced of my own inability to express myself properly on a subject i was so much affected with and thought i should be able to do it better in writing  after many efforts which all appeared inadequate to my feelings i at length finished a letter in which i exhausted every argument that i thought could move his honor or pity and engage him to renounce the worthless hand that could not give a heart when i had sealed and sent it the agitation of my mind became almost insupportable but still i flattered myself that a certainty of any kind would afford me relief  i was not permitted to remain long in this error for in an hours time i received a very florid epistle from mr harley lamenting his misfortune in not having been able to engage my affections but that as he had every thing to hope for from my virtue and good sense he flattered himself that by a series of unremitted tenderness he should at length triumph over every prejudice i might have conceived against him and concluded with assuring me that the request contained in my letter was the only one i should ever make that he would ever refuse with the certainty i so much wished for all my hopes were blasted and i then thought it was impossible i could ever be more wretched  vain presumption those sorrows were but the prelude to far greater woes  warned by my folly let no woman ever confess a prior passion for another object to him whom fate allots her for a husband my fatal letter turned mr harleys heart to stone his pride was piqued and though i truly think he did not love me he would have died rather than have surrendered me to a triumphant rival  a thousand wild vagaries now rushed into my troubled brain i thought of getting off in some disguise of flying to my henry  but then would not my father force me from his arms might not some horrid scene of bloodshed follow could i sustain the curse of disobedience o no my heart shrunk within me at the shocking thought  my mothers dying form seemed to appear before me and her last words to vibrate on my ear  i could resist no longer  and when my father came to reproach me with the letter which mr harley had so ungenerously shown him i pacified his wrath by telling him with a composure that amazed myself that i was ready to obey his will and sacrifice my peace my happiness and all my soul held dear to his commands and go a silent victim to the altar with mr harley  at that instant my father gazed on me with an astonished look and said my julia is incapable of deceit she therefore purposes what she now promises and means to make her father happy at last  o do not doubt it sir i answered if giving up much more than life can answer that great end behold your daughter ready to make the sacrifice  my father turned away his head to hide the starting tear then took me in his arms and blessed me  i was a perfect niobe yet at that moment felt a transient transport that absorbed my griefs  blessed source of happiness the consciousness of having done my duty why were thou not for ever present with me why has this feeble frame been ever torn between thy dictates and contending passions  my father was so much pleased with me that he became all kindness on the sudden sally watson was allowed to attend me i was no longer watched by mrs winterman and he was indulgent enough to postpone my marriage for a fortnight without my requesting it in hopes that i should in that time recover my cheerfulness  alas it was for ever fled from me  and though i wore the semblance of composure all the day my nights were passed in agonies  my poor watson was amazed at my conduct and was afraid to mention the loved name of evelyn  but as she found me frequently in tears she began to doubt the reality of my seeming calmness and ventured to acquaint me with the numberless stratagems my henry had vainly tried to accomplish his hopes of seeing me  i was terrified at the account she gave me of the dangers to which he had exposed himself for me and told her that were it in my power to see him i would decline the interview as my fate was now irrevocably fixed and nothing upon earth could alter it  she then implored my forgiveness for having promised to deliver a letter from mr evelyn which she presented to me  i had not virtue to withstand this trial i bathed the precious relic with my tears and placed it next my heart from thence my answer flowed in which i solemnly conjured him as he valued my happiness here and hereafter never to attempt to see me more  i told him that i now considered myself as mr harleys wife and that from that moment i never would receive a letter from or write to him again  i poured forth a thousand fervent wishes for his happiness and for yours my lucy and bade him everlastingly farewell  in spite of my injunctions he wrote again and watson brought his second letter but i returned it as it came unopened and fancied i had now gained a perfect victory over my fondness  how vain the selfsufficience of our boasted reason  the letter was no sooner gone than i a thousand times repented my not reading it  perhaps my henry acquiesced in my request and readily resigned me to his rival  had i been sure of that it would i thought have eased my tortured mind for i too fondly felt his sorrows added to my own  my days thus wasting in a state of misery brought forward that superlatively sad one that was to mark my future life with anguish as it approached i looked on it with horror yet i wished it past on the preceding evening my father took me by the hand and led me to the garden where as we walked he condescended to apologize for the seeming severity of his conduct toward me by saying that he apprehended my opposition to his will had proceeded from my mothers haying ealy inspired me with an aversion to his person and a contempt of his authority which latter article of undutifulness at least he was resolved to conquer  in the zeal of my filial affection to her injured memory i exclaimed o sir you do her wrong  i see my mother now and hear her dying words  at that instant i beheld my henrys form concealed beneath a peasants garb standing near me i gave an heavy sigh and sunk upon the earth  my father stood amazed and thought the power of fancy had so far operated on my weak spirits as to conjure up a spectre to my view  he called for instant help and when my sight returned i still beheld my henrys face pale and dejected with his hands fast closed leaning against a tree  i rose the moment i had strength sufficient and resting on my fathers arm returned into the house  my fathers late returning tenderness seemed much alarmed at this accident and he told mr harley before me that he thought it proper to deser our marriage for a few days longer  judge of their mutual surprise when i requested that it might not be delayed the wretch condemned asks but an addition to his misery who begs a reprieve when hope of pardon is past you may be sure they readily assented and i desired leave to retire to my chamber for the remainder of the evening  there i indulged my sorrows and gave a loose to tears and to complainings  there i reproached the cruel henry for having disobeyed my last command and exposed himself and me to certain ruin had he been detected  and there i tried to tearhis image from my tortured bosom  but in the foldings of my heart he lived with life and far the dearer he  after a night passed in the bitterest conflict with myself i arose more calm and hoped the force of duty to my father with a patient resignation to my irresistible doom might enable me to go through the awful and irrevocable ceremony with composure  before i left my chamber i begged of heaven not to impute to me the sacrilegous loveless vow i was compelled to make  but when the solemn words of adjuration which begins the ceremony were pronounced i could no longer contain my sorrow it burst forth and had not my father supported me i had again sunk lifeless on the earth  on this occasion mr harley appeared rather more offended than alarmed and behaved with a gloomy kind of tenderness toward me while my father seemed to impute what he called accident to the weak state of my nerves and as soon as i was able to stand again they proceeded to finish the ceremony and the indissoluble knot was tied  in about a week after i was to my great satisfaction conveyed to harleyhill i flattered myself that change of place and objects might amuse my mind and that when i had quitted fairfield i should lose the remembrance of the sorrows i had experienced there  there was another and a stronger reason that made me desirous of leaving it the vicinity of your house to ours  i had never ventured to walk in the garden or even to look out at a window since the evening before i was married lest my eyes should encounter their dearest yet most dreaded object  alas i knew not that grief had preyed upon my henrys spirits and that he was at that time confined to his bed with a slow fever  i call heaven to witness that from the moment i became a wife i most solemnly purposed to fulfill my duty and never give mr harlcy the smallest cause of discontent  i concealed my grief and even endeavored to assume a cheerful air i received his friends and relations as graciously as i had power to do and if a sigh escaped me in his presence i blushed for having committed an involuntary fault yet had i not at that time given vent to my swollen bosom and poured forth all its sorrows to my faithful watson i must have died overcharged with woe  as soon as the hurry and dissipation of our wedding visits were at an end my father left us and from that hour mr harley became sullen and severe  when we have been alone and i have tried to sooth his temper and to force a smile from his contracted brow he would take out the fatal letter i had written to him before our marriage con it over several times then look upon me with contempt and say it is damned dissimulation all  i could not at such times command my tears in spite of me they flowed  he then would sneer and say thank heaven you feel the pangs of disappointed love  so far we meet on equal terms  we passed four months in this deplorable state i had then the additional misfortune of losing my father who died in scotland and appointed mr harley guardian to my brother  on this account it was necessary for mr harley to go there and after my grief for my father had a little subsided i felt a secret satisfaction in thinking that business and a new scene might contribute to raise his spirits and give a more cheerful and contented turn to his mind  from the time he left me my days were spent in solitude nor did my feet ever pass the bounds of his demesne  miss harley then was with me our souls but ill accorded she was quickly disgusted with the retired life i led and quitted harleyhill soon after her brother  it was then the autumnal season and thus freed from constraint my time was all my own a happiness i never had enjoyed before and when the moon shone bright i frequently indulged my meditations even till midnight in a grove and temple that were situated at a considerable distance from the house at the extremity of our improvements i used to have lights placed in the temple or rather summer house that when i grew tired of walking i might sit there and read or weep unheard and unseen  in this sequestered spot i sat one evening gazing through the dim medium of my tears at henrys last dear letter  i needed not to read it the words were but too deeply engraved upon my heart  i thought i heard a little sound of gently treading feet i snatched up my loved treasure and placed it in my bosom then rose to see from whence the noise proceeded  my henry stood before me but so much emaciated and altered that i scarcely knew him  i shrieked and would have fled he clasped me in his arms and held me there  i could not force my way nor when he loosed me from his hold had i the power to move  he knelt and wept before me  offended as i was at his intrusion my breaking heart pleaded his cause too strongly and i reproached him not but with my tears just then i heard the trampling of a horse close by the temple side which joined a private road that mr harley sometimes used  i bade my henry fly  he pressed me to his heart and left me  it was our last embrace the door that he came in at to the garden then stood open and i hoped he might escape unseen  fear lent me wings i ran or rather flew into the house and gained my chamber the family were all at rest but watson  my looks were wild she trembled at my appearance and eagerly asked me what had happened  i could not answer her but sat fixed in a gloomy stupor  when i could speak i ordered her to bed  when left alone i became quite distracted i tore my hair and ran about the room i knew not why i threw up the sash to listen to some sound and was a thousand times tempted to throw myself out of it  i could hear nothing but the passing breeze and dogs that bayed the moon  i stole softly down stairs and resolved to return to the temple from whence i could look upon the road and see if any one was there but terror had unstrung my trembling limbs and they would not support me and in all the misery of anxious suspense i waited for the morning  when the day dawned i began to flatter myself that i might have been mistaken in supposing the horseman that passed the temple should be mr harley and yet he and he only had a key that opened all the gates that led into that road conjecture was in vain  my poor disturbed imagination could not form one that did not teem with horror  about six oclock i heard a confused noise at a distance and a cry of fire  i looked but saw none the servants who were up ran toward the sound and quickly brought me word that the summer house was in flames  but a still more horrid sound now pierced my sinking heart in looking for water to extinguish the fire they had found mr harleys body weltering in his blood with a discharged pistol clenched in his stiffened hand  the servants raised the body and as they brought it toward the house i heard their loud laments and rushed amongst them  think how my eyes were blasted with the sight they could not bear it for a single moment  i sunk into a swoon  for above six days i remained delirious without a single interval of reason  my faithful watson never left my fide nor suffered any person but the doctor to approach me though she has never hinted at it i am certain that in my ravings i betrayed myself and told the horrid secret of my having been the occasion though not the cause of my husbands death  when my senses and my misery returned together i incessantly prayed and wished for death  but he comes not at call nor mends his slowest pace for plaints or cries as a sacrifice of atonement to my husbands memory i bound myself by the most solemn vow never to see my henry more  yet still i own i wished to know his fate and be informed what provocation he had received from mr harley that could exculpate him from the foul crime of murder i knew he had not purposed this vile act and i most earnestly hoped that selfdefence alone had forced him to commit it  i sometimes for a moment even wished that henry had fallen instead of harley i considered myself as an accomplice in his death and was a thousand times tempted to relieve my mind from the agony i suffered by revealing the unhappy circumstances that occasioned it  but then forgive me heaven my love returned and i rejoiced the man who killed my husband was in safety  mr harleys relations took every possible pains to discover his murderer  shocking term my lucy  large rewards were offered but no trace appeared that led even to suspicion the circumstance of the summer house being set on fire was also unaccounted for as none but watson knew i had lights there which in my fright i had forgot to extinguish  from the time i recovered my reason though anxious for his fate beyond expression i never mentioned mr evelyns name i concealed all the misery i felt within my tortured boson nay had that kind of tenderness for watson which macbeth expresses for his wife when he says be innocent of the knowledge  the unhappiness of my mind had humbled me so far as to make me look up with respect to my servant  she was deceived by my outward semblance and thought that grief for mr harleys shocking and untimely fate was all the woe that preyed upon my heart she delivered me a letter which had come by post enclosed to her  it was from henry it lies before me now and if my tears will give me leave i will copy it  to lady juliana harley most loved and most unhappy of your sex how shall the cause of all your woes dare to approach you o julia could i wash away my crimes with my hearts blood i would freely let it out  yet do not think me worse than i unhappily am  though stained with blood i am not a vile murderer  heaven knows how earnestly i sought to avoid the fatal contest that has destroyed our every hope of mutual happiness he called me villain base adulterer impatient as my nature is i yet forbore to answer him for conscious innocence disclaimed the opprobrious terms  he struck me julia  i could bear no more but bad him use the weapons of a gentleman  we both had pistols he discharged one but missed me i fired one of mine in the air he again presented at me swearing with the most dreadful imprecation that if i escaped his second fire you should be his victim the next instant  my calmness left me your danger roused my passions we both fired at the same instant  i saw the unhappy harley fall  i threw myself upon my knees beside him but soon discovered that all help was vain  heaven is my witness that at that moment i wished to have been in his situation rather than my own  but when i thought of what you must have suffered had he lived it in some measure reconciled me to his death though never julia will my mind know peace for having been the unhappy instrument of his untimely fate  i was a thousand times tempted to give myself up to justice and expiate my crime by yielding up my life  but there again you interfered i could not bear the thought of loading you with ignominy of blasting your fair fame and leaving you alone to stand the shock of infamy  yet while i write i feel i shall not long support my share of misery  a burning fever preys upon my nerves  how wretched is my lot still doomed to add new sorrows to that heart for whose dear peace i would ten thousand times have sacrificed my own  i tremble for your sufferings julia when you shall hear your henry is no more  yet o my love my life remember that if my days were lengthened they must be days of sorrow nor would our fate permit that i should soften or alleviate yours  we must have parted julia and what is death but parting its only pang is there and that is past  then grudge me not the sole retreat of misery the peaceful grave there only can your henry know rest and there i trust that he shall find it if true contrition can atone his crime o my loved julia add your prayers to mine for pardon and peace to the departing spirit of your faithful dying  henry   i will not vainly strive to paint the agonies i endured from the perusal of this letter and the fatal account that followed it  but o my lucy   grief will not kill for julia lives to say that henry died here let me close the sad detail of all my sorrows  they could know no addition  can you my once dear friend without abhorrence think of her who robbed you of a brother and was the unhappy cause his pure and spotless soul was stained with blood  are you not now amazed how conscious of the evils i had brought upon your family i dared to view your face or to behold the day yet such was the fatality of my attachment to my dear departed henry i could not bear my own existence but at those times my thoughts were fixed on him and my sad fancy busied in retracing the likeness of his features in an evelyns face  the secret of my woes is now revealed and my heart lightened of an heavy load  but after this confession i must decline our ever meeting more  i should sink down abashed before you and wound your gentle mind by my abasement  but at this distance we may still converse the healing balm of pity here may reach me and soften every pain  may saints and angels guard your steps and innocence conduct them to the paths of bliss  j harley    letter lxiv lady stanley to lady juliana my truly loved and most unhappy friend why have you broke my heart i think my tears will never cease to flow you deign to ask my pity you have more much more my admiration and esteem  most truly do i revere your fortitude and mourn your sorrows  in what sad ills has your inhuman fathers cruelty involved my hapless brother the illfated harley and your dear suffering self yet i respect the mildness with which you treat the memory of him who was at once the author of your being and your woes  i at this moment blush from recollecting the petulance with which i have often jested with your grief unknowing of the cause can you forgive me julia yes i know you will though i cannot pardon myself  it is impossible that any human being can think you guilty of mr harleys death and heaven that judges from intention only will most surely acquit you nor did my unhappy brother i am well convinced ever purpose such a crime his guilt was accidental and he most surely forfeited his life in expiation of it  the rigor of the laws could ask no more and heaven i trust accepted of his penitence  a thousand things recur to my remembrance that strongly proved my brother wished to die he concealed his illness till it was past cure nor even then would be prevailed upon to keep his bed or take any kind of medicine  fear not my friend that i shall ever more attempt to change your purpose or strive to draw you from your sanctuary  the world contains no joys for griefworn minds  the slender superstructure of all earthly pleasures must soon decay if not supported by an heart at ease  but those more permanent delights that arise from an holy and religious fervor which like the vital flame is never extinguished shall still be yours and time that lessens the value of all other enjoyments will but increase theirs till even this life may afford you sueh a state of happiness as only can beheightened in the next  without your leave i never shall break in on your retirement yet sure the time may come when all your sorrows shall subside to rest and my then sainted friend may look on lucys face without emotion in the mean time my prayers and tears are yours  write to me i entreat you tell me that grief is banished from your bosom and that the roselipped cherub peace has filled its room  adieu my most beloved and most lamented friend l stanley  letter lxv mr sewell to mr simpson dear jack the route is come and i think it high time to march mensieur dupont will be in town in a few days  i have reason to apprehend that there are others who mean to decamp as well as i but i may perhaps put a spoke in the wheel of the ammunitioncart i never was so near being nicked in my life but as luck would have it i discovered the trick before they counted game  in return for the intended deceit i have laid a train that shall blow them all up though i will not wait the springing of the mine  this is all heathen greek to you but i shall see you in a few days and at meeting the riddle shall be explained by  yours g sewell p s provide me handsome lodgings for i mean to make a figure    letter lxvi sir william stanley to mr evelyn dear charles matters are now come to such a crisis in the desmond family that i think your presence and yours only can adjust them  i will however relate the particulars of their present situation and leave you to determine with regard to your coming as you think proper  the card parties at sir james desmonds have been for some time past to all appearance broken up our dear emma regained her ease and cheerfulness and her husband seemed to behave with more affection and attention toward her than he had done since her arrival in london  but what can escape the piercing eyes of love emma soon found out that the scene was only changed and that the nightly origes were still held at madame duponts in burystreet her husband who is much to be pitied having been for some time in the country  in consequence of this discovery some little altercation passed between sir james and lady desmond he had however art enough to lull her anxiety to rest and all seemed peace and harmony between them  on saturday last emma dined at our house sir james was expected but sent an apology after dinner she was affected with some little complaints incident to her situation for she is far gone with child and expressed an earnest desire to go home  lucy would have attended her but we had other company nor did she think her sister very ill  our carriage was immediately ordered for her and she left us  in a very short time after one of her servants came running almost breathless to our house and entreated i would come to his lady directly  almost at the same minute a messenger brought me a note from sir james desmond dated from a bailiffs house in careystreet requesting me to come to him instantly  i immediately supposed emmas alarm to proceed from a knowledge of her husbands situation and flew to her to relieve her apprehensions and assure her of my assistance  when i entered her apartment i found her lying breathless on a couch her maids in vain endeavoring to recover her from a swoon there was a letter lying by her which i knew to be her husbands writing and was shocked at his inhumanity in having acquainted her with his distress  i sent off directly for a surgeon to bleed her and also a note to lucy desiring her to acquaint her company that lady desmond was taken ill and come to her as fast as possible  i waited in hopes that her senses would return that i might be able to set her mind at ease about her husband but with all the aid that could be given her she relapsed from one fainting fit into another and the surgeon who attended seemed to be apprehensive for her life  my lucy was almost distracted the poor little fanny clung round her dying mother and i confess i never was so much distressed upon any occasion in my life  lucy caught up the letter that lay by lady desmond and before she could have read more than half of it she burst into tears and sunk upon the sofa by her sister  i seized the contagious scroll and read the following lines  to lady desmomd before this paper will reach your hands we shall be many miles asunder  i hope your sense and virtue will enable you to conquer any remains of tenderness you may yet feel for a man who acknowledges himself unworthy of it  our affections are not in our power and though i own that mine have strayed to an object perhaps less amiable than yourself believe me emma i would not thus publicly have deferted you had it been in my power to have supported appearances any longer but in truth i am a ruined man and had i staid must have involved you in misery without extricating myself for my pride would never suffer me to bear the being indebted to your family for the means of subsistence and i have long since parted with the last of mine  the sincerest satisfaction i can at present feel arises from the certainty that your brother will take care of you and my little fanny and will properly educate the child you carry if it should be a son  the generous girl who accompanies my flight has sacrificed all that was dear to her for my sake  bear her no hatred emma she is much less to blame than him who for the last time subscribes himself your husband  j desmond   i was almost struck speechless with indignation at the perusal of this vile paper and was no longer surprised at lady desmonds situation but could by no means reconcile its contents with the summons i had so lately received from sir james  i instantly set about unravelling the mystery and thought if i could bring sir james desmond back to his house his presence would more effectually contribute to his wifes recovery than any other medicine that could be tried  when i reached careystreet i saw sir james desmonds postchaise and four horses standing at some distance from the bailiffs house  when i came into the room where he was madame dupont was seated by him in an elegant traveling dress  he immediately started up and said sir william i fear your delay has undone me i shall not get out of this odious house tonight  i replied sir james i cannot possibly think of speaking to you upon this subject before a third person i therefore must request that this lady may be shown into another apartment  madame dupont rose with the most disdainful air rung the bell and said she thought i might guess that there were no secrets now between sir james and her but that she should however comply with my illbred request  upon the waiters entrance he told her there was not a vacant room in the house but that there was an elderly lady in the next who had been confined there about three weeks and she might if she pleased walk in there  she tripped out with the waiter and in a very few minutes we heard her utter a loud scream  i rushed out to see what was the occasion of it when i beheld lady mortons venerable figure bending over her unworthy daughter and heard her say my child you are come at last  madame dupont turned from her and with a look of indignation said to me i suppose this is your scheme sir william  the good old lady gazed in silence at us both the tears fast falling down her pallid cheek  i addressed her with the utmost respect and told her i was sincerely sorry to see her in a place so ill betfiting her rank and worth  she calmly answered i cannot feel sorrow in marias presence if love and duty bring her to this place  i thought those words must necessarily affect her daughter deeply and bowing retired from the chamber  when i returned to sir james i acquainted him with the interview i had been witness to  he seemed much surprised and said it cannot be lady morton is at her nephews house in shropshire madame dupont assured me she was there  i was charmed at his discovering this instance of her falsehood and inhumanity but could not expatiate long on the subject as i was impatient to acquaint him with lady desmonds situation  he was affected even to tears at my relation but said it was impossible he could ever see her more  i told him if he persisted in this resolution it was almost certain that his wife would never see another morning and that not only the whole world but his own heart must tell him he had murdered her  he started wildly at these words and struck his breast  then said you know it is impossible sir william i cannot if i would go see my injured emma  that villain sewell has undone us all it is at his suit i am here  i replied most willingly do i forgive his villainy since he has detained you for the happy purpose of saving lady desmonds life and your own character but do not waver any longer come with me this moment or we may be too late i will be answerable to the bailiff for sewells claim let it be what it may  sir james again repeated it is impossible  i cannot forsake maria she has left all for me  she never can return to her husband and i will not abandon her to want and infamy  emma has virtue and religion to support my loss and all who know love and esteem her i am the only man on earth that would forsake her but she has better friends than such a wretch as me  long was our argument before i could prevail but he at length consented to throw himself at lady desmonds feet and if she received him as the returning prodigal to remain with her till she was able to go abroad with him if it should be her choice but that on no account would he remain in england a bankrupt and a beggar  but the chief point he insisted upon was that if he gave up madame dupont she should be taken care of out of the wreck of his fortunes and not be suffered to know distress on his account but have some competent annuity settled upon her for her support  nothing but lady desmonds life being at stake could have made me comply with these terms for her sake i acceded to them all and ratified the engagement with my honor provided he would quit the bailiffs house without seeing his circe  he agreed and sat down to write a short farewell  there remained now i imagined nothing to be done but to pass a security to the bailiff for sewells demand which was fifteen hundred pounds and carry sir directly to his own house  but to my great concern and surprise i found that there were already writs and executions upon sundry notes and bonds lodged in the bailiffs hand to the amount of twelve thousand pounds and that he would by no means consent to enlarge his prisoner till these debts were discharged  had i been in possession of so large a sum and would have laid it down that would not have procured sir jamess release at that time as it was saturday night the sheriffs office was shut and the governor of this enchanted castle would not suffer his guest to depart till every form of law was fulfilled  i had no resource left but an applicacation to the bailiffs humanity by acquainting him with lady desmonds situation and offering to be security for sir jamess forthcoming on monday morning  the man paused for some time then said so the madam that came here with his honor is not his wife  these are bad doings and she shall walk out of my house directly  and if so be that your honor will get another person to be security with you the gentleman shall go and see his sick lady for i never was hardhearted in my life  i immediately sent to my friend mr drummond who at my request became responsible with me for sir jamess appearance  i then ordered a chair to be in readiness to convey madame dupont where she thought proper as soon as we were gone out of the house  i got sir james into my carriage and drove as hard as possible to charlesstreet  in our way i inquired how his friend sewell had been so far irritated against him as to arrest him without giving him the least previous notice of his intention he told me that he had discovered his design of eloping with madame dupont by a note which she had dropped in which the time and place of their setting out was fixed for at the very spot which was in parklane and on the instant of their meeting the bailiffs seized him  he called sewell a thousand opprobrious names and swore his blood should expiate his villainy  yet at the same time he said he rejoiced in his being detained if his presence could relieve one pang of lady desmonds but he was certain she must feel more sorrow from seeing him languish out his life in a prison as he must probably do upon his being surrendered back into custody again than she would have known from his leaving her  as we drew near berkeleysquare he became extremely agitated and talked and looked as if he was distracted  i was sensible of a mixed sensation toward him compounded of compassion and contempt and felt very uneasy apprehensions for the consequences of the interview between him and our dear emma  he entered his house like a culprit without even daring to enquire into the state of his wifes health when i went up stairs i found she was in bed and that her fainting fits had subsided about half an hour that she was perfectly sensible though speechless and that her tears flowed abundantly  when i approached the bedside she cast a look expressive of the most anxious inquiry toward me to which i immediately replied he waits but your permission to throw himself at his loved emmas feet  she raised herself with an amazing quickness and opened wide her arms but instantly sunk back and fainted quite away  while the persons about her were using means for her recovery i brought sir james into the room he knelt by her bedside and wept the moment her senses returned she gazed upon him with a look of tenderness caught up his hand and pressed it to her lips and with a scarcely articulate voice said you will not leave me  he replied never by heaven my love and clasped her in his arms  her joy became too powerful and she again relapsed into a state of weakness  i forced sir james out of the chamber and never yet saw any person so strongly affected as he appeared to be he called himself a murderer said he had never known how tenderly he loved his wife till that sad hour vowed if she died he would destroy himself and doubted the possibility of her forgiving him  yet in the midst of all his fond emotions he lamented the unhappy situation in which he had involved madame dupont but fortunately he has since received a letter from her which has entirely relieved his apprehensions for her and contributed more effectually to the restoration of his affections where they were justly due than any other circumstance could possibly have done  in this letter she loaded him with the most opprobrious terms and added the epithet of mean or poor spirited to them all thanked heaven for being released from a wretch who was contemptible enough to return home and ask forgiveness of his wife  said her spirit could never brook such meanness and that therefore she had sought and found protection in the arms of a man every way his superior who was neither a bankrupt in honor in fortune or in love  she assured him of her sincere detestation and desired if his wifes relations should be weak enough to trust him with his liberty that he should avoid hers and lord somners presence  sir james was almost petrified at the perusal of this extraordinary epistle but upon recollection said he felt himself relieved from a weight which only such behavior could ever have removed as she had art sufficient to persuade him that the violence of her passion for him alone could have prevailed on her to swerve from virtue but he was now convinced that it was her aversion to the sober duties of a married life that had occasioned her misconduct he however reproached himself severely as the prime cause of her crimes and follies which he said he should repent of along with his own to the last hour of his life  a new cause of distress now occurred lady desmond was seized with labor pains i left lucy with her and brought sir james to my house yesterday morning she was delivered of a son who though born two months before his time is likely to live and she thank heaven is in a fair way of recovery  this morning i accompanied the penitent baronet back to his prison in careystreet where he said he should be content to pass his days provided emma could be made happy i find upon enquiry that most of his debts are of the same nature of sewells demand from whom he did not receive above five hundred for the bond of fifteen  these matters must be litigated and the scoundrels who have cheated him exposed  about noon i procured his release upon bail and the moment i returned home though much fatigued sat down to give you this long and circumstantial detail of every thing relative to our dear emma  i again repeat my wish for your return to london your presence will diffuse tranquillity and joy amongst us all  but let we warn you my dear charles against being too rigidly virtuous the baronet is truly penitent   and in sooth so humbled that he has left part of his grief with me to suffer with him he seems to detest his former follies particularly his fondness for play which he confesses has involved him and all that is dear to him in beggary and ruin  with sincere concern i tell you that my dear lucy has for some time past entirely lost her cheerfulness and vivacity she has received a long letter or rather history from lady juliana harley which she says she cannot communicate even to me  she shuts herself up for hours to read this doleful tale and comes out of her dressing room with her eyes swollen with tears  thank heaven the woes she weeps are not her own  adiu my dear evelyn i can no longer hold the pen than to subscribe myself  yours w stanley  letter lxvii mr evelyn to sir william stanley how could you my dear stanley make me suffer through the long detail of your letter by not at first acquainting me that emmas life was safe every paragraph i read made me tremble for the next as i expected it to contain the period of her life and sufferings  unhappy much loved sister i fear they will not separately end  notwithstanding your caution i feel the strongest indignation against sir james desmond and pay but little regard to his mere attrition for such i consider his present state of humiliation  there is no palliation for his misconduct but the weakness of his understanding  what a tottering foundation to build any permanent hope upon experience may make fools cunning but nothing can make them wise and his reigning vice is of such a nature that men of the best sense once infected with it find it difficult to get the better of  how do i lament that emmas happiness is bound in his and that he should ignorantly possess a treasure richer than all his tribe i have not your calmness stanley and cannot think with patience of his casting such a pearl away  but emma must be made happy and if my whole fortune can effect that purpose it will be well bestowed  that wretched scoundrel sewell who is now here and whom i sent for as soon as i had read your letter has offered to reduce his demand to the sum of five hundred pounds which he lent sir james out of the money he had cheated him of provided he is not exposed but i refused any terms of accommodation with him threatened him with a prosecution and have publicly proclaimed him a cheat  i perfectly recollect your antipathy and my sympathy toward this man your presentiment though since proved more just had less foundation than mine which arose from an open cheerful countenance that has always appeared to me the index of an honest heart for i shall never read rascal in any mans countenance till his actions have rendered the characters legible  though it seems that as hamlet says a man may smile and smile and be a villain  i must necessarily be detained here some days longer as i have promised to stay with mr and mrs harrison till they are ready to set out for the continent but had i no engagement i should not wish to meet sir james desmond till my resentment toward him is somewhat abated i also think that emma must as yet be in too weak a state to bear even the slight emotion which might arise from seeing me after such an incident in the mean time i entreat you to use every possible means of settling sir james desmonds affairs and for that purpose enclose you an unlimited letter of credit on my banker the first use i desire you to make of it is to release lady morton from her confinement i cannot express what i felt at your description of the interview between her and her unnatural daughter whose infamous conduct has brought her mothers silver hairs with sorrow to the grave  though this expression be a common one it can never cease to be affecting  do not be offended with me stanley for saying that i am not sorry lucys feelings should be augmented even at the expense of her vivacity  tenderness stands second in the catalogue of female charms modesty is its only antecedent and always its companion they are both derived from the same source from sensibility and those soft drops which pity has engendered add infinitely more luster to the speaking eye than all the jewels that ever issued from golcondas mines or blazed around a diadem  but think what i myself must suffer when you say that lucys tears flow for lady julianas sorrow why am i ever doomed to be unhappy from the miseries of those that are most dear to me there is a fatal influence attends my love which equals the malignity arising from another persons hate  write to me by every post i entreat you  i shall not know peace till i hear that emmas is restored  yours most truly c evelyn  letter lxviii madame dupont to lady oshaughnasy london my dear shanasy  i must abbreviate your horrid name  i am extremely glad you are returned to this delightful metropolis which i was near quitting upon a very foolish errand  that worthless wretch sir james desmond is a greater deceiver than even your baronet  but i hope his wife will turn termagant since he has bowed to the distaff and revenge my quarrel  luckily i had more spirit than my contemptible lover for having once broken ground i did not choose to return to my husband and cry pray pray for forgiveness  i am now extremely happy in the friendly protection of lord somners  i hear poor dupont is almost distracted at my loss and has commenced a suit in doctors commons in order to obtain a divorce  i shall not oppose his inclination for i have no doubt if it takes place that i shall obtain the title of lady instead of madame  but should i even be disappointed in this expectation one blessing i am sure of  that of being free  duponts fortune was too confined for my inclinations and he would by no means consent to my endeavoring to increase it by play or any other of the polite moyens de vivre poor simpleton he went into the country to find out a proper place for us to retire to where we might live soberly within our income but i had no idea of being buried alive at five and twenty and therefore did not choose to wait his return  though you have as you say been pillaged i assure you that you may make a very tolerable figure upon your ten thousand for i know many women in this town who have not the tenth part of the money who keep good company and play at gold loo every night  there lies the whole secret my dear and if i should be so lucky as to become lady somners i will take care to introduce you into proper setts for the purpose  keep up your spirits i desire you and come to me this evening  i dont care to go much abroad in my present situation and shall be glad of an agreeable female friend to join our little party on your account we shall not play high tonight so that if you put fifty pieces in your cardpurse for i dare say you have not a pambox they will probably be sufficient  rely upon my friendship and believe me sincerely  yours m dupont  letter lxix lady desmond to mr evelyn i am persuaded that a line from me will give you pleasure as it will be a more convincing proof of my recovery than any other that you can at this distance receive  yes my most generous and best of brothers your emma is again restored to health and happiness and at this hour more blessed than if she had never tasted sorrow  my husbands tenderness and virtue are now established on a solid base  he sees his errors and sure that is sufficient to prevent his ever falling into them again  but he does more he feelingly repents them  his sorrow is sincere it flows from love for me and for our children as well as from contrition  he regards not his own sufferings but cannot bear the thought of my partaking them he strives to conceal the anguish of his mind from me and would rather it should still prey upon his heart than be alleviated by the sympathy of mine  but i will watch over his dejected spirit will pour the balm of tenderness upon his reclaimed heart and speak of comfort to my afflicted mourner these are the offices of virtuous love the real proofs of conjugal affection and most supremely happy do i think myself in being called to this delightful task  we never know our strength till it is tried our virtues and our passions all lie dormant unless occasion calls them forth bred up in ease and affluence a life of poverty appeared to me a state of misery the idea was delusive and is vanished  can i regret the pomp of dress and equipage when put in competition with my husbands love while i possessed them did they make me happy too truly i can answer they did not  and are not millions so who never have enjoyed them  to this you may reply  there is a wide distinction between privation and deprivation those who have never known the elegancies of life can easily support the wants they scarcely feel but by habit they become necessary to those who have long enjoyed them  but what is virtue charles is it not strength of mind to conquer habit or else an empty name i wish to express myself as strongly as possible upon this subject to relieve your apprehensions for my happiness which i am well convinced is totally independent of the goods of fortune  sir james who is sensible of the most lively gratitude for your more than brotherly affection is resolved to be no farther burdensome to your generosity  his debts my brother stanley says may be compounded for about five thousand pounds  the sale of our house jewels plate and other effects will probably amount to more than this sum and there is still a little estate left of about three hundred pounds a year  with this in many parts of the world we shall be rich but in any part of it we shall be more than rich we shall be happy  i have not yet mentioned your new relation my little charles he was called after you by his fathers particular desire his mother not opposing  he thrives apace and my sweet fanny grows almost an angel  think you i would exchange these treasures for potosis mines  i most earnestly wish to see you and as we shall not stay longer in london than is absolutely necessary to the settling of our affairs i hope you will not delay your coming  i am with the sincerest gratitude my dear charless most affectionate sister  e desmond  letter lxx mr evelyn to sir william stanley dear stanley i have by this post received a letter from lady desmond which has affected me almost as much as your account of her distress though the emotion i felt was of a different kind  i am charmed with the virtue and good sense she possesses in her present unhappy situation and my affection is increased by my esteem for her worth  i begin also to be sensible of a kind of sympathy toward sir james from the spirit he has shown in rejecting my proffered assistance at a time when he standso much in need of it  i could not have avoided thinking meanly of him if he had condescended to accept of a support from an injured wife  the spirit of independence is natural to men from thence arises the only justifiable reason that can be assigned for the dominion they assume over the other sex and whenever they relinquish the power of assisting themselves  housewives should make a skillet of their helms this kind of argument might appear to any one who did not know me as meant for a salvo to myself on having altered my intentions toward emma and her family  on the contrary my attachment to her happiness and interest is stronger at this moment than it has ever been though i rejoice at finding that she will have less occasion for pecuniary assistance than either she or her husband apprehend at present  for this information i am indebted to sewell who though undoubtedly a knave is willing to make a merit of disclosing the villainy of others provided his own may go unpunished  on these terms he has offered to make very material discoveries and i have promised to secure him from any legal inflictions leaving him to be punished only with the loss of character and the stings of his own conscience  our kings evidence then has laid open a most complicated scene of wickedness and is ready to prove that the jew who bought the estate on which emmas jointure of five hundred pounds a year was settled the power over which unluckily devolved to her by my having neglected to administer to my brother who was her sole trustee did not pay in sterling cash above six thousand for it though the bargain was made for fifteen thousand which was much under the real value but in lieu of money made sir james accept of old goods and chattels which when sold did not produce above eight hundred pounds as this rascally usurer who by the way is only a jew in his dealings has amassed a noble fortune by his villainy i shall have infinite pleasure not only in making him refund his infamous purchase but in exposing him to the contempt he deserves  o heaven that such companions should unfold and put in every honest hand a whip to lash the rascal naked through the world even from east to west i enclose you the heads of a bill which i request you will get immediately filed against that wretch of an usurer  i shall be in town in a very few days to prosecute the suit in the mean time i insist upon it that sir james desmond shall not part with his house or any thing else that he possesses for i have no doubt of being able to reestablish his fortune upon a better foundation than it has been for a considerable time past  and if he has as emma says seen his errors in a true light i will endeavor to hope that their happiness may be as permanent as their lives at least i shall take care that nothing on my part shall be wanting to ensure it for it is only from the happiness of others that i can hence forward derive my own the prospect of bliss in a direct line being for ever barred from my hopes  all those fond schemes relative to myself which youthful fancy once had formed are now blasted and in adopted children only shall i look for heirs  when i come amongst you i flatter myself you will be a little more communicative than you have hitherto been with regard to lady julianas situation be it what it may my warmest wishes for her happiness for ever shall attend her  my very worthy friends the harrisons set out from hence for dover on tuesday next  miss harrison has consented to give her hand to mr stuart the gentleman i mentioned before as her lover as soon as they arrive at a proper place on the continent  her delicacy would not permit her to be married here as the scene would too strongly recall to her mind the imprudent step she was so near having taken with captain williams  i shall hope for the happiness of seeing you and all my sisters in perfect health on wednesday evening  i most sincerely long to embrace ye all  nor shall the repentant sir james desmond be excluded from his share of that brotherly affection with which i am most truly  yours c evelyn p s i hope lucy has recovered her cheerfulness without losing her sensibility as i am very certain they are compatible  tell emma i thank her for her letter and will answer it in person    letter lxxi madame dupont to lady oshaughnasy my dear shanacy i am utterly undone and have no refuge but your friendship to fly to  you know that monsieur dupont has obtained a divorce and of course i am for ever barred from any claim to his assistance or support  wretch that i am why did i forsake the best and worthiest of men but repentance on this subject is now too late  and i shall not take up your time with unavailing lamentations  while the suir was depending i did not perceive the least abatement in lord somners fondness for me but as soon as the affair was determined i affected to grow extremely melancholy and more than hinted that nothing but a matrimonial connection with him could restore my happiness  he constantly waived the subject whenever it was mentioned and i began to think i had better appear to be satisfied with my situation than risk a quarrel that might possibly end in separation and trust to my charms and blandishments to effect my purpose at some future time  the artful monster took advantage of my apparent fondness and one evening that we unfortunately talked of that bane to my happiness your detested sisterinlaw he drew me in so far as to confess that my hatred to her arose from my love to him and that i had traduced her character merely to prevent his marrying her  this you know was a falsehood for it was more to gratify you than myself that i at that time unjustly censured her however i flattered myself that as he seemed to have entirely forgotten her he would only think of the affair in the light i wished and receive the calumny as a proof of my love  but it turned out alas quite otherways  my cunning overshot the mark  his pride appeared to be hurt at being deceived and he wrote a letter directly to lady julianas brother lord r  who was in scotland acquainting him with the means by which he had been imposed on and entreating his and his sisters forgiveness  this huffgruff don of a nobleman arrived in town yesterday and came directly to our house lord somners was at home and i could hear enough of their conversation to discover that there was a very warm altercation between them  i trembled like an aspin leaf cursed my own folly for having betrayed myself and when lord somners came into my dressing room i was as pale as death and looked like a culprit that expected sentence to be pronounced against him  the insensible barbarian somners appeared perfectly composed and with the utmost sang froid said he was very sorry to be under a necessity of informing me that he could not have the honor of my company any longer under his roof for that lord r  had insisted on his abandoning the woman who had injured and villified the spotless character of his sister  though i was shocked almost to death at his indifference i mustered up courage enough to tell him that i could not suppose him to be such a mean spirited wretch as to give up a woman who had sacrificed every thing to him to save himself from lord r  s resentment  he replied that this was by no means the case on either side for he thought it but a flight compensation for the injuries he had done an amiable and virtuous woman to give up one who had made the sacrifice she boasted to sir james desmond at least if not to others  i grew outrageous at his insolence but my fury had no effect upon his impenetrable head or heart  he certainly never loved me he took out of his pocketbook a bill for five hundred and left it on the table saying he hoped that sum would provide for me till i had formed a more lasting connection and bowing left me  i think i should have gone mad but for this last proof of his tenderness which has helped to console me for his loss  i now propose my dear shanacy that you and i should set out together for brighthelmstone southampton scarborough or any other public rendezvous of the gay and idle where i hope soon to repair the errors i have fallen into by drawing some young man of fortune into the matrimonial noose  your title and appearance will be of infinite service to me on this occasion and the sooner this scheme is put in practice the better  i shall send my trunks to your lodgings directly and they shall be followed by your sincerely affectionate friend  i do not know what to sign myself  but it shall be  maria morton  letter lxxii lady oshaughnasy to miss morton really miss morton i am quite astonished at your assurance and were it not to prevent your coming or sending your trunks to me i should take no notice of your extraordinary letter how could you ever presume that i would appear in public with a woman that has been divorced from her husband and lived as a kept mistress with another man let me tell you madam you are extremely mistaken in my character  it is true that on my first coming to london being very low spirited and having no acquaintance in town i did condescend to sup with you two or three times in private and i think i paid pretty handsomely for my entertainment  besides you were not then divorced and i might in charity suppose that your connection with lord somners was perfectly innocent  but the matter is much too clear at present for lady oshaughnasy to be seen with miss morton  how could i with any face upbraid my husband for keeping an infamous woman if i should become the companion of such a one myself  and as to your making a merit to me of your traducing lady julianas character you know full well that it was to gratify your own spleen and jealousy against her for having deprived you of your fancied conquest mr evelyn  but in truth miss morton though i do not wish to mortify you at present i am certain he never did or could like you  but nothing can conquer some peoples vanity  i have been informed that sir john oshaughnasy is at scarborough  it is my duty to follow him there and i have no doubt of recovering his affections  i mention this circumstance in order to prevent your bending your course that way as i should be sorry to be obliged to treat a person with contempt for whom i once had a small portion of regard and for this reason i hope you will henceforth avoid any further intercourse with  a oshaughnasy  letter lxxiii lady juliana to lady stanley dijon dried be my lucys tears and may each trace of sorrow she has ever felt for her unhappy friend vanish at the receipt of this like morning dews before the rising sun no cause remains for lucy now to weep her sister magdalen the name lady juliana assumed with the veil is well and happy  your letter was the harbinger of peace i could no longer doubt of heavens forgiveness when a frail mortal like myself looked with compassion on my sufferings and thought they had atoned for all my faults hope once again illumined my sad mind and stilled the beating of my anxious heart  i dared to make my vows  from that blessed hour no pang has harrowed up my soul no bursts of grief have since deformed my face  though the soft drops of penitence sincere will never cease to flow  yes lucy i believe that i could bear to see you now and meet your looks with firmness yet for your sake i would postpone the interview till use has made the idea of our separation more easy to your friendly heart  yet let me not turn boaster perhaps your presence might recall ideas that should be ever banished from my mind then do not risk my present tranquillity but strive to wean yourself from the affection which you long have borne me and think of me as a departed friend  to complete my earthly happiness i have received a letter from my brother filled with the tenderest acknowledgments of what he calls the unlucky error that had led him to behave unkindly to me and the most earnest entreaties to return and pass my days with him without control  blessed be the power of truth that has relieved his mind from the indignant yet humiliating sensation that must arise from the dishonor of a sister  for my own part i never felt resentment to my foes and only grieved for what my brother suffered i am indebted to their malice lucy  they meant to sting my heart but have procured its peace  may penitence for the intended mischief assuage their own remorse  i am infinitely indebted to the amiable superior of our convent for many indulgencies  she knew and loved my mother and has transferred that kindness to your friend  from this cause were there no other i should be pleased with her society but she is sensible as well as good  i mention this little circumstance to render you more easy at my seclusion from a world which has to me most surely been a world of woe  may every happiness it can afford await my tender friend and may we meet again in that blessed place where every tear is wiped from every eye to part no more  st mary magdalen  finis
