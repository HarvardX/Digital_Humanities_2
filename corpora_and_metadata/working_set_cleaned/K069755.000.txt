excite agreeable sensations with a tale    on the province of comedy various are the methods which art and ingenuity have invented to exhibit a picture of human life and manners these have differed from each other both in the mode of representation and in the particular view of the subject which has been taken with respect to the first it is universally allowed that the dramatic form is by far the most perfect the circumstance of leaving every character to display itself in its own proper language with all the variations of tone and gesture which distinguish it from others and which mark every emotion of the mind and the scenic delusions of dress painting and machinery contribute to stamp such an appearance of reality upon dramatic representations as no other of the imitative arts can attain indeed when in their perfection they can scarcely be called imitations but the tragedy and serious parts into that called a comedy yet it has ever been understood that what constitutes the essential and invariable character of each is something which is expressed by the terms tragic and comic and comes under the head of serious or ludicrous emotions referring therefore to a future consideration the propriety of introducing serious parts in a comedy i shall now lay down the character of comedy as a dramatic composition exhibiting a ludicrous picture of human life and manners  there are two sources of ludicrous emotions which it is proper here to distinguish one of these arises from character the other from incident the first is attached and appropriated to the person and makes a part as it were of his composition the other is merely accidental proceeding from awkward situations odd and uncommon circumstances and the like which may happen indifferently to every person if we compare these with regard to their dignity and utility we shall find a further difference since that proceeding from character belongs to a very respectable part of knowledge that of human manners and has for its end the correction of foibles whereas that proceeding from incident is mean and trivial in its origin and answers no other purpose than present mirth it is true it is perfectly natural to be pleased with risible objects even of the lowest kind and a fastidious aversion to their exhibition may be accounted mere affected nicety yet since we rank comedy among the higher and more refined species of composition let us assign it the more honorable office of exhibiting and correcting the ludicrous part of characters and leave to bartholemew fair the ingenious contrivances of facetious drollery and handicraft merriment  the following sources may be pointed out from whence comic character is derived  nations like individuals have certain leading features which distinguish them from others of these there are always some of a ludicrous cast which afford matter of entertainment to their neighbors comedy has at all times made very free with national peculiarities and although the ridicule has often been conducted in a trivial and illiberal manner by greatly overcharging the picture and introducing idle and unjust accusations yet i think we need not go so far as entirely to reject this sort of ludicrous painting since it may be as important to warn against the imitation of foreign follies as those of our own growth indeed when a frenchman or irishman is brought upon our stage merely to talk broken english or make bulls there can be no plea either of wit or utility to excuse the illiberal jest but when the nicer distinctions of national character are exposed with a just and delicate ridicule the spectacle may be both intertaining and instructive amidst the tribe of foreign valets to be met with on the english theater i would instance canton in the clandestine marriage as an admirable example of true national character independent on language and grimace the obsequiousness and attentive flattery of the servile swissfrenchman are quite characteristic as well as the careless insolence and affected airs of brush the english footman i am concerned to observe an instance of illiberal national ridicule without any merit of composition to palliate it from a respectable dramatic writer which is also rendered much more obnoxious by the circumstances mr voltaires ecossaise was purposely written to exhibit a worthy english character marked indeed with some whimsical peculiarities but distinguished by a strong spirit of benevolence it was impossible to expose national foibles more gently than by combining them with national virtues when this piece was brought on our stage under the title of the english merchant a french valet was inserted among the personae dramatis characterised by nothing but his false english and for no other end but to be exhibited as a scoundrel oflaherty the irish soldier of fortune in the west indian is an example of similar merit much more so i think than the character from which the piece has its title  although some part of the character of a nation is pretty uniform and constant yet its manners and customs in many points are extremely variable these variations are the peculiar modes and fashions of the age and hence the age as well as the nation acquires a distinguishing character fashion in general usurps a dominion only over the smaller and less important part of manners such as dress public diversions and other matters of taste the improprieties of fashion are therefore of the absurd and ludicrous kind and consequently fit subjects of comic ridicule there is no source of comedy more fertile and pleasing than this and none in which the end of reformation is likely to be so well answered an extravagant fashion is exhibited upon the stage with such advantage of ridicule that it can scarcely stand long against it and i make no doubt that molieres marquis de mascarille and cibbers lord foppington had a considerable share in reforming the prevailing foppery of the times fashion has also too much interfered in some more serious matters as the sentiments and studies of the age here too comedy has made its attacks and the alchemist the virtuoso the antiquary the belle esprit have in their turns undergone the ridicule of the stage when their respective pursuits by being fashionable were carried to a fanciful extravagance it is well known that moliere in his comedies of the femmes savantes and the precieuses ridicules was as successful against the pedantry and pretensions to wit which infected the french nation and particularly the ladies at that period as cervantes in his attack upon knighterrantry  there is another point of national or fashionable folly in which comedy might be very useful yet the attempt has been found dangerous and perhaps the subject is too delicate for the stage considering the abuses to which it is liable i mean popular superstition and priestcraft moliere who with impunity had attacked every other species of folly was almost ruined by exposing a hypocrite and a devotee and the licentious ridicule of dryden and others of that age was generally aimed not only against superstition but religion the spanish friar however is an instance in which with exquisite humor the ridicule can hardly be blamed as improper and it certainly did more hurt to roman catholic superstition than he could ever remedy by his scholastic hind and panther how far the minor comes under the same description would probably be a subject of dispute  particular ranks and professions of men have likewise characteristical peculiarities which are capable of being placed in a ludicrous view and comedy has made frequent use of this source of ridicule in exposing professional as well as national absurdities great illiberality and unfairness have been shown both probably from the same cause a want of sufficient acquaintance with the whole characters and taking a judgment of them from a few external circumstances yet upon the whole good effects may have arisen even from this branch of comedy since by attacking a profession on a side where it was really weak the members of it have been made sensible of and have reformed those circumstances which rendered them ridiculous a goodnatured physician can never be angry at molieres most laughable exhibitions of the faculty when he reflects that the follies ridiculed though exaggerated in the representation had a real existence and by being held up to public derision have been in a great measure reformed the professors of law being necessarily confined to forms and rules have not been able to benefit so much from the comic ridicule of which they have enjoyed an equally plentiful share  besides the arrangements which nation and profession make of mankind there are certain natural classes formed from the diversities of personal character although the varieties of temper and disposition in men are infinite so that no two persons probably ever existed in whom there was an exact conformity yet there are certain leading features of character which produce a general resemblance among numerous individuals thus the proud man the vain the sanguine the splenetic the suspicious the covetous the lavish and so forth are a sort of abstract characters which divide the whole human race amongst them now there are belonging to all these objects of ridicule which it has been the business of comedy to exhibit and though perhaps no one individual of each class perfectly resembled the person held to view on the stage yet if all the circumstances exhibited are contained in the general character it appears sufficiently natural the miser of moliere is not a picture of any one miser who ever lived but of a miser considered as forming a class of human characters as these general classes however are few in number they must be soon exhausted by the writers of comedy who have been obliged for the sake of variety to exhibit those peculiarities which are more rare and singular hence have been derived many pictures of that character which we call an humourist by which is meant a character distinguished by certain ludicrous singularities from the rest of mankind the humourist is not without those marks of distinction which he may acquire like others from rank prosession or temper of mind but all these are displayed in him after a manner peculiarly his own and dashed with his leading oddities a love of what is uncommon and out of the way has often occasioned such extravagance in the representation of these characters as to disgust from their want of probability but where a due moderation is observed and the peculiarities though unusual are such as really exist in nature great entertainment may be derived from their exhibition of this kind are the admirable misanthrope and malade imaginaire of moliere and the old bachelor and sir sampson legend of congreve  from hence it appears but a small gradation to the exhibition of individuals upon the stage and yet the difference is important and essential that which marks out the distinction between individuals of the same species is something entirely uncommunicable therefore the rational end of comedy which is the reformation of folly cannot take place in personal ridicule for it will not be alleged that reforming the person himself is the object nor can it scarcely ever be just to expose an individual to the ridicule of the stage since folly and not vice being the proper subject of that ridicule it is hardly possible any one can deserve so severe a punishment indeed the exposing of folly can scarcely be the plea for all the common or even the rarer kinds of folly lie open to the attack of comedy under fictitious characters by means of which the failing may be ridiculed without the person personal ridicule must therefore turn as we find it always has done upon bodily imperfections awkward habits and uncouth gestures which the low arts of mimickry inhumanly drag forth to public view for the mean purpose of exciting present merriment in the best hands personal comedy would be a degradation of the stage and an unwarrantable severity but in the hands it would be likely if encouraged to fall into it would prove an intolerable nuisance i should therefore without hesitation join those who utterly condemn this species of comic ridicule it is also to be considered that the author shows his talents to disadvantage and cannot lay any basis of future fame in this walk for the resemblance which depends so much upon mimickry is lost upon those of the audience who are not acquainted with the original and upon every one who only reads the piece mr footes works will aptly exemplify this matter in which the fund of genuine comedy derived from happy strokes upon the manners of the times and uncommon but not entirely singular characters will secure a lasting admiration when the mimickry which supported the parts of squintum and cadwallader is despised or forgotten  having thus attempted to trace the different sources of what i conceive the essential part of true comedy the ridicule derived from character it remains to say somewhat of the mixture of additional matter which it has received as a composition  during a considerable period of modern literature wit was a commodity in great request and frequently to be met with in all kinds of composition it was no where more abundant than in comedy the genius of which it appeared peculiarly to suit from its gaiety and satirical smartness accordingly the language of comedy was a string of repartees in which a thought was bandied about from one to another till it was quite run out of breath this made a scene pass off with great vivacity but the misfortune was that distinction of character was quite lost in the contest every personage from the lord to the valet was as witty as the author himself and provided good things enough were said it was no matter from whom they came congreve with the greatest talents for true comic humor and the delineation of ludicrous character was so overrun with a fondness for brilliancy as frequently to break in upon consistency wit is an admirable ornament of comedy and judiciously applied is a high relief to humor but should never interfere with the more essential parts  we are now however happily free from all manner of danger of an inundation of wit no congreve arises to disturb the sententious gravity and calm simplicity of modern comedy a moralist may congratulate the age on hearing from the theater compositions as pure serious and delicate as are given from the pulpit when we consider how much wit and humor at the time they were most prevalent were perverted to vicious purposes we may rejoice at the sacrifice yet we may be allowed to feel a regret at the loss of an amusement which might certainly have been reconciled with innocence nay might perhaps have pleaded utility beyond what is substituted in its room sentimental comedy as it is called contains but very faint discrimination of character and scarcely any thing of ridicule its principal aim is to introduce elegant and refined sentiment particularly of the benevolent cast and to move the heart by tender and interesting situations hence they are in general much more affecting than our modern tragedies which are formed upon nearly the same plan but labor under the disadvantage of a formal stately style and manners removed too far from the rank of common life one would not perhaps wish altogether to banish from the stage pieces so moral and innocent yet it is a pity they are not distinguished by some appropriated name from a thing they so little resemble as true comedy  i fear a view of modern manners in other respects will scarcely allow us to flatter ourselves that this change in the theater chiefly proceeds from improved morality it may perhaps be more justly attributed to a false delicacy of taste which renders us unable to bear the representation of low life and to a real deficiency in genius with respect to the first genuine comedy knows no distinction of rank but can as heartily enjoy a humourous picture in the common walks of life where indeed the greatest variety is to be found as in the most cultivated and refined some have placed the distinction between farce and comedy in the rank from whence the characters are taken but i think very improperly if there is any real distinction besides the length of the pieces i should take it from the different source of the humor which in farce is mere ludicrous incident but in comedy ridiculous character this criterion however will not at all agree with the titles under which each species has already appeared  as to the other cause deficiency of genius it too plainly appears in many other productions cold correctness has laid her repressing hand upon imagination and damped all her powers the example of the ancicients has been thought to justify the gravity and simplicity of modern comedy but great as they were in many qualities of the mind in those of wit and humor they were still more defective than even ourselves in the present age they who would eagerly catch at a wretched pun or a meagre piece of plot were certainly withheld from witticism and drollery by want of invention not justness of taste i admire in the pure latin of terence the elegant sentiment and still more the knowledge of the human heart with which he abounds but i would not for them compare his genius at least in comedy with moliere and congreve lenibus atque utinam scriptis adjuncta soret vis comica  moral sentiment is the cheapest product of the mind novels and magazines and even newspapers are full of it but wit and humor threaten to leave us with stern and chesterfield  still however i would hope the state of comedy is not desperate the clandestine marriage exhibits an example of comic merit as various and perfect as perhaps any piece in our language all the sources of ludicrous character have contributed to it national ridicule appears in canton and professional in sterling lord ogleby is an excellent humourist mrs heidelberg and her niece besides a comic pettishness of temper have plenty of fashionable follies modified by city vulgarism even the lovers of tender sentiment have their share in the entertainment and i by no means would object to its occasional introduction when as it were offering itself from the circumstances then besides mr footes comic theater we have several pieces which though ranged under the list of farces contain true and original comedy of these we may instance the citizen polly honeycomb the upholsterer the apprentice and the oxonian in town it is a mistake to suppose that the matter of comedy can ever fail though general characters may be exhausted yet the prevailing follies and fashions of the times with the singularities starting up in particular ranks and orders of men must constantly supply food for the ridicule of the stage this is lawful game and the pursuit of it is well worthy the encouragement of the public so long as it is unattended with the licentiousness which disgraced the wit of the last age let ridicule be sacred to the interests of good sense and virtue let it never make a good character less respectable nor a bad one less obnoxious but let us not resign its use to commonplace maxim and insipid sentiment  the hill of science a vision in that season of the year when the serenity of the sky the various fruits which cover the ground the discolored foliage of the trees and all the sweet but fading graces of inspiring autumn open the mind to benevolence and dispose it for contemplation i was wandering in a beautiful and romantic country till curiosity began to give way to weariness and i sat me down on the fragment of a rock overgrown with moss where the rustling of the falling leaves the dashing of waters and the hum of the distant city soothed my mind into the most perfect tranquillity and sleep insensibly stole upon me as i was indulging the agreeable reveries which the objects around me naturally inspired  i immediately found myself in a vast extended plain in the middle of which arose a mountain higher than i had before any conception of it was covered with a multitude of people chiefly youth many of whom pressed forwards with the liveliest expression of ardor in their countenance though the way was in many places steep and difficult i observed that those who had but just begun to climb the hill thought themselves not far from the top but as they proceeded new hills were continually rising to their view and the summit of the highest they could before discern seemed but the foot of another till the mountain at length appeared to lose itself in the clouds as i was gazing on these things with astonishment my good genius suddenly appeared the mountain before thee said he is the hill of science on the top is the temple of truth whose head is above the clouds and a veil of pure light covers her face observe the progress of her votaries be silent and attentive  i saw that the only regular approach to the mountain was by a gate called the gate of languages it was kept by a woman of a pensive and thoughtful appearance whose lips were continually moving as though she repeated something to herself her name was memory on entering this first enclosure i was stunned with a confused murmur of jarring voices and dissonant sounds which increased on me to such a degree that i was utterly confounded and could compare the noise to nothing but the confusion of tongues at babel the road was also rough and stony and rendered more difficult by heaps of rubbish continually tumbled down from the higher parts of the mountain and broken ruins of ancient buildings which the travelers were obliged to climb over at every step insomuch that many disgusted with so rough a beginning turned back and attempted the mountain no more while others having conquered this difficulty had no spirits to ascend further and sitting down on some fragment of the rubbish harangued the multitude below with the greatest marks of importance and selfcomplacency  about half way up the hill i observed on each side the path a thick forest covered with continual fogs and cut out into labyrinths cross alleys and serpentine walks entangled with thorns and briars this was called the wood of error and i heard the voices of many who were lost up and down in it calling to one another and endeavoring in vain to extricate themselves the trees in many places shot their boughs over the path and a thick mist often rested on it yet never so much but that it was discernable by the light which beamed from the countenance of truth  in the pleasantest part of the mountain were placed the bowers of the muses whose office it was to cheer the spirits of the travelers and encourage their fainting steps with songs from their divine harps not far from hence were the fields of fiction filled with a variety of wild flowers springing up in the greatest luxuriance of richer scents and brighter colors than i had observed in any other climate and near them was the dark walk of allegory so artificially shaded that the light at noonday was never stronger than that of a bright moonshine this gave it a pleasingly romantic air for those who delighted in contemplation the paths and alleys were perplexed with intricate windings and were all terminated with the statue of a grace a virtue or a muse  after i had observed these things i turned my eye toward the multitudes who were climbing the steep ascent and observed amongst them a youth of a lively look a piercing eye and something fiery and irregular in all his motions his name was genius he darted like an eagle up the mountain and left his companions gazing after him with envy and admiration but his progress was unequal and interrupted by a thousand caprices when pleasure warbled in the valley he mingled in her train when pride beckoned toward the precipice he ventured to the tottering edge he delighted in devious and untried paths and made so many excursions from the road that his feebler companions often outstripped him i observed that the muses beheld him with partiality but truth often frowned and turned aside her face while genius was thus wasting his strength in excentric flights i saw a person of a very different appearance named application he crept along with a slow and unremitting pace his eyes fixed on the top of the mountain patiently removing every stone that obstructed his way till he saw most of those below him who had at first derided his slow and toilsome progress indeed there were few who ascended the hill with equal and uninterrupted steadiness for beside the difficulties of the way they were continually solicited to turn aside by a numerous crowd of appetites passions and pleasures whose importunity when they had once complied with they became less and less able to resist and though they often returned to the path the asperities of the road were more severely felt the hill appeared more steep and rugged the fruits which were wholesome and refreshing seemed harsh and illtasted their sight grew dim and their feet tript at every little obstruction  i saw with some surprise that the muses whose business was to cheer and encourage those who were toiling up the ascent would often sing in the bowers of pleasure and accompany those who were enticed away at the call of the passions they accompanied them however but a little way and always forsook them when they lost sight of the hill the tyrants then doubled their chains upon the unhappy captives and led them away without resistance to the cells of ignorance or the mansions of misery amongst the innumerable seducers who were endeavoring to draw away the votaries of truth from the path of science there was one so little formidable in her appearance and so gentle and languid in her attempts that i should scarcely have taken notice of her but for the numbers she had imperceptibly loaded with her chains indolence for so she was called far from proceeding to open hostilities did not attempt to turn their feet out of the path but contented herself with retarding their progress and the purpose she could not force them to abandon she persuaded them to delay her touch had a power like that of the torpedo which withered the strength of those who came within its influence her unhappy captives still turned their faces toward the temple and always hoped to arrive there but the ground seemed to slide from beneath their feet and they found themselves at the bottom before they suspected they had changed their place the placid serenity which at first appeared in their countenance changed by degrees into a melancholy languor which was tinged with deeper and deeper gloom as they glided down the stream of insignificance a dark and sluggish water which is curled by no breeze and enlivened by no murmur till it falls into a dead sea where the startled passengers are awakened by the shock and the next moment buried in the gulf of oblivion  of all the unhappy deserters from the paths of science none seemed less able to return than the followers of indolence the captives of appetite and passion could often seize the moment when their tyrants were languid or asleep to escape from their enchantment but the dominion of indolence was constant and unremitted and seldom resisted till resistance was in vain  after contemplating these things i turned my eyes toward the top of the mountain where the air was always pure and exhilerating the path shaded with laurels and other evergreens and the effulgence which beamed from the face of the goddess seemed to shed a glory round her votaries happy said i are they who are permitted to ascend the mountain  but while i was pronouncing this exclamation with uncommon ardour i saw standing beside me a form of diviner features and a more benign radiance happier said she are those whom virtue conducts to the mansions of content what said i does virtue then reside in the vale i am found said she in the vale and i illuminate the mountain i cheer the cottager at his toil and inspire the sage at his meditation i mingle in the crowd of cities and bless the hermit in his cell i have a temple in every heart that owns my influence and to him that wishes for me i am already present science may raise you to eminence but i alone can guide you to felicity while the goddess was thus speaking i stretched out my arms toward her with a vehemence which broke my slumbers the chill dews were falling around me and the shades of evening stretched over the landscape i hastened homeward and resigned the night to silence and meditation  on romances an imitation of all the multifarious productions which the efforts of superior genius or the labors of scholastic industry have crowded upon the world none are perused with more insatiable avidity or disseminated with more universal applause than the narrations of feigned events descriptions of imaginary scenes and delineations of ideal characters the celebrity of other authors is confined within very narrow limits the geometrician and divine the antiquary and critic however distinguished by uncontested excellence can only hope to please those whom a conformity of disposition has engaged in similar pursuits and must be content to be regarded by the rest of the world with the smile of frigid indifference or the contemptuous sneer of selfsufficient folly the collector of shells and the anatomist of insects is little inclined to enter into theological disputes the divine is not apt to regard with veneration the uncouth diagrams and tedious calculations of the astronomer the man whose life has been consumed in adjusting the disputes of lexicographers or elucidating the learning of antiquity cannot easily bend his thoughts to recent transactions or readily interest himself in the unimportant history of his contemporaries and the cit who knows no business but acquiring wealth and no pleasure but displaying it has a heart equally shut up to argument and fancy to the batteries of syllogism and the arrows of wit to the writer of fiction alone every ear is open and every tongue lavish of applause curiosity sparkles in every eye and every bosom is throbbing with concern  it is however easy to account for this enchantment to follow the chain of perplexed ratiocination to view with critical skill the airy architecture of systems to unravel the web of sophistry or weigh the merits of opposite hypotheses requires perspicacity and presupposes learning works of this kind therefore are not so well adapted to the generality of readers as familiar and colloquial composition for few can reason but all can feel and many who cannot enter into an argument may yet listen to a tale the writer of romance has even an advantage over those who endeavor to amuse by the plea of fancy who from the fortuitous collision of dissimilar ideas produce the scintillations of wit or by the vivid glow of poetical imagery delight the imagination with colors of ideal radiance the attraction of the magnet is only exerted upon similar particles and to taste the beauties of homer it is requisite to partake his fire but every one can relish the author who represents common life because every one can refer to the originals from whence his ideas were taken he relates events to which all are liable and applies to passions which all have felt the gloom of solitude the languor of inaction the corrosions of disappointment and the toil of thought induce men to step aside from the rugged road of life and wander in the fairy land of fiction where every bank is sprinkled with flowers and every gale loaded with perfume where every event introduces a hero and every cottage is inhabited by a grace invited by these flattering scenes the student quits the investigation of truth in which he perhaps meets with no less fallacy to exhilerate his mind with new ideas more agreeable and more easily attained the busy relax their attention by desultory reading and smooth the agitation of a ruffled mind with images of peace tranquillity and pleasure the idle and the gay relieve the listlessness of leisure and diversify the round of life by a rapid series of events pregnant with rapture and astonishment and the pensive solitary fills up the vacuities of his heart by interesting himself in the fortunes of imaginary beings and forming connections with ideal excellence  it is indeed no ways extraordinary that the mind should be charmed by fancy and attracted by pleasure but that we should listen to the groans of misery and delight to view the exacerbations of complicated anguish that we should choose to chill the bosom with imaginary fears and dim the eyes with fictitious sorrow seems a kind of paradox of the heart and only to be credited because it is universally felt various are the hypotheses which have been formed to account for the disposition of the mind to riot in this species of intellectual luxury some have imagined that we are induced to acquiesce with greater patience in our own lot by beholding pictures of life tinged with deeper horrors and loaded with more excruciating calamities as to a person suddenly emerging out of a dark room the saintest glimmering of twilight assumes a luster from the contrasted gloom others with yet deeper refinement suppose that we take upon ourselves this burden of adscititious sorrows in order to feast upon the consciousness of our own virtue we commiserate others say they that we may applaud ourselves and the sigh of compassionate sympathy is always followed by the gratulations of selfcomplacent esteem but surely they who would thus reduce the sympathetic emotions of pity to a system of refined selfishness have but ill attended to the genuine feelings of humanity it would however exceed the limits of this paper should i attempt an accurate investigation of these sentiments but let it be remembered that we are more attracted by those scenes which interest our passions or gratify our curiosity than those which delight our fancy and so far from being indifferent to the miseries of others we are at the time totally regardless of our own and let not those on whom the hand of time has impressed the characters of oracular wisdom censure with too much acrimony productions which are thus calculated to please the imagination and interest the heart they teach us to think by inuring us to feel they ventilate the mind by sudden gusts of passion and prevent the stagnation of thought by a fresh infusion of dissimilar ideas  selama an imitation of ossian what soft voice of sorrow is in the breeze  what lovely sunbeam of beauty trembling on the rock its bright hair is bathed in showers and it looks faint and dim through its mist on the rushy plain why art thou alone  maid of the mournful look

pine of the desert they had rolled on selama and he asked the daughter of connal tonthormo breaker of shields thou art a meteor of death in war whose fiery hair streams on the clouds and the nations

blood and the dusky clouds sail low and heavy athwart its path thoughts like the troubled ocean rushed over his soul  and he struck with his spear the sounding pine starting he mixed in battle with

bites the ground in rage his blood is poured  a dark red stream  into oithonas trembling waves joy brightened in the soul of reuthamir when a young warrior came with his forward spear he moved in the light of beauty but his words were haughty and fierce is tonthormo fallen in blood  the friend of my early years die  thou darksould chief for never shall selama be thine  the maid of his love lovely

arm said the rising pride of youth thou shall vanish like a cloud of mist before the sun when he looks abroad in the power of his brightness  but thou thyself did fall before reuthamir in all thy boasting words as a tall ash of the mountain  when the tempest takes its green head and lays it level on the plain  come from thy secret cave selama thy foes are silent and dark thou dove that hidest in the clefts of the rocks the storm is over and past come from thy rock selama and give thy white hand to the chief  who never fled from the face of glory in all its terrible brightness  she gave her hand  but it was trembling and cold  for the spear was deep in her side red beneath her mail the current of crimson wandered down her white breast  as the track of blood on cromlas mountains of snow when the wounded deer slowly crosses the heath and the hunters cries are in the breeze blessed be the spear of reuthamir said the faint voice of the lovely  i feel it cold in my heart lay me by the son of semo why should i know another love raise the tomb of the aged  his thin form shall rejoice as he sails on a lowhung cloud and guides the wintry storm open your airy halls spirits of my love  and have i quenched the light which was pleasant to my soul said the chief of morna my steps moved in darkness  why were the words of strife in thy tale sorrow like a cloud comes over my soul and shades the joy of mighty deeds soft be your rest in the narrow house children of grief the breeze in the long whistling grass shall not awaken you the tempest shall rush over you and the bulrush bow its head upon your tomb  but silence shall dwell in your habitation long repose and the peace of years to come the voice of the bard shall raise your remembrance in the distant land and mingle your tale of woe with the murmur of other streams often shall the harp send forth a mournful found and the tear dwell in the soft eyes of the daughters of morna  such were the words of reuthamir while he raised the tombs of the fallen sad were his steps toward the towers of his fathers as  musing  he crossed the dark heath of lena and struck  at times  the thistles beard  against inconsistency in our expectations what is more reasonable than that they who take pains for any thing should get most in that particular for which they take pains they have taken pains for power you for right principles they for riches you for a proper use of the appearances of things see whether they have the advantage of you in that for which you have taken pains and which they neglect if they are in power and you not why will not you speak the truth to yourself that you do nothing for the sake of power but that they do every thing no but since i take care to have right principles it is more reasonable that i should have power yes in respect to what you take care about your principles but give up to others the things in which they have taken more care than you else it is just as if because you have right principles you should think it fit that when you shoot an arrow you should hit the mark better than an archer or that you should forge better than a smith carters epictetus as most of the unhappiness in the world arises rather from disappointed desires than from positive evil it is of the utmost consequence to attain just notions of the laws and order of the universe that we may not vex ourselves with fruitless wishes or give way to groundless and unreasonable discontent the laws of natural philosophy indeed are tolerably understood and attended to and though we may suffer inconveniences we are seldom disappointed in consequence of them no man expects to preserve oranges through an english winter or when he has planted an acorn to see it become a large oak in a few months the mind of man naturally yields to necessity and our wishes soon subside when we see the impossibility of their being gratified now upon an accurate inspection we shall find in the moral government of the world and the order of the intellectual system laws as determinate fixed and invariable as any in newtons principia the progress of vegetation is not more certain than the growth of habit nor is the power of attraction more clearly proved than the force of affection or the influence of example the man therefore who has well studied the operations of nature in mind as well as matter will acquire a certain moderation and equity in his claims upon providence he never will be disappointed either in himself or others he will act with precision and expect that effect and that alone from his efforts which they are naturally adapted to produce for want of this men of merit and integrity often censure the dispositions of providence for suffering characters they despise to run away with advantages which they yet know are purchased by such means as a high and noble spirit could never submit to if you refuse to pay the price why expect the purchase we should consider this world as a great mart of commerce where fortune exposes to our view various commodities riches ease tranquillity fame integrity knowledge every thing is marked at a settled price our time our labor our ingenuity is so much ready money which we are to lay out to the best advantage examine compare choose reject but stand to your own judgment and do not like children when you have purchased one thing repine that you do not possess another which you did not purchase such is the force of wellregulated industry that a steady and vigorous exertion of our faculties directed to one end will generally insure success would you for instance be rich do you think that single point worth the sacrificing every thing else to you may then be rich thousands have become so from the lowest beginnings by toil and patient diligence and attention to the minutest articles of expense and profit but you must give up the pleasures of leisure of a vacant mind of a free unsuspicious temper if you preserve your integrity it must be a coarsespun and vulgar honesty those high and lofty notions of morals which you brought with you from the schools must be considerably lowered and mixed with the baser alloy of a jealous and wordlyminded prudence you must learn to do hard if not unjust things and for the nice embarrassments of a delicate and ingenuous spirit it is necessary for you to get rid of them as fast as possible you must shut your heart against the muses and be content to feed your understanding with plain household truths in short you must not attempt to enlarge your ideas or polish your taste or refine your sentiments but must keep on in one beaten track without turning aside either to the right hand or to the left but i cannot submit to drudgery like this  i feel a spirit above it it is well be above it then only do not repine that you are not rich  is knowledge the pearl of price that too may be purchased  by steady application and long solitary hours of study and reflection bestow these and you shall be wise but says the man of letters what a hardship is it that many an illiterate fellow who cannot construe the motto of the arms on his coach shall raise a fortune and make a figure while i have little more than the common conveniences of life et tibi magna satis  was it in order to raise a fortune that you consumed the sprightly hours of youth in study and retirement was it to be rich that you grew pale over the midnight lamp and distilled the sweetness from the greek and roman spring you have then mistaken your path and ill employed your industry what reward have i then for all my labors what reward a large comprehensive soul well purged from vulgar fears and perturbations and prejudices able to comprehend and interpret the works of man  of god a rich flourishing cultivated mind pregnant with inexhaustible stores of entertainment and reflection a perpetual spring of fresh ideas and the conscious dignity of superior intelligence good heaven and what reward can you ask besides  but is it not some reproach upon the economy of providence that such a one who is a mean dirty fellow should have amassed wealth enough to buy half a nation not in the least he made himself a mean dirty fellow for that very end he has paid his health his conscience his liberty for it and will you envy him his bargain will you hang your head and blush in his presence because he outshines you in equipage and show lift up your brow with a noble confidence and say to yourself i have not these things it is true but it is because i have not sought because i have not desired them it is because i possess something better i have chosen my lot i am content and satisfied  you are a modest man  you love quiet and independence and have a delicacy and reserve in your temper which renders it impossible for you to elbow your way in the world and be the herald of your own merits be content then with a modest retirement with the esteem of your intimate friends with the praises of a blameless heart and a delicate ingenuous spirit but resign the splendid distinctions of the world to those who can better scramble for them  the man whose tender sensibility of conscience and strict regard to the rules of morality makes him scrupulous and fearful of offending is often heard to complain of the disadvantages he lies under in every path of honor and profit could i but get over some nice points and conform to the practice and opinion of those about me i might stand as fair a chance as others for dignities and preferment and why can you not what hinders you from discarding this troublesome scrupulosity of yours which stands so grievously in your way if it be a small thing to enjoy a healthful mind sound at the very core that does not shrink from the keenest inspection inward freedom from remorse and perturbation unfullied whiteness and simplicity of manners a genuine integrity pure in the last recesses of the mind if you think these advantages an inadequate recompense for what you resign dismiss your scruples this instant and be a slavemerchant a director or  what you please if these be motives weak break off betimes and as you have not spirit to assert the dignity of virtue be wise enough not to forego the emoluments of vice  i much admire the spirit of the ancient philosophers in that they never attempted as our moralists often do to lower the tone of philosophy and make it consistent with all the indulgences of indolence and sensuality they never thought of having the bulk of mankind for their disciples but kept themselves as distinct as possible from a worldly life they plainly told men what sacrifices were required and what advantages they were which might be expected si virtus hoc una potest dare fortis omissis hoc age deliciis  if you would be a philosopher these are the terms you must do thus and thus there is no other way if not go and be one of the vulgar  there is no one quality gives so much dignity to a character as consistency of conduct even if a mans pursuits be wrong and unjustifiable yet if they are prosecuted with steadiness and vigor we cannot withold our admiration the most characteristic mark of a great mind is to choose some one important object and pursue it through life it was this made caesar a great man his object was ambition he pursued it steadily and was always ready to sacrifice to it every interfering passion or inclination  there is a pretty passage in one of lucians dialogues where jupiter complains to cupid that though he has had so many intrigues he was never sincerely beloved in order to be loved says cupid you must lay aside your aegis and your thunderbolts and you must curl and perfume your hair and place a garland on your head and walk with a soft step and assume a winning obsequious deportment but replied jupiter i am not willing to resign so much of my dignity then returns cupid leave off desiring to be loved  he wanted to be jupiter and adonis at the same time  it must be confessed that men of genius are of all others most inclined to make these unreasonable claims as their relish for enjoyment is strong their views large and comprehensive and they feel themselves lifted above the common bulk of mankind they are apt to slight that natural reward of praise and admiration which is ever largely paid to distinguished abilities and to expect to be called forth to public notice and favor without considering that their talents are commonly very unfit for active life that their excentricity and turn for speculation disqualifies them for the business of the world which is best carried on by men of moderate genius and that society is not obliged to reward any one who is not useful to it the poets have been a very unreasonable race and have often complained loudly of the neglect of genius and the ingratitude of the age the tender and pensive cowley and the elegant shenstone had their minds tinctured by this discontent and even the sublime melancholy of young was too much owing to the stings of disappointed ambition  the moderation we have been endeavoring to inculcate will likewise prevent much mortification and disgust in our commerce with mankind as we ought not to wish in ourselves so neither should we expect in our friends contrary qualifications young and sanguine when we enter the world and feel our affections drawn forth by any particular excellence in a character we immediately give it credit for all others and are beyond measure disgusted when we come to discover as we soon must discover the defects in the other side of the balance but nature is much more frugal than to heap together all manner of shining qualities in one glaring mass like a judicious painter she endeavors to preserve a certain unity of style and coloring in her pieces models of absolute perfection are only to be met with in romance where exquisite beauty and brilliant wit and profound judgment and immaculate virtue are all blended together to adorn some favorite character as an anatomist knows that the racer cannot have the strength and muscles of the draughthorse and that winged men gryffons and mermaids must be mere creatures of the imagination so the philosopher is sensible that there are combinations of moral qualities which never can take place but in idea there is a different air and complexion in characters as well as in faces though perhaps each equally beautiful and the excellencies of one cannot be transferred to the other thus if one man possesses a stoical apathy of soul acts independent of the opinion of the world and fulfils every duty with mathematical exactness you must not expect that man to be greatly influenced by the weakness of pity or the partialities of friendship you must not be offended that he does not fly to meet you after a short absence or require from him the convivial spirit and honest effusions of a warm open susceptible heart if another is remarkable for a lively active zeal inflexible integrity a strong indignation against vice and freedom in reproving it he will probably have some little bluntness in his address not altogether suitable to polished life he will want the winning arts of conversation he will disgust by a kind of haughtiness and negligence in his manner and often hurt the delicacy of his acquaintance with harsh and disagreeable truths  we usually say  that man is a genius but he has some whims and oddities  such a one has a very general knowledge but he is superficial etc now in all such cases we should speak more rationally did we substitute therefore for but he is a genius therefore he is whimsical and the like  it is the fault of the present age owing to the freer commerce that different ranks and professions now enjoy with each other that characters are not marked with sufficient strength the several classes run too much into one another we have fewer pedants it is true but we have fewer striking originals every one is expected to have such a tincture of general knowledge as is incompatible with going deep into any science and such a conformity to fashionable manners as checks the free workings of the ruling passion and gives an insipid sameness to the face of society under the idea of polish and regularity  there is a cast of manners peculiar and becoming to each age sex and profession one therefore should not throw out illiberal and commonplace censures against another each is perfect in their kind a woman as a woman a tradesman as a tradesman we are often hurt by the brutality and sluggish conceptions of the vulgar not considering that some there must be to be hewers of wood and drawers of water and that cultivated genius or even any great refinement and delicacy in their moral feelings would be a real misfortune to them  let us then study the philosophy of the human mind the man who is master of this science will know what to expect from every one from this man wise advice from that cordial sympathy from another casual entertainment the passions and inclinations of others are his tools which he can use with as much precision as he would the mechanical powers and he can as readily make allowance for the workings of vanity or the biass of selfinterest in his friends as for the power of friction or the irregularities of the needle  the canal and the brook a reverie a delightfully pleasant evening succeeding a sultry summerday invited me to take a solitary walk and leaving the dust of the highway i fell into a path which led along a pleasant little valley watered by a small meandring brook the meadowground on its banks had been lately mown and the new grass was springing up with a lively verdure the brook was hid in several places by shrubs that grew on each side and intermingled their branches the sides of the valley were roughened by small irregular thickets and the whole scene had an air of solitude and retirement uncommon in the neighborhood of a populous town the duke of bridgewaters canal crossed the valley high raised on a mound of earth which preserved a level with the elevated ground on each side an arched road was carried under it beneath which the brook that ran along the valley was conveyed by a subterraneous passage i threw myself upon a green bank shaded by a leafy thicket and resting my head upon my hand after a welcome indolence had overcome my senses i saw with the eyes of fancy the following scene  the firmbuilt side of the aqueduct suddenly opened and a gigantic form issued forth which i soon discovered to be the genius of the canal he was clad in a close garment of a russet hue a mural crown indented with battlements surrounded his brow his naked feet were discolored with clay on his left shoulder he bore a huge pickax and in his right hand he held certain instruments used in surveying and levelling his looks were thoughtful and his features harsh the breach through which he proceeded instantly closed and with a heavy tread he advanced into the valley as he approached the brook the deity of the stream arose to meet him he was habited in a light green mantle and the clear drops fell from his dark hair which was encircled with a wreath of waterlily interwoven with sweet scented flag an angling rod supported his steps the genius of the canal eyed him with a contemptuous look and in a hoarse voice thus began  hence ignoble rill with thy scanty tribute to thy lord the mersey nor thus waste thy almost exhausted urn in lingering windings along the vale feeble as thine aid is it will not be unacceptable to that master stream himself for as i lately crossed his channel i perceived his sands loaded with stranded vessels i saw and pitied him for undertaking a task to which he is unequal but thou whose languid current is obscured by weeds and interrupted by misshapen pebbles who losest thyself in endless mazes remote from any sound but thy own idle gurgling how can thou support an existence so contemptible and useless for me the noblest child of art who hold my unremitting course from hill to hill over vales and rivers who pierce the solid rock for my passage and connect unknown lands with distant seas wherever i appear i am viewed with astonishment and exulting commerce hails my waves behold my channel thronged with capacious vessels for the conveyance of merchandise and splendid barges for the use and pleasure of travelers my banks crowned with airy bridges and huge warehouses and echoing with the busy sounds of industry pay then the homage due from sloth and obscurity to grandour and utility  i readily acknowledge replied the deity of the brook in a modest accent the superior magnificence and more extensive utility of which you so proudly boast yet in my humble walk i am not void of a praise less shining but not less solid than yours the nymph of this peaceful valley rendered more fertile and beautiful by my stream the neighboring sylvan deities to whose pleasure i contribute will pay a grateful testimony to my merit the windings of my course which you so much blame serve to diffuse over a greater extent of ground the refreshment of my waters and the lovers of nature and the muses who are sond of straying on my banks are better pleased that the line of beauty marks my way than if like yours it were directed in a straight unvaried line they prize the irregular wildness with which i am decked as the charms of beauteous simplicity what you call the weeds which darken and obscure my waves afford to the botanist a pleasing speculation of the works of nature and the poet and painter think the luster of my stream greatly improved by glittering through them the pebbles which diversify my bottom and make these ripplings in my current are pleasing objects to the eye of taste and my simple murmurs are more melodious to the learned ear than all the rude noises of your banks or even the music that resounds from your slately barges if the unfeeling sons of wealth and commerce judge of me by the mere standard of usefulness i may claim no undistinguished rank while your waters confined in deep channels or lifted above the valleys roll on a useless burden to the fields and only subservient to the drudgery of bearing temporary merchandises my stream will bestow unvarying fertility on the meadows during the summers of future ages yet i scorn to submit my honors to the decision of those whose hearts are shut up to taste and sentiment let me appeal to nobler judges the philosopher and poet by whose labors the human mind is elevated and refined and opened to pleasures beyond the conception of vulgar souls will acknowledge that the elegant deities who preside over simple and natural beauty have inspired them with their charming and instructive ideas the sweetest and most majestic bard that ever sung has taken a pride in owning his affection to woods and streams and while the stupendous monuments of roman grandeur the columns which pierced the skies and the aqueducts which poured their waves over mountains and valleys are sunk in oblivion the gently winding mincius still retains his tranquil honors and when thy glories proud genius are lost and forgotten when the flood of commerce which now supplies thy urn is turned into another course and has left thy channel dry and desolate the softly flowing avon shall still murmur in song and his banks receive the homage of all who are beloved by phoebus and the muses  on monastic institutions i happened the other day to take a solitary walk amongst the venerable ruins of an old abbey the stillness and solemnity of the place were favorable to thought and naturally led me to a train of ideas relative to the scene when like a good protestant i began to indulge a secret triumph in the ruin of so many structures which i had always considered as the haunts of ignorance and superstition  ye are fallen said i ye dark and gloomy mansions of mistaken zeal where the proud priest and lazy monk fattend upon the riches of the land and crept like vermin from their cells to spread their poisonous doctrines through the nation and disturb the peace of kings obscure in their origin but daring and ambitious in their guilt see how the pure light of heaven is clouded by the dim glass of the arched window stained with the gaudy colors of monkish tales and legendary fiction fit emblem how reluctantly they admitted the fairer light of truth amidst these dark recesses and how much they have debased its genuine luster the low cells the long and narrow aisles the gloomy arches the damp and secret caverns which wind beneath the hollow ground far from impressing on the mind the idea of the god of truth and love seem only fit for those dark places of the earth in which are the habitations of cruelty these massy stones and scattered relics of the vast edifice like the large bones and gigantick armor of a once formidable ruffian produce emotions of mingled dread and exultation farewell ye once venerated seats enough of you remains and may it always remain to remind us from what we have escaped and make posterity for ever thankful for this fairer age of liberty and light  such were for a while my meditations but it is cruel to insult a fallen enemy and i gradually fell into a different train of thought i began to consider whether something might not be advanced in favor of these institutions during the barbarous ages in which they flourished and though they have been productive of much mischief and superstition whether they might not have spread the glimmering of a feeble ray of knowledge through that thick night which once involved the western hemisphere  and where indeed could the precious remains of classical learning and the divine monuments of ancient taste have been safely lodged amidst the ravages of that age of ferocity and rapine which succeeded the desolation of the roman empire except in sanctuaries like these consecrated by the superstition of the times beyond their intrinsic merit the frequency of wars and the licentious cruelty with which they were conducted left neither the hamlet of the peasant nor the castle of the baron free from depredation but the church and monastery generally remained inviolate there homer and aristotle were obliged to shroud their heads from the rage of gothic ignorance and there the sacred records of divine truth were preserved like treasure hid in the earth in troublesome times safe but unenjoyed some of the barbarous nations were converted before their conquests and most of them soon after their settlement in the countries they overran those buildings which their new faith taught them to venerate afforded a shelter for those voluable manuscripts which must otherwise have been destroyed in the common wreck at the revival of learning they were produced from their dormitories a copy of the pandect of justinian that valuable remain of roman law which first gave to europe the idea of a more perfect jurisprudence and gave men a relish for a new and important study was discovered in a monastery of amalphi most of the classics were recovered by the same means and to this it is owing to the books and learning preserved in these repositories that we were not obliged to begin anew and trace every art by slow and uncertain steps from its first origin science already full grown and vigorous awaked as from a trance shook her pinions and soon soared to the heights of knowledge  nor was she entirely idle during her recess at least we cannot but confess that what little learning remained in the world was amongst the priests and religious orders books before the invention of paper and the art of printing were so dear that few private persons possessed any the only libraries were in convents and the monks were often employed in transcribing manuscripts which was a very tedious and at that time a very necessary task it was frequently enjoined as a penance for some slight offense or given as an exercise to the younger part of the community the monks were obliged by their rules to spend some stated hours every day in reading and study nor was any one to be chosen abbot without a competent share of learning they were the only historians and though their accounts be interwoven with many a legendary tale and darkened by much superstition still they are better than no histories at all and we cannot but think ourselves obliged to them for transmitting to us in any dress the annals of their country  they were likewise almost the sole instructors of youth toward the end of the tenth century there were no schools in europe but the monasteries and those which belonged to episcopal residences nor any masters but the benedictines it is true their course of education extended no further than what they called the seven liberal arts and these were taught in a very dry and uninteresting manner but this was the genius of the age and it should not be imputed to them as a reproach that they did not teach well when no one taught better we are guilty of great unfairness when we compare the schoolmen with the philosophers of a more enlightened age we should contrast them with those of their own times with a highconstable of france who could not read with kings who made the sign of the cross in confirmation of their charters because they could not write their names with a whole people without the least glimmering of taste or literature whatever was their real knowledge there was a much greater difference between men of learning and the bulk of the nation at that time than there is at present and certainly some of the disciples of those schools who though now fallen into disrepute were revered in their day by the name of the subtle doctor or the angelic doctor showed an acuteness and strength of genius which if properly directed would have gone far in philosophy and they only failed because their enquires were not the objects of the human power had they exercised half that acuteness on facts and experiments they had been truly great men however there were not wanting some even in the darkest ages whose names will be always remembered with pleasure by the lovers of science alcuin the preceptor of charlemagne the first who introduced a taste for polite literature into france and the chief instrument that prince made use of in his noble endeavors for the encouragement of learning to whom the universities of soissons tours and paris owe their origin the historians matthew paris william of malmsbury savanarola the elegant and unfortunate abelard and to crown the rest the english franciscan roger bacon  it may be here observed that forbidding the vulgar tongue in the offices of devotion and in reading the scriptures though undoubtedly a great corruption in the christian church was of infinite service to the interests of learning when the ecclesiastics had locked up their religion in a foreign tongue they would take care not to lose the key this gave an importance to the learned languages and every scholar could not only read but wrote and disputed in latin which without such a motive would probably have been no more studied than the chinese and at a time when the modern languages of europe were yet unformed and barbarous latin was of great use as a kind of universal tongue by which learned men might converse and correspond with each other  indeed the monks were almost the only set of men who had leisure or opportunity to pay the least attention to literary subjects a learned education and a very little went to that title was reckoned peculiar to the religious it was almost esteemed a blemish on the savage and martial character of the gentry to have any tincture of letters a man therefore of a studious and retired turn a verse to quarrels and not desirous of the fierce and sanguinary glory of those times beheld in the cloister a peaceful and honorable sanctuary where without the reproach of cowardice or danger of invasion he might devote himself to learning associate with men of his own turn and have free access to libraries and manuscripts in this enlightened and polished age where learning is diffused through every rank and many a merchants clerk possesses more real knowledge than half the literati of that era we can scarcely conceive how gross an ignorance overspread those times and how totally all useful learning might have been lost amongst us had it not been for an order of men vested with peculiar privileges and protected by even a superstitious degree of reverence  thus the muses with their attendant arts in strange disguise indeed and uncouth trappings took refuge in the peaceful gloom of the convent statuary carved a madona or a crucifix painting illuminated a missal eloquence made the panegyric of a saint and history composed a legend yet still they breathed and were ready at any happier period to emerge from obscurity with all their native charms and undiminished luster  but there were other views in which those who devoted themselves to a monastic life might be supposed useful to society they were often employed either in cultivating their gardens or in curious mechanical works as indeed the nuns are still famous for many elegant and ingenious manufactures by the constant communication they had with those of their own order and with their common head at rome they maintained some intercourse between nations at a time when traveling was dangerous and commerce had not as now made the most distant parts of the globe familiar to each other and they kept up a more intimate bond of union amongst learned men of all countries who would otherwise have been secluded from all knowledge of each other a monk might travel with more convenience than any one else his person was safer and he was sure of meeting with proper accommodations the intercourse with rome must have been peculiarly favorable to these northern nations as italy for a long time led the way in every improvement of politeness or literature and if we imported their superstition we likewise imported their manufactures their knowledge and their taste thus alfred sent for italian monks when he wanted to civilize his people and introduce amongst them some tincture of letters it may likewise be presumed that they tempered the rigor of monarchy indeed they as well as the sovereigns endeavored to enslave the people but subjection was not likely to be so abject and unlimited where the object of it was divided and each showed by turns that the other might be opposed it must have been of service to the cause of liberty to have a set of men whose laws privileges and immunities the most daring kings were afraid to trample on and this before a more enlightened spirit of freedom had arisen might have its effect in preventing the states of christendom from falling into such entire slavery as the asiatics  such an order would in some degree check the excessive regard paid to birth a man of mean origin and obscure parentage saw himself excluded from almost every path of secular preferment and almost treated as a being of an inferior species by the high and haughty spirit of the gentry but he was at liberty to aspire to the highest dignities of the church and there have been many who like sextus v and cardinal wolsey have by their industry and personal merit alone raised themselves to a level with kings  it should likewise be remembered that many of the orders were charitable institutions as the knights of faith and charity in the thirteenth century who were associated for the purpose of suppressing those bands of robbers which infested the public roads in france the brethren of the order of the redemption for redeeming slaves from the mahometans the order of st anthony first established for the relief of the poor under certain disorders and the brethren and sisters of the pious and christian schools for educating poor children these supplied the place of hospitals and other such foundations which are now established on the broader basis of public benevolence to bind up the wounds of the stranger was peculiarly the office of the inhabitants of the convent and they often shared the charities they received the exercise of hospitality is still their characteristic and must have been of particular use formerly when they had not the conveniences and accommodations for traveling which we now enjoy the learned stranger was always sure of an agreeable residence amongst them and as they all understood latin they served him for interpreters and introduced him to a sight of whatever was curious or valuable in the countries which he visited they checked the spirit of savage fierceness to which  warlike ancestors were so prone with the mildness and sanctity of religious influences they preserved some respect to law and order and often decided controversies by means less bloody than the sword though confessedly more superstitious  a proof that these institutions had a favorable aspect toward civilization may be drawn from a late history of ireland soon after the introduction of christianity into that kingdom says dr leland the monks fixed their habitations in deserts which they cultivated with their own hands and rendered the most delightful spots in the kingdom these deserts became well policed cities and it is remarkable enough that to the monks we owe so useful an institution in ireland as the bringing great numbers together into one civil community in these cities the monks set up schools and taught not only the youth of ireland but the neighboring nations furnishing them also with books they became umpires between contending chiefs and when they could not confine them within the bounds of reason and religion at least terrified them by denouncing divine vengeance against their excesses  let it be considered too that when the minds of men began to open some of the most eminent reformers sprung from the bosom of the church and even of the convent it was not the laity who began to think the ecclesiastics were the first to perceive the errors they had introduced the church was reformed from within not from without and like the silkworm when ripened in their cells to maturer vigor and perfection they pierced the cloud themselves had spun and within which they had so long been enveloped  and let not the good protestant be too much startled if i here venture to insinuate that the monasteries were schools of some high and respectable virtues poverty chastity and a renunciation of the world were certainly intended in the first plan of these institutions and though from the unavoidable frailty of human nature they were not always observed certain it is that many individuals amongst them have been striking examples of the selfdenying virtues and as the influence they acquired was only built upon the voluntary homage of the mind it may be presumed such an ascendancy was not originally gained without some species of merit the fondness for monkery is easily deduced from some of the best principles in the human heart it was indeed necessity that in the third century first drove the christians to shelter themselves from the decian persecution in the solitary deserts of thebais but the humor soon spread and numbers under the name of hermits or eremites secluded themselves from the commerce of mankind choosing the wildest solitudes living in caves and hollows of the rocks and subsisting on such roots and herbs as the ground afforded them about the fourth century they were gathered into communities and increased with surprising rapidity it was then that by a great and sudden revolution the fury of persecution had ceased and the governing powers were become friendly to christianity but the agitation of mens minds did not immediately subside with the storm the christians had so long experienced the necessity of resigning all the enjoyments of life and were so detached from every tie which might interfere with the profession of their faith that upon a more favorable turn of affairs they hardly dared open their minds to pleasurable emotions they thought the life of a good man must be a continual warfare between mind and body and having been long used to see ease and safety on the one side and virtue on the other no wonder if the association was so strong in their minds as to suggest the necessity of voluntary mortification and lead them to inflict those sufferings upon themselves which they no longer apprehended from others they had continually experienced the amazing effects of christianity in supporting its followers under hardship tortures and death and they thought little of its influence in regulating the behavior of life if it produced none of those great exertions they had been used to contemplate they were struck with the change from heathen licentiousness to the purity of the gospel and thought they could never be far enough removed from that bondage of the senses which it had just cost them so violent a struggle to escape the minds of men were working with newly received opinions not yet mellowed into a rational faith and the young converts astonished at the grandeur and sublimity of the doctrines which then first entered their hearts with irresistible force thought them worthy to engross their whole attention the mystic dreams of the platonist mingled with the enthusiasin of the martyr and it soon became the prevailing opinion that silence solitude and contemplation were necessary for the reception of divine truth mistaken ideas prevailed of a purity and perfection far superior to the rules of common life which was only to be attained by those who denied themselves all the indulgences of sense and thus the ascetic severities of the cloister succeeded in some degree to the philosophic poverty of the cynic school and the lofty virtues of the stoic porch  indeed it is now the prevailing taste in morals to decry every observance which has the least appearance of rigor and to insist only on the softer virtues but let it be remembered that selfcommand and selfdenial are as necessary to the practice of benevolence charity and compassion as to any other duty that it is impossible to live to others without denying ourselves and that the man who has not learned to curb his appetites and passions is ill qualified for those sacrifices which the friendly affections are continually requiring of him the man who has that one quality of selfcommand will find little difficulty in the practice of any other duty as on the contrary he who has it not though possessed of the gentlest feelings and most refined sensibilities will soon find his benevolence sink into a mere companionable easiness of temper neither useful to others nor happy for himself a noble enthusiasm is sometimes of use to show how far human nature can go though it may not be proper or desirable that numbers should seclude themselves from the common duties and ordinary avocations of life for the austerer lessons of the cloister yet it is not unuseful that some should push their virtues to even a romantic height and it is encouraging to reflect in the hour of temptation that the love of ease the aversion to pain every appetite and passion and even the strongest propensities in our nature have been controuled that the empire of the mind over the body has been asserted in its fullest extent and that there have been men in all ages who voluntarily renounce all the world offers voluntarily suffer all it dreads and live independent and unconnected with it nor was it a small advantage or ill calculated to support the dignity of science that a learned man might be respectable in a coarse gown a leathern girdle and barefooted cardinal ximenes preserved the severe simplicity of a convent amidst the pomp and luxury of palaces and to those who thus thought it becoming in the highest stations to affect the appearance of poverty the reality surely could not be very dreadful  there is yet another light in which these institutions may be considered it is surely not improper to provide a retreat for those who stained by some deep and enormous crime wish to expiate by severe and uncommon penitence those offenses which render them unworthy of freer commerce with the world repentance is never so secure from a relapse as when it breaks off at once from every former connection and entering upon a new course of life bids adieu to every object that might revive the idea of temptations which have once prevailed in these solemn retreats the stillness and acknowledged sanctity of the place with the striking novelty of every thing around them might have great influence in calming the passions might break the force of habit and suddenly induce a new turn of thinking there are likewise afflictions so overwhelming to humanity that they leave no relish in the mind for any thing else than to enjoy its own melancholy in silence and solitude and to a heart torn with remorse or oppressed with sorrow the gloomy severities of la trappe are really a relief retirement is also the favorite wish of age many a statesman and many a warrior sick of the bustle of that world to which they had devoted the prime of their days have longed for some quiet cell where like cardinal wolsey or charles v they might shroud their gray hairs and lose sight of the follies with which they had been too much tainted  though there is perhaps less to plead for immuring beauty in a cloister and confining that part of the species who are formed to shine in families and sweeten society to the barren duties and austere discipline of a monastic life yet circumstances might occur in which they would even to a woman be a welcome refuge a young female whom accident or war had deprived of her natural protectors must in an age of barbarism be peculiarly exposed and helpless a convent offered her an asylum where she might be safe at least if not happy and add to the consciousness of unviolated virtue the flattering dreams of angelic purity and perfection there were orders as well amongst the women as the men instituted for charitable purposes such as that of the virgins of love or daughters of mercy founded in    0 for the relief of the sick poor with others for instructing their children these must have been peculiarly suited to the softness and compassion of the sex and to this it is no doubt owing that still in catholic countries ladies of the highest rank often visit the hospitals and houses of the poor waiting on them with the most tender assiduity and performing such offices as our protestant ladies would be shocked at the thoughts of we should also consider that most of the females who now take the veil are such as have no agreeable prospects in life why should not these be allowed to quit a world which will never miss them it is easier to retire from the public than to support its disregard the convent is to them a shelter from poverty and neglect their little community grows dear to them the equality which subsists among these sisters of obscurity the similarity of their fate the peace the leisure they enjoy give rise to the most endearing friendships their innocence is shielded by the simplicity of their life from even the idea of ill and they are flattered by the notion of a voluntary renunciation of pleasures which probably had they continued in the world they would have had little share in  after all that can be said we have reason enough to rejoice that the superstitions of former times are now fallen into disrepute what might be a palliative at one time soon became a crying evil in itself when the fuller day of science began to dawn the monkish orders were willing to exclude its brightness that the dim lamp might still glimmer in their cell their growing vices have rendered them justly odious to society and they seem in a fair way of being for ever abolished but may we not still hope that the world was better than it would have have been without them and that he who knows to bring good out of evil has made them in their day subservient to some useful purposes the corruptions of christianity which have been accumulating for so many ages seem to be now gradually clearing away and some future period may perhaps exhibit our religion in all its native simplicity so the pure limpid stream when foul with stains of rushing torrents and descending rains works itself clear and as it runs refines till by degrees the floating mirror shines reflects each flower that on its borders grows and a new heaven in its fair bosom shows   on the pleasure derived from objects of terror with sir bertrand a fragment that the exercise of our benevolent feelings as called forth by the view of human afflictions should be a source of pleasure cannot appear wonderful to one who considers that relation between the moral and natural system of man which has connected a degree of satisfaction with every action or emotion productive of the general welfare the painful sensation immediately arising from a scene of misery is so much softened and alleviated by the reflex sense of selfapprobation attending virtuous sympathy that we find on the whole a very exquisite and refined pleasure remaining which makes us desirous of again being witnesses to such scenes instead of flying from them with disgust and horror it is obvious how greatly such a provision must conduce to the ends of mutual support and assistance but the apparent delight with which we dwell upon objects of pure terror where our moral feelings are not in the least concerned and no passion seems to be excited but the depressing one of fear is a paradox of the heart much more difficult of solution  the reality of this source of pleasure seems evident from daily observation the greediness with which the tales of ghosts and goblins of murders earthquakes fires shipwrecks and all the most terrible disasters attending human life are devoured by every ear must have been generally remarked tragedy the most favorite work of fiction has taken a full share of those scenes it has supt full with horrors  and has perhaps been more indebted to them for public admiration than to its tender and pathetic parts the ghost of hamlet macbeth descending into the witches cave and the tent scene in richard command as sorcibly the attention of our souls as the parting jaffeir and belvidera the fall of wolsey or the death of shore the inspiration of terror was by the ancient critics assigned as the peculiar province of tragedy and the greek and roman tragedians have introduced some extraordinary personages for this purpose not only the shades of the dead but the suries and other fabulous inhabitants of the infernal regions collins in his most poetical ode to fear has finely enforced this idea though gentle pity claim her mingled part yet all the thunders of the scene are thine   the old gothic romance and the eastern tale with their genii giants enchantments and transformations however a refined critic may censure them as absurd and extravagant will ever retain a most powerful influence on the mind and interest the reader independently of all peculiarity of taste thus the great milton who had a strong biass to these wildnesses of the imagination has with striking effect made the stories of forests and enchantments drear a favorite subject with his penseroso and had undoubtedly their awakening images strong upon his mind when he breaks out call up him that left halftold the story of cambuscan bold etc   how are we then to account for the pleasure derived from such objects i have often been led to imagine that there is a deception in these cases and that the avidity with which we attend is not a proof of our receiving real pleasure the pain of suspense and the irresistible desire of satisfying curiosity when once raised will account for our eagerness to go quite through an adventure though we suffer actual pain during the whole course of it we rather choose to suffer the smart pang of a violent emotion than the uneasy craving of an unsatisfied desire that this principle in many instances may involuntarily carry us through what we dislike i am convinced from experience this is the impulse which renders the poorest and most insipid narrative interesting when once we get fairly into it and i have frequently felt it with regard to our modern novels which if lying on my table and taken up in an idle hour have led me through the most tedious and disgusting pages while like pistol eating his leek i have swallowed and execrated to the end and it will not only force us through dullness but through actual torture  through the relation of a damiens execution or an inquisitors act of faith when children therefore listen with pale and mute attention to the frightful stories of apparitions we are not perhaps to imagine that they are in a state of enjoyment any more than the poor bird which is dropping into the mouth of the rattlesnake  they are chained by the ears and fascinated by curiosity this solution however does not satisfy me with respect to the wellwrought scenes of artificial terror which are formed by a sublime and vigorous imagination here though we know beforehand what to expect we enter into them with eagerness in quest of a pleasure already experienced this is the pleasure constantly attached to the excitement of surprise from new and wonderful objects a strange and unexpected event awakens the mind and keeps it on the stretch and where the agency of invisible being is introduced of forms unseen and mightier far than we our imagination darting forth explores with rapture the new world which is laid open to its view and rejoices in the expansion of its powers passion and fancy cooperating elevate the soul to its highest pitch and the pain of terror is lost in amazement  hence the more wild fanciful and extraordinary are the circumstances of a scene of horror the more pleasure we receive from it and where they are too near common nature though violently borne by curiosity through the adventure we cannot repeat it or reflect on it without an overbalance of pain in the arabian nights are many most striking examples of the terrible joined with the mavelous the story of aladdin and the travels of sinbad are particularly excellent the castle of otranto is a very spirited modern attempt upon the same plan of mixed terror adapted to the model of gothic romance the best conceived and most strongly workedup scene of mere natural horror that i recollect is in smollets ferdinand count fathom where the hero entertained in a lone house in a forest finds a corpse just slaughtered in the room where he is sent to sleep and the door of which is locked upon him it may be amusing for the reader to compare his feelings upon these and from thence form his opinion of the justness of my theory the following fragment in which both these manners are attempted to be in some degree united is offered to entertain a solitary winters evening   after this adventure sir bertrand turned his steed toward the woulds hoping to cross these dreary moors before the curfew but ere he had proceeded half his journey he was bewildered by the different tracks and not being able as far as the eye could reach to espy any object but the brown heath surrounding him he was at length quite uncertain which way he should direct his course night overtook him in this situation it was one of those nights when the moon gives a faint glimmering of light through the thick black clouds of a lowering sky now and then she suddenly emerged in full splendour from her veil and then instantly retired behind it having just served to give the forlorn sir bertrand a wide extended prospect over the desolate waste hope and native courage a while urged him to push forwards but at length the increasing darkness and fatigue of body and mind overcame him he dreaded moving from the ground the stood on for fear of unknown pits and bogs and alighting from his horse in despair he threw himself on the ground he had not long continued in that posture when the sullen toll of a distant bell struck his ears  he started up and turning toward the sound discerned a dim twinkling light instantly he seized his horses bridle and with cautious steps advanced toward it after a painful march he was stopped by a moated ditch surrounding the place from whence the light proceeded and by a momentary glimpse of moonlight he had a full view of a large antique mansion with turrets at the corners and an ample porch in the center the injuries of time were strongly marked on every thing about it the roof in various places was fallen in the battlements were half demolished and the windows broken and dismantled a drawbridge with a ruinous gateway at each end led to the court before the building  he entered and instantly the light which proceeded from a window in one of the turrets glided along and vanished at the same moment the moon sunk beneath a black cloud and the night was darker than ever all was silent  sir bertrand fastened his steed under a shed and approaching the house traversed its whole front with light and slow footsteps  all was still as death  he looked in at the lower windows but could not distinguish a single object through the impenetrable gloom after a short parley with himself he entered the porch and seizing a massey iron knocker at the gate lifted it up and hesitating at length struck a loud stroke the noise resounded through the whole mansion with hollow echoes all was still again  he repeated the strokes more boldly and louder  another interval of silence ensued  a third time he knocked and a third time all was still he then fell back to some distance that he might discern whether any light could be seen in the whole front  it again appeared in the same place and quickly glided away as before  at the same instant a deep sullen toll sounded from the turret sir bertrands heart made a fearful stop  he was a while motionless then terror impelled him to make some hasty steps toward his steed  but shame stopped his flight and urged by honor and a resistless desire of finishing the adventure he returned to the porch and working up his soul to a full steadiness of resolution he drew forth his sword with one hand and with the other lifted up the latch of the gate the heavy door creaking upon its hinges reluctantly yielded to his hand  he applied his shoulder to it and forced it open  he quitted it and stepped forward  the door instantly shut with a thundering clap sir bertrands blood was chilled  he turned back to find the door and it was long ere his trembling hands could seize it  but his utmost strength could not open it again after several ineffectual attempts he looked behind him and beheld across a hall upon a large staircase a pale bluish flame which cast a dismal gleam of light around he again summoned forth his courage and advanced toward it  it retired he came to the foot of the stairs and after a moments deliberation ascended he went slowly up the flame retiring before him till he came to a wide gallery  the flame proceeded along it and he followed in silent horror treading lightly for the echoes of his footsteps startled him it led him to the foot of another staircase and then vanished  at the same instant another toll sounded from the turret  sir bertrand felt it strike upon his heart he was now in total darkness and with his arms extended began to ascend the second staircase a dead cold hand met his left hand and firmly grasped it drawing him forcibly forwards  he endeavored to disengage himself but could not  he made a furious blow with his sword and instantly a loud shriek pierced his ears and the dead hand was left powerless in his  he dropped it and rushed forwards with a desperate valor the stairs were narrow and winding and interrupted by frequent breaches and loose fragments of stone the staircase grew narrower and narrower and at length terminated in a low iron grate sir bertrand pushed it open  it led to an intricate winding passage just large enough to admit a person upon his hands and knees a faint glimmering of light served to show the nature of the place sir bertrand entered  a deep hollow groan resounded from a distance through the vault  he went forwards and proceeding beyond the first turning he discerned the same blue flame which had before conducted him he followed it the vault at length suddenly opened into a lofty gallery in the midst of which a figure appeared completely armed thrusting forwards the bloody stump of an arm with a terrible frown and menacing gesture and brandishing a sword in his hand sir bertrand undauntedly sprung forwards and aiming a fierce blow at the figure it instantly vanished letting fall a massey iron key the flame now rested upon a pair of ample folding doors at the end of the gallery sir bertrand went up to it and applied the key to a brazen lock  with difficulty he turned the bolt  instantly the doors flew open and discovered a large apartment at the end of which was a coffin rested upon a bier with a taper burning on each side of it along the room on both sides were gigantic statues of black marble attired in the moorish habit and holding enormous sabres in their right hands each of them reared his arm and advanced one leg forwards as the knight entered at the same moment the lid of the coffin flew open and the bell tolled the flame still glided forwards and sir bertrand resolutely followed till he arrived within six paces of the coffin suddenly a lady in a shroud and black veil rose up in it and stretched out her arms toward him  at the same time the statues clashed their sabres and advanced sir bertrand flew to the lady and clasped her in his arms  she threw up her veil and kissed his lips and instantly the whole building shook as with an earthquake and fell asunder with a horrible crash sir bertrand was thrown into a sudden trance and on recovering found himself seated on a velvet sofa in the most magnificent room he had ever seen lighted with innumerable tapers in lustres of pure crystal a sumptuous banquet was set in the middle the doors opening to soft music a lady of incomparable beauty attired with amazing splendour entered surrounded by a troop of gay nymphs more fair than the graces  she advanced to the knight and falling on her knees thanked him as her deliverer the nymphs placed a garland of laurel upon his head and the lady led him by the hand to the banquet and sat beside him the nymphs placed themselves at the table and a numerous train of servants entering served up the feast delicious music playing all the time sir bertrand could not speak for astonishment  he could only return their honors by courteous looks and gestures after the banquet was finished all retired but the lady who leading back the knight to the sofa addressed him in these words     on the heroic poem of gondibert a person engaged in the pursuit of literary fame must be severely mortified on observing the very speedy neglect into which writers of high merit so frequently fall the revolution of centuries the extinction of languages the vast convulsions which agitate a whole people are causes which may well be submitted to in overwhelming an author with oblivion but that in the same country with little variation of language or manners the delights of one age should become utter strangers in the next is surely an immaturity of fate which conveys reproach upon the inconstancy of national taste that noble band the english poets have ample reason for complaining to what unjust guardians they have entrusted their renown while we crown the statue of shakespeare as the prince of dramatic poets shall we forget the works and almost the names of his contemporaries who possessed so much of a kindred spirit shall the italian pastor fido and amyntas stand high in our estimation and the faithful shepherdess the most beautiful pastcral that a poets fancy ever formed be scarcely known amongst us shall we feel the fire of heroic poetry in translations from greece and rome and never search for it in the native productions of our own country  the capital work of sir william davenant which i now desire to call forth from its obscurity may well be considered as in a state of oblivion since we no where meet with allusions to it or quotations from it in our modern writers and few i imagine even of the professed students in english classics would think their taste discredited by confessing that they had never read gondibert a very learned and ingenious critic in his wellknown discourse upon poetical imitation has indeed taken notice of this poem but though he bestows all due praise upon its author yet the purpose for which it is mentioned being to instance an essential error we cannot suppose that his authority has served to gain it more readers having very judiciously laid it down as a general observation that writers by studiously avoiding the fancied disgrace of imitation are apt to fall into improper methods forced conceits and affected expression he proceeds to introduce the work in question after the following manner and that the reader may not suspect me of asserting this without experience let me exemplify what has been here said in the case of a very eminent person who with all the advantages of art and nature that could be required to adorn the true poet was ruined by this single error the person i mean was sir william davenant whose gondibert will remain a perpetual monument of the mischiefs which must ever arise from this affectation of originality in lettered and polite poets  a consideradle degree of deference is undoubtedly due to a critic of such acknowledged taste and abilities yet since it appears to me that in this instance he writes under the influence of system and learned prejudice i shall venture to canvass the principles upon which he supports his censure  the method of gondibert is first objected to by dr hurd and upon two accounts first that the compass of the poem is contracted from the limits of the ancient epic to those of the dramatic form and by this means pursuing a close accelerated plot the opportunity is lost of introducing digressive ornaments and of giving that minuteness of description which confers an air of reality now since the author sets out with disavowing the common rules of epic poetry it is certainly unjust to try him by those rules that effects are not produced which he never designed to produce can be no matter of blame we have only to examine the justness of the design itself it is wrong to expect incompatible qualities as well in compositions as in men a work cannot at the same time possess force and diffusiveness rapidity and minuteness  every one who has read homer without prejudice will i doubt not confess that the effects which should result from the great events of the story are much broken and impeded by that very minuteness of description and frequency of digression which davenant is blamed for rejecting the mind warmed by an interesting narration either in history poetry or romance requires the writer to keep up with its exertions and cannot bear him to flag in his pace or turn aside in pursuit of other objects the proper end of epic poetry according to dr hurd is admiration this i imagine would by no means have been allowed by our author who seems rather to have placed it in interesting the passions inclucating noble sentiments and informing the understanding nor does it answer the idea of horace who praises homer for his moral lessons for teaching  quid sit pulcrum quid turpe quid utile quid non however a due limitation of subject and something of rapidity in pursuing it appear very necessary to the production of a considerable effect of what kind soever and a pompous display of foreign circumstances must always debilitate more than adorn it appears an extremely bad compliment to an epic poem to say that its chief beauty lies in the episodes indeed epic poetry as existing in the models of antiquity or their copies by no means i think deserves the title given by critics of the highest species of poetical composition the tedious compass of the subject the necessity of employing so large a share of the work in the relation of trifling occurrences for the sake of connection and the frequency of interruptions from collateral matter inevitably cause both the poets exertions and the readers attention to intermit and it is no wonder that homer and virgil too sometimes nod over their labors the author of gondibert seems to have been sensible of these inconveniences and upon fair comparison of the epic and dramatic form to have preferred the latter as capable of more spirit and uniform dignity we shall find however in reviewing the poem that he has by no means restricted himself so narrowly as to preclude all ornamental deviations and though they may not deserve the title of episodes yet in his short and unfinished piece they have all the desirable effect of a pleasing variety  the second objection which dr hurd brings against the method of this poem is the rejection of all supernatural agency or what constitutes the machinery of the ancient epic poem but for this the critic himself offers a vindication when he commends the author for not running into the wild sables of the italian romancers which had too slender a foundation in the serious belief of his age to justify a relation to them now by making this belief an essential rule of propriety with respect to the machinery an author in an enlightened period such as that of davenant is in effect prohibited from its use altogether for the abstracted nature of a pure and philosophical religion renders it utterly unfit for the purposes of poetical fiction the works of such christian poets as have attempted to form a system of machinery upon the ideas of saints angels and tutelary spirits will sufficiently prove that their religion even with a mixture of popular superstition was ill calculated to assist their imagination two writers whom one would little expect to meet upon the same ground sir richard blackmore and mons voltaire have given instances of the same faulty plan in this respect and nothing in the good knights epic labors can more deserve the attack of ridicule than the divine mission in the henriade for instructing his majesty in the sublime mysteries of transubstantiation  it was a very just charge which plato brought against homer that he had greatly contributed to debase religion by the unworthy and absurd representations he has given of the celestial beings both with respect to their power and their justice and this is a fault which the poet must always in some measure be guilty of when he too familiarly mixes divine agency with human events nor does it appear more favorable to the greatness of the human personages that they are on all occasions so beholden to the immediate interposition of divine allies the refined and judicious virgil though he has tolerably kept up the dignity of his deities has yet very much lowered his heroes from this cause when we see aeneas the son of a goddess aided by a god and covered with celestial armor with difficulty vanquishing the gallant turnus we conclude that without such odds the victory must have fallen on the other side under such a system of supernatural agency there was no other way of exalting a man than making him like diomed war against the gods or like cato approve a cause which they had unjustly condemned surely a  sober intermixture of religion can never be attributed to the ancient epic the poem of gondibert is indeed without all this mixture of religious machinery whether it be termed sober or extravagant human means are brought to accomplish human ends and cowley in his recommendatory lines prefixed to the work has thus expressed his approbation of this part of the plan methinks heroic poesy till now like some fantastique fairyland did show gods devils nymphs witches and giants race and all but man in mans best work had place thou like some worthy knight with sacred arms do drive the monsters thence and end the charms instead of these do men and manners plant the things which that rich soil did chiefly want   we shall see hereafter that the author has not neglected to introduce religious sentiment and that of a more noble and elevated kind than can easily be parallelled in poetry  but as the poet in the critics opinion did too much in banishing every thing supernatural in the events so he did too little in retaining the fantastic notions of love and honor in the characters of his piece which were derived from the same source of fiction and romance there is however an essential difference between the cases artificial sentiments however unnatural at first may from the operation of particular causes become so familiar as to be adopted into the manners of the age instances of fashion in sentiment are almost as frequent as of fashion in dress it is certain that the romantic ideas of love and honor did in fact prevail in a high degree during a considerable period of the later ages owing to causes which the same ingenious critic has in a very curious manner investigated in his letters on chivalry and romance they give the leading tone to all polished manners and gallantry was as serious a principle in the italian courts as love to their country in the states of greece or old rome supernatural agency in human events on the other hand however commonly pretended or firmly believed would never approach one step nearer to reality after all the author of gondibert could not intend to reduce his poem to mere history but he chose to take a poetical license in the dignity and elevation of its sentiments rather than in the marvellousness of its events he thought he might attribute to the exalted personages of courts and camps the same nobleness of mind which himself a courtier and a soldier possessed if his work be allowed less grand and entertaining from the want of such ornaments as those of his predecessors are decorated with it will yet be difficult to show how at his time they could have been applied consistently with good sense and improved taste  so much in vindication of the general method of sir w davenants poem with respect to its execution the justice of dr hurds censure cannot be controverted that his sentiments are frequently farfetched and affected and his expression quaint and obscure is but too obviously apparent and these faults together with the want of harmony in versification will sufficiently account for the neglect into which the work is fallen though interesting in its story and thicksown with beauties readers who take up a book merely for the indolent amusement of a leisure hour cannot endure the labor of unharbouring a fine thought from the cover of perplexed expression the pleasure arising from a flowing line or a rounded period is more engaging to them because more easily enjoyed than that from a sublime or witty conception the authors faulty execution however arose from a source directly contrary to the dread of imitation imitation itself led him to it for almost all the models of polite literature existing in his own country and indeed in the other polished nations of europe were characterized by the very same vitiation of taste among our own writers it is sufficient to instance done suckling and cowley for this constant affectation of wit and uncommon sentiment and for a consequent obscurity of expression yet all these and sir w davenant perhaps in a more eminent degree than the rest had for great occasions above the temptation of trifling a majestic and nervous simplicity both of sentiment and expression which with our more refined taste and language we have never been able to equal  i should now hope that the reader would set out with me upon a nearer inspection of this peom with the general idea of its being the work of an elevated genius pregnant with a rich store of free and noble sentiment fashioned by an intimate commerce with the great world and boldly pursuing an original but not an unskilful plan  the measure chosen for this poem is that which we now almost confine to elegy this choice does not appear very judicious for although our elegiac stanza possesses a strength and fullness which renders it not unsuitable to heroic subjects yet in a piece of considerable length every returning measure must become tiresome from its frequent repetitions and this is not the worst effect of returning flanzas in a long work the necessity of comprizing a sentence within the limits of the measure is the tyranny of procrustes to thought for the sake of a disagreeable uniformity expression must constantly be cramped or extenuated in general the latter expedient will be practiced as the easiest and thus both sentiment and language will be enfeebled by unmeaning expletives this indeed in some measure is the effect of rhyme couplets and still more of the latin hexameter and pentameter in our author a redundancy of thought running out into parentheses seems to have been produced or at least encouraged by the measure but i think he has generally preserved a force and majesty of expression  it would have been highly injudicious for one who has rejected all poetical machinery to have begun his poem with the ancient from of invoking a muse indeed in all modern writers this invocation appears little better than an unmeaning ceremony practiced by rote from ancient custom and very properly makes a part of the receipt for an epic poem humourously laid down after the exact model of mechanical imitation in the spectator our author with simple and unaffected dignity thus opens at once into his subject of all the lombards by their trophies known who sought fame soon and had her favor long king aribert best seemed to fill the throne and bred most business for heroic song   this conquering monarch we are soon acquainted was blessed with an only child the heroine of the story recorded rhodalind whose high renown who miss in books not luckily have read or vexed with living beauties of their own have shunned the wise records of lovers dead   descriptions of female beauty have engaged the powers of poets in every age who have exhausted all nature for imagery to heighten their painting yet the picture has ever been extremely faint and inadequate our poet judiciously confines his description of rhodalind to the qualities of her mind contenting himself with general praises though in the highflown gallantry of the times of her personal charms her looks like empire showed great above pride since pride ill counterseits excessive height but nature published what she fain would hide who for her deeds not beauty loved the light to make her lowly minds appearance less she used some outward greatness for disguise esteemed as pride the cloystral lowliness and thought them proud who even the proud despise oppressors big with pride when she appeared blushed and believed their greatness counterfeit the lowly thought they them in vain had feared found virtue harmless and naught else so great her mind scarce to her feeble sex a kin did as her birth her right to empire show seemed careless outward when employed within her speech like lovers watched was kind and low   the court of aribert could not want men of high rank and accomplishments to pay their devotions at such a shrine among these oswald the great and greater gondibert moved in the most exalted sphere of renown these noble personages are characterized and contrasted with so masterly a hand that it would be an injury not to transcribe the whole in court prince oswald costly was and gay finer than near vain kings their favorites are outshind bright favorites on their nuptial day yet were his eyes dark with ambitious care duke gondibert was still more gravely clad but yet his looks familiar were and clear as if with ill to others never sad nor toward himself could others practice fear the prince could porpoiselike in tempests play and in court storms on shipwrecked greatness feed not frighted with their fate when cast away but to their glorious hazards durst succeed the duke would lasting calms to courts assure as pleasant gardens we defend from winds for he who business would from storms procure soon his affairs above his manage finds oswald in throngs the abject people sought with humble looks who still too late will know they are ambitions quarry and soon caught when the aspiring eagle stoops so low the duke did these by steady virtue gain which they in action more than precept taste deeds show the good and those who goodness feign by such even through their vizards are outfact oswald in war was worthily renowned though gay in courts coarsely in camps could live judged danger soon and first was in it found could toil to gain what he with ease did give yet toils and dangers through ambition loved which does in war the name of virtue own but quits that name when from the war removed as rivers theirs when from their channels gone the duke as restless as his fame in war with martial toil could oswald weary make and calmly do what he with rage did dare and give so much as he might deign to take him as their founder cities did adore the court he knew to steer in storms of state in fields a battle lost he could restore and after force the victors to their sat   of these great rivals gondibert was he whom the king had destined for his soninlaw and the heir of his throne and rhodalind too in the privacy of her own breast had made the same choice this is related in a manner little inferior to shakespeares famous description of concealed love yet sadly it is sung that she in shades mildly as mourning doves loves sorrows felt whilst in her secret tears her freshness fades as roses silently in lymbecks melt   gondibert however though of a nature by no means unsusceptible of the tender passion had not as yet felt it for a particular object and oswald who stood forth as the public suitor to the princess was incited by no other motive than ambition not rhodalind herself says the poet could he affect but shining in her throne  his cause was powerfully pleaded with the princess by his sister gartha with whom we are next brought acquainted a bold full majestic beauty and a corresponding mind high restless and aspiring are her distinguishing features the prince and duke were urged on to ambitious pursuits by their respective armies which just returned from conquest lay encamped the one at brescia and the other at bergamo that of gondibert was composed of hardy youth whom he had selected from his fathers camp and educated in martial discipline under his own inspection temperance chastity vigilance humanity and all the high virtues of chivalry remarkably distinguish these young soldiers from those of later times beauty indeed commanded no less regard amongst them than in a modern camp but it was an object of passion and not of appetite and was the powerful engine in their education which inspired them with noble and exalted sentiments this is an idea on which our author true to the principles of chivalry very frequently enlarges and always with peculiar force and dignity in the present instance it is thus finely expressed but though the duke taught rigid discipline he let them beauty thus at distance know as priests discover some more sacred shrine which none must touch yet all to it may bow when thus as suitors mourning virgins pass through their clean camp themselves in form they draw that they with martial reverence may grace beauty the stranger which they seldom saw they vayld their ensigns as it by did move whilst inward as from native conscience all worshipped the poets darling godhead love which grave philosophers did nature call   indeed the influence of this passion in its purest and most exalted state during the course of education is a subject that might perhaps shine as much in the hands of a moralist as of a poet  the soldiers of oswald were his fathers brave veterans in whose arms he had been bred the story thus opened and our attention awakened to the expectation of important events the first canto is closed  the second canto introduces us to a solemn annual hunting held by duke gondibert in commemoration of a great victory gained on this day by his grandsire his train was adorned by many gallant and noble persons the friends of his family and commanders in his army the hunting which is described with much poetical spirit terminates in a combat as gondibert and his party are returning weary homeward an ancient ranger hastily brings the tidings that oswald who had lain in ambush with a body of chosen horse is advancing upon them the duke rejecting all counsels of flight prepares to receive his foes and with an account of their principal leaders and the order of their march the canto concludes  a parley between the chiefs now succeeds in which the character of each is well preserved oswald warmly accuses his rival for usurping his claims on the princess and the kingdom gondibert defends himself with temper and disavows all ambitious designs the other disdains accommodation and the conference ends in a generous agreement to decide their differences in single fight  when every thing is prepared for the combat hubert the brother of oswald steps forth with a general challenge to the opposite party this is instantly accepted and serves for a prelude to so many others that a general engagement seems likely to ensue when oswald reproves their disobedient ardour and upon huberts insisting to share his fate from the rights of brotherhood it is at length decided that three persons of each party should enter the lists along with their generals the duel then comes on in the fourth canto in which oswald hubert paradine and dargonet are severally matched with gondibert hurgonil the lover of orna the dukes sister and arnold and hugo generous rivals in laura descriptions of battle are so frequent in epic poetry that scarcely any circumstances of variety are left to diversify them homer and his imitators have attempted novelty in the multiplicity of their combats by every possible variation of weapon posture and wound they considered the human body with anatomical nicety and dwelt with a savage pleasure upon every idea of pain and horror that studied butchery could excite i shall leave it to the professed admirers of antiquity to determine under what head of poetical beauty such objects are to be ranged the terrible is certainly a principal source of the sublime but a slaughterhouse or a surgery would not seem proper studies for a poet davenant has drawn little from them his battles are rendered interesting chiefly by the character and situation of the combatants when arnold the favored lover of laura is slain by paradine hugo who had overthrown his antagonist springs to avenge his rival with these truly gallant expressions vain conqueror said hugo then return instead of laurel which the victor wears go gather cypress for thy brothers urn and learn of me to water it with tears thy brother lost his life attempting mine which cannot for lord arnolds loss suffice i must revenge unlucky paradine the blood his death will draw from lauras eyes we rivals were in laura but though she my griefs derided his with sighs approved yet i in loves exact integrity must take thy life for killing him she loved   his generosity however was fatal both to his foe and himself  hubert disabled by a wound in his arm is dishonored by receiving his life from his conqueror upon which occasion the poet thus beautifully apostrophises o honor frail as life thy fellow flower cherished and watched and humrously esteemed then worn for short adornments of an hour and is when lost no more than life redeemed   the two chiefs are still left closely engaging and when hurgonil approaches to assist his lord he is warmly commanded to retire at length after many mutual wounds oswald falls  the death of the prince at the same time takes off all restraint from his party and incites them to revenge led by the wounded hubert old vasco and borgio they attack the hunters who besides the fatigue of the chase are represented as somewhat inferior in number a furious battle the subject of the fifth canto now ensues gondibert shines forth in all the splendour of a hero by his prowess his friends are rescued and the opposite leaders overthrown in various separate encounters and by his military skill the brave veterans of oswald are defeated the whole description of the battle is warm and animated  in gondiberts generous lamentation over the fallen every heart must sympathize with the following pathetic tribute to the rival lovers brave arnold and his rival straight remove where laura shall bestrew their hallowed ground protectors both and ornaments of love this said his eyes outwept his widest wound tell her now these loves faithful saints are gone the beauty they adored she ought to hide for vainly will loves miracles be shown since lovers faith with these brave rivals died say little hugo never more shall mourn in noble numbers her unkind disdain who now not seeing beauty feels no scorn and wanting pleasure is exempt from pain when she with flowers lord arnolds grave shall strew and hears why hugos life was thrown away she on that rivals hearse will drop a few which merits all that april gives to may   the duke now draws off his remaining friends toward bergamo but on the journey overcome by fatigue and loss of blood he falls into a deadly swoon his attendants amidst their anxiety and confusion upon this event are surprised in the sixth canto with the approach of a squadron of horse this however proves to be a friendly body led by old ulsin who after recovering the duke by a cordial declares himself to have been a page to his grandsire and gives a noble relation of the character and exploits of his great master the rumor of oswalds attack brought him to the relief of gondibert and we have a description which will be thought too much bordering upon the ludicrous of the strange confusion among his maimed veterans who in their haste had seized upon each others artificial limbs this unsightly troop with the deficiences of hands arms legs and eyes can scarcely with all the poets art be rendered a respectable object such instances of faulty judgment are frequent in the writings of an age which was characterized by vigor of imagination rather than correctness of taste ulfin leads the duke to the house of the sage astragon where with the approach of night the canto and the first book conclude  in the beginning of the second book the poet carries us with hurgonil and tybalt and their noble dead to verona the distant turrets first appearing and then the great objects opening one by one the river the palace the temple and the amphitheatre of flaminius form a landscape truly noble and picturesque the view of the temple gives occasion to one of those elevated religious sentiments which dignify this poem this to soothe heaven the bloody clephes built as if heavens king so soft and easy were so meanly housed in heaven and kind to guilt that he would be a tyrants tenant here   we have then a lively description of a city mourning with the various and uncertain rumors of the late event among the people the rest of the canto is employed in a debate rather tedious though intermixed with fine sentiments concerning the propriety of granting funeral rites to those who had perished in the quarrel  the progress of the fatal news is traced in the next canto aribert appears sitting in council in all the regal dignity tybalt relates the story the king in a majestic speech complains of the toils and cares of empire and predicts the baneful consequences likely to ensue a more interesting scene is then disclosed in which tybalt declares the melancholy events of the combat to rhodalind and the other ladies of the court great art is shown in the delicate ambiguity by which they are prepared to receive the tidings laura is overpowered by her loss and calling on arnolds name is conveyed away by her female attendants this tender scene of sorrow is finely contrasted by the abrupt entrance of gartha in all the wild pomp of mingled rage and grief no sooner was the pitied laura gone but oswalds sister gartha the renowned enters as if the world was overthrown or in the tears of the afflicted drowned unconquered as her beauty was her mind which wanted not a spark of oswalds fire ambition loved but never to love was kind vexed thrones did more than quiet shades desire her garments now in loose neglect she wore as suited to her wild dishevelled hair   in the fury of her passion she breaks out into execrations against the innocent blasted be all your beauties rhodalind till you a shame and terror be to sight unwingd be love and slow as he is blind who with your looks poisoned my brothers sight   at length she mounts her chariot and flies with the wings of revenge to the veteran camp at brescia the terror impressed on the people by her hasty departure is imaged with great sublimity she seemed their citys genius as she passed who by their sins expelled would never return   the third canto brings us to brescia where huberts arrival with the dead body of oswald excites every emotion of surprise grief and fury in the breasts of the brave veterans they spend the night in this storm of contending passions and at daybreak assemble round the tent of hubert who by a noble harangue gives additional fire to their revenge they instantly arm and demand to be led to bergamo when gartha arrives she turns their vengeance against the court where she represents the triumph of gondiberts faction and the dishonor cast upon their own the rage discovered in her countenance overpowering the symptoms of grief is painted with amazing grandeur in the following simile the sun did thus to threatned nature show his anger red whilst guilt looked pale in all when clouds of floods did hang about his brow and then shrunk back to let that anger fall   this tempest is however allayed in the next canto by the arrival of the wife hermegild who though grown aged in war and politics is possessed with a youthful passion for gartha he solemnly binds his services to their party for the reward of garthas love but persuades them to submit to more cautious and pacific measures gartha returns with him to the court and the funeral of oswald with roman rites which yet the worlds last law had not forbid is described in the remaining part of the canto  from scenes of rage and tumult the poet then leads us to the quiet shades of philosophy in the house of astragon this change is not better calculated for the readers relief than for a display of the richness and elevation of the writers mind that the friend of hobbes should despise the learned lumber of the schools will not be thought extraordinary but that he should distinctly mark out such plans of acquiring knowledge as have since been pursued with the greatest success may well be deemed a remarkable proof of high and comprehensive genius in astragons domain is a retired building upon which is written in large letters great natures office here sit certain venerable sages styled natures registers busied in recording what is brought them by a throng called their intelligencers these men are diversely employed in exploring the haunts of beasts of birds and of fishes and collecting observations of their manners their prey their increase and every circumstance of their economy near this place is natures nursery stocked with every species of plants of which the several properties and virtues are diligently examined is it not striking to find in the house of astragon so exact a model of the school of linnaeus  we are next led to the cabinet of death a receptacle for skeletons and anatomical curiosities of every kind and from thence by a pleasing analogy to the library or as it is termed the monument of banished minds the feelings of his guests on entering this room are thus described where when they thought they saw in well sought books the assembled souls of all that men held wise it bred such awful reverence in their looks as if they saw the buried writers rise   the poet then goes through a particular survey of the authors distinguished into their several periods countries and professions in which he exhibits a great extent of learning and much more to his honor a sound and liberal judgment of what is truly valuable in learning of this his account of the polemic divines will be thought no unfavourable specimen about this sacred little book did stand unwieldy volumes and in number great and long it was since any readers hand had reached them from their unfrequented seat for a deep dust which time does softly shed where only time does come their covers bear on which grave spiders streets of webs had spread subtle and slight as the grave writers were in these heavens holy fire does vainly burn nor warms nor lights but is in sparkles spent where froward authors with disputes have torn the garment seamless as the firmament   if the subjects of this canto appear more noble and elevated than those which usually employ the episodes of heroic poetry that of the ensuing one must strike with still superior dignity having acquainted us with the philosophy of his admired sage the poet now by a beautiful kind of allegory instructs us in his religion astragon had dedicated three temples to prayer to penitence and to praise the temple of prayer is described as a building quite plain open and without bells since nothing should tempt or summon to an office to which our own wants invite us the duty of penitence being a severity unpleasing to nature its temple is contrived by its solemn and uncommon appearance to catch the sense it is a vast building of black marble hung with black and furnished with that dim religious light which poets have so finely employed to excite kindred ideas of gloom and melancholy but none i think have painted it with such strength of coloring as our author black curtains hide the glass whilst from on high a winking lamp still threatens all the room as if the lazy flame just now would die such will the suns last light appear at doom   a tolling bell calls to the temple and every other circumstance belonging to it is imagined with great propriety and beauty  but the poets greatest exertions are reserved for his favorite temple of praise a general shout of joy is the summons to it the building in its materials and architecture is gay and splendid beyond the most sumptuous palace the front is adorned with figures of all kinds of musical instruments all as he most beautifully expresses it that joy did ever invent or breath inspired or flying fingers touched into a voice the statues without the pictures within the decorations and the choir of worshippers are all suited with nice judgment and described with genuine poetry this distinguished canto concludes with these noble stanzas the sum and moral as it were of the whole praise is devotion fit for mighty minds the differing worlds agreeing sacrifice where heaven divided faiths united finds but prayer in various discord upwards flies for prayer the ocean is where diversely men steer their course each to a several coast where all our interests so discordant be that half beg winds by which the rest are lost by penitence when we ourselves forsake it is but in wise design on piteous heaven in praise we nobly give what god may take and are without a beggars blush forgiven its utmost force like powders is unknown and though weak kings excess of praise may fear yet when it is here like powder dangerous grown heavens vault receives what would the palace tear the last thought will be termed in this cold age a conceit and so may every thing that distinguishes wit and poetry from plain sense and prose  the wonders of the house of astragon are not yet exhausted to astragon heaven for succession gave one only pledge and birtha was her name   this maid her fathers humble disciple and assistant educated in the bosom of rural simplicity is rendered a more charming object than even the renowned rhodalind upon her throne courts she never saw yet courts could have undone with untaught looks and an unpracticed heart her nets the most prepared could never shun for nature spread them in the scorn of art   but i check my desire of copying more from this exquisitely pleasing picture my intention is to excite curiosity not to gratify it i hope i have already done enough for that purpose and since the rest of this unfinished story may be comprised in a short compass i shall proceed with but few interruptions to conclude a paper already swelled to an unexpected bulk  that the unpractised birtha should entertain an unresisted passion for the noblest of his sex and that gondibert whose want of ambition alone had secured him from the charms of rhodalind should bow to those of his lovely hostess and handmaid will be thought a very natural turn in the story upon which however the reader may foresee the most interesting events depending the progress of their love though scarcely known to themselves is soon discovered by the sage astragon this is expressed by the poet with a very fine turn of a common thought when all these symptoms he observed he knows from alga which is rooted deep in seas to the high cedar that on mountains grows no sovereign herb is found for their disease   the remainder of this poem consisting of a third book written during the authors imprisonment is composed of several detached scenes in which the main plot lies ripening for future action rivals are raised in birtha flattering advances from the court and more open declarations of love from rhodalind are in vain employed to assail the constancy of gondibert various conflicts of passion arise and interesting situations well imagined and painted in lively colors much is given as in the former parts to the introduction of elevated sentiment with one example of which i shall finish my quotations several wellborn youths are placed about the person of gondibert as his pages whose education consists of the following great lessons from their lord but with the early sun he rose and taught these youths by growing virtue to grow great showed greatness is without it blindly sought a desperate charge which ends in base retreat he taught them shame the sudden sense of ill shame natures hasty conscience which forbids weak inclination ere it grows to will or stays rash will before it grows to deeds he taught them honor virtues bashfulness a fort so yieldless that it fears to treat like power it grows to nothing growing less honor the moral conscience of the great he taught them kindness souls civility in which nor courts nor cities have a part for theirs is fashion this from falsehood free where love and pleasure know no lust nor art and love he taught the souls stolen visit made though froward age watch hard and law sorbd her walks no spy has traced nor mountain staid her friendships cause is as the loadstone hid he taught them love of toil toil which does keep obstructions from the mind and quench the blood ease but belongs to us like sleep and sleep like opium is our medicine not our food   the plot is at length involved in so many intricate and apparently unsurmountable difficulties that it is scarce possible to conceive a satisfactory termination perhaps the poet was sensible of a want of power to extricate himself and chose thus to submit to a voluntary bankruptcy of invention rather than hazard his reputation by going further in his postscript indeed he excuses himself on account of sickness and approaching dissolution however disappointed we may be by his abrupt departure from scenes which he has filled with confusion we ought not to forget the pleasures already received from them if says he to his reader with more than the spirit of a dying man thou art one of those who has been warmed with poetic fire i reverence thee as my judge from such a judicature this noble fragment would i doubt not acquire for him what the critic laments his having lost the possession of that true and permanent glory of which his large soul appears to have been full disc on poetical imitation   an enquiry into those kinds of distress which excite agreeable sensations it is undoubtedly true though a phenomenon of the human mind difficult to account for that the representation of distress frequently gives pleasure from which general observation many of our modern writers of tragedy and romance seem to have drawn this inference that in order to please they have nothing more to do than to paint distress in natural and striking colors with this view they heap together all the afflicting events and dismal accidents their imagination can furnish and when they have half broke the readers heart they expect he should thank them for his agreeable entertainment an author of this class sits down pretty much like an inquisitor to compute how much suffering he can inflict upon the hero of his tale before he makes an end of him with this difference indeed that the inquisitor only tortures those who are at least reputed criminals whereas the writer generally chooses the most excellent character in his piece for the subject of his persecution the great criterion of excellence is placed in being able to draw tears plentifully and concluding we shall weep the more the more the picture is loaded with doleful events they go on telling  of sorrows upon sorrows even to a lamentable length of woe   a monarch once proposed a reward for the discovery of a new pleasure but if any one could find out a new torture or nondescript calamity he would be more entitled to the applause of those who fabricate books of entertainment  but the springs of pity require to be touched with a more delicate hand and it is far from being true that we are agreeably affected by every thing that excites our sympathy it shall therefore be the business of this essay to distinguish those kinds of distress which are pleasing in the representation from those which are really painful and disgusting  the view or relation of mere misery can never be pleasing we have indeed a strong sympathy with all kinds of misery but it is a feeling of pure unmixed pain similar in kind though not equal in degree to what we feel for ourselves on the like occasions and never produces that melting sorrow that thrill of tenderness to which we give the name of pity they are two distinct sensations marked by very different external expression one causes the nerves to single the flesh to shudder and the whole countenance to be thrown into strong contractions the other relaxes the frame opens the features and produces tears when we crush a noxious or loathsome animal we may sympathize strongly with the pain it suffers but with far different emotions from the tender sentiment we feel for the dog of ulysses who crawled to meet his long lost master looked up and died at his feet extreme bodily pain is perhaps the most intense suffering we are capable of and if the fellowfeeling with misery alone was grateful to the mind the exhibition of a man in a fit of the toothache or under a chirurgical operation would have a fine effect in a tragedy but there must be some other sentiment combined with this kind of instinctive sympathy before it becomes in any degree pleasing or produces the sweet emotion of pity this sentiment is love esteem the complacency we take in the contemplation of beauty of mental or moral excellence called forth and rendered more interesting by circumstances of pain and danger tenderness is much more properly than sorrow the spring of tears for it affects us in that manner whether combined with joy or grief perhaps more in the former case than the latter and i believe we may venture to assert that no distress which produces tears is wholly without a mixture of pleasure when josephs brethren were sent to buy corn if they had perished in the desert by wild beasts or been reduced as in the horrid adventures of a pierre de vaud to eat one another we might have shuddered but we should not have wept for them the gush of tears is when joseph made himself known to his brethren and fell on their neck and kissed them when hubert prepares to burn out prince arthurs eyes the shocking circumstance of itself would only affect us with horror it is the amiable simplicity of the young prince and his innocent affection to his intended murderer that draws our tears and excites that tender sorrow which we love to feel and which refines the heart while we do feel it  we see therefore from this view of our internal feelings that no scenes of misery ought to be exhibited which are not connected with the display of some moral excellence or agreeable quality if fortitude power and strength of mind are called forth they produce the sublime feelings of wonder and admiration if the softer qualities of gentleness grace and beauty they inspire love and pity the management of these latter emotions is our present object  and let it be remembered in the first place that the misfortunes which excite pity must not be too horrid and overwhelming the mind is rather stunned than softened by great calamities they are little circumstances that work most sensibly upon the tender feelings for this reason a well written novel generally draws more tears than a tragedy the distresses of tragedy are more calculated to amaze and terrify than to move compassion battles torture and death are in every page the dignity of the characters the importance of the events the pomp of verse and imagery interest the grander passions and raise the mind to an enthusiasm little favorable to the weak and languid notes of pity the tragedies of young are in a fine strain of poetry and the situations are worked up with great energy but the pictures are in too deep a shade all his pieces are full of violent and gloomy passions and so overwrought with horror that instead of awakening any pleasing sensibility they leave on the mind an impression of sadness mixed with terror shakespeare is sometimes guilty of presenting scenes too shocking such is the trampling out of glosters eyes and such is the whole play of titus andronicus but lee beyond all others abounds with this kind of images he delighted in painting the most daring crimes and cruel massacres and though he has shown himself extremely capable of raising tenderness he continually checks its course by shocking and disagreeable expressions his pieces are in the same taste with the pictures of spagnolet and there are many scenes in his tragedies which no one can relish who would not look with pleasure on the flaying of st bartholomew the following speech of marguerite in the maffacre of paris was i suppose intended to express the utmost tenderness of affection die for him that is too little i could burn piecemeal away or bleed to death by drops be flayed alive then broke upon the wheel yet with a smile endure it all for guise and when let loose from torments all one wound run with my mangled arms and crush him dead   imagls like these will never excite the softer passions we are less moved at the description of an indian tortured with all the dreadful ingenuity of that savage people than with the fatal mistake of the lover in the spectator who pierced an artery in the arm of his mistress as he was letting her blood tragedy and romancewriters are likewise apt to make too free with the more violent expressions of passion and distress by which means they lose their effect thus an ordinary author does not know how to express any strong emotion otherwise than by swoonings or death so that a person experienced in this kind of reading when a girl faints away at parting with her lover or a hero kills himself for the loss of his mistress considers it as the established etiquette upon such occasions and turns over the pages with the utmost coolness and unconcern whereas real sensibility and a more intimate knowledge of human nature would have suggested a thousand little touches of grief which though slight are irresistible we are to gloomy a people some of the french novels are remarkable for little affecting incidents imagined with delicacy and told with grace perhaps they have a better turn than we for this kind of writing  a judicius author will never attempt to raise pity by any thing mean or disgusting as we have already observed there must be a degree of complacence mixed with our sorrows to produce an agreeable sympathy nothing therefore must be admitted which destroys the grace and dignity of suffering the imagination must have an amiable figure to dwell upon there are circumstances so ludicrous or disgusting that no character can preserve a proper decorum under them or appear in an agreeable light who can read the following description of polypheme without finding his compassion entirely destroyed by aversion and loathing  his bloody hand snatched two unhappy of my martial band and dashed like dogs against the stony floor the pavement swims with brains and mingled gore torn limb from limb he spreads his horrid feast and fierce devours it like a mountain beast he sucks the marrow and the blood he drains nor entrails flesh nor solid bone remains or that of scylla in the wide dungeon she devours her food and the flesh trembles while she churns the blood deformity is always disgusting and the imagination cannot reconcile it with the idea of a favorite character therefore the poet and romancewriter are fully justified in giving a larger share of beauty to their principal figures than is usually met with in common life a late genius indeed in a whimsical mood gave us a lady with her nose crushed for the heroine of his story but the circumstance spoils the picture and though in the course of the story it is kept a good deal out of sight whenever it does recur to the imagination we are hurt and disgusted it was an heroic instance of virtue in the nuns of a certain abbey who cut off their noses and lips to avoid violation yet this would make a very bad subject for a poem or a play something akin to this is the representation of any thing unnatural of which kind is the famous story of the roman charity and for this reason i cannot but think it an unpleasing subject for either the pen or the pencil  poverty if truly represented shocks our nicer feelings therefore whenever it is made use of to awaken our compassion the rags and dirt the squalid appearance and mean employments incident to that state must be kept out of sight and the distress must arise from the idea of depression and the shock of falling from higher fortunes we do not pity belisarius as a poor blind beggar and a painter would succeed very ill who should sink him to the meanness of that condition he must let us still discover the conqueror of the vandals the general of the imperial armies or we shall be little interested let us look at the picture of the old woman in otway  a wrinkled hag with age grown double picking dry sticks and muttering to herself her eyes with scalding rheum were galled and red cold palsy shook her head her hands seemed withered and on her crooked shoulder had she wrapped the tattered remnant of an old stripped hanging which served to keep her carcass from the cold so there was nothing of a piece about her here is the extreme of wretchedness and instead of melting into pity we turn away with aversion indeed the author only intended it to strike horror but how different are the sentiments we feel for the lovely belvidera we see none of those circumstances which render poverty an unamiable thing when the goods are seized by an execution our attention is turned to the piles of massy plate and all the ancient most domestic ornaments which imply grandeur and consequence or to such instances of their hard fortune as will lead us to pity them as lovers we are struck and affected with the general face of ruin but we are not brought near enough to discern the ugliness of its features belvidera ruined belvidera deprived of friends without a home abandoned to the wide world  we can contemplate with all the pleasing sympathy of pity but had she been represented as really sunk into low life had we seen her employed in the most servile offices of poverty our compassion would have given way to contempt and disgust indeed we may observe in real life that poverty is only pitied so long as people can keep themselves from the effects of it when in common language we say a miserable object we mean an object of distress which if we relieve we turn away from at the same time to make pity pleasing the object of it must not in any view be disagreeable to the imagination how admirably has the author of clarissa managed this point amidst scenes of suffering which rend the heart in poverty in a prison under the most shocking outrages the grace and delicacy of her character never suffers even for a moment there seems to be a charm about her which prevents her receiving a stain from any thing which happens and clarissa abandoned and undone is the object not only of complacence but veneration  i would likewise observe that if an author would have us feel a strong degree of compassion his characters must not be too perfect the stern fortitude and inflexible resolution of a cato may command esteem but does not excite tenderness and faultless rectitude of conduct though no rigor be mixed with it is of too sublime a nature to inspire compassion virtue has a kind of selfsufficiency it stands upon its own basis and cannot be injured by any violence it must therefore be mixed with something of helplessness and imperfection with an excessive sensibility or a simplicity bordering upon weakness before it raises in any great degree either tenderness or familiar love if there be a fault in the masterly performance just now mentioned it is that the character of clarissa is so inflexibly right her passions are under such perfect command and her prudence is so equal to every occasion that she seems not to need that sympathy we should bestow upon one of a less elevated character and perhaps we should feel a livelier emotion of tenderness for lovelaces rosebud but that the story of clarissa is so worked up by the strength of coloring and the force of repeated impressions as to command all our sorrow  pity seems too degrading a sentiment to be offered at the shrine of faultless excellence the sufferings of martyrs are rather beheld with admiration and sympathetic triumph than with tears and we never feel much for those whom we consider as themselves raised above common feelings  the last rule i shall insist upon is that scenes of distress should not be too long continued all our finer feelings are in a manner momentary and no art can carry them beyond a certain point either in intenseness or duration constant suffering deadens the heart to tender impressions as we may observe in sailors and others who are grown callous by a life of continual hardships it is therefore highly necessary in a long work to relieve the mind by scenes of pleasure and gaiety and i cannot think it so absurd a practice as our modern delicacy has represented it to intermix wit and fancy with the pathetic provided care be taken not to check the passions while they are flowing the transition from a pleasurable state of mind to tender sorrow is not so difficult as we imagine when the mind is opened by gay and agreeable scenes every impression is felt more sensibly persons of a lively temper are much more susceptible of that sudden swell of sensibility which occasions tears than those of a grave and saturnine cast for this reason women are more easily moved to weeping than men those who have touched the springs of pity with the finest hand have mingled light strokes of pleasantry and mirth in their most pathetic passages very different is the conduct of many novel writers who by plunging us into scenes of distress without end or limit exhaust the powers and before the conclusion either render us insensible to every thing or fix a real sadness upon the mind the uniform style of tragedies is one reason why they affect so little in our old plays all the force of language is reserved for the more interesting parts and in the scenes of common life there is no attempt to rise above common language whereas we by that pompous manner and affected solemnity which we think it necessary to preserve through the whole piece lose the force of an elevated or passionate expression where the occasion really suggests it  having thus considered the manner in which fictitious distress must be managed to render it pleasing let us reflect a little upon the moral tendency of such representations much has been said in favor of them and they are generally thought to improve the tender and humane feelings but this i own appears to me very dubious that they exercise sensibility is true but sensibility does not increase with exercise by the constitution of our frame our habits increase our emotions decrease by repeated acts and thus a wise provision is made that as our compassion grows weaker its place should be supplied by habitual benevolence but in these writings our sensibility is strongly called forth without any possibility of exerting itself in virtuous action and those emotions which we shall never feel again with equal force are wasted without advantage nothing is more dangerous than to let virtuous impressions of any kind pass through the mind without producing their proper effect the awakenings of remorse virtuous shame and indignation the glow of moral approbation if they do not lead to action grow less and less vivid every time they recur till at length the mind grows absolutely callous the being affected with a pathetic story is undoubtedly a sign of an amiable disposition but perhaps no means of increasing it on the contrary young people by a course of this kind of reading often acquire something of that apathy and indifference which the experience of real life would have given them without its advantages  another reason why plays and romances do not improve our humanity is that they lead us to require a certain elegance of manners and delicacy of virtue which is not often found with poverty ignorance and meanness the objects of pity in romance are as different from those in real life as our husbandmen from the shepherds of arcadia and a girl who will sit weeping the whole night at the delicate distresses of a lady charlotte or lady julia shall be little moved at the complaint of her neighbor who in a homely phrase and vulgar accent laments to her that she is not able to get bread for her family romancewriters likewise make great misfortunes so familiar to our ears that we have hardly any pity to spare for the common accidents of life but we ought to remember that misery has a claim to relief however we may be disgusted with its appearance and that we must not fancy ourselves charitable when we are only pleasing our imagination  it would perhaps be better if our romances were more like those of the old stamp which tended to raise human nature and inspire a certain grace and dignity of manners of which we have hardly the idea the high notions of honor the wild and fanciful spirit of adventure and romantic love elevated the mind our novels tend to depress and enfeeble it yet there is a species of this kind of writing which must ever afford an exquisite pleasure to persons of taste and sensibility where noble sentiments are mixed with well fancied incidents pathetic touches with dignity and grace and invention with chaste correctness such will ever interest our sweetest passions i shall conclude this paper with the following tale  a tale in the happy period of the golden age when all the celestial inhabitants descended to the earth and conversed familiarly with mortals among the most cherished of the heavenly powers were twins the offspring of jupiter love and joy wherever they appeared the flowers sprung up beneath their feet the sun shone with a brighter radiance and all nature seemed embellished by their presence they were inseparable companions and their growing attachment was favored by jupiter who had decreed that a lasting union should be solemnized between them so soon as they were arrived at maturer years but in the mean time the sons of men deviated from their native innocence vice and ruin overran the earth with giant strides and astrea with her train of celestial visitants forsook their polluted abodes love alone remained having been stolen away by hope who was his nurse and conveyed by her to the forests of arcadia where he was brought up among the shepherds but jupiter assigned him a different partner and commanded him to espouse sorrow the daughter of ate he complied with reluctance for her features were harsh and disagreeable her

she loved to lie for hours together on the banks of some wild and melancholy stream singing to her lute she taught men to weep for she took a strange delight in tears and often when the virgins of the hamlet were assembled at their evening sports she would steal in amongst them and captivate their hearts by her tales full of a charming sadness she wore on her head a garland composed of her fathers

the infusion pity was commanded by jupiter to follow the steps of her mother through the world dropping balm into the wounds she made and binding up the hearts she had broken she follows with her hair loose her bosom bare and throbbing her garments torn by the briars and her feet bleeding with the roughness of the path the nymph is mortal for her mother is so and when she has fulfilled her destined course upon the earth they shall both expire together and love be again united to joy his immortal and long betrothed bride    the end
