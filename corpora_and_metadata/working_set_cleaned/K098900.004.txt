morphew near stationers hall mdccxii  to the right honorable chares lord hallifax from the hovel at hamptonwick april        my lord when i first resolved upon doing my self this honor i could not but indulge a certain vanity in dating from this little covert where i have frequently had the honor of your lordships company and received from you very many obligations the elegant solitude of this place and the greatest pleasures of it i owe to its being so near those beautiful manors wherein you sometimes reside it is not retiring from the world but enjoying its most valuable blessings when a man is permitted to share in your lordships conversations in the country all the bright images which the wits of past ages have left behind them in their writings the noble plans which the greatest statesmen have laid down for administration of affairs are equally the familiar objects of your knowledge but what is peculiar to your lordship above all the illustrious personages that have appeared in any age is that wit and learning have from your example fallen into a new era your patronage has produced those arts which before shunned the commerce of the world into the service of life and it is to you we owe that the man of wit has turned himself to be a man of business the false delicacy of men of genius and the objections which others were apt to insinuate against their abilities for entering into affairs have equally vanished and experience has shown that men of letters are not only qualified with a greater capacity but also a greater integrity in the dispatch of business your own studies have been diverted from being the highest ornament to the highest use to mankind and the capacities which would have rendered you the greatest poet of your age have to the advantage of great britain been employed in pursuits which have made you the most able and unbiassed patriot a vigorous imagination an extensive apprehension and a ready judgment have distinguished you in all the illustrious parts of administration in a reign attended with such difficulties that the same talents without the same quickness in the possession of them would have been incapable of conquering the natural success of such abilities has advanced you to a seat in that illustrious house where you were received by a crowd of your relations great as you are in your honors and personal qualities i know you will forgive an humble neighbor the vanity of pretending to a place in your friendship and subscribing himself  my lord your lordships most obliged and most devoted servant richard steel  the preface in the last tatler i promised some explanation of passages and persons mentioned in this work as well as some account of the assistances i have had in the performance i shall do this in very few words for when a man has no design but to speak plain truth he may say a great deal in a very narrow compass i have in the dedication of the first volume made my acknowledgments to dr swift whose pleasant writings in the name of bickerstaff created an inclination in the town toward any thing that could appear in the same disguise i must acknowledge also that at my first entering upon this work a certain uncommon way of thinking and a turn in conversation peculiar to that agreeable gentleman rendered his company very advantageous to one whose imagination was to be continually employed upon obvious and common subjects though at the same time obliged to treat of them in a new and unbeaten method his verses on the shower in town and the description of the morning are instances of the happiness of that genius which could raise such pleasing ideas upon occasions so barren to an ordinary invention  when i am upon the house of bickerstaff i must not forget that genealogy of the family sent to me by the post and written as i since understand by mr twisden who died at the battle of mons and has a monument in westminsterabbey suitable to the respect which is due to his wit and his valor there are through the course of the work very many incidents which were written by unknown correspondents of this kind is the tale in the second tatler and the epistle from mr downs the prompter with others which were very well received by the public but i have only one gentleman who will be nameless to thank for any frequent assistance to me which indeed it would have been barbarous in him to have denied to one with whom he has lived in an intimacy from childhood considering the great ease with which he is able to dispatch the most entertaining pieces of this nature this good office he performed with such force of genius humor wit and learning that i fared like a distressed prince who calls in a powerful neighbor to his aid i was undone by my auxiliary when i had once called him in i could not subsist without dependence on him  the same hand writ the distinguishing characters of men and women under the names of musical instruments the distress of the newswriters the inventory of the playhouse and the description of the thermometer which i cannot but look upon as the greatest embellishments of this work  thus for i thought necessary to say relating to the great hands which have been concerned in these volumes with relation to the spirit and genius of the work and am far from pretending to modesty in making this acknowledgment what a man obtains from the good opinion and friendship of worthy men is a much greater honor than he can possibly reap from any accomplishments of his own but all the credit of wit which was given me by the gentlemen abovementioned with whom i have now accounted has not been able to atone for the exceptions made against me for some raillery in behalf of that learned advocate for the episcopacy of the church and the liberty of the people mr hoadley i mention this only to defend my self against the imputation of being moved rather by party than opinion and i think it is apparent i have with the utmost frankness allowed merit wherever i found it though joined in interests different from those for which i have declared my self when my favonius is acknowledged to be dr smalridge and the amiable character of the dean in the sixty sixth tatler drawn for dr atterbury i hope i need say no more as to my impartiality  i really have acted in these cases with honesty and am concerned it should be thought otherwise for wit if a man had it unless it be directed to some useful end is but a wanton frivolous quality all that one should value himself upon in this kind is that he had some honorable intention in it  as for this point never hero in romance was carried away with a more furious ambition to conquer giants and tyrants than i have been in extirpating gamesters and duellists and indeed like one of those knights too though i was calm before i am apt to fly out again when the thing that first disturbed me is presented to my imagination i shall therefore leave off when i am well and fight with windmills no more only shall be so arrogant as to say of my self that in spite of all the force of fashion and prejudice in the face of all the world i alone bewailed the condition of an english gentleman whose fortune and life are at this day precarious while his estate is liable to the demands of gamesters through a false sense of justice and to the demands of duellists through a false sense of honor as to the first of these orders of men i have not one word more to say of them as to the latter i shall conclude all i have more to offer aginst them with respect to their being prompted by the fear of shame by applying to the duellist what i think dr south says somewhere of the liar he is a coward to man and a brave to god  the no   0 tatler by isaac bickerstaff esquire vol iv  timeo danaos and dona ferentes virg from saturday june    to tuesday june       0 sheerlane june    there are some occasions in life wherein regards to a mans self is the most pitiful and contemptible of all passions and such a time certainly is when the true public spirit of a nation is run into a faction against their friends and benefactors i have hinted heretofore some things which discover the real sorrow i am in at the observation that it is now very much so in great britain and have had the honor to be pelted with several epistles to expostulate with me on that subject among others one from a person of the number of those they call quakers who seems to admonish me out of pure zeal and good will but as there is no character so unjust as that of talking in party upon all occasions without respect to merit or worth on the contrary side so there is no part we can act so justifiable as to speak our mind when we see things urged to extremity against all that is praiseworthy or valuable in life upon general and groundless suggestions but if i have talked too frankly upon such reflections my correspondent has laid before me after his way the error of it in a manner that makes me indeed thankful for his kindness but the more inclinable to repeat the imprudence from the necessity of the circumstance  the   d of the  th month which is the month june friend isaac forasmuch as i love thee i cannot any longer refrain declaring my mind unto thee concerning some things thou did thy self indite the epistle inserted in one of thy late lucubrations as thou would have us call them for verily thy friend of stone and i speak according to knowledge has no fingers and though he has a mouth yet speaks he not therewith nor yet did that epistle at all come unto thee from the mansion house of the scarlet whore it is plain therefore that the truth is not in thee but since thou would lie could thou not lie with more discretion wherefore should thou insult over the afflicted or add sorrow unto the heavy of heart truly this gall proceeds not from the spirit of meekness i tell thee moreover the people of this land be marvelously given to change insomuch that it may lightly come to pass that before thou art many years nearer to thy dissolution thou may behold him sitting on a high place whom thou now laughest to scorn and then how will thou be glad to humble thy self to the ground and lick the dust of his feet that thou may find favor in his sight if thou did meditate as much upon the word as thou do upon the profane scribblings of the wise ones of this generation thou would have remembered what happened unto shimei the son of gera the benjamite who cursed the good man david in his distress david pardoned his transgression yet was he afterward taken as in a snare by the words of his own mouth and fell by the sword of solomon the chief ruler furthermore i do not remember to have heard in the days of my youth and vanity when like thine my conversation was with the gentiles that the men of rome which is babylon ever sued unto the men of carthage for tranquillity as thou do aver neither was hannibal the son of hamilcar called home by his countrymen till these saw the sword of their enemies at their gates and then was it not time for him think thou to return it appears therefore that thou do prophesy backwards thou do row one way and look another and indeed in all things art thou too much a timeserver yet seem thou not to consider what a day may bring forth think of this and take tobacco  thy friend aminadab   if the zealous writer of the above letter has any meaning it is of too high a nature to be the subject of my lucubrations i shall therefore wave such high points and be as useful as i can to persons of less moment than any he hints at when a man runs into a little fame in the world as he meets with a great deal of reproach which he does not deserve so does he also a great deal of esteem to which he has in himself no pretensions were it otherwise i am sure no one would offer to put a lawcase to me but because i am an adept in physic and astrology they will needs persuade me that i am no less a proficient in all other sciences however the point mentioned in the following letter is so plain a one that i think i need not trouble my self to cast a figure to be able to discuss it  mr bickerstaff it is some years ago since the entail of the estate of our family was altered by passing a fine in favor of me who now am in possession of it after some others deceased the heirsgeneral who live beyond sea were excluded by this settlement and the whole estate is to pass in a new channel after me and my heirs but several tenants of the lordship persuade me to let them hereafter hold their lands of me according to the old customs of the barony and not oblige them to act by the limitations of the last settlement this they say will make me more popular among my departments and the ancient vassals of the estate to whom any deviation from the line of succession is always invidious  yours etc   sheerlane june    sir you have by the fine a plain right in which none else of your family can be your competitor for which reason by all means demand vassalage upon that title the contrary advice can be given for no other purpose in nature but to betray you and favor other pretenders by making you place a right which is in you only upon a level with a right which you have in common with others i am  sir your most faithful servant till death i b   there is nothing so dangerous or so pleasing as compliments made to us by our enemies and my correspondent tells me that though he knows several of those who give him this counsel were at first against passing the fine in favor of him yet is he so touched with their homage to him that he can hardly believe they have a mind to set it aside in order to introduce the heirsgeneral into his estate  these are great evils but since there is no proceeding with success in this world without complying with the arts of it i shall use the same method as my correspondents tenants did with him in relation to one whom i never had a kindness for but shall notwithstanding presume to give him my advice  isaac bickerstaff esquire of great britain to lewis xiv of france sir your majesty will pardon me while i take the liberty to acquaint you that some passages written from your side of the water do very much obstruct your interests we take it very unkindly that the prints of paris are so very partial in favor of one set of men among us and treat the others as irreconcilable to your interests your writers are very large in recounting any thing which relates to the figure and power of one party but are dumb when they should represent the actions of the other this is a trifling circumstance many here are apt to lay some stress upon therefore i thought fit to offer it to your consideration before you dispatch the next courier  i b   the tatler no      propter vitam vivendi perdere causas juv from tuesday june    to thursday june       0 from my own apartment june    of all the evils under the sun that of making vice commendable is the greatest for it seems to be the basis of society that applause and contempt should be always given to proper objects but in this age we behold things for which we ought to have an abhorrence not only received without disdain but even valued as motives of emulation this is naturally the destruction of simplicity of manners openness of heart and generosity of temper when one gives ones self the liberty to range and run over in ones thoughts the different geniuss of men which one meets in the world one cannot but observe that most of the indirection and artifice which is used among men does not proceed so much from a degeneracy in nature as an affectation of appearing men of consequence by such practices by this means it is that a cunning man is so far from being ashamed of being esteemed such that he secretly rejoices in it it has been a sort of maxim that the greatest art is to conceal art but i know not how among some people we meet with their greatest cunning is to appear cunning there is polypragmon makes it the whole business of his life to be thought a cunning fellow and thinks it a much greater character to be terrible than agreeable when it has once entered into a mans head to have an ambition to be thought crafty all other evils are necessary consequences to deceive is the immediate endeavor of him who is proud of the capacity of doing it it is certain polypragmon does all the ill he possibly can but pretends to much more than he performs he is contented in his own thoughts and hugs himself in his closet that though he is locked up there and doing nothing the world does not know but that he is doing mischief to favor this suspicion he gives halflooks and shrugs in his general behavior to give you to understand that you dont know what he means he is also wonderfully adverbial in his expressions and breaks off with a perhaps and a nod of the head upon matters of the most indifferent nature it is a mighty practice with men of this genius to avoid frequent appearance in public and to be as mysterious as possible when they do come into company there is nothing to be done according to them the common way and let the matter in hand be what it will it must be carried with an air of importance and transacted if we may so speak with an ostentatious secrecy these are your persons of long heads who would fain make the world believe their thoughts and ideas are very much superior to their neighbors and do not value what these their neighbors think of them provided they do not reckon them fools these have such a romantic touch in business that they hate to perform any thing like other men were it in their choice they had rather bring their purposes to bear by overreaching the persons they deal with than by a plain and simple manner they make difficulties for the honor of surmounting them polypragmon is eternally busied after this manner with no other prospect than that he is in hopes to be thought the most cunning of all men and fears the imputation of want of understanding much more than that of the abuse of it but alas how contemptible is such an ambition which is the very reverse of all that is truly laudable and the very contradiction to the only means to a just reputation simplicity of manners cunning can in no circumstance imaginable be a quality worthy a man except in his own defense and merely to conceal himself from such as are so and in such cases it is no longer craft but wisdom the monstrous affectation of being thought artful immediately kills all thoughts of humanity and goodness and gives men a sense of the soft affections and impulses of the mind which are imprinted in us for our mutual advantage and succor as of mere weaknesses and follies according to the men of cunning you are to put off the nature of a man as fast as you can and acquire that of a demon as if it were a more eligible character to be a powerful enemy than an able friend but it ought to be a mortification to men affected this way that there wants but little more than instinct to be considerable in it for when a man has arrived at being very bad in his inclination he has not much more to do but to conceal himself and he may revenge cheat and deceive without much employment for understanding and go on with great cheerfulness with the high applause of being a prodigious cunning fellow but indeed when we arrive at that pitch of false taste as not to think cunning a contemptible quality it is methinks a very great injustice that pickpockets are had in so little veneration who must be admirably well turned not only for the theoretick but also the practical behavior of cunning fellows after all the endeavor of this family of men whom we call cunning their whole work falls to pieces if others will lay down all esteem for such artifices and treat it as an unmanly quality which they forbear to practice only because they abhor it when the spider is ranging in the different apartments of his web it is true that he only can weave so fine a thread but it is in the power of the meerest drone that has wings to fly through and destroy it  wills coffeehouse june    though the taste of wit and pleasure is at present but very low in this town yet there are some that preserve their relish undebauched with common impressions and can distinguish between reality and imposture a gentleman was saying here this evening that he would go to the play to morrow night to see heroism as it has been represented by some of our tragedians represented in burlesque it seems the play of alexander is to be then turned into ridicule for its bombast and other false ornaments in the thought as well as the language the bluster alexander makes is as much inconsistent with the character of an hero as the roughness of clytus an instance of the sincerity of a bold artless soldier to be plain is not to be rude but rather inclines a man to civility and deference not indeed to show it in the gestures of the body but in the sentiments of the mind it is among other things from the impertinent figures unskilful dramatists draw of the characters of men that youth are bewildered and prejudiced in their sense of the world of which they have no notions but what they draw from books and such representations thus talk to a very young man let him be of never so good sense and he shall smile when you speak of sincerity in a courtier good sense in a soldier or honesty in a politician the reason of this is that you hardly see one play wherein each of these ways of life is not drawn by hands that know nothing of any one of them and the truth is so far of the opposite side to what they paint that it is more impracticable to live in esteem in courts than any where else without sincerity good sense is the great requisite in a soldier and honesty the only thing that can support a politician this way of thinking made the gentleman of whom i was just now speaking say he was glad any one had taken upon him to depreciate such unnatural fustian as the tragedy of alexander the character of that prince indeed was that he was unequal and given to intemperance but in his sober moments when he had warm in his imagination the precepts of his great instructor he was a pattern of generous thoughts and dispositions in opposition to the strongest desires which are incident to a youth and conqueror but instead of representing that hero in the glorious character of generosity and chastity in his treatment of the beauteous family of darius he is drawn all along as a monster of lust or of cruelty as if the way to raise him to the degree of an hero were to make his character as little like that of a worthy man as possible such rude and indigested draughts of things are the proper objects of ridicule and contempt and depreciating alexander as we have him drawn is the only way of restoring him to what he was in himself it is well contrived of the players to let this part be followed by a true picture of life in the comedy called the chances wherein don john and constantia are acted to the utmost perfection there need not be a greater instance of the force of action than in many incidents of this play where indifferent passages and such that conduce only to the tacking of the scenes together are enlivened with such an agreeable gesture and behavior as apparently shows what a play might be though it is not wholly what a play should be  the tatler no     tecum vivere amem tecum obeam libens hor from thursd june    to saturd july      0 from my own apartment june  0 some years since i was engaged with a coach full of friends to take a journey as far as the landsend we were very well pleased with one another the first day every one endeavoring to recommend himself by his good humor and complaisance to the rest of the company this good correspondence did not last long one of our party was sowred the very first evening by a plate of butter which had not been melted to his mind and which spoiled his temper to such a degree that he continued upon the fret to the end of our journey a second fell off from his good humor the next morning for no other reason that i could imagine but because i chanced to step into the coach before him and place my self on the shady side this however was but my own private guess for he did not mention a word of it nor indeed of any thing else for three days following the rest of our company held out very near half the way when of a sudden mr sprightly fell asleep and instead of endeavoring to divert and oblige us as he had hitherto done carried himself with an unconcerned careless drowzy behavior till we came to uur last stage there were three of us who still held up our heads and did all we could to make our journey agreeable but to my shame be it spoken about three miles on this side exeter i was taken with an unaccountable fit of sullenness that hung upon me for above threescore miles whether it were for want of respect or from an accidental tread upon my foot or from a foolish maids calling me the old gentleman i cannot tell in short there was but one who kept his good humor to the landsend  there was another coach that went along with us in which i likewise observed that there were many secret jealousies heartburnings and animosities for when we joined companies at night i could not but take notice that the passengers neglected their own company and studied how to make themselves esteemed by us who were altogether strangers to them till at length they grew so well acquainted with us that they liked us as little as they did one another when i reflect upon this journey i often fancy it to be a picture of humane life in respect to the several friendships contracts and alliances that are made and dissolved in the several periods of it the most delightful and most lasting engagements are generally those which pass between man and woman and yet upon what trifles are they weakened or entirely broken sometimes the parties fly asunder even in the midst of courtship and sometimes grow cool in the very honey month some separate before the first child and some after the fifth others continue good till thirty others till forty while some few whose souls are of an happier make and better fitted to one another travel on together to the end of their journey in a continual intercourse of kind offices and mutual endearments  when we therefore choose our companions for life if we hope to keep both them and our selves in good humor to the last stage of it we must be extremely careful in the choice we make as well as in the conduct on our own part when the persons to whom we join our selves can stand an examination and bear the scrutiny when they mend upon our acquaintance with them and discover new beauties the more we search into their characters our love will naturally rise in proportion to their perfections  but because there are very few possessed of such accomplishments of body and mind we ought to look after those qualifications both in our selves and others which are indispensibly necessary toward this happy union and which are in the power of every one to acquire or at least to cultivate and improve these in my opinion are cheerfulness and constancy a cheerful temper joined with innocence will make beauty attractive knowledge delightful and wit goodnatured it will lighten sickness poverty and affliction convert ignorance into an amiable simplicity and render deformity it self agreeable  constancy is natural to persons of even tempers and uniform dispositions and may be acquired by those of the greatest fickleness violence and passion who consider seriously the terms of union upon which they come together the mutual interest in which they are engaged with all the motives that ought to incite their tenderness and compassion toward those who have their dependence upon them and are embarked with them for life in the same state of happiness or misery constancy when it grows in the mind upon considerations of this nature becomes a moral virtue and a kind of good nature that is not subject to any change of health age fortune or any of those accidents which are apt to unsettle the best dispositions that are founded rather in constitution than in reason where such a constancy as this is wanting the most enflamed passion may fall away into coldness and indifference and the most melting tenderness degenerate into hatred and aversion i shall conclude this paper with a story that is very well known in the north of england  about thirty years ago a packetboat that had several passengers on board was cast away upon a rock and in so great danger of sinking that all who were in it endeavored to save themselves as well at they could though only those who could swim well had a bare possibility of doing it among the passengers there were two women of fashion who seeing themselves in such a disconsolate condition begged of their husbands not to leave them one of them chose rather to die with his wife than to forsake her the other though he was moved with the utmost compassion for his wife told her that for the good of their children it was better one of them should live than both perish by a great piece of good luck next to a miracle when one of our good men had taken the last and long farewell in order to save himself and the other held in his arms the person that was dearer to him than life the ship was preserved it is with a secret sorrow and vexation of mind that i must tell the sequel of the story and let my reader know that this faithful pair who were ready to have died in each others arms about three years after their escape upon some trifling disgust grew to a coldness at first and at length fell out to such a degree that they left one another and parted for ever the other couple lived together in an uninterrupted friendship and felicity and what was remarkable the husband whom the shipwreck had like to have separated from his wife died a few months after her not being able to survive the loss of her  i must confess there is something in the changeableness and inconstancy of humane nature that very often both dejects and terrifies me whatever i am at present i tremble to think what i may be while i find this principle in me how can i assure my self that i shall be always true to my god my friend or my self in short without constancy there is neither love friendship or virtue in the world  the tatler no     qui didicit patriae quid debeat and quid amicis quo sit amore parens quo frater amandus and hospes scribere personae scit convenientia cuique hor from saturday july   to tuesday july      0 wills coffeehouse july   i have of late received many epistles wherein the writers treat me as a mercenary person for some late hints concerning matters which they think i should not have touched upon but for sordid considerations it is apparent that my motive could not be of that kind for when a man declares him self openly on one side that party will take no more notice of him because he is sure and the set of men whom he declares against for the same reason are violent against him thus it is folly in a plaindealer to expect that either his friends will reward him or his enemies forgive him for which reason i thought it was the shortest way to impartiality to put my self beyond further hopes or fears by declaring my self at a time when the dispute is not about persons and parties but things and causes to relieve my self from the vexation which naturally attends such reflections i came hither this evening to give my thoughts quite a new turn and converse with men of pleasure and wit rather than those of business and intrigue i had hardly entered the room when i was accosted by mr thomas dogget who desired my favor in relation to the play which was to be acted for his benefit on thursday he pleased me in saying it was the old bachelor in which comedy there is a necessary circumstance observed by the author which most other poets either overlook or do not understand that is to say the distinction of characters it is very ordinary with writers to indulge a certain modesty of believing all men as witty as themselves and making all the persons of the play speak the sentiments of the author without any manner of respect to the age fortune or quality of him that is on the stage ladies talk like rakes and footmen make similes but this writer knows men which makes his plays reasonable entertainments while the scenes of most others are like the tunes between the acts they are perhaps agreeable sounds but they have no ideas affixed to them dogget thanked me for my visit to him in the winter and after his comic manner spoke his request with so arch a leer that i promised the drole i would speak to all my acquaintance to be at his play  whatever the world may think of the actors whether it be that their parts have an effect on their lives or whatever it is you see a wonderful benevolence among them toward the interests and necessities of each other dogget therefore would not let me go without delivering me a letter from poor old downs the prompter wherein that retainer to the theater desires my advice and assistance in a matter of concern to him i have sent him my private opinion for his conduct but the stage and the state affairs being so much canvassed by parties and factions i shall for some time hereafter take leave of subjects which relate to either of them and employ my care in the consideration of matters which regard that part of mankind who live without interesting themselves with the troubles or pleasures of either however for a mere notion of the present posture of the stage i shall give you the letter at large as follows  july      0 honored sir finding by diverse of your late papers that you are a friend to the profession of which i was many years an unworthy member i the rather make bold to crave your advice touching a proposal that has been lately made me of coming again into business and the subadministration of stage affairs i have from my youth been bred up behind the curtain and been a prompter from the time of the restoration i have seen many changes as well of scenes as of actors and have known men within my remembrance arrive to the highest dignities of the theater who made their entrance in the quality of mutes jointstools flowerpots and tapestry hangings it cannot be unknown to the nobility and gentry that a gentleman of the inns of court and a deep intriguer had some time since worked himself into the sole management and direction of the theater nor is it less notorious that his restless ambition and subtle machinations did manifestly tend to the extirpation of the good old british actors and the introduction of foreign pretenders such as harlequins french dancers and roman singers which though they impoverished the proprietors and imposed on the audience were for some time tolerated by reason of his dextrous insinuations which prevailed upon a few deluded women especially the vizard masks to believe that the stage was in danger but his schemes were soon exposed and the great ones that supported him withdrawing their favor he made his exit and remained for a season in obscurity during this retreat the machiavilian was not idle but secretly fomented divisions and wrought over to his side some of the inferior actors reserving a trap door to himself to which only he had a key this entrance secured this cunning person to complete his company bethought himself of calling in the most eminent of strollers from all parts of the kingdom i have seen them all ranged together behind the scenes but they are many of them persons that never trod the stage before and so very awkward and ungainly that it is impossible to believe the audience will bear them he was looking over his catalogue of plays and indeed picked up a good tolerable set of grave faces for counselors to appear in the famous scene of venice preserved when the danger is over but they being but mere outsides and the actors having a great mind to play the tempest there is not a man of them when he is to perform any thing above dumb show is capable of acting with a good grace so much as the part of trincalo however the master persists in his design and is fitting up the old storm but i am afraid he will not be able to procure able sailors or experienced officers for love or money  besides all this when he comes to cast the parts there is so great a confusion amongst them for want of proper actors that for my part i am wholly discouraged the play with which they design to open is the duke and no duke and they are so put to it that the master himself is to act the conjurer and they have no one for the general but honest george powell  now sir they being so much at a loss for the dramatis personae viz the persons to enact and the whole frame of the house being designed to be altered i desire your opinion whether you think it advisable for me to undertake to prompt em for though i can clash swords when they represent a battle and have yet lungs enough left to huzza their victories i question if i should prompt em right whether they would act accordingly i am  your honors most humble servant j downs p s sir since i writ this i am credibly informed that they design a new house in lincolnsinnfields near the popish chapel to be ready by michaelmas next which indeed is but repairing an old one that has already failed you know the honest man who kept the

book of spencer in which sir scudamore relates the progress of his courtship to amoret under a very beautiful allegory which is one of the most natural and unmixed of any in that most excellent author i shall transprose it to use mr bayss term for the benefit of many english lovers who have by frequent letters desired me to lay down some rules for the conduct of their virtuous amors and shall only premise that by the shield of love  meant a generous constant passion for the person beloved  when the fame says he of this celebrated beauty first flew abroad i went in pursuit of her to the temple of love this temple continues he bore the name of the goddess venus and was seated in a most fruitful island walled by nature against all invaders there was a single bridge that led into the island and before it a castle garrisoned by twenty knights near the castle was an open plain and in the midst of it a pillar on which was hung the shield of love and underneath it in letters of gold was this inscription  happy the man who well can use his bliss whose ever be the shield fair amoret be his my heart panted upon reading the inscription i struck upon the shield with my spear immediately issued forth a knight well mounted and completely armed who without speaking ran fiercely at me i received him as well as i could and by good fortune threw him out of the saddle i encountered the whole twenty successively and leaving them all extended on the plain carried off the shield in token of victory having thus vanquished my rivals i passed on without impediment till i came to the outermost gate of the bridge which i found locked and barred i knocked and called but could get no answer at last i saw one on the other side of the gate who stood peeping through a small crevice this was the porter he had a double face resembling a janus and was continually looking about him as if he mistrusted some sudden danger his name as i afterward learned was doubt over against him sat delay who entertained passengers with some idle story while they lost such opportunities as were never to be recovered as soon as the porter saw my shield he opened the gate but upon my entering delay caught hold of me and would fain have made me listen to her fooleries however i shook her off and passed forward till i came to the second gate the gate of good desert which always stood wide open but in the porch was an hideous giant that stopped the entrance his name was danger many warriors of good reputation not able to bear the sternness of his look went back again cowards fled at the first sight of him except some few who watching their opportunity slipped by him unobserved i prepared to assault him but upon the first sight of my shield he immediately gave way looking back upon him i found his hinder parts much more deformed and terrible than his face hatred murder treason envy and detraction lying in ambush behind him to fall upon the heedless and unwary  i now entered the island of love which appeared in all the beauties of art and nature and feasted every sense with the most agreeable objects amidst a pleasing variety of walks and allies shady seats and flowery banks sunny hills and gloomy valleys were thousands of lovers sitting or walking together in pairs and singing hymns to the deity of the place  i could not forbear envying this happy people who were already in possession of all they could desire while i went forward to the temple the structure was beautiful beyond imagination the gate stood open in the entrance sat a most amiable woman whose name was concord  on either side of her stood two young men both strongly armed as if afraid of each other as i afterward learned they were both her sons but begotten of her by two different fathers their names love and hatred  the lady so well tempered and reconciled them both that she forced them to join hands though i could not but observe that hatred turned aside his face as not able to endure the sight of his younger brother  i at length entered the inmost temple the roof of which was raised upon an hundred marble pillars decked with crowns chains and garlands the ground was strowed with flowers an hundred altars at each of which stood a virgin priestess clothed in white blazed all at once with the sacrifice of lovers who were perpetually sending up their vows to heaven in clouds of incense  in the midst stood the goddess her self upon an altar whose substance was neither gold nor stone but infinitely more precious than either about her neck flew numberless flocks of little loves joys and graces and all about her altar lay scattered heaps of lovers complaining of the disdain pride or treachery of their mistresses one among the rest no longer able to contain his griefs broke out into the following prayer  venus queen of grace and beauty joy of gods and men who with a smile becalmest the seas and renewest all nature goddess whom all the different species in the universe obey with joy and pleasure grant i may at last obtain the object of my vows  the impatient lover pronounced this with great vehemence but i in a soft murmur besought the goddess to lend me her assistance while i was thus praying i chanced to cast my eye on a company of ladies who were assembled together in a corner of the temple waiting for the anthem  the foremost seemed something elder and of a more composed countenance than the rest who all appeared to be under her direction her name was womanhood on one side of her sat shamefacedness with blushes rising in her cheeks and her eyes fixed upon the ground on the other was cheerfulness with a smiling look that infused a secret pleasure into the hearts of all that saw her with these sat modesty holding her hand on her heart courtesy with a graceful aspect and obliging behavior and the two sisters who were always linked together and resembled each other silence and obedience  thus sat they all around in seemly rate and in the midst of them a goodly maid even in the lap of womanhood there sat the which was all in lillywhite arrayed where silver streams among the linen strayed like to the morn when first her shining face has to the gloomy world it self bewrayed that same was fairest amoret in place shining with beautys light and heavenly virtues grace as soon as i beheld the charming amoret my heart throbbed with hopes i stepped to her and seized her hand when womanhood immediately rising up sharply rebuked me for offering in so rude a manner to lay hold on a virgin i excused my self as modestly as i could and at the same time displayed my shield upon which as soon as she beheld the god emblazoned with his bow and shafts she was struck mute and instantly retired  i still held fast the fair amoret and turning my eyes toward the goddess of the place saw that she favored my pretensions with a smile which so emboldened me that i carried off my prize  the maid sometimes with tears sometimes with smiles entreated me to let her go but i led her through the templegate where the goddess concord who had favored my entrance befriended my retreat  this allegory is so natural that it explains it self the persons in it are very artfully described and disposed in proper places the posts assigned to doubt delay and danger are admirable the gate of good desert has something noble and instructive in it but above all i am most pleased with the beautiful grouppe of figures in the corner of the temple among these womanhood is drawn like what the philosophers call an universal nature and is attended with beautiful representatives of all those virtues that are the ornaments of the female sex considered in its natural perfection and innocence  the tatler no     from thursd july   to saturd july      0 grecian coffeehouse july   the learned world are very much offended at many of my ratiocinations and have but a very mean opinion of me as a politician the reason of this is that some erroneously conceive a talent for politics to consist in the regard to a mans own interest but i am of quite another mind and think the first and essential quality toward being a statesman is to have a public spirit one of the gentlemen who are out of humor with me imputes my falling into a way wherein i am so very awkward to a barrenness of invention and has the charity to lay new matter before me for the future he is at the bottom my friend but is at a loss to know whether i am a fool or a physician and is pleased to expostulate with me with relation to the latter he falls heavy upon licentiates and seems to point more particularly at us who are not regularly of the faculty but since he has been so civil to me as to meddle only with those who are employed no further than about mens lives and not reflected upon me as of the astrological sect who concern our selves about lives and fortunes also i am not so much hurt as to stifle any part of his fond letter  sir i am afraid there is something in the suspicions of some people that you begin to be short of matter for your lucubrations though several of them now and then did appear somewhat dull and insipid to me i was always charitably inclined to believe the fault lay in my self and that i wanted the true key to uncipher your mysteries and remember your advertisement upon this account but since i have seen you fall in an unpardonable error yea with a relapse i mean since i have seen you turn politician in the present unhappy dissentions i have begun to stagger and could not choose but lessen the great value i had for the censor of our isle how is it possible that a man whom interest did naturally lead to a constant impartiality in these matters and who has wit enough to judge that his opinion was not like to make many proselytes how is it possible i say that a little passion for i have still too good an opinion of you to think you was bribed by the staggering party could blind you so far as to offend the very better half of the nation and to lessen off so much the number of your friends mr morphew will not have cause to thank you unless you give over and endeavor to regain what you have lost there is still a great many themes you have left untouched such as the ill managements of matters relating to law and physic the setting down rules for knowing the quacks in both professions what a large field is there left in discovering the abuses of the college who had a charter and privileges granted them to hinder the creeping in and prevailing of quacks and pretenders and yet grant licenses to barbers and write letters of recommendation in the country towns out of the reach of their practice in favor of mere boys valuing the health and lives of their countrymen no farther than they get money by them you have said very little or nothing about the dispensation of justice in town and country where clerks are the counselors to their masters  but as i cannot expect that the censor of great britain should publish a letter wherein he is censured with too much reason himself yet i hope you will be the better for it and think upon the themes i have mentioned which must certainly be of greater service to the world your self and mr morphew than to let us know whether you are a whig or a tory i am still  your admirer and servant cato junior   this gentleman and i differ about the words staggering and better part but instead of answering to the particulars of this epistle i shall only acquaint my correspondent that i am at present forming my thoughts upon the foundation of sir scudamores progress in spencer which has led me from all other amusements to consider the state of love in this island and from the corruptions in the government of that to deduce the chief evils of life in the mean time that i am thus employed i have given positive orders to don saltero of chelsea the toothdrawer and dr thomas smith the corncutter of king street westminster who have the modesty to confine their pretensions to manual operations to bring me in with all convenient speed complete lists of all who are but of equal learning with themselves and yet administer physic beyond the feet and gums these advices i shall reserve for my future leisure but have now taken a resolution to dedicate the remaining part of this instant july to the service of the fair sex and have almost finished a scheme for settling the whole remainder of that sex who are unmarried and above the age of twenty five  in order to this good and public service i shall consider the passion of love in its full extent as it is attended both with joys and inquietudes and lay down for the conduct of my lovers such rules as shall banish the cares and heighten the pleasures which flow from that amiable spring of life and happiness there is no less than an absolute necessity that some provision be made to take off the dead stock of women in city town and country let there happen but the least disorder in the streets and in an instant you see the inequality of the numbers of males and females besides that the feminine crowd on such occasions is more numerous in the open way you may observe them also to the very garrets huddled together four at least at a casement add to this that by an exact calculation of all that have come to town by stagecoach or wagon for this twelvemonth last three times in four the treated persons have been males this overstock of beauty for which there are so few bidders calls for an immediate supply of lovers and husbands and i am the studious knight errant who have suffered long nocturnal contemplations to find out methods for the relief of all british females who at present seem to be devoted to involuntary virginity the scheme upon which i design to act i have communicated to none but a beauteous young lady who has for some time left the town in the following letter  to amanda in kent madam i send with this my discourse of ways and means for encouraging marriage and repeopling the island you will soon observe that according to these rules the mean considerations which make beauty and merit cease to be the objects of love and courtship will be fully exploded i have unanswerably proved that jointures and settlements are the bane of happiness and not only so but the ruin even of their fortunes who enter into them i beg of you therefore to come to town upon the receipt of this where i promise you you shall have as many lovers as toasters for there needed nothing but to make mens interests fall in with their inclinations to render you the most courted of your sex as many as love you will now be willing to marry you hasten then and be the honorable mistress of mankind cassander and many others stand in the gate of good descrt to receive you i am  madam your

 0 the intended course of my studies was altered this evening by a visit from an old acquaintance who complained to me mentioning one upon whom he had long depended that he found his labor and perseverance in his patrons service and interests wholly ineffectual and he thought now after his best years were spent in a professed adherence to him and his fortunes he should in the end be forced to break with him and give over all further expectations from him he sighed and ended his discourse by saying you mr censor some time ago gave us your thoughts of the behavior of great men to their creditors this sort of demand upon them for what they invite men to expect is a debt of honor which according to custom they ought to be most careful of paying and would be a very worthy subject for a lucubration  of all men living i think i am the most proper to treat of this matter because in the character and employment of censor i have had encouragement so infinitely above my desert that what i say cannot possibly be supposed to arise from peevishness or any disappointment in that kind which i my self have met with when we consider patrons and their clients those who receive addresses and those who are addressed to it must not be understood that the dependants are such as are worthless in their natures abandoned to any vice or dishonor or such as without a call thrust themselves upon men in power nor when we say patrons do we mean such as have it not in their power or have no obligation to assist their friends but we speak of such leagues where there are power and obligation on the one part and merit and expectation on the other were we to be very particular on this subject i take it that the division of patron and client may include a third part of our nation the want of merit and real worth will strike out about ninety nine in the hundred of these and want of ability in the patron will dispose of as many of that order he who out of mere vanity to be applied to will take up anothers time and fortune in his service where he has no prospect of returning it is as much more unjust as those who took up my friend the upholders goods without paying him for them i say he is much more unjust as our life and time is more valuable than our goods and movables among many whom you see about the great there is a contented wellpleased set who seem to like the attendance for its own sake and are early at the abodes of the powerful out of mere fashion this sort of vanity is as well grounded as if a man should lay aside his own plain suit and dress himself up in a gay livery of another  there are many of this species who exclude others of just expectation and make those proper dependants appear impatient because they are not so cheerful as those who expect nothing i have made use of the pennypost for the instruction of these voluntary slaves and informed them that they will never be provided for but they double their diligence upon admonition will afterday has told his friends that he was to have the next thing these ten years and harry linger has been fourteen within a month of a considerable office however the fantastic complaisance which is paid to them may blind the great from seeing themselves in a just light they must needs if they in the least reflect at some times have a sense of the injustice they do in raising in others a false expectation but this is so common a practice in all the stages of power that there are not more cripples come out of the wars than from the attendance of patrons you see in one a settled melancholy in another a bridled rage a third has lost his memory and a fourth his whole constitution and humor in a word when you see a particular cast of mind or body which looks a little upon the distracted you may be sure the poor gentleman has formerly had great friends for this reason i have thought it a prudent thing to take a nephew of mine out of a ladies service where he was a page and have bound him to a shoemaker  but what of all the humors under the sun is the most pleasant to consider is that you see some men lay as it were a set of acquaintance by them to converse with when they are out of employment who had no effect of their power when they were in here patrons and clients both make the most fantastical figure imaginable friendship indeed is most manifested in adversity but i do not know how to behave my self to a man who thinks me his friend at no other time but that dick reptile of our club had this in his head the other night when he said i am afraid of ill news when i am visited by any of my old friends these patrons are a little like some fine gentlemen who spend all their hours of gaiety with their wenches but when they fall sick will let no one come near them but their wives it seems truth and honor are companions too sober for prosperity it is certainly the most black ingratitude to accept of a mans best endeavors to be pleasing to you and return it with indifference  i am so much of this mind that dick eastcourt the comedian for coming one night to our club though he laughed at us all the time he was there shall have our company at his play on thursday a man of talents is to be favored or never admitted let the ordinary world truck for money and wares but men of spirit and conversation should in every kind do others as much pleasure as they receive from them but men are so taken up with outward forms that they do not consider their actions else how should it be that a man shall deny that to the entreaties and almost tears of an old friend which he shall solicit a new one to accept of i remember when i first came out of staffordshire i had an intimacy with a man of quality in whose gift there fell a very good employment all the town cried there is a thing for mr bickerstaff when to my great astonishment i found my patron had been forced upon twenty artifices to surprise a man with it who never thought of it but sure it is a degree of murder to amuse men with vain hopes if a man takes away anothers life where is the difference whether he does it by taking away the minutes of his time or the drops of his blood but indeed such as have hearts barren of kindness are served accordingly by those whom they employ and pass their lives away with an empty show of civility for love and an insipid intercourse of a commerce in which their affections are no way concerned but on the other side how beautiful is the life of a patron who performs his duty to his inferiors a worthy merchant who employs a crowd of artificers a great lord who is generous and merciful to the several necessities of his tenants a courtier who uses his credit and power for the welfare of his friends these have in their several stations a quick relish of the exquisite pleasure of doing good in a word good patrons are like the guardian angels of plato who are ever busy though unseen in the care of their wards but ill patrons are like the deities of epicurus supine indolent and unconcerned though they see mortals in storms and tempests even while they are offering incense to their power  the tatler no     semper ego auditor tantum  juv from tuesday july    to thursday july       0 grecian coffeehouse july    when i came hither this evening the man of the house delivered me a book very finely bound when i received it i overheard one of the boys whisper another and say it was a fine thing to be a great scholar what a pretty book that is it has indeed a very gay outside and is dedicated to me by a very ingenious gentleman who does not put his name to it the title of it for the work is in latin is epistolarum obscurorum virorum ad dm m ortuinum gratium volumina ii etc the epistles of the obscure writers to ortuinus etc the purpose of the work is signified in the dedication in very elegant language and fine raillery it seems this is a collection of letters which some profound blockheads who lived before our times have written in honor of each other and for their mutual information in each others absurdities they are mostly of the german nation whence from time to time inundations of writers have flowed more pernicious to the learned world than the swarms of goths and vandals to the politic it is methinks wonderful that fellows could be awake and utter such incoherent conceptions and converse with great gravity like learned men without the least taste of knowledge or good sense it would have been an endless labor to have taken any other method of exposing such impertinencies than by an edition of their own works where you see their follies according to the ambition of such virtuosi in a most correct edition  looking over these accomplished labors i could not but reflect upon the immense load of writings which the commonalty of scholars have pushed into the world and the absurdity of parents who educate crowds to spend their time in pursuit of such cold and sprightless endeavors to appear in public it seems therefore a fruitless labor to attempt the correction of the taste of our contemporaries except it was in our power to burn all the senseless labors of our ancestors there is a secret propensity in nature from generation to generation in the blockheads of one age to admire those of another and men of the same imperfections are as great admirers of each other as those of the same abilities  this great mischief of voluminous follies proceeds from a misfortune which happens in all ages that men of barren geniuss but fertile imaginations are bred scholars this may at first appear a paradox but when we consider the talking creatures we meet in public places it will no longer be such ralph shallow is a young fellow that has not by nature any the least propensity to strike into what has not been observed and said every day of his life by others but with that inability of speaking any thing that is uncommon he has a great readiness at what he can speak of and his imagination runs into all the different views of the subject he treats of in a moment if ralph had learning added to the common chitchat of the town he would have been a disputant upon all topics that ever were considered by men of his own genius as for my part i never am teazed by an empty townfellow but i bless my stars that he was not bred a scholar this addition we must consider would have made him capable of maintaining his follies his being in the wrong would have been protected by suitable arguments and when he was hedged in by logical terms and false appearances you must have owned your self convinced before you could then have got rid of him and the shame of his triumph had been added to the pain of his impertinence  there is a sort of littleness in the minds of men of wrong sense which makes them much more insufferable than mere fools and has the further inconvenience of being attended by an endless loquacity for which reason it would be a very proper work if some wellwisher to humane society would consider the terms upon which people meet in public places in order to prevent the unseasonable declamations which we meet with there i remember in my youth it was an humor at the university when a fellow pretended to be more eloquent than ordinary and had formed to himself a plot to gain all our admiration or triumph over us with an argument to either of which he had no manner of call i say in either of these cases it was the humor to shut one eye this whimsical way of taking notice to him of his absurdity has prevented many a man from being a coxcomb if amongst us on such an occasion each man offered a voluntary rhetorician some snuff it would probably produce the same effect as the matter now stands whether a man will or no he is obliged to be informed in whatever another pleases to entertain him with though the preceptor makes these advances out of vanity and not to instruct but insult him  there is no man will allow him who wants courage to be called a soldier but men who want good sense are very frequently not only allowed to be scholars but esteemed for being such at the same time it must be granted that as courage is the natural parts of a soldier so is a good understanding of a scholar such little minds as these whose productions are collected in the volume to which i have the honor to be patron are the instruments for artful men to work with and become popular with the unthinking part of mankind in courts they make transparent flatterers in camps ostentatious bullies in colleges unintelligible pedants and their faculties are used accordingly by those who lead them  when a man who wants judgment is admitted into the conversation of reasonable men he shall remember such improper circumstances and draw such groundless conclusions from their discourse and that with such color of sense as would divide the best set of company that can be got together it is just thus with a fool who has a familiarity with books he shall quote and recite one author against another in such a manner as shall puzzle the best understanding to refute him though the most ordinary capacity may observe that it is only ignorance which makes the intricacy all the true use of that we call learning is to ennoble and improve our natural faculties and not to disguise our imperfections it is therefore in vain for folly to attempt to conceal it self by the refuge of learned languages literature does but make a man more eminently the thing which nature made him and polyglottes had he studied less than he has and writ only in his mother tongue had been known only in great britain for a pedant  mr bickerstaff thanks dorinda and will both answer her letter and take her advice  the tatler no     quale sit id quod amas celeri

first years of this young lady whose story is of consequence only as her life has lately met with passages very uncommon she is now in the twentieth year of her age and owes a strict but cheerful education to the care of an aunt to whom she was recommended by her dying father whose decease was hastened by an inconsolable affliction for the loss of her mother as caelia is the offspring of the most generous passion that has been known in our age she is adorned with as much beauty and grace as the most celebrated of her sex possess but her domestic life moderate fortune and religious educaiton gave her but little opportunity and less inclination to be admired in public assemblies her abode has been for some years a convenient distance from the cathedral of st pauls where her aunt and she chose to reside for the advantage of that rapturous way of devotion which gives ecstasy to the pleasures of innocence and in some measure is the immediate possession of those heavenly enjoyments for which they are addressed  as you may trace the usual thoughts of men in their countenances there appeared in the face of caelia a cheerfulness the constant companion of unaffected virtue and a gladness which is as inseparable from true piety her every look and motion spoke the peaceful mild resigning humble inhabitant that animated her beauteous body her air discovered her body a mere machine of her mind and not that her thoughts were employed in studying graces and attractions for her person such was caelia when she was first seen by palamede at her usual place of worship palamede is a young man of two and twenty wellfashioned learned genteel and discreet the son and heir of a gentleman of a very great estate and himself possessed of a plentiful one by the gift of an uncle he became enamoured with caelia and after having learned her habitation had address enough to communicate his passion and circumstances with such an air of good sense and integrity as soon obtained permission to visit and profess his inclinations toward her palamedes present fortune and future expectations were no way prejudicial to his addresses but after the lovers had passed some time in the agreeable entertainments of a successful courtship caelia one day took occasion to interrupt palamede in the midst of a very pleasing discourse of the happiness he promised himself in so accomplished a companion and assuming a serious air told him there was another heart to be won before he gained hers which was that of his father palamede seemed much disturbed at the overture and lamented to her that his father was one of those too provident parents who only place their thoughts upon bringing riches into their families by marriages and are wholly insensible of all other considerations but the strictness of caelias rules of life made her insist upon this demand and the son at a proper hour communicated to his father the circumstances of his love and the merit of the object the next day the father made her a visit the beauty of her person the fame of her virtue and a certain irresistible charm in her whole behavior on so tender and delicate an occasion wrought so much upon him in spite of all prepossessions that he hastened the marriage with an impatience equal to that of his son their nuptials were celebrated with a privacy suitable to the character and modesty of caelia and from that day till a fatal one of last week they lived together with all the joy and happiness which attend minds entirely united  it should have been intimated that palamede is a student of the temple and usually retired thither early in a morning caelia still sleeping  it happened a few days since that she followed him thither to communicate to him something she had omitted in her redundant fondness to speak of the evening before when she came to his apartment the servant there told her she was coming with a letter to her while caelia in an inner room was reading an apology from her husband that he had been suddenly taken by some of his acquaintance to dine at brentford but that he should return in the evening a country girl decently clad asked if those were not the chambers of mr palamede she was answered they were but that he was not in town the stranger asked when he was expected at home the servant replied she would go in and ask his wife the young woman repeated the word wife and fainted this accident raised no less curiosity when amazement in caelia who caused her to be removed into the inner room upon proper applications to revive her the unhappy young creature returned to her self and said to caelia with an earnest and beseeching tone are you really mr palamedes wife caelia replies i hope i do not look as if i were any other in the condition you see me the stranger answers no madam he is my husband at the same instant she threw a bundle of letters into caelias lap which confirmed the truth of what she asserted their mutual innocence and sorrow made them look at each other as partners in distress rather than rivals in love the superiority of caelias understanding and genius gave her an authority to examine into this adventure as if she had been offended against and the other the delinquent the stranger spoke in the following manner  madam if it shall please you mr palamede having an uncle of a good estate near winchester was bred at the school there to gain the more his good will by being in his sight his uncle died and left him the estate which my husband now has when he was a mere youth he set his affections on me but when he could not gain his ends he married me making me and my mother who is a farmers widow swear we would never tell it upon any account whatsoever for that it would not look well for him to marry such a one as me besides that his father would cut him off of the estate i was glad to have him in an honest way and he now and then came and stayed a night and away at our house but very lately he came down to see us with a fine young gentleman his friend who stayed behind there with us pretending to like the place for the summer but ever since master palamede went he has attempted to abuse me and i ran hither to acquaint him with it and avoid the wicked intentions of his false friend  caelia had no more room for doubt but left her rival in the same agonies she felt her self palamede returns in the evening and finding his wife at his chambers learned all that had passed and hastened to caelias lodgings  it is much easier to imagine than express the sentiments of either the criminal or the injured at this encounter  as soon as palamede had found way for speech he confessed his marriage and his placing his companion on purpose to vitiate his wife that he might break through a marriage made in his nonage and devote his riper and knowing years to caelia she made him no answer but retired to her closet he returned to the temple where he soon after received from her the following letter  sir you who this morning were the best are now the worst of men who beath vital air i am at once overwhelmed with love hatred rage and disdain can infamy and innocence live together i feel the weight of the one too strong for the comfort of the other how bitter heaven how bitter is my portion how much have i to say but the infant which i bear about me stirs with my agitation i am palamede to live in shame and this creature be heir to it farewell for ever   the tatler no     from saturd july    to tuesd july       0 when we revolve in our thoughts such catastrophes as that in the history of the unhappy caelia there seems to be something so hazardous in the changing a single state of life into that of marriage that it may happen all the precautions imaginable are not sufficient to defend a virgin from ruin by her choice it seems a wonderful inconsistence in the distribution of public justice that a man who robs a woman of an earring or a jewel should be punished with death but one who by false arts and insinuations should take from her her very self is only to suffer disgrace this excellent young woman has nothing to consolate her self with but the reflection that her sufferings are not the effect of any guilt or misconduct and has for her protection the influence of a power which amidst the unjust reproach of all mankind can give not only patience but pleasure to innocence in distress  as the person who is the criminal against caelia cannot be sufficiently punished according to our present law so are there numberless unhappy persons without remedy according to present custom that great ill which has prevailed among us in these latter ages is the making even beauty and virtue the purchase of money the generality of parents and some of those of quality instead of looking out for introducing health of constitution frankness of spirit or dignity of countenance into their families lay out all their thoughts upon finding out marches for their estates and not their children you shall have one form a plot for the good of his family that there shall not be six men in england capable of pretending to his daughter a second shall have a son obliged out of mere discretion for fear of doing any thing below himself follow all the drabs in town these sage parents meet and as there is no pass no courtship between the young ones it is no unpleasant observation to behold how they proceed to treaty there is ever in the behavior of each something that denotes his circumstance and honest coupler the conveniencer says he can distinguish upon sight of the parties before they have opened any point of their business which of the two has the daughter to sell coupler is of our club and i have frequently heard him declaim upon this subject and assert that the marriagesettlements which are now used have grown fashionable even within his memory  when the theater in some late reigns owed its chief support to those scenes which were written to put matrimony out of countenance and render that state terrible then was it that pinmoney first prevailed and all the other articles inserted which create a diffidence and intimate to the young people that they are very soon to be in a state of war with each other though this had seldom happened except the fear of it had been expressed coupler will tell you also that jointures were never frequent till the age before his own but the women were contented with the third part of the estate the law allotted them and scorned to engage with men whom they thought capable of abusing their children he has also informed me that those who were the oldest benchers when he came to the temple told him the first marriagesettlement of considerable length was the invention of an old sergeant who took the opportunity of two testy fathers who were ever squabbling to bring about an alliance between their children these fellows knew each other to be knaves and the sergeant took hold of their mutual diffidence for the benefit of the law to extend the settlement to three skins of parchment  to this great benefactor to the profession is owing the present price current of lines and words thus is tenderness thrown out of the question and the great care is what the young couple shall do when they come to hate each other i do not question but from this one humor of settlements might very fairly be deduced not only our present defection in point of morals but also our want of people this has given way to such unreasonable gallantries that a man is hardly reproachable that deceives an innocent woman though she has never so much merit if she is below him in fortune the man has no dishonor following his treachery and her own sex are so debased by force of custom as to say in the case of the woman how could she expect he would marry her  by this means the good offices the pleasures and graces of life are not put into the balance the bridegroom has given his estate out of himself and he has no more left but to follow the blind decree of his fate whether he shall be succeeded by a sot or a man of merit in his fortune on the other side a fine woman who has also a fortune is set up by way of auction her first lover has ten to one against him the very hour after he has opened his heart and his rentroll he is made no other use of but to raise her price she and her friends lose no opportunity of publishing it to call in new bidders while the poor lover very innocently waits till the plenipotentiaries at the inns of court have debated about the alliance all the partisans of the lady throw difficulties in the way till other offers come in and the man who came first is not put in possession till she has been refused by half the town if an abhorrence to such mercenary proceedings were well settled in the minds of my fair readers those of merit would have a way opened to their advancement nay those who abound in wealth only would in reality find their account in it it would not be in the power of their prude acquaintance their waiters their nurses cousins and whisperers to persuade them that there are not above twenty men in a kingdom and those such as perhaps they may never set eyes on whom they can think of with discretion as the case stands now let any one consider how the great heiresses and those to whom they were offered for no other reason but that they could make them suitable settlements live together what can be more insipid if not loathsome than for two persons to be at the head of a crowd who have as little regard for them as they for each other and behold one another in an affected sense of prosperity without the least relish of that exquisite gladness at meeting that sweet inquietude at parting together with the charms of voice look gesture and that general benevolence between well chosen lovers which makes all things please and leaves not the least trifle indifferent  but i am diverted from these sketches for future essays in behalf of my numerous clients of the fair sex by a notice sent to my office in sheerlane that a blooming widow in the third year of her widowhood and twenty six of her age designs to take a colonel of twenty eight the parties request i would draw up their terms of coming together as having a regard to my opinion against long and diffident settlements and i have sens them the following indenture  we john  and mary  having estates for life resolve to take each other i john will venture my life to enrich thee mary and i mary will consult my health to nurse thee john to which we have interchangeably set our hands hearts and seals this   th of july    0 the tatler no  00 from tuesday july    to thursday july  0    0 from my own apartment july    having devoted the greater part of my time to the service of the fair sex i must ask pardon of my men correspondents if i postpone their commands when i have any from the ladies which lie unanswered that which follows is of importance  sir you cannot think it strange if i who know little of the world apply to you for advice in the weighty affair of matrimony since you your self have often declared it to be of that consequence as to require the utmost deliberation without farther preface therefore give me leave to tell you that my father at his death left me a fortune sufficient to make me a march for any gentleman my mother for she is still alive is very pressing with me to marry and i am apt to think to gratify her i shall venture upon one of two gentlemen who at this time make their addresses to me my request is that you would direct me in my choice which that you may the better do i shall give you their characters and to avoid confusion desire you to call them by the names of philander and silvius philander is young and has a good estate silvius is as young and has a better the former has had a liberal education has seen the town is retired from thence to his estate in the country is a man of few words and much given to books the latter was brought up under his fathers eye who gave him just learning enough to enable him to keep his accounts but made him withal very expert in country business such as ploughing sowing buying selling and the like they are both very sober men neither of their persons is disagreeaable nor did i know which to prefer till i had heard them discourse when the conversation of philander so much prevailed as to give him the advantage with me in all other respects my mother pleads strongly for silvius and uses these arguments that he not only has the larger estate at present but by his good husbandry and management increases it daily that his little knowledge in other affairs will make him easy and tractable whereas according to her men of letters know too much to make good husbands to part of this i imagine i answer effectually by saying philanders estate is large enough that they who think  000 l a year sufficient make no difference between that and three i easily believe him less conversant in those affairs the knowledge of which she so much commends in silvius but i think them neither so necessary or becoming in a gentleman as the accomplishments of philander it is no great character of a man to say he rides in his coach and six and understands as much as he who follows his plough add to this that the conversation of these sort of men seems so disagreeable to me that though they may make good bailiffs i can hardly be persuaded they can be good companions it is possible i may seem to have odd notions when i say i am not fond of a man only for being of what is called a thriving temper to conclude i own i am at a loss to conceive how good sense should make a man an ill husband or conversing with books less complaisant  caelia   the resolution which this lady is going to take she may very well say is founded on reason for after the necessities of life are served there is no manner of competition between a man of liberal education and an illiterate men are not altered by their circumstances but as they give them opportunities of exerting what they are in themselves and a powerful clown is a tyrant in the most ugly form he can possibly appear there lies a seeming objection in the thoughtful manner of philander but let her consider which she shall oftener have occasion to wish that philander would speak or silvius hold his tongue  the train of my discourse is prevented by the urgent have of another correspondent  july    mr bickerstaff this comes to you from one of those virgins of twenty five years old and upwards that you like a patron of the distressed promised to provide for who makes it her humble request that no occasional stories or subjects may as they have for three or four of your last days

for  your admirer diana forecast   in this important affair i have not neglected the proposals of others among them is the following sketch of a lottery for persons the author of it has proposed very ample encouragement not only to my self but also to charles lilly and john morphew if the matter bears i shall not be unjust to his merit i only desire to enlarge his plan for which purpose i lay it before the town as well for the improvement as encouragement of it  the amicable contribution for raising the fortunes of ten young ladies imprimis it is proposed to raise  00000 crowns by way of lots which will advance for each lady   00 l which sum together with one of the ladies the gentleman that shall be so happy as to draw a prize provided they both like will be entitled to under such restrictions hereafter mentioned and in case they do not like then either party that refuses shall be entitled to  000 l only and the remainder to him or her that shall be willing to marry the man being first to declare his mind but it is provided that if both parties shall consent to have one another the gentleman shall before he receives the money thus raised settle  000 l of the same in substantial hands who shall be as trustees for the said ladies and shall have the whole and sole disposal of it for her use only  note each party shall have three months time to consider after an interview had which shall be within ten days after the lots are drawn  note also the name and place of abode of the prize shall be placed on a proper ticket  item they shall be ladies that have had a liberal education between fifteen and twenty three all genteel witty and of unblameable characters  the money to be raised shall be kept in an iron box and when there shall be  000 subscriptions which amounts to  00 l it shall be taken out and put into a goldsmiths hands and the note made payable to the proper lady or her assigns with a clause therein to hinder her from receiving it till the fortunate person that draws her shall first sign the note and so on till the whole sum is subscribed for and as soon as  00000 subscriptions are completed and  00 crowns more to pay the charges the lottery shall be drawn at a proper place to be appointed a fortnight before the drawing  note mr bickerstaff objects to the marriageable years here mentioned and is of opinion they should not commence till after twenty three but he appeals to the learned both of warwick lane and bishopsgatestreet on this subject  the tatler no  0  from thursd july  0 to saturd july       0 whites chocolatehouse july    it has been often asserted in these papers that the great source of our wrong pursuits is the impertinent manner with which we treat women both in the common and important circumstances of life in vain do we say the whole sex would run into england while the privileges which are allowed them do no way balance the inconveniences arising from those very immunities our women have very much indulged to them in the participation of our fortunes and our liberty but the errors they commit in the use of either are by no means so impartially considered as the false steps which are made by men in the commerce of lovers the man makes the address assails and betrays and yet stands in the same degree of acceptance as he was in before he committed that treachery the woman for no other crime but believing one whom she thought loved her is treated with shiness and indifference at the best and commonly with reproach and scorn he that is past the power of beauty may talk of this matter with the same unconcern as of any other subject therefore i shall take upon me to consider the sex as they live within rules and as they transgress them the ordinary class of the good or the ill have very little influence upon the actions of others but the eminent in either kind are those who lead the world below them the ill are employed in communicating scandal infamy and disease like furies the good distribute benevolence friendship and health like angels the ill are damped with pain and anguish at the sight of all that is laudable lovely or happy the virtuous are touched with commiseration toward the guilty the disagreeable and the wretched there are those who betray the innocent of their own sex and solicit the lewd of ours there are those who have abandoned the very memory not only of innocence but shame there are those who never forgave nor could ever bear being forgiven there are also who visit the beds of the sick lull the cares of the sorrowful and double the joys of the joyful such is the destroying fiend such the guardian angel woman  the way to have a greater number of the amiable part of womankind and lessen the crowd of the other sort is to contribute what we can to the success of wellgrounded passions and therefore i comply with the request of an enamoured man in inserting the following billet  madam mr bickerstaff you always read though me you will never hear i am obliged therefore to his compassion for the opportunity of imploring yours  i sigh for the most accomplished of her sex that is so just a distinction of her to whom i write that the owning i think so is no distinction of me who write your good qualities are peculiar to you my admiration in common with thousands i shall be present when you read this but fear every woman will take it for her character sooner than she who deserves it   if the next letter which presents it self should come from the mistress of this modest lover and i make them break through the oppression of their passions i shall expect gloves at their nuptials  mr bickerstaff you that are a philosopher know very well the make of the mind of woman and can best iustruct me in the conduct of an affair which highly concerns me i never can admit my lover to speak to me of love yet think him impertinent when he offers to talk of any thing else what shall i do with a man that always believes me it is a strange thing this distance in men of sense why do not they always urge their fate if we are sincere in our severity you lose nothing by attempting if we are hypocrites you certainly succeed   from my own apartment july    before i withdraw from business for the night it is my custom to receive all addresses to me that others may go to rest as well as my self at least as far as i can contribute to it when i called to know if any would speak with me i was informed that mr mills the player desired to be admitted he was so and with much modesty acquainted me as he did other people of note that hamlet was to be acted on wednesday next for his benefit i had long wanted to speak with this person because i thought i could admonish him of many things which would tend to his improvement in the general i observed to him that though action was his business the way to that action was not to study gesture for the behavior would follow the sentiments of the mind  action to the player is what speech is to an orator if the matter be well conceived words will flow with ease and if the actor is well possessed of the nature of his part a proper action will necessarily follow he informed me that wilks was to act hamlet i desired him to request of him in my name that he would wholly forget mr betterton for that he failed in no part of othello but where he had him in view an actors forming himself by the carriage of another is like the trick among the widows who lament their husbands as their neighbors did theirs and not according to their own sentiments of the deceased  there is a fault also in the audience which interrupts their satisfaction very much that is the figuring to themselves the actor in some part wherein they formerly particularly liked him and not attending to the part he is at that time performing thus whatever wilks who is the strictest follower of nature is acting the vulgar spectators turn their thoughts upon sir harry wildair when i had indulged the loquacity of an old man for some time in such loose hints i took my leave of mr mills and was told mr elliot of st jamess coffeehouse would speak with me his business was to desire i would as i am an astrologer let him know beforehand who were to have the benefittickets in the ensuing lottery which knowledge he was of opinion he could turn to great account as he was concerned in news  i granted his request upon an oath of secrecy that he would only make his own use of it and not let it be publicly known till after they were drawn i had not done speaking when he produced to me a plan which he had formed of keeping books with the names of all such adventurers and the numbers of their tickets as should come to him in order to give an hourly account of what tickets shall come up during the whole time of the lottery the drawing of which is to begin on wednesday next i liked his method of disguising the secret i had told him and pronounced him a thriving man who could so well watch the motion of things and profit by a prevailing humor and impatience so aptly as to make his honest industry agreeable to his customers as it is to be the messenger of their good fortune  advertisement from the trumpet in

animus si te non deficit aequus hor from saturd july    to tuesd july       0 from my own apartment july    this afternoon i went to visit a gentleman of my acquaintance at mileend and passing through stepney churchyard i could not forbear entertaining my self with the inscriptions on the tombs and graves among others i observed one with this notable memorial  here lies the body of t b this fantastical desire of being remembered only by the two first letters of a name led me into the contemplation of the vanity and imperfect seize of ambition in general when i run back in my imagination all the men whom i have ever known and conversed with in my whole life there are but very few who have not used their faculties in the pursuit of what it is impossible to acquire or left the possession of what they might have been at their setting out masters to search for it where it was out of their reach in this thought it was not possible to forget the instance of pyrrhus who proposing to himself in discourse with a philosopher one and another and another conquest was asked what he would do after all that then says the king we will make merry he was well answered what hinders your doing that in the condition you are already the restless desire of exerting themselves above the common level of mankind is not to be resisted in some tempers and minds of this make may be observed in every condition of life where such men do not make to themselves or meet with employment the soil of their constitution runs into tares and weeds an old friend of mine who lost a majors post forty years ago and quitted has ever since studied maps encampments retreats and countermarches with no other design but to feed his spleen and illhumour and furnish himself with matter for arguing against all the successful actions of others he that at his first setting out in the world was the gayest man in our regiment ventured his life with alacrity and enjoyed it with satisfaction encouraged men below him and was courted by men above him has been ever since the most froward creature breathing his warm complexion spends it self now only in a general spirit of contradiction for which he watches all occasions and is in his conversation still upon sentry treats all men like enemies with every other impertinence of a speculative warrior  he that observes in himself this natural inquietude should take all imaginable care to put his mind in some method of gratification or he will soon find himself grow into the condition of this disappointed major instead of courting proper occasions to rise above others he will be ever studious of pulling others down to him it being the common refuge of disappointed ambition to ease themselves by detraction it would be no great argument against ambition that there are such mortal things in the disappointment of it but it certainly is a forcible exception that there can be no solid happiness in the success of it if we value popular praise it is in the power of the meanest of the people to disturb us by calumny if the fame of being happy we cannot look into a village but we see crowds in actual possession of what we seek only the appearance to this may be added that there is i know not what malignity in the minds of ordinary men to oppose you in what they see you fond of and it is a certain exception against a mans receiving applause that he visibly courts it however this is not only the passion of great and undertaking spirts but you see it in the lives of such as one would believe were far enough removed from the ways of ambition the rural squires of this nation even eat and drink out of vanity a vainglorious foxhunter shall entertain half a county for the ostentation of his beef and beer without the least affection for any of the crowd about him he feeds them because he thinks it a superiority over them that he does so and they devour him because they know he treats them out of insolence this indeed is ambition in grotesque but may figure to us the condition of politer men whose only pursuit is glory when the superior acts out of a principle of vanity the dependant will be sure to allow it him because he knows it destructive of the very applause which is courted by the man who favors him and consequently makes him nearer himself  but as every man living has more or less of this incentive which makes men impatient of an unactive condition and urges men to attempt what may tend to their reputation it is absolutely necessary they should form to themselves an ambition which is in every mans power to gratify this ambition would be independent and would consist only in acting what to a mans own mind appears most great and laudable it is a pursuit in the power of every man and is only a regular prosecution of what he himself approves it is what can be interrupted by no outward accidents for no man can be robbed of his good intention one of our society of the trumpet therefore started last night a notion which i thought had reason in it it is methinks said he an unreasonable thing that heroic virtue should as it seems to be at present be confined to a certain order of men and be attainable by none but those whom fortune has elevated to the most conspicuous stations i would have every thing to be esteemed as heroic which is great and uncommon in the circumstances in the man who performs it thus there would be no virtue in humane life which every one of the species would not have a pretense to arrive at and an ardency to exert since fortune is not in our power let us be as little as possible in hers why should it be necessary that a man should be rich to be generous if we measured by the quality and not the quantity of things the particulars which accompany an action is what should denominate it mean or great the highest station of humane life is to be attained by each man that pretends to it for every man can be as valiant as generous as wise and as merciful as the faculties and opportunities which he has from heaven and fortune will permit he that can say to himself i do as much good and am as virtuous as my most earnest endeavors will allow me whatever is his station in the world is to himself possessed of the highest honor if ambition is not thus turned it is no other than a continual succession of anxiety and vexation but when it has this cast it invigorates the mind and the consciousness of its own worth is a reward which it is not in the power of envy reproach or detraction to take from it thus the seat of solid honor is in a mans own bosom and no one can want support who is in possession of an honest conscience but he who would suffer the reproaches of it for other greatness  p s i was going on in my philosophy when notice was brought me that there was a great crowd in my antichamber who expected audience when they were admitted i found they all met at my lodgings each coming upon the same errand to know whether they were of the fortunate in the lottery which is now ready to be drawn i was much at a loss how to extricate my self from their importunity but observing the assembly made up of both sexes i signified to them that in this case it would appear fortune is not blind for all the lots would fall upon the wisest and the fairest this gave so general a satisfaction that the room was soon emptied and the company retired with the best air and the most pleasing grace i had any where observed mr elliot of st jamess coffeehouse now stood alone before me and signified to me he had now not only prepared his books but had received a very great subscription already his design was to advertise his subscribers at their respective places of abode within an hour after their number is drawn whether it was a blank or benefit if the adventurer lives within the bills of mortality if he dwells in the country by the next post i encouraged the man in his industry and told him the ready path to good fortune was to believe there was no such thing  the tatler no  0  ut tu fortunam sic nos te celse feremus hor from tuesday july    to thursday july       0 from my own apartment july    it is natural for the imaginations of men who lead their lives in too solitary a manner to prey upon themselves and form from their own conceptions beings and things which have no place in nature this often makes an adept as much at a loss when he comes into the world as a mere savage to avoid therefore that ineptitude for society which is frequently the fault of us scholars and has to men of understanding and breeding something much more shocking and untractable than rusticity it self i take care to visit all public solemnities and go into assemblies as often as my studies will permit this being therefore the first day of the drawing of the lottery i did not neglect spending a considerable time in the crowd but as much a philosopher as i pretend to be i could not but look with a sort of veneration upon the two boys which received the tickets from the wheels as the impartial and equal dispensers of the fortunes which were to be distributed among the crowd who all stood expecting the same chance it seems at first thought very wonderful that one passion should so universally have the preeminence of another in the possession of mens minds as that in this case all in general have a secret hope of the great ticket and yet fear in another instance as in going into a battle shall have so little influence as that though each man believes there will be many thousands slain each is consident he himself shall escape this certainty proceeds from our vanity for every man sees abundance in himself that deserves reward and nothing which should meet with mortification but of all the adventurers that filled the hall there was one who stood by me who i could not but fancy expected the thousand pounds per annum as a mere justice to his parts and industry he had his pencil and table book and was at the drawing of each lot counting how much a man with seven tickets was now nearer the great prize by the striking out another and another competitor this man was of the most particular constitution i had ever observed his passions were so active that he worked in the utmost stretch of hope and fear when one rival fell before him you might see a short gleam of triumph in his countenance which immediately vanished at the approach of another what added to the particularity of this man was that he every moment cast a look either upon the commissioners the wheels or the boys i gently whispered him and asked when he thought the thousand pounds would come up pugh says he who knows that and then looks upon a little list of his own tickets which were pretty high in their numbers and said it would not come this ten days this fellow will have a good chance though not that which he has put his heart on the man is mechanically turned and made for getting the simplicity and eagerness which he is in argues an attention to his point though what he is laboring at does not in the least contribute to it were it not for such honest fellows as these the men who govern the rest of their species would have no tools to work with for the outward show of the world is carried on by such as cannot find out that they are doing nothing i left my man with great reluctance seeing the care he took to observe the whole conduct of the persons concerned and compute the inequality of the chances with his own hands and eyes dear sir said i they must rise early that cheat you ay said he there is nothing like a mans minding his business himself it is very true said i the masters eye makes the horse fat  as it is much the greater number who are to go without prizes it is but very expedient to turn our lecture to the forming just sentiments on the subject of fortune one said this morning that the chief lot he was consident would fall upon some puppy but this gentleman is one of those wrong tempers who approve only the unhappy and have a natural prejudice to the fortunate but as it is certain that there is a great meanness in being attacked to a man purely for his fortune there is no less a meanness in disliking him for his happiness it is the same perverseness under different colors and both these resentments arise from mere pride  the true greatness of mind consists in valuing men apart from their circumstances or according to their behavior in them wealth is a distinction only in traffic but it must not be allowed as a recommendation in any other particular but only just as it is applied it was very prettily said that we may learn the little value of fortune by the persons on whom heaven is pleased to bestow it however there is not a harder part in humane life than becoming wealth and greatness he must be very well stocked with merit who is not willing to draw some superiority over his friends from his fortune for it is not every man that can entertain with the air of a guest and do good offices with the mien of one that receives them  i must confess i cannot conceive how a man can place himself in a figure wherein he can so much enjoy his own soul and that greatest of pleasures the just approbation of his own actions than as an adventurer on this occasion to sit and see the lots go off without hope or fear perfectly unconcerned as to himself but taking part in the good fortune of others  i will believe there are happy tempers in being to whom all the good that arrives to any of their fellow creatures gives a pleasure these live in a course of substantial and lasting happiness and have the satisfaction to see all men endeavor to gratify them this state of mind not only lets a man into certain enjoyments but relieves him from as certain anxieties if you will not rejoice with happy men you must repine at them dick reptile alluded to this when he said he would hate no man out of pure idleness as for my own part i look at fortune quite in another view than the rest of the world and by my knowledge in futurity tremble at the approaching prize which i see coming to a young lady for whom i have much tenderness and have therefore writ her the following letter to be sent by mr elliot with the notice of her ticket  madam you receive at the instant this comes to your hands an account of your having what only you wanted fortune and to admonish you that you may not now want every thing else you had yesterday wit virtue beauty but you never heard of them till to day they say fortune is blind but you will find she has opened the eyes of all your beholders i beseech you madam make use of the advantages of having been educated without flattery if you can still be chloe fortune has indeed been kind to you if you are alered she has it not in her power to give you an equivalent   grecian coffeehouse july    some time ago a virtuoso my very good friend sent me a plan of a covered summerhouse which a little after was rallied by another of my correspondents i cannot therefore defer giving him an opportunity of making his defense to the learned in his own words  to isaac bickerstaff esquire july       0 sir i have been this summer upon a ramble to visit several friends and relations which is the reason i have left you and our ingenious unknown friend of south wales so long in your error concerning the grassplots in my greenhouse i will not give you the particulars of my gardiners conduct in the management of my covered garden but content my self with letting you know that my little fields within doors though by their novelty they appear too extravagant to you to subsist even in a regular imagination are in the effect things that require no conjuration your correspondent may depend upon it that under a sashed roof which lets in the sun at all times and the air as often as is convenient he may have grassplots in the greatest perfection if he will be at the pains to water mow and roll them grass and herbs in general the less they are exposed to the sun and wind the livelier is their verdure they require only warmth and moisture and if you were to see my plots your eye would soon confess that the bowlinggreen at marybone wears not half so bright a livery  the motto with which the gentleman has been pleased to furnish you is so very proper and pleases me so well that i design to have it set upon the front of my greenhouse in letters of gold  i am sir etc   the tatler no  0   gaudent prae nomine molles auriculae   from thursd july    to saturday july       0 from my own apartment july    many are the inconveniences which happen from the improper manner of address in common speech between persons of the same or of different quality among these errors there is none greater than that of the impertinent use of title and a paraphrastical way of saying you i had the curiosity the other day to follow a crowd of people near billingsgate who were conducting a passionate woman who sold fish to a magistrate in order to explain some words which were ill taken by one of her own quality and profession in the public market when she came to make her defense she was so very full of his worship and of if it should please his honor that we could for some time hardly hear any other apology she made for her self than that of attoning for the ill language she had been accused of toward her neighbor by the great civilities she paid to her judge but this extravagance in her sense of doing honor was no more to be wondered at than that her many rings on each finger were worn as instances of finery and dress the vulgar may thus heap and huddle terms of respect and nothing better be expected from them but for people of rank to repeat appellatives insignificantly is a folly not to be endured neither with regard to our times or our understanding it is below the dignity of speech to extend it with more words or phrases than are necessary to explain our selves with elegance and it is methinks an instance of ignorance if not of servitude to be redundant in such expressions  i waited upon a man of quality some mornings ago he happened to be dressing and his shoemaker fitting him told him that if his lordship would please to tread hard or that if his lordship would stamp a little his lordship would find his lordships shoe will fit as easy as any piece of work his lordship should see in england as soon as my lord was dressed a gentleman approached him with a very good air and told him he had an affair which had long depended in the lower courts which through the inadvertency of his ancestors on the one side and the ill arts of their adversaries on the other could not possibly be settled according to the rules of the lower courts that therefore he designed to bring his cause before the house of lords next session where he should be glad if his lordship should happen to be present for he doubted not but his cause would be approved by all men of justice and honor in this place the word lordship was gracefully inserted because it was applied to him in that circumstance wherein his quality was the occasion of the discourse and wherein it was most useful to the one and most honorable to the other  this way is so far from being disrespectful to the honor of nobles that it is an expedien for using them with greater deference i would not put lordship to a mans hat gloves wig or cane but to desire his lordships favor his lordships judgment or his lordships patronage is a manner of speaking which expresses an alliance between his quality and his merit it is this knowledge which distinguished the discourse of the shoemaker from that of the gentleman the highest point of good breeding if any one can hit it is to show a very nice regard to your own dignity and with that in your heart express your value for the man above you  but the silly humor to the contrary has so much prevailed that the slavish addition of title enervates discourse and renders the application of it almost ridiculous we writers of diurnals are nearer in our styles to that of common talk than any other writers by which means we use words of respect sometimes very unfortunately the postman who is one of the most celebrated of our fraternity fell into this misfortune yesterday in his paragraph from berlin of july    count wartemberg says he great chamberlain and chief minister of this court who on monday lest accompanied the king of prussia to oranienburg was taken so very ill the  wednesday has life was despaired of and we had a report that his excellency was dead  i humbly presume that it slattens the narration to say his excellency in a case which is common to all men except you would infer what is not to be inferred to wit that the author designed to say all wherein he excelled others was departed from him  were distinctions used according to the rules of reason and sense those additions to mens names would be as they were first intended significant of their worth and not their persons so that in some cases it might be proper to say the man is dead but his excellency will never die it is methinks very unjust to laugh at a quaker because he has taken up a resolution to treat you with a word the most expressive of complaisance that can be thought of and with an air of good nature and charity calls you friend i say it is very unjust to rally him for this term to a stranger when you your selves in all your phrases of distinction confound phrases of honor into no use at all  tom courtly who is the pink of courtesy is an

aug      0 from my own apartment july    nature has implanted in us two very strong desires hunger for the preservation of the individual and lust for the support of the species or to speak more intelligibly the former to continue our own persons and the latter to introduce others into the world according as men behave themselves with regard to these appetites they are above or below the beasts of the field which are incited by them without choice or reflection but reasonable creatures correct these incentives and improve them into elegant motives of friendship and society it is chiefly from this homely foundation that we are under the necessity of seeking for the agreeable companion and the honorable mistress by this cultivation of art and reason our wants are made pleasures and the gratification of our desires under proper restrictions a work no way below our noblest faculties the wisest man may maintain his character and yet consider in what manner he shall best entertain his friend or divert his mistress nay it is so far from being a derogation to him that he can in o other instances show so true a taste of his life or his fortune what concerns one of the bovementioned appetites as it is elevated into love i shall have abundant occasion to discourse of before i have provided for the numberless crowd of damsels i have proposed to take care of the subject therefore of the present paper shall be that part of society which owes its beginning to the common necessity of hunger when this is considered as the support of our being we may take in under the same head thirst also otherwise when we are pursuing the glutton the drunkard may make his escape the true choice of our diet and our companions at it seems to consist in that which contributes most to cheerfulness and refreshment and these certainly are best consulted by simplicity in the food and sincerity in the company by this rule are in the first place excluded from pretense to happiness all meals of state and ceremony which are performed in dumb show and greedy sullenness at the boards of the great they say you shall have a number attending with as good habits and countenances as the guests which only circumstance must destroy the whole pleasure of the repast for if such attendants are introduced for the dignity of their appearance modest minds are shocked by considering them as spectators or else look upon them as equals for whose servitude they are in a kind of suffering it may be here added that the sumptuous sideboard to an ingenious eye has often more the air of an altar than a table the next absurd way of enjoying our selves at meals is where the bottle is plied without being called for where humor takes place of appetite and the good company are too dull or too merry to know any enjoyment in their senses  though this part of time is absolutely necessar to sustain life it must be also considered tha life it self is to the endless being of man b what a meal is to this life not valuable for  self but for the purposes of it if there be an truth in this the expense of many hours the way is somewhat unaccountable and placing much thought either in too great sumptuousness and elegance in this matter or wallowing in noise and riot at it are both though not equally unaccountable i have often considered these different people with very great attention and always speak of them with the distinction of the eaters and the swallowers the eaters sacrifice all their senses and understanding to this appetite the swallowers hurry themselves out of both without pleasing this or any other appetite at all the latter are improved brutes the former degenerated men i have sometimes thought it would not be improper to add to my dead and living men persons in an intermediate state of humanity under the appellation of dozers the dozers are a sect who instead of keeping their appetites in subjection live in subjection to them nay they are so truly slaves to them that they keep at too great a distance ever to come into their presence within my own acquaintance i know those that i dare say have forgot that they ever were hungry and are no less utter strangers to thirst and weariness who are beholden to sauces for their food and to their food for their weariness  i have often wondered confidering the excellent and choice spirits that we have among our divines that they do not think of putting vicious habits into a more contemptible and unlovely figure than they do at present so many men of wit and spirit as there are in sacred orders have it in their power to make the fashion of their side the leaders in humane society are more effectually prevailed upon this way than can easily be imagined i have more than one in my thoughts at this time capable of doing this against all the opposition of the most witty as well as the most voluptuous there may possibly be more acceptable subjects but sure there are none more useful it is visible that though mens fortunes circumstances and pleasures give them prepossessions too strong to regard any mention either of punishments or rewards they will listen to what makes them inconsiderable or mean in the imaginations of others and by degrees in their own  it is certain such topics are to be touched upon in the light we mean only by men of the most consummate prudence as well as excellent wit for these discourses are to be made if made to run into example before such as have their thoughts more intent upon the propriety than the reason of the discourse what indeed leads me into this way of thinking is that the last thing i read was a sermon of the learned dr south upon the ways of pleasantness this admirable discourse was made at court where the preacher was too wise a man not to believe the greatest argument in that place against the pleasures then in vogue must be that they lost greater pleasures by prosecuting the course they were in the charming discourse has in it whatever wit and wisdom can put together this gentleman has a talent of making all his faculties bear to the great end of his hallowed profession happy genius he is the better man for being a wit the best way to praise this author is to quote him and i think i may defy any man to say a greater thing of him or his ability than that there are no paragraphs in the whole discourse i speak of below these which follow  after having recommended the satisfaction of the mind and the pleasure of conscience he proceeds  an ennobling property of it is that it is such a pleasure as never satiates or wearies for it properly affects the spirit and a spirit feels no weariness as being privileged from the causes of it but can the epicure say so of any of the pleasures he so much dotes upon do they not expire while they satisfy and after a few minutes refreshment determine in loathing and unquietness how short is the interval between a pleasure and a burden how undiscernable the transition from one to the other pleasure dwells no longer upon the appetie than the necessities of nature which are quickly and easily provided for and then all that follows is a load and an oppression every morsel to a satisfied hunger is only a new labor to a tired digestion every draught to him that has quenched his thirst is but a further quenching of nature and a provision for rheum and diseases a drowning of the quickness and activity of the spirits  he that prolongs his meals and sacrifices his time as well as his other conveniences to his luxury how quickly does he outsit his pleasure and then how is all the following time bestowed upon ceremony and surfeit till at length after a long fatigue of eating and drinking and babbling he concludes the great work of dining genteely and so makes a shift to rise from table that he may lie down upon his bed where after he has slept himself into some use of himself by much ado he staggers to his table again and there acts over the same brutish scene so that he passes his whole life in a dozed condition between sleeping and waking with a kind of drowsiness and confusion upon his senses which what pleasure it can be is hard to conceive all that is of it dwells upon the tip of his tongue and within the compass of his palate a worthy prize for a man to purchase with the loss of his time his reason and himself  the tatler no  0  metiri se quemque suo module ac pede verum est hor from tuesday aug   to thursday aug      0 from my own apartment august   the general purposes of men in the conduct of their lives i mean with relation to this life only end in gaining either the affection or the esteem of those with whom the converse esteem makes a man powerful in business and affection desirable in conversation which is certainly the reason that very agreeabl men fail of their point in the world and thos who are by no means such arrive at it with much ease if it be visible in a mans carriage that h has a strong passion to please no one is much a a loss how to keep measures with him because there is always a balance in peoples hands  make up with him by giving him what he  wants in exchange for what you think fit to de him such a person asks with diffidence  ever leaves room for denial by that softness  his complexion at the same time he himse is capable of denying nothing even what he  not able to perform the other sort of man w courts esteem having a quite different view  as different a behavior and acts as much by  dictates of his reason as the other does by  impulse of his inclination you must pay  every thing you have of him he consid mankind as a people in commerce and ne gives out out of himself what he is sure will  come in with interest from another all  words and actions tend to the advancement of his reputation and of his fortune toward which he makes hourly progress because he lavishes no part of his good will upon such as do not make some advances to merit it the man who values affection sometimes becomes popular he who aims at esteem seldom falls of growing rich  thus far we have looked at these different men as persons who endeavor to be valued and beloved from design or ambition but they appear in quite another figure when you observe the men who are agreeable and venerable from the force of their natural inclinations we affect the company of him who has least regard of himself in his carriage who throws himself into unguarded gaiety voluntary mirth and general good humor who has nothing in his head but the present hour and seems to have all his interests and passions gratified if every man else in the room is as unconcerned as himself this man usually has no quality or character among his companions let him be born of whom he will have what great qualities he please let him be capable of assuming for a moment what figures he pleases he still dwells in the imagination of all who know him but as jack such a one this makes jack brighten up the room wherever he enters and change the severity of the company into that gaiety and good humor into which his conversation generally leads them it is not unpleasant to observe even this sort of creature go out of his character to check himself sometimes for his familiarities and pretend so aukwardly at procuring to himself more esteem than he finds he meets with i was the other day walking with jack gainly toward lincolnsinnwalks we met a fellow who is a lower officer where jack is in the direction jack cries to him so how is it mr  he answers mr gainly i am glad to see yo well this expression of equality gave m friend a pang which appeared in a flush of hi countenance prithee jack says i do not b angry at the man for do what you will the man can only love you be contented with the image the man has of thee for if thou aimes at any other it must be hatred or contempt i went on and told him lookee jack i have heard thee sometimes talk like an oracle for half an hour with the sentiments of a roman the closeness of a schoolman and the integrity of a divine but then jack while i admired thee it was upon topics which did not concern thy self and where the greatness of the subject added to thy being personally unconcerned in it created all that was great in thy discourse i did not mind his being a little out of humor but comforted him by giving him several instances of men of our acquaintance who had no one quality in any eminence that were much more esteemed than he was with very many but the thing is if your character is to give pleasure men will consider you only in that light and not in those acts which turn to esteem and veneration  when i think of jack gainly i cannot but reflect also upon his sister gatty she is young witty pleasant innocent this is her natural character but when she observes any one admired for what they call a fine woman she i all the next day womanly prudent observing and virtuous she is every moment asked in her prudential behavior whether she is not well upon which she as often answers in a fret do people think one must be always romping always a jackpudding i never fail to enquire o her if my lady such a one that awful beauty was not at the play last night she knows the connection between that question and her chang of humor and says it would be very well if some people would examine into themselves as much as they do into others or sure there is nothing in the world so ridiculous as an amorous old man  as i was saying there is a class which every man is in by his post in nature from which it is impossible for him to withdraw to another and become it therefore it is necessary that each should be contented with it and not endeavor at any progress out of that tract to follow nature is the only agreeable course which is what i would fain inculcate to those jarring companions flavia and lucia they are mother and daughter flavia who is the mamma has all the charms and desires of youth still about her and not much turned of thirty lucia is blooming and amorous and but a little above fifteen the mother looks very much younger than she is the girl very much elder if it were possible to fix the girl to her sick bed and preserve the portion the use of which the mother partakes the good widow flavia would certainly do it but for fear of lucias escape the mother is forced to be constantly attended with a rival that explains her age and draws off the eyes of her admirers the jest is they can never be together in strangers company but lucy is eternally reprimanded for something very particular in her behavior for which she has the malice to say she hopes she shall always obey her parents she carried her passion and jealousy to that height the other day that coming suddenly into the room and surprising colonel lofty speaking rapture on one knee to her mother she clapped down by him and asked her blessing  i do not know whether it is so proper to tell family occurrences of this nature but we every day see the same thing happen in the public conversation in the world men cannot be contented with what is laudable but they must have all that is laudable this affectation is what destroys the familiar man into pretenses to take state upon him and the contrary character to the folly of aiming at being winning and complaisant but in these cases men may easily lay aside what they are but can never arrive at what they are not  as to the pursuits after affection and esteem the fair sex are happy in this particular that with them the one is much more nearly related to the other than in men the love of a woman is inseparable from some esteem of her and as she is naturally the object of affection the woman who has your esteem has also some degree of your love a man that dotes on a woman for her beauty will whisper his friend that creature has a great deal of wit when you are well acquainted with her and if you examine the bottom of your esteem for a woman you will find you have a greater opinion of her beauty than any body else as to us men i design to pass most of my time with the facetious harry bickerstaff but william bickerstaff the most prudent man of our family shall be my executor  the tatler no  0  from thursd aug   to saturd aug      0 from my own apartment august   having yesterday morning received a paper of latin verses written with much elegance in honor of these my papers and being informed at the same time that they were composed by a youth under age i read them with much delight as an instance of his improvement there is not a greater pleasure to old age than seeing young people entertain themselves in such a manner as that we can partake of their enjoyments on such occasions we flatter our selves that we are not quite laid aside in the world but that we are either used with gratitude for what we were or honored for what we are a well inclined young man and whose good breeding is founded upon the principles of nature and virtue must needs take delight in being agreeable to his elders as we are truly delighted when we are not the jest of them when i say this i must confess i cannot but think it a very lamentable thing that there should be a necessity for making that a rule of life which should be methinks a mere instinct of nature if reflection upon a man in poverty whom we once knew in riches is an argument of commiseration with generous minds sure old age which is a decay from that vigor which the young possess and must certainly if not prevented against their will arrive at should be more forcibly the object of that reverence which honest spirits are inclined to from a sense of being themselves liable to what they observe has already overtaken others  my three nephews whom in june last was twelvemonth i disposed of according to their several capacities and inclinations the first to the university the second to a merchant and the third to a woman of quality as her page by my invitation dined with me to day it is my custom often when i have a mind to give my self a more than ordinary cheerfulness to invite a certain young gentlewoman of our neighborhood to make one of the company she did me that favor this day the presence of a beautiful woman of honor to minds which are not trivially disposed displays an alacrity which is not to be communicated by any other object it was not unpleasant to me to look into her thoughts of the company she was in she smiled at the party of pleasure i had thought of for her which was composed of an old man and three boys my scholar my citizen and my self were very soon neglected and the young courtier by the bow he made to her at her entrance engaged her observation without a rival i observed the oxonian not a little discomposed at this preference while the trader kept his eye upon his uncle my nephew will had a thousand secret resolutions to break in upon the discourse of his younger brother who gave my fair companion a full account of the fashion and what was reckoned most becoming to this complexion and what sort of habit appeared best upon the other shape he proceeded to acquaint her who of quality was well or sick within the bills of mortality and named very familiarly all his ladys acquaintance not forgetting her very words when he spoke of their characters besides all this he had a road of flattery and upon her enquiring what sort of woman lady lovely was in her person really madam says the jackanapes she is exactly of your height and shape but as you are fair she is a brown woman there was no enduring that this fop should outshine us all at this unmerciful rate therefore i thought fit to talk to my young scholar concerning his studies and because i would throw his learning into present service i desired him to repeat to me the translation he had made of some tender verses in theocritus he did so with an air of elegance peculiar to the college to which i sent him i made some exceptions to the turn of the phrases which he defended with much modesty as believing in that place the matter was rather to consult the softness of a swains passion than the strength of his expressions it soon appeared that will had outstripped his brother in the opinion of our young lady a little poetry to one who is bred a scholar has the same effect that a good carriage of his person has on one who is to live in courts the favor of women is so natural a passion that i envied both the boys their success in the approbation of my guest and i thought the only person invulnerable was my young trader during the whole meal i could observe in the children a mutual contempt and scorn of each other arising from their different way of life and education and took that occasion to advertise them of such growing distasts which might mislead them in their future life and disappoint their friends as well as themselves of the advantages which might be expected from the diversity of their professions and interests  the prejudices which are growing up between these brothers from the different ways of education are what create the most fatal misunderstandings in life but all distinctions of disparagement merely from our circumstances are such as will not bear the examination of reason the courtier the trader and the scholar should all have an equal pretension to the denomination of a gentleman that tradesman who deals with me in a commodity which i do not understand with uprightness has much more right to that character than the courtier who gives me false hopes or the scholar who laughs at my ignorance  the appellation of gentleman is never to be affixed to a mans circumstances but to his behavior in them for this reason i shall ever as far as i am able give my nephews such impressions as shall make them value themselves rather as they are useful to others than as they are conscious of merit in themselves there are no qualities from which we ought to pretend to the esteem of others but such as render us serviceable to them for free men have no superiors but benefactors i was going on like a true old fellow to this purpose to my guests when i received the following epistle  sir i have yours with notice of a benefitticket of  00 l per annum both enclosed by mr elliot who had my numbers for that purpose your philosophic advice came very seasonably to me with that good fortune but i must be so sincere with you as to acknowledge i owe my present moderation more to my own folly than your wisdom you will think this strange till i inform you that i had fixed my thoughts upon the  000 l a year and had with that expectation laid down so many agreeable plans for my behavior toward my new lovers and old friends that i have received this favor of fortune with an air of disappointment this is interpreted by all who know not the springs of my heart as a wonderful piece of humility i hope my present state of mind will grow into that but i confess my conduct to be now owing to another cause however i know you will approve my taking hold even of imperfections to find my way toward virtue which is so feeble in us at the best that we are often beholden to our faults for the first appearances of it i am  sir your most humble servant chloe   the tatler no  0  si dixeris aestuo sudat  juv from saturd august   to tuesd august      0 from my own apartment august   an old acquaintanc who met me this morning seemed overjoyed to see me and told me i looked as well as he had known me do these forty years but continued he not quite the man you were when we visited together at lady brightlys oh isaac those days are over do you think there are any such fine creatures now living as we then conversed with he went on with a thousand incoherent circumstances which in his imagination must needs please me but they had the quite contrary effect the flattery with which he began in telling me how well i wore was not disagreeable but his indiscreet mention of a set of acquaintance we had outlived recalled ten thousand things to my memory which made me reflect upon my present condition with regret had he indeed been so kind as after a long absence to felicitate me upon an indolent and easy old age and mentioned how much he and i had to thank for who at our time of day could walk firmly eat heartily and converse cheerfully he had kept up my pleasure in my self but of all mankind there are none so shocking as these injudicious civil people they ordinarily begin upon something that they know must be a satisfaction but then for fear of the imputation of flattery they follow it with the last thing in the world of which you would be reminded it is this that perplexes civil persons the reason that there is such a general outcry amongst us against flatterers is that there are so very few good ones it is the nicest art in this life and is a part of eloquence which does not want the preparation that is necessary to all other parts of it that your audience should be your wellwishers for praise from an enemy is the most pleasing of all commendations  it is generally to be observed that the person most agreeable to a man for a constancy is he that has no shining qualities but is a certain degree above great imperfections whom he can live with as his inferior and who will either overlook or not observe his little defects such an easy companion as this either now and then throws out a little flattery or lets a man silently flatter himself in his superiority to him if you take notice there is hardly a rich man in the world who has not such a led friend of small consideration who is a darling for his insignificancy it is a great ease to have one in our own shape a species below us and who without being listed in our service is by nature of our retinue these dependants are of excellent use on a rainy day or when a man has not a mind to dress or to exclude solitude when one has neither a mind to that or to company there are of this goodnatured order who are so kind as to divide themselves and do these good offices to many five or six of them visit a whole quarter of the town and exclude the spleen without fees from the families they frequent if they do not prescribe physic they can be company when you take it very great benefactors to the rich or those whom they call people at their ease are your persons of no consequence i have known some of them by the help of a little cunning make delicious flatterers they know the course of the town and the general characters of persons by this means they will sometimes tell the most agreeable falsehoods imaginable they will acquaint you that such a one of a quite contrary party said that though you were engaged in different interests yet he had the greatest respect for your good sense and address when one of these has a little cunning he passes his time in the utmost satisfaction to himself and his friends for his position is never to report or speak a displeasing thing to his friend as for letting him go on in an error he knows advice against them is the office of persons of greater talents and less discretion  the latin word for a flatterer assentator implies no more than a person that barely consents and indeed such a one if a man were able to purchase or maintain him cannot be bought too dear such a one never contradicts you but gains upon you not by a fulsom way of commending you in broad terms but liking whatever you propose or utter at the same time is ready to beg your pardon and gainsay you if you chance to speak ill of your self an old lady is very seldom without such a companion as this who can recite the names of all her lovers and the matches refused by her in the days when she minded such vanities as she is pleased to call them though she so much approves the mention of them it is to be noted that a womans flatterer is generally older than her self her years serving at once to recommend her patronesss age and to add weight to her complaisance in all other particulars  we gentlemen of small fortunes are extremely necessitous in this particular i have indeed one who smokes with me often but his parts are so low that all the incense he does me is to fill his pipe with me and to be out at just as many whiffs as i take this is all the praise or assent that he is capable of yet there are more hours when i would rather be in his company than that of the brightest man i know it would be an hard matter to give an account of this inclination to be flattered but if we go to the bottom of it we shall find that the pleasure in it is something like that of receiving money which lay out every man thinks he has an estate of reputation and is glad to see one that will bring any of it home to him it is no matter how dirty a bag it is conveyed to him in or by how clownish a messenger so the money is good all that we want to be pleased with flattery is to believe that the man is sincere who gives it us it is by this one accident that absurd creatures often outrun the more skilful in this art their want of ability is here an advantage and their bluntness as it is the seeming effect of sincerity is the best cover to artifice  terence introduces a flatterer talking to a coxcomb whom he cheats out of a livelihood and a third person on the stage makes on him this pleasant remark this fellow has an art of making fools madmen the love of flattery is indeed sometimes the weakness of a great mind but you see it also in persons who otherwise discover no manner of relish of any thing above mere sensuality these latter it sometimes improves but always debases the former a fool is in himself the object of pity till he is flattered by the force of that his stupidity is raised into affectation and he becomes of dignity enough to be ridiculous i remember a drole that upon ones saying the times are so ticklish that there must great care be taken what one says in conversation answered with an air of surliness and honesty if people will be free let them be so in the manner that i am who never abuse a man but to his face he had no reputation for saying dangerous truths therefore when it was repeated you abuse a man but to his face yes says he i flatter him  it is indeed the greatest of injuries to flatter any but the unhappy or such as are displeased with themselves for some infirmity in this latter case we have a member of our club that when sir jeffery falls asleep wakens him with snoring this makes sir jeffery hold up for some moments the longer to see there are men younger than himself among us who are more lethargick than he is  when flattery is practiced upon any other consideration it is the most abject thing in nature nay i cannot think of any character below the flatterer except he that envies him you meet with fellows prepared to be as mean as possible in their condescentions and expressions but they want persons and talents to rise up to such a baseness as a coxcomb is a fool of parts so is a flatterer a knave of parts  the best of this order that i know is one who disguises it under a spirit of contradiction or reproof he told an errant driveler the other day that he did not care for being in company with him because he heard he turned his absent friends into ridicule and upon lady autumns disputing with him about something that happened at the revolution he replied with a very angry tone pray madam give me leave to know more of a thing in which i was actually concerned than you who were then in your nurses arms  the tatler no  0  from tuesd august   to thursd august  0    0 from my own apartment august   anoble painter who has an ambition to draw an historypiece has desired of me to give him a subject on which he may show the utmost force of his art and genius for this purpose i have pitched upon that remarkable incident between alexander the great and his physician this prince in the midst of his conquests in persia was seized by a violent fever and according to the account we have of his vast mind his thoughts were more employed about his recovery as it regarded the war than as it concerned his own life he professed a slow method was worse than death to him because it was what he more dreaded an interruption of his glory he desired a dangerous so it might be a speedy remedy during this impatience of the king it is well known that darius had offered an immense sum to any who should take away his life but philippus the most esteemed and most knowing of his physicians promised that within three days time he would prepare a medicine for him which should restore him more expeditiously than could be imagined immediately after this engagement alexander receives a letter from the most considerable of his captains with intelligence that darius had bribed philippus to poison him every circumstance imaginable favored this suspicion but this monarch who did nothing but in an extraordinary manner concealed the letter and while the medicine was preparing spent all his thoughts upon his behavior in this important incident from his long soliloquy he came to this resolution  alexander must not lie here alive to be oppressed by his enemy i will not believe my physician guilty or i will perish rather by his guilt than my own diffidence  at the appointed hour philippus enters with the potion one cannot but form to ones self on occasion the encounter of their eyes the resolution in those of the patient and the benevolence in the countenance of the physician the hero raised himself in his bed and holding the letter in one hand and the potion in the other drank the medicine it will exercise my friends pencil and brain to place this action in its proper beauty a prince observing the features of a suspected traitor after having drank the poison he offered him is a circumstance so full of passion that it will require the highest strength of his imagination to conceive it much more to express it but as painting is eloquence and poetry in mechanism i shall raise his ideas by reading with him the finest draughts of the passions concerned in this circumstance from the most excellent poets and orators the confidence which alexander assumes from the air of philippuss face as he is reading his accusation and the generous disdain which is to rise in the features of a falsely accused man are principally to be regarded in this particular he must heighten his thoughts by reflecting that he is not drawing only an innocent man traduced but a man zealously affected to his person and safety full of resentment for being thought false how shall we contrive to express the highest admiration mingled with disdain how shall we in strokes of a pencil say what philippus did to his prince on this occasion sir my life never depended on yours more than it does now without knowing this secret i prepared the potion which you have taken as what concerned philippus no less than alexander and there is nothing new in this adventure but that it makes me still more admire the generosity and confidence of my master alexander took him by the hand and said  philippus i am confident you had rather i had any other way to have manifested the faith i have in you than a case which so nearly concerns me and in gratitude i now assure you i am anxious for the effect of your medicine more for your sake than my own  my painter is employed by a man of sense and wealth to furnish him a gallery and i shall join with my friend in the designing part it is the great use of pictures to raise in our minds either agreeable ideas of our absent friends or high images of eminent personages but the latter design is methinks carried on in a very improper way for to fill a room full of battlepieces pompous histories of sieges and a tall hero alone in a crowd of insignificant figures about him is of no consequence to private men but to place before our eyes great and illustrious men in those parts and circumstances of life wherein their behavior may have an effect upon our minds as being such as we partake with them merely as they were men such as these i say may be just and useful ornaments of an elegant apartment in this collection therefore that we are making we will not have the battles but the sentiments of alexander the affair we were just now talking of has circumstances of the highest nature and yet their grandeur has little to do with his fortune if by observing such a piece as that of his taking a bowl of poison with so much magnanimity a man the next time he has a fit of the spleen is less froward to his friend or his servants thus far is some improvement  i have frequently thought that if we had many draughts which were historical of certain passions and had the true figure of the great men we see transported by them it would be of the most solid advantage imaginable to consider this mighty man on one occasion administer to the wants of a poor soldier benumbed with cold with the greatest humanity at another barbarously stabbing a faithful officer at one time so generously chaste and virtuous as to give his captive statira her liberty at another burning a town at the instigation of thais this sort of changes in the same person are what would be more beneficial lessons of morality than the several revolutions in a great mans fortune there are but one or two in an age to whom the pompous incidents of his life can be exemplary but i or any man may be as sick as goodnatured as compassionate and as angry as alexander the great my purpose in all this chat is that so excellent a furniture may not for the future have so romantic a turn but allude to incidents which come within the fortunes of the ordinary race of men i do not know but it is by the force of this senseless custom that people are drawn in postures they would not for half they are worth be surprised in the unparalleled firceness of some rural squires drawn in red or in armor who never dreamed to destroy any thing above a fox is a common and ordinary offense of this kind but i shall give an account of our whole gallery on another occasion  the tatler no   0 from thursd aug  0 to saturd aug       0 sheerlane august  0 i did my self the honor this day to make a visit to a lady of quality who is one of those who are ever railing at the vices of the age but mean only one vice because it is the only vice they are not guilty of she went so far as to fall foul on a young woman who has had imputations but whether they were just or not no one knows but her self however that is she is in her present behavior modest humble pious and discreet i thought it became me to bring this censorious lady to reason and let her see she was a much more vicious woman than the person she spoke of  madam said i you are very severe to this poor young woman for a trespass which i believe heaven has forgiven her and for which you see she is for ever out of countenance nay mr bickerstaff she interrupted if you at this time of day contradict people of virtue and stand up for ill women  no no madam said i not so fast she is reclaimed and i fear you never will be nay nay madam do not be in a passion but let me tell you what you are you are indeed as good as your neighbors but that is being very bad you are a woman at the head of a family and lead a perfect town ladys life you go on your own way and consult nothing but your glass what imperfections indeed you see there you immediately mend as fast as you can you may do the same by the faults i tell you of for they are much more in your power to correct  you are to know then that you visiting ladies that carry your virtue from house to house with so much prattle in each others applause and triumph over other peoples faults i grant you have but the speculation of vice in your own conversations but promote the practice of it in all others you have to do with  as for you madam your time passes away in dressing eating sleeping and praying when you rise in morning i grant you an hour spent very well but you come out to dress in so froward a humor that the poor girl who attends you curses her very being in that she is your servant for the peevish things you say to her when this poor creature is put into a way that good or evil are regarded but as they relieve her from the hours she has and must pass with you the next you have to do with is your coachman and footmen they convey your ladyship to church while you are praying there they are cursing swearing and drinking in an alehouse during the time also which your ladyship sets apart for heaven you are to know that your cook is sweating and fretting in preparation for your dinner soon after your meal you make visits and the whole world that belongs to you speaks all the ill of you which you are repeating of others you see madam whatever way you go all about you are in a very broad one the morality of these people it is your proper business to enquire into and till you reform them you had best let your equals alone otherwise if i allow you you are not vicious you must allow me you are not virtuous  i took my leave and received at my coming home the following letter  mr bickerstaff i have lived a pure and undefiled virgin these twenty seven years and i assure you it is with great grief and sorrow of heart i tell you that i become weary and impatient of the derision of the gigglers of our sex who call me old maid and tell me i shall lead apes if you are truly a patron of the distressed and an adept in astrology you will advise whether i shall or ought to be prevailed upon by the impertinencies of my own sex to give way to the importunities of yours i assure you i am surrounded with both though at present a forlorn  i am etc   i must defer my answer to this lady out of a point of chronology she says she has been twenty seven years a maid but i fear according to a common error she dates her virginity from her birth which is a very erroneous method for a woman of twenty is no more to be thought chaste so many years than a man of that age can be said to have been so long valiant we must not allow people the favor of a virtue till they have been under the temptation to the contrary a woman is not a maid till her birthday as we call it of her fifteenth year my plaintiff is therefore desired to inform me whether she is at present in her twenty eighth or forty third year and she shall be dispatched accordingly  st jamess coffeehouse august    a merchant came hither this morning and read a letter from a correspondent of his at milan it was dated of the  th instant n s the following is an abstract of it on the   th of the last month five thousand men were on their march in the lampourdan under the command of general wesell having received orders from his catholic majesty to join him in his camp with all possible expedition the duke of anjou soon had intelligence of their motion and took a resolution to decamp in order to intercept them within a days march of our army the king of spain was apprehensive the enemy might make such a movement and commanded general stanhope with a body of horse consisting of fourteen squadrons to observe their course and prevent their passage over the rivers segra and noguera between larida and balaguer it happened to be the first day that officer had appeared abroad after a dangerous and violent fever but he received the kings commands on this occasion with a joy which surmounted his present weakness and on the   th of last month came up with the enemy on the plains of balaguer the duke of anjous rearguard consisting of twenty six squadrons that general sent intelligence of their posture to the king and desired his majestys orders to attack them during the time which he waited for his instructions he made his disposition for the charge which was to divide themselves into three bodies one to be commanded by himself in the center a body on the right by count maurice of nassau and the third on the left by the earl of rochford upon the receipt of his majestys direction to attack the enemy the general himself charged with the utmost vigor and resolution while the earl of rochford and count maurice extended themselves on his right and left to prevent the advantage the enemy might make of the superiority of their numbers what appears to have misled the enemys general in this affair was that it was not supposed practicable that the confederates would attack him till they had received a reinforcement for this reason he pursued his march without facing about till we were actually coming on to engagement general stanhopes disposition made it impracticable to do it at that time count maurice and the earl of rochford attacking them in the instant in which they were forming themselves the charge was made with the greatest gallantry and the enemy very soon put into so great disorder that their whole cavalry were commanded to support their rearguard upon the advance of this reinforcement all the horse of the king of spain were come up to sustain general stanhope insomuch that the battle improved to a general engagement of the cavalry of both armies after a warm dispute for some time it ended in the utter defeat of all the duke of anjous horse upon the dispatch of these advices that prince was retiring toward lerida we have no account of any considerable loss on our side except that both those heroic youths the earl of rochford and count nassau fell in this action they were you know both sons of persons who had a great place in the confidence of your late king william and i doubt not but their deaths will endear their families which were ennobled by him in your nation general stanhope has been reported by the enemy dead of his wounds but he received only a slight contusion on the shoulder  p s we acknowledge you here a mighty brave people but you are said to love quarrelling so well that you cannot be quiet at home the favorers of the house of bourbon among us affirm that this stanhope who could as it were get out of his sick bed to fight against their king of spain must be of the antimonarchical party  the tatler no      nequeo monstrare and sentio tantum juv from saturd aug    to tuesd aug       0 sunday august    if there were no other consequence of it but barely that humane creatures on this day assemble themselves before their creator without regard to their usual employments their minds at leisure from the cares of this life and their bodies adorned with the best attire they can bestow on them i say were this mere outward celebration of a sabbath all that is expected from men even that were a laudable distinction and a purpose worthy the humane nature but when there is added to it the sublime pleasure of devotion our being is exalted above it self and he who spends a seventh day in the contemplation of the next life will not easily fall into the corruptions of this in the other six they who never admit thoughts of this kind into their imagination lose higher and sweeter satisfactions than can be raised by any other entertainment the most illiterate man who is touched with devotion and uses frequent exercises of it contracts a certain greatness of mind mingled with a noble simplicity that raises him above those of the same condition and there is an indelible mark of goodness in those who sincerely possess it it is hardly possible it should be otherwise for the fervours of a pious mind will naturally contract such an earnestness and attention toward a better being as will make the ordinary passages of life go off with a becoming indifference by this a man in the lowest condition will not appear mean or in the most splendid fortune insolent  as to all the intricacies and vicissitudes under which men are ordinarily entangled with the utmost sorrow and passion one who is devoted to heaven when he falls into such difficulties is led by a clue through a labyrinth as to this world he does not pretend to skill in the mazes of it but fixes his thoughts upon one certainty that he shall soon be out of it and we may ask very boldly what can be a more sure consolation than to have an hope in death when men are arrived at thinking of their very dissolution with pleasure how few things are there that can be terrible to them certainly nothing can be dreadful to such spirits but what would make death terrible to them falsehood toward man or impiety toward heaven to such as these as there are certainly many such the gratifications of innocent pleasures are doubled even with reflections upon their imperfection the disappointments which naturally attend the great promises we make our selves in expected enjoyments strike no damp upon such men but only quicken their hopes of soon knowing joys which are too pure to admit of allay or satiety  it is thought among the politer part of mankind an imperfection to want a relish of any of those things which refine our lives this is the foundation of the acceptance which eloquence music and poetry make in the world and i know not why devotion considered merely as an exaltation of our happiness should not at leas be so far regarded as to be considered it is possible the very enquiry would lead men into suc thoughts and gratifications as they did not expect to meet with in this place many a goo acquaintance has been lost from a general prepossession in his disfavour and a severe aspect has often hid under it a very agreeable companion  there are no distinguishing qualities among men to which there are not false pretenders but though none is more pretended to than that of devotion there are perhaps fewer successful impostors in this kind than any other there is something so natively great and good in a person that is truly devout that an awkward man may as well pretend to be genteel as an hypocrite to be pious the constraint in words and actions are equally visible in both cases and any thing set up in their room does but remove the endeavourers the further off their pretensions but however the sense of true piety is abated there is no other motive of action that can carry us through all the vicissitudes of life with alacrity and resolution but piety like philosophy when it is superficial does but make men appear the worse for it and a principle that is but half received does but distract instead of guiding our behavior when i reflect upon the unequal conduct of lotius i see many things that run directly counter to his interest therefore i cannot attribute his labors for the public good to ambition when i consider his disregard to his fortune i cannot esteem him covetous how then can i reconcile his neglect of himself and his zeal for others i have long suspected him to be a little pious but no man ever hid his vice with greater caution than he does his virtue it was the praise of a great roman that he had rather be than appear good but such is the weakness of lotius that i dare say he had rather be esteemed irreligious than devout by i know not what impatience of railery he is wonderfully fearful of being thought oo great a believer a hundred little devices are made use of to hide a time of private devotion and he will allow you any suspicion of his being ill employed so you do not tax him with being well but alas how mean is such a behavior to boast of virtue is a most ridiculous way of disappointing the merit of it but not so pitiful as that of being ashamed of it how unhappy is the wretch who makes the most absolute and independent motive of action the cause of perplexity and inconstancy how much another figure does caelicola make with all who know him his great and superior mind frequently exalted by the raptures of heavenly meditation is to all his friends of the same use as if an angel were to appear at the decision of their disputes they very well understand he is as much disinterested and unbiased as such a being he considers all applications made to him as those addresses will effect his own application to heaven all his determinations are delivered with a beautiful humility and he pronounces his decisions with the air of one who is more frequently a supplicant than a judge  thus humble and thus great is the man who is moved by piety and exalted by devotion but behold this recommended by the masterly hand of a great divine i have heretofore made bold with  it is such a pleasure as can never cloy or overwork the mind a delight that grows and improves under thought and reflection and while it exercises does also endear it self to the mind all pleasure that affect the body must needs weary because they transport and all transportation is a violence and no violence can be lasting but determines upon the falling of the spirits which are not able to keep up that height of motion that the pleasure of the senses raises them to and therefore how inevitably does an immoderate laughter end in a sigh which is only natures recovering it self after a force done to it but the religious pleasure of a welldisposed mind moves gently and therefore constantly it does not effect by rapture and ecstasy but is like the pleasure of health greater and stronger than those that call up the senses with grosser and more affecting impressions no mans body is as strong as his appetites but heaven has corrected the boundlesness of his voluptuous desires by stinting his strengths and contracting his capacities  the pleasure of the religious man is an easy and a portable pleasure such an one as he carries about in his bosom without alarming either the eye or envy of the world a man putting all his pleasure into this one is like a traveller putting all his goods into one jewel the value is the same and the convenience greater the tatler no     from tuesday aug    to thursday aug       0 from my own apartment aug    i have had much importunity to answer the following letter  mr bickerstaff reading over a volume of yours i find the words simplex munditiis mentioned as a description of a very well dressed woman i beg of you for the sake of the sex to explain these terms i cannot comprehend what my brother means when he tells me they signify my own name which is  sir your humble servant plain english   i think the ladys brother has given us a very good idea of that elegant expression it being the greatest beauty of speech to be close and intelligible to this end nothing is to be more carefully consulted than plainness in a ladys attire this is the single excellence for to be what some call fine is the same vice in that case as to be florid is in writing or speaking i have studied and writ on this important subject till i almost despair of making a reformation in the females of this island where we have more beauty than in any spot in the universe if we did not disguise it by false garniture and detract from it by impertinent improvements i have by me a treatise concerning pinners which i have some hopes will contribute to the amendment of the present headdresses to which i have solid and unanswerable objections but most of the errors in that and other particulars of adorning the head are crept into the world from the ignorance of modern tirewomen for it is come to that pass that an awkward creature in the first year of her apprenticeship that can hardly stick a pin shall take upon her to dress a woman of the first quality however it is certain that there requires in a good tirewoman a perfect skill in optics for all the force of ornament is to contribute to the intention of the eyes thus she who has a mind to look killing must arm her face accordingly and not leave her eyes and cheeks undressed ther is araminta so sensible of this that she never will see even her own husband without a hood on can any one living bear to see miss gruel lean as she is with her hair tied back after the modern way but such is the folly of our ladies that because one who is a beauty out of ostentation of her being such takes care to wear something that she knows cannot be of any consequence to her complexion i say our women run on so heedlesly in the fashion that though it is the interest of some to hide as much of their faces as possible yet because a leading toast appeared with a backward headdress the rest shall follow the mode without observing that the author of the fashion assumed it because it could become no one but her self  flavia is ever well dressed and always the gentilest woman you meet but the make of her mind very much contributes to the ornament of her body she has the greatest simplicity of manners of any of her sex this makes every thing look native about her and her clothes are so exactly fitted that they appear as it were part of her person every one that sees her knows her to be of quality but her distinction is owing to her manner and not to her habit her beauty is full of attraction but not of allurement there is such a composure in her looks and propriety in her dress that you would think it impossible she should change the garb you one day see her in for any thing so becoming till you next day see her in another there is no other mystery in this but that however she is apparelled she is her self the same for there is so immediate a relation between our thoughts and gestures that a woman must think well to look well  but this weighty subject i must put off for some other matters in which my correspondents are urgent for answers which i shall do where i can and appeal to the judgment of others where i cannot  august       0 mr bickerstaff taking the air the other day on horseback in the green lane that leads to southgate i discovered coming toward me a person well mounted in a mask and i accordingly expected as any one would to have been robbed but when we came up with each other the spark to my greater surprise very peaceably gave me the way which made me take courage enough to ask him if he masqueraded or how he made me no answer but still continued incognito this was certainly an ass in a lions skin a harmless bullbeggar who delights to fright innocent people and set them a gallopping i bethought my self of putting as good a jest upon him and had turned my horse with a design to pursue him to london and get him apprehended on suspicion of being a highwayman but when i reflected that twas the proper office of the magistrate to punish only knaves and that we had a censor of great britain for people of another denomination i immediately determined to prosecute him in your court only this unjustifiable frolic i take to be neither wit nor humor therefore hope you will do me and as many others as were that day frighted justice i am  sir your friend and servant j l   sir the gentleman begs your pardon and frighted you out of fear of frighting you for he is just come out of the smallpox   mr bickerstaff your distinction concerning the time of commencing virgins is allowed to be just i write you my thanks for it in the twenty eighth year of my life and twelfth of my virginity but i am to ask you another question may a woman be said to live any more years a maid than she continues to be courted  i am etc   aug       0 sir i observe that the postman of saturday last giving an account of the action in spain has this elegant turn of expression general stanhope who in the whole action expressed as much bravery as conduct received a contusion in his right shoulder i should be glad to know whether this cautious politician means to commend or to rally him by saying he expressed as much bravery as conduct if you can explain this dubious pharase it will inform the public and oblige  sir your humble servant etc   the tatler no     from thursd aug    to saturd aug       0 sheerlane august    there has of late crept in among the downright english a mighty spirit of dissimulation but before we discourse of this vice it will be necessary to observe that the learned make a difference between simulation and dissimulation simulation is a pretense of what is not and dissimulation a concealment of what is the latter is our present affair when you look round you in public places in this island you see the generality of mankind carry in their countenance an air of challenge or defiance and there is no such man to be found among us who naturally strives to do greater honors and civilities than he receives this innate sullenness or stubborness of complexion is hardly to be conquered by any of our islanders for which reason however they may pretend to choose one another they make but very awkward rogues and their dislike to each other is seldom so well dissembled but it is suspected when once it is so it had as good be professed a man who dissembles well must have none of what we call stomach otherwise he will be cold in his professions of good will where he hates an imperfection of the last ill consequence in business this fierceness in our natures is apparent from the conduct of our young fellows who are not got into the schemes and arts of life which the children of this world walk by one would think that of course when a man of any consequence for his figure his mien or his gravity passes by a youth he should certainly have the first advances of salutation but he is you may observe treated in a quite different manner it being the very characteristick of an english temper to defy as i am an englishman i find it a very hard matter to bring my self to pull off the hat first but it is the only way to be upon any good terms with those we meet with therefore the first advance is of high moment men judge of others by themselves and he that will command with us must condescend it moves ones spleen very agreeably to see fellows pretend to be dissemblers without this lesson they are so reservedly complaisant till they have learned to resign their natural passions that all the steps they make toward gaining those whom they would be well with are but so many marks of what they really are and not of what they would appear  the rough britains when they pretend to be artful toward one another are ridiculous enough but when they set up for vices they have not and dissemble their good with an affectation of ill they are insupportable i know two men in this town who make as good figures as any in it that manage their credit so well

justice to another i insert it at large  garraways coffeehouse august  0 mr bickerstaff i have lately read your paper wherein you represent a conversation between a young lady your three nephews and your self and am not a little offended at the figure you give your young merchant in the presence of a beauty the topic of love is a subject on which a man is more beholden to nature for his eloquence than to the instruction of the schools or my ladys woman from the two latter your scholar and page must have reaped all their advantage above him  i know by this time you have pronounced me a trader i acknowledge it but cannot bear the exclusion from any pretense of speaking agreeably to a fine woman or from any degree of generosity that way you have among us citizens many wellwishers but it is for the justice of your representations which we perhaps are better judges of than you by the account you give of your nephew seem to allow  to give you an opportunity of making us some reparation i desire you would tell your own way the following instance of heroic love in the city you are to remember that somewhere in your writings for enlarging the territories of virtue and honor you have multiplied the opportunities of attaining to heroic virtue and have hinted that in whatever state of life a man is if he does things above what is ordinarily performed by men of his rank he is in those instances an hero  tom trueman a young gentleman of eighteen years of age fell passionately in love with the beauteous almira daughter to his master her regard for him was no less tender trueman was better acquainted with his masters affairs than his daughter and secretly lamented that each day brought him by many miscarriages nearer bankrupcy than the former this unhappy posture of their affairs the youth suspected was owing to the ill management of a factor in whom his master had an entire confidence trueman took a proper occasion when his master was ruminating on his decaying fortune to address him for leave to spend the remainder of his time with his foreign correspondent during three years stay in that employment he became acquainted with all that concerned his master and by his great address in the management of that knowledge saved him ten thousand pounds soon after this accident truemans uncle left him a considerable estate upon receiving that advice he returned to england and demanded almira of her father the father over joyd at the match offered him the  0000 l he had saved him with the further proposal of resigning to him all his business trueman refused both and retired into the country with his bride contented with his own fortune though perfectly skilled in all the methods of improving it  it is to be noted that trueman refused twenty thousand pounds with another young lady so that reckoning both his selfdenials he is to have in your court the merit of having given  0000 l for the woman he loved this gentleman i claim your justice to and

in every party there are two sorts of men the rigid and the supple the rigid are an intractable race of mortals who act upon principle and will not forsooth fall into any measures that are not consistent with their received notions of honor these are persons of a stubborn unpliant morality that sullenly adhere to their friends when they are disgraced and to their principles though they are exploded i shall therefore give up this stiffnecked generation to their own obstinacy and turn my thoughts to the advantage of the supple who pay their homage to places and not persons and without enslaving themselves to any particular scheme of opinions are as ready to change their conduct in point of sentiment as of fashion the welldisciplined part of a court are generally so perfect at their exercise that you may see a whole assembly from front to rear face about at once to a new man of power though at the same time they turn their backs upon him that brought them thither the great hardship these complaisant members of society are under seems to be the want of warning upon any approaching change or revolution so that they are obliged in a hurry to tack about with every wind and stop short in the midst of a full career to the great surprise and derision of their beholders  when a man foresees a decaying ministry he has leisure to grow a malecontent reflect upon the present conduct and by gradual murmurs fall off from his friends into a new party by just steps and measures for want of such notices i have formerly known a very wellbred person refuse to return a bow of a man whom he thought in disgrace that was next day made secretary of state and another who after a long neglect of a minister came to his levee and made professions of zeal for his service the very day before he was turned out  this produces also unavoidable confusions and mistakes in the descriptions of great mens parts and merits that ancient lyrick mr durfey some years ago writ a dedication to a certain lord in which he celebrated him for the greatest poet and critic of that age upon a misinformation in dyers letter that his noble patron was made lord chamberlain in short innumerable votes speeches and sermons have been thrown away and turned to no account merely for want of due and timely intelligence nay it has been known that a panegyric has been half printed off when the poet upon the removal of the minister has been forced to alter it into a satyr  for the conduct therefore of such useful persons as are ready to do their country service upon all occasions i have an engine in my study which is a sort of a political barometer or to speak more intelligibly a state weatherglass that by the rising and falling of a certain magical liquor presages all changes and revolutions in government as the common glass does those of the weather this weatherglass is said to have been invented by cardan and given by him as a present to his great countryman and contemporary machiavel which by the way may serve to rectify a received error in chronology that places one of these some years after the other how or when it came into my hands i shall desire to be excused if i keep to my self but so it is that i have walked by it for the better part of a century to my safety at least if not to my advantage and have among my papers a register of all the changes that have happened in it from the middle of queen elizabeths reign  in the time of that princess it stood long at settled fair at the latter end of king james the first it fell to cloudy it held several years after at stormy insomuch that at last despairing of seeing any clear weather at home i followed the royal exile and some time after finding my glass rise returned to my native country with the rest of the loyalists i was then in hopes to pass the remainder of my days in settled fair but alas during the greatest part of that reign the english nation lay in a dead calm which as it is usual was followed by high winds and tempests till of late years in which with unspeakable joy and satisfaction i have seen our political weather returned to settled fair i must only observe that for all this last summer my glass has pointed at changeable upon the whole i often apply to fortune aenaeass speech to the sybil   non ulla laborum o virgo nova mi facies inopinave surgit omnia praecepi atque animo mecum ante peregi the advantages which have accured to those whom i have advised in their affairs by virtue of this sort of praescience have been very considerable a nephew of mine who has never put his money into the stocks or taken it out without my advice has in a few years raised five hundred pounds to almost so many thousands as for my self who look upon riches to consist rather in content than possessions and measure the greatness of the mind rather by its tranquillity than its ambition i have seldom used my glass to make my way in the world but often to retire from it this is a bypath to happiness which was first discovered to me by a most pleasing apothegm of pythagoras when the winds says he rise worship the echo that great philosopher whether to make his doctrines the more venerable or to guild his precepts with the beauty of imagination or to awaken the curiosity of his disciples for i will not suppose what is usually said that he did it to conceal his wisdom from the vulgar has couched several admirable precepts in remote allusions and mysterious sentences by the winds in this apothegm are meant statehurricanes and popular tumults when these arise says he worship the echo that is

from my own apartment august    lysander has writ to me out of the country and tells me after many other circumstances that he had passed a great deal of time with much pleasure and tranquillity till his happiness was interrupted by an indiscreet flatterer who came down into those parts to visit a relation with the circumstances in which he represents the matter he had no small provocation to be offended for he attacked him in so wrong a season that he could not have any relish of pleasure in it though perhaps at another time it might have passed upon him without giving him much uneasiness lysander had after a long satiety of the town been so happy as to get to a solitude he extremely liked and recovered a pleasure he had long discontinued that of reading he was got to the bank of a rivulet covered by a pleasing shade and fanned by a soft breeze which threw his mind into that sort of composure and attention in which a man though with indolence enjoys the utmost liveliness of his spirits and the greatest strength of his mind at the same time in this state lysander represents that he was reading virgils georgicks when on a sudden the gentleman abovementioned surprised him and without any manner of preparation falls upon him at once what i have found you out at last after searching all over the wood we wanted you at cards after dinner but you are much better employed i have heard indeed that you are an excellent scholar but at the same time is it not a little unkind to rob the ladies who like you so well of the pleasure of your company but that is indeed the misfortune of you great scholars you are seldom so fit for the world as those who never trouble themselves with books well i see you are taken up with your learning there and i will leave you lysander says he made him no answer but took a resolution to complain to me  it is a substantial affliction when men govern themselves by the rules of good breeding that by the very force of them they are subjected to the insolence of those who either never will or never can understand them the superficial part of mankind form to themselves little measures of behavior from the outside of things by the force of these narrow conceptions they act amongst themselves with applause and do not apprehend they are contemptible to those of higher understanding who are restrained by decencies above their knowledge from showing a dislike hence it is that because complaisance is a good quality in conversation one impertinent takes upon him on all occasions to commend and because mirth is agreeable another thinks fit eternally to jest i have of late received many packets of letters complaining of these spreading evils a lady who is lately arrived at the bath acquaints me there was in the stagecoach wherein she went down a common flatterer and a common jester these gentlemen were she tells me rivals in her favor and adds if there ever happened a case wherein of two persons one was not liked more than another it was in that journey they differed only in proportion to the degree of dislike between the nauseous and the insipid both these characters of men are born out of a barrenness of imagination they are never fools by nature but become such out of an impotent ambition of being what she never intended them men of wit and conversation i therefore think fit to declare that according to the known laws of this land a man may be a very honest gentleman and enjoy himself and his friend without being a wit and i absolve all men from taking pains to be such for the future as the present case stands is it not very unhappy that lysander must be attacked and applauded in a wood and corinna jolted and commended in a stagecoach and this for no manner of reason but because other people have a mind to show their parts i grant indeed if these people as they have understanding enough for it would confine their accomplishments to those of their own degree of talents it were to be tolerated but when they are so insolent as to interrupt the meditations of the wise the conversations of the agreeable and the whole behavior of the modest it becomes a grievance naturally in my jurisdiction among themselves i cannot only overlook but approve it i was present the other day at a conversation where a man of this height of breeding and sense told a young woman of the same form to be sure madam every thing must please that comes from a lady she answered i know sir you are so much a gentleman that you think so why this is very well on both sides and it is impossible that such a gentleman and lady should do other than think well of one another these are but loose hints of the disturbances in humane society of which there is yet no remedy but i shall in a little time publish tables of respect and civility by which persons may be instructed in the proper times and seasons as well as at what degree of intimacy a man may be allowed to commend or rally his companions the promiscuous license of which is at present far from being among the small errors in conversation  p s the following letter was left with a request to be immediately answered lest the artifices used against a lady in distress may come into common practice  sir my elder sister buried her husband about six months ago and at his funeral a gentleman of more art than honesty on the night of his interrment while she was not her self but in the utmost agony of her grief spoke to her of the subject of love in that weakness and distractio which my sister was in as one ready to fall is ap to lean on any body he obtained her promise of marriage which was accordingly consummated eleve weeks after there is no affliction comes alone bu one brings another my sister is now ready to liei she humbly asks of you as you are a friend to the sex to let her know who is the lawful father of thi child or whether she may not be relieved from thi second marriage considering it was promised under such circumstances as one may very well suppose she did not what she did voluntarily but because s was helpless otherwise she is advised somethin about engagements made in gaol which she thin the same as to the reason of the thing but dea sir she relies upon your advice and gives you h service as does  your humble servant rebecca midriff   the case is very hard and i fear the plea she is advised to make from the similitude of a man who is in duresse will not prevail but though i despair of remedy as to the mother the law gives the child his choice of his father where the birth is thus legally ambiguous  to isaac bickerstaff esquire the humble petition of the company of linendrapers residing within the liberty of westminster shows that there has of late prevailed among the ladies so great an affectation of nakedness that

addere pondus  from thursd aug    to saturd aug       0 from my own apartment aug    nature is full of wonders every atom is a standing miracle and endowed with such qualities as could not be impressed on it by a power and wisdom less than infinite for this reason i would not discourage any searches that are made into the most minute and trivial parts of the creation however since the world abounds in the noblest fields of speculation it is methinks the mark of a little genius to be wholly conversant among insects reptiles animalcules and those trifling rarities that furnish out the apartment of a virtuoso  there are some men whose heads are so odly turned this way that though they are utter strangers to the common occurrences of life they are able to discover the sex of a cockle or describe the generation of a mite in all its circumstances they are so little versed in the world that they scarce know a horse from an ox but at the same time will tell you with a great deal of gravity that a flea is a rhinoceros and a snail an hermaphrodite i have known one of these whimsical philosophers who has set a greater value upon a collection of spiders than he would upon a collection of spiders than he would upon a flock of sheep and has sold his coat off his back to purchase a tarantula  i would not have a scholar wholly unacquainted with these secrets and curiosities of nature but certainly the mind of man that is capable of so much higher contemplations should not be altogether fixed upon such mean and disproportioned objects observations of this kind are apt to alienate us too much from the knowledge of the world and to make us serious upon trifles by which means they expose philosophy to the ridicule of the witty and contempt of the ignorant in short studies of this nature should be the diversions relaxations and amusements not the care business and concern of life  it is indeed wonderful to consider that there should be a sort of learned men who are wholly employed in gathering together the refuse of nature if i may call it so and hoarding up in their chests and cabinets such creatures as others industriously avoid the sight of one does not know how to mention some of the most precious parts of their treasure without a kind of an apology for it i have been shown a beetle valued at twenty crowns and a toad at an hundred but we must take this for a general rule that whatever appears trivial or obscene in the common notions of the world looks grave and philosophical in the eye of a virtuoso  to show this humor in its perfection i shall

counterfeits for such are abroad  the tatler no     atque does atque astra vocat crudelia matter  from saturd aug    to tuesd aug       0 from my own apartment aug    as i was passing by a neighbors house this morning i overheard the wife of the family speak things to her husband which gave me much disturbance and put me in mind of a character which i wonder i have so long omitted and that is an outrageous species of the fair sex which is distinguished by the term scolds the generality of women are by nature loquacious therefore mere volubility of speech is not to be imputed to them but should be considered with pleasure when it is used to express such passions as tend to sweeten or adorn conversation but when through rage females are vehement in their eloquence nothing in the world has so ill an effect upon the features for by the force of it i have seen the most amiable become the most deformed and she that appeared one of the graces immediately turned into one of the furies i humbly conceive the great cause of this evil may proceed from a false notion the ladies have of what we call a modest woman they have too narrow a conception of this lovely character and believe they have not at all forfeited their pretensions to it provided they have no imputations on their chastity but alas the young fellows know they pick out better women in the sideboxes than many of those who pass upon the world and themselves for modest  modesty never rages never murmurs never pouts when it is ill treated it pines it beseeches it languishes the neighbor i mention is one of your common modest women that is to say those as are ordinarily reckoned such her husband knows every pain in life with her but jealousy now because she is clear in this particular the man cannot say his souls his own but she cries no modest woman is respected now adays what adds to the comedy in this case is that it is very ordinary with this sort of women to talk in the language of distress they will complain of the forlorn wretchedness of their condition and then the poor helpless creatures shall throw the next thing they can lay their hands on at the person who offends them our neighbor was only saying to his wife she went a little too fine when she immediately pulled his periwig off and stamping it under her feet wrung her hands and said never modest woman was so used these ladies of irresistible modesty are those who make virtue unamiable not that they can be said to be virtuous but as they live without scandal and being under the common denomination of being such men fear to meet their faults in those who are as agreeable as they are innocent  i take the bully among men and the scold among women to draw the foundation of their actions from the same defect in the mind a bully thinks honor consists wholly in being brave and therefore has regard to no one rule of life if he preserves himself from the accusation of cowardice the froward woman knows chastity to be the first merit in a woman and therefore since no one can call her one ugly name she calls all mankind all the rest  these ladies where their companions are so imprudent as to take their speeches for any other than exercises of their own lungs and their husbands patience gain by the force of being resisted and flame with open fury which is no way to be opposed but by being neglected though at the same time humane frailty makes it very hard to relish the philosophy of contemning even frivolous reproach there is a very pretty instance of this infirmity in the man of the best sense that ever was no less a person than adam himself according to miltons description of the first couple as soon as they had fallen and the turbulent passions of anger hatred and jealousy first entered their breasts adam grew moody and talked to his wife as you may find it in the    th page and  th book of paradise lest in the octave edition which out of heroicks and put into domestic style would run thus  madam if my advice had been of any authority with you when that strange desire of gadding possessed you this morning we had still been happy but your cursed vanity and opinion of your own conduct which is certainly very wavering when it seeks occasions of being proved has ruined both your self and me who trusted you  eve had no fan in her hand to ruffle or tucker to pull down but with a reproachful air she answered  sir do you impute that to my desire of gadding which might have happened to your self with all your wisdom and gravity the serpent spoke so excellently and with so good a grace that  besides what harm had i ever done him that he should design me any was i to have been always at your side i might as well have continued there and been but your rib still but if i was so weak a creature as you thought me why did you not interpose your sage authority more absolutely you denied me going as faintly as you say i resisted the serpent had not you been too easy neither you or i had now transgressed  adam replied why eve have thou the impudence to upbraid me as the cause of thy transgression for my indulgence to thee thus it will ever be with him who trusts too much to woman at the same time that she refuses to be governed if she suffers by her ostinacy she will accuse the man that shall leave her to her self  thus they in mutual accusation spent the fruitless hours but neither self condemning and of their vain contest appeared no end this to the modern will appear but a very faint piece of conjugal enmity but you are to consider that they were but just begun to be angry and they wanted new words for expressing their new passions but her accusing him of letting her go and telling him how good a speaker and how fine a gentleman the devil was we must reckon allowing for the improvements of time that she gave him the same provocation as if she had called him cuckold the passionate and familiar terms with which the same case repeated daily for so many thousand years has furnished the present generation were not then in use but the foundation of debate has ever been the same a contention about their merit and wisdom our general mother was a beauty and hearing there was another now in the world could not forbear as adam tells her showing her self though to the devil by whom the same vanity made her liable to be betrayed  i cannot with all the help of science and astrology find any other remedy for this evil but what was the medicine in this first quarrel which was as appeared in the next book that they were convinced of their being both weak but one weaker than the other  if it were possible that the beauteous could but rage a little before a glass and see their pretty countenances grow wild it is not to be doubted but it would have a very good effect but that would require temper for lady firebrand upon observing her features swell when her maid vexed her the other day stamped her dressingglass under her feet in this case when one of this temper is moved she is like a witch in an operation and makes all things turn round with her the very fabric is in a vertigo when she begins to charm in an instant whatever was the occasion that moved her blood she has such intolerable servants betty is so awkward tom cannot carry a message and her husband has so little respect for her that she poor woman is weary of this life

wittier than he has hitherto been  the tatler no     scriptorum chorus omnis amat nemus and fugit urbe hor from tuesday aug    to thursday aug       0 from my own apartment aug  0 i chanced to rise very early one particular morning this summer and took a walk into the country to divert my self among the fields and meadows while the green was new and the flowers in their bloom as at this season of the year every lane is a beautiful walk and every hedge full of nosegays i lost my self with a great deal of pleasure among several thickets and bushes that were filled with a great variety of birds and an agreeable confusion of notes which formed the pleasantest scene in the world to one who had passed a whole winter in noise and smoke the freshness of the dews that lay upon every thing about me with the cool breath of the morning which inspired the birds with so many delightful instincts created in me the same kind of animal pleasure and made my heart overflow with such secret emotions of joy and satisfaction as are not to be described or accounted for on this occasion i could not but reflect upon a beautiful simile in milton as one who long in populous city pent where houses thick and sewers annoy the air forth issuing on a summers morn to breath among the pleasant villages and farms adjoind from each thing met conceives delight the smell of grain or tedded grass or kine or dairy each rural sight each rural sound those who are conversant in the writings of polite authors receive an additional entertainment from the country as it revives in their memories those charming descriptions with which such authors do frequently abound  i was thinking of the foregoing beautiful simile in milton and applying it to my self when i observed to the windward of me a black cloud falling to the earth in long trails of rain which made me betake my self for shelter to a house which i saw at a little distance from the place where i was walking as i sat in the porch i heard the voices of two or three persons who seemed very earnest in discourse my curiosity was raised when i heard the names of alexander the great and artaxerxes and as their talk seemed to run on ancient heroes i concluded there could not be any secret in it for which reason i thought i might very fairly listen to what they said  after several parallels between great men which appeared to me altogether groundless and chimerical i was surprised to hear one say that he valued the black prince more than the duke of vendosme how the duke of vendosme should become a rival of the black princes i could not conceive and was more startled when i heard a second affirm with great vehemence that if the emperor of germany was not going off he should like him better than either of them he added that though the season was so changeable the duke of marlborough was in blooming beauty i was wondering to my self from whence they had received this odd intelligence especially when i heard them mention the names of several other great generals as the prince of hesse and the king of sweden who they said were both running away to which they added what i entirely agreed with them in that the crown of france was very weak but that the marshall villars still kept his colors at last one of them told the company if they would go along with him he would show them a chimneysweeper and a painted lady in the same bed which he was sure would very much please them the shower which had driven them as well as my self into the house was now over and as they were passing by me into the garden i asked them to let me be one of their company  the gentleman of the house told me if i delighted in flowers it would be worth my while for that he believed he could show me such a blow of tulips as was not to be matched in the whole country  i accepted the offer and immediately found that they had been talking in terms of gardening and that the kings and generals they had mentioned were only so many tulips to which the gardiners according to their usual custom had given such high titles and appellations of honor  i was very much pleased and astonished at the glorious show of these gay vegetables that arose in great profusion on all the banks about us sometimes i considered them with the eye of an ordinary spectator as so many beautiful objects varnished over with a natural gloss and stained with such a variety of colors as are not to be equalled in any artificial dies or tinctures sometimes i considered every leaf as an elaborate piece of tissue in which the threads and fibers were woven together into different configurations which gave a different coloring to the light as it glanced on the several parts of the surface sometimes i considered the whole bed of tulips according to the notion of the greatest mathematician and philosopher that ever lived as a multitude of optic instruments designed for the separating light into all those various colors of which it is composed  i was awakened out of these my philosophical speculations by observing the company often seemed to laugh at me i accidentally praised a tulip as one of the finest that i ever saw upon which they told me twas a common foolscoat upon that i praised a second which it seems was but another kind of foolscoat i had the same fate with two or three more for which reason i desired the owner of the garden to let me know which were the finest of the flowers for that i was so unskilful in the art that i thought the most beautiful were the most valuable and that those which had the gayest colors were the most beautiful the gentleman smiled at my ignorance he seemed a very plain honest man and a person of good sense had not his head been touched with that distemper which hippocrates calls the  tulippomania insomuch that he would talk very rationally on any subject in the world but a tulip  he told me that he valued the bed of flowers which lay before us and was not above twenty yards in length and two in breadth more than he would the best hundred acres of land in england and added that it would have been worth twice the money it is if a foolish cookmaid of his had not almost ruined him the last winter by mistaking an handful of tuliproots for an heap of onions and by that means says he made me a dish of porridge that cost me above  000 l sterling he then showed me what he thought the finest of his tulips which i found received all their value from their rarity and oddness and put me in mind of your great fortunes which are not always the greatest beauties  i have often looked upon it as a piece of happiness that i have never fallen into any of these fantastical tastes nor esteemed any thing the more for its being uncommon and hard to be met with for this reason i look upon the whole country in springtime as a spacious garden and make as many visits to a spot of daizies or a bank of violets as a florist does to his borders and parterres there is not a bush in blossom within a mile of me which i am not acquainted with nor scarce a daffodil or cowslip that withers away in my neighborhood without my missing it i walked home in this temper of mind through several fields and meadows with an unspeakable pleasure not without reflecting on the bounty of providence which has made the most pleasing and most beautiful objects the most ordinary and most common

perplexed as a select company of us were this evening with a couple of professed wits who through our ill fortune and their own confidence had thought fit to pin themselves upon a gentleman who had owned to them that he was going to meet such and such persons and named us one by one these pert puppies immediately resolved to come with him and from the beginning to the end of the night entertained each other with impertinencies to which we were perfect strangers i am come home very much tired for the affliction was so irksome to me that it surpasses all other i ever knew insomuch that i cannot reflect upon this sorrow with pleasure though it is past  an easy manner of conversation is the most desirable quality a man can have and for that reason coxcombs will take upon them to be familiar with people whom they never saw before what adds to the vexation of it is that they will act upon the foot of knowing you by fame and rally with you as they call it by repeating what your enemies say of you and court you as they think by uttering to your face at a wrong time all the kind things your friends speak of you in your absence  these people are the more dreadful the more they have of what is usually called wit for a lively imagination when it is not governed by a good understanding makes such miserable havoc both in conversation and business that it lays you defenseless

with a good air and mien that part of life which we spend in company is the most pleasing of all our moments and therefore i think our behavior in it should have its laws as well as the part of our being which is generally esteemed the more important from hence it is that from long experience i have made it a maxim that however we may pretend to take satisfaction in sprightly mirth and high jollity there is no great pleasure in any company where the basis of the society is not mutual good will when this is in the room every trifling circumstance the most minute accident the absurdity of a servant the repetition of an old story the look of a man when he is telling it the most indifferent and the most ordinary occurrences are matters which produce mirth and good humor i went to spend an hour after this manner with some friends who enjoy it in perfection whenever they meet when those destroyers abovementioned came in upon us there is not a man among them has any notion of distinction of superiority to one another either in their fortunes or their talents when they are in company or if any reflection to the contrary occurs in their thoughts it only strikes a delight upon their minds that so much wisdom and power is in possession of one whom they love and esteem  in these my lucubrations i have frequently dwelt upon this one topic it would make short work for us reformers for it is only want of making this a position that renders some characters bad which would otherwise be good tom mercett means no man ill but does ill to every body his ambition is to be witty and to carry on that design he breaks through all things that other people hold sacred if he thought wit was no way to be used but to the advantage of society that sprightliness would have a new turn and we should expect what he is going to say with satisfaction instead of fear it is no excuse for being mischievous that a man is mischievous without malice nor will it be thought an atonement that the ill was done not to injure the party concerned but to divert the indifferent  it is methinks a very great error that we should not profess honesty in conversation as much as in commerce if we consider that there is no greater misfortune than to be ill received where we love the turning a man to ridicule among his friends we rob him of greater enjoyments than he could have purchased by his wealth yet he that laughs at him would perhaps be the last man who would hurt him in this case of less consequence it has been said the history of don quixote utterly destroyed the spirit of gallantry in the spanish nation and i believe we may say much more truly that the humor of ridicule has done as much injury to the true relish of company in england  such satisfactions as arise from the secret comparison of our selves to others with relation to their inferior fortunes or merit are mean and unworthy the true and high state of conversation is when men communicate their thoughts to each other upon such subjects and in such a manner as would be pleasant if there were no such thing as folly in the world for it is but a low condition of wit in one man which depends upon folly in another  p s

hor from saturd sept   to tuesd sept      0 from my own apartment sept   having received many letters filled with compliments and acknowledgments for my late useful discovery of the political barometer i shall here communicate to the public an account of my ecclesiastical thermometer the latter giving as manifest prognostications of the changes and revolutions in church as the former does of those in state and both of them being absolutely necessary for every prudent subject who is resolved to keep what he has and get what he can  the church thermometer which i am now to treat of is supposed to have been invented in the reign of henry the eighth about the time when that religious prince put some to death for owning the popes supremacy and others for denying transubstantiation i do not find however any great use made of this instrument till it fell into the hands of a learned and vigilant priest or minister for he frequently wrote himself both one and the other who was some time vicar of bray this gentleman lived in his vicaridge to a good old age and after having seen several successions of his neighboring clergy either burnt or banished departed this life with the satisfaction of having never deserted his flock and died vicar of bray as this glass was first designed to calculate the different degrees of heat in religion as it raged in popery or as it cooled and grew temperate in the reformation it was marked at several distances after the manner our ordinary thermometer is to this day viz extreme hot sultry hot very hot hot warm temperate cold just freezing frost hard frost great frost extreme cold  it is well known that toricellius the inventor of the common weatherglass made the experiment in a long tube which held thirty two foot of water and that a more modern virtuoso finding such a machine altogether unweildy and useless and considering that thirty two inches of quicksilver weighed as much as so many foot of water in a tube of the same circumference invented that fizeable instrument which is now in use after this manner that i might adapt the thermometer i am now speaking of to the present constitution of our church as divided into high and low i have made some necessary variations both in the tube and the fluid it contains in the first place i ordered a tube to be cast in a planetary hour and took care to seal it hermetically when the sun was in conjunction with saturn i then took the proper precautions about the fluid which is a compound of two very different liquors one of them a spirit drawn out of a strong heady wine the other a particular sort of rock water colder than ice and clearer than crystal the spirit is of a red fiery color and so very apt to ferment that unless it be mingled with a proportion of the water or pent up very close it will burst the vessel that holds it and fly up in fume and smoke the water on the contrary is of such a subtle piercing cold that unless it be mingled with a proportion of the spirits it will sink through almost every thing that it is put into and seems to be of the same nature as the water mentioned by quintus curtius which says the historian could be contained in nothing but in the hoof or as the oxford manuscript has it in the skull of an ass the thermometer is marked according to the following figure which i set down at length not only to give my reader a clear idea of it but also to fill up my paper ignorance persecution wrath zeal church moderation lukewarmness infidelity ignorance   the reader will observe that the church is placed in the middle point of the glass between zeal and moderation the situation in which she always flourishes and in which every good englishman wishes her who is a friend to the constitution of his country however when it mounts to zeal it is not amiss and when it sinks to moderation is still in a most admirable temper the worst of it is that when once it begins to rise it has still an inclination to ascend insomuch that it is apt to climb from zeal to wrath and from wrath to persecution which always ends in ignorance and very often proceeds from it in the same manner it frequently takes its progress through the lower half of the glass and when it has a tendency to fall will gradually descend from moderation to lukewarmness and from lukewarmness to infidelity which very often terminates in ignorance and always proceeds from it  it is a common observation that the ordinary thermometer will be affected by the breathing of people who are in the room where it stands and indeed it is almost incredible to conceive how the glass i am now describing will fall by the breath of a multitude crying popery or on the contrary how it will rise when the same multitude as it sometimes happens cry out in the same breath the church is in danger  as soon as i had finished this my glass and adjusted it to the abovementioned scale of religion that i might make proper experiments with it i carried it under my cloak to several coffeehouses and other places of resort about this great city at st jamess coffeehouse the liquor stood at moderation but at wills to my extreme surprise it subsided to the very lowest mark on the glass at the grecian it mounted but just one point higher at the rainbow it still ascended two decrees childs fetched it up to zeal and other adjacent coffeehouses to wrath  it fell into the lower half of the glass as i went further into the city till at length it settled at moderation where it continued all the time i stayed about the change as also whilst i passed by the bank and here i cannot but take notice that through the whole course of my remarks i never observed my glass to rise at the same time that the stocks did  to complete the experiment i prevailed upon a friend of mine who works under me in the occult sciences to make a progress with my glass through the whole island of great britain and after his return to present me with a register of his observations i guessed beforehand at the temper of several places he passed through by the characters they have had time out of mind thus that facetious divine dr fuller speaking of the town of banbury near a hundred years ago tells us it was a place famous for cakes and zeal which i find by my glass is true to this day as to the latter part of this description though i must confess it is not in the same reputation for cakes that it was in the time of that learned author and thus of other places in short i have now by me digested in an alphabetical order all the counties corporations and boroughs in great britain with their respective tempers as they stand related to my thermometer but this i shall keep to my self because i would by no means do any thing that may seem to influence any ensuing elections  the point of doctrine which i would propagate by this my invention is the same which was long ago advanced by that able teacher horace out of whom i have taken my text for this discourse we should be careful not to overshoot our selves in the pursuits even of virtue whether zeal or moderation be the point we aim at let us keep fire out of the one and frost out of the other but alas the world is too wise to want such a precaution the terms highchurch and lowchurch as commonly used do not so much denote a principle as they distinguish a party they are like words of battle that have nothing to do with their original signification but are only given out to keep a body of men together and to let them know friends from enemies  i must confess i have considered with some little attention the influence which the opinions of these great national sects have upon their practice and do look upon it as one of the unaccountable things of our times that multitudes of honest gentlemen who entirely agree in their lives should take it in their heads to differ in their religion  the tatler no      sicut meus est mos nescio quid meditans nugarum and totus in illis hor from

the letter ran thus  mr bickerstaff i hope you will not be surprised to receive a letter from the widow gimcrack you know sir that i have lately lost a very whimsical husband who i find by one of your last weeks papers was not altogether a stranger to you when i married this gentleman he had a very handsome estate but upon buying a set of microscopes he was chosen a fellow of the royal society from which time i do not remember ever to have heard him speak as other people did or talk in a manner that any of his family could understand him he used however to pass away his time very innocently in conversation with several member of that learned body for which reason i never advised him against their company for several years till at last i found his brain was quite turned with their discourses the first symptom which he discovered of his being a virtuoso as you call him poor man was about fifteen years ago when he gave me positive orders to turn off an old weedingwoman that had been employed in the family for several years he told me at the same time that there was no such thing in nature as a weed and that it was his design to let his garden produce what it pleased so that you may be sure it makes a very pleasant show as it now lies about the same time he took a humor to ramble up and down the country and would often bring home with him his pockets full of moss and pebbles this you may be sure gave me a heavy heart though at the same time i must needs say he had the character of a very honest man notwithstanding he was reckoned a little weak till he begun to sell his estate and buy those strange baubles that you have taken notice of upon midsummerday last as he was walking with me in the fields he saw a very odd colored butterfly just before us i observed that he immediately changed color like a man that is surprised with a piece of good luck and telling me that it was what he had looked for above these twelve years he threw off his coat and followed it i lost sight of them both in less than a quarter of an hour but my husband continued the chase over hedge and ditch till about sunset at which time as i was afterward told he caught the butterfly as she rested her self upon a cabbage near five miles from the place where he first put her up he was here lifted from the ground by some passengers in a very fainting condition and brought home to me about midnight his violent exercise threw him into a fever which grew upon him by degrees and at last carried him off in one of the intervals of his distemper he called to me and after having excused himself for running out of his estate he told me that he had always been more industrious to improve his mind than his fortune and that his family must rather value themselves upon his memory as he was a wise man than a rich one he then told me that it was a custom among the romans for a man to give his slaves their liberty when he lay upon his deathbed i could not imagine what this meant till after having a little composed himself he ordered me to bring him a flea which he had kept for several months in a chain with a design as he said to give it its manumission this was done accordingly he then made the will which i have since seen printed in your works word for word only i must take notice that you have omitted the codicil in which he left a large concha veneris as it is there called to a member of the royal society who was often with him in his sickness and assisted him in his will and now sir i come to the chief business of my letter which is to desire your friendship and assistance in the disposal of those many rarities and curiosities which lie upon my hands if you know any one that has an occasion for a parcel of dried spiders i will sell them a pennyworth i could likewise let any one have a bargain of cockleshells i would also desire your advice whether i had best sell my beetles in a lump or by retail the gentleman abovementioned who was my husbands friend would have me make an auction of all his goods and is now drawing up a catalogue of every particular for that purpose with the two following words in great letters over the head of them auctio gimcrackiana but upon talking with him i begin to suspect he is as mad as poor sir nicholas was your advice in all these particulars will be a great piece of charity to  sir your most humble servant elizabeth gimcrack   i shall answer the foregoing letter and give the widow my best advice as soon as i can find out chapmen for the wares which she has to put off in the mean time i shall give my reader the sight of a letter which i have received from another female correspondent by the same post  good mr bickerstaff i am convinced by a late paper of yours that a passionate woman which among the common people goes under the name of a scold is one of the most unsupportable creatures in the world but alas sir what can we do i have made a thousand vows and resolutions every morning to guard my self against this frailty but have generally broken them before dinner and could never in my life hold out till the second course was set upon the table what most troubles me is that my husband is as patient and goodnatured as you own worship or any man living can be pra give me some directions for i would observe the strictest and severest rules you can think of to cu my self of this distemper which is apt to fall into my tongue every moment i am  sir your most humble servant etc   in answer to this most unfortunate lady i must acquaint her that there is now in town an ingenious physician of my acquaintance who undertakes to cure all the vices and defects of the mind by inward medicines or outward applications i shall give the world an account of his patients and his cures in other papers when i shall be more at leisure to treat upon this subject i shall only here inform my correspondent that for the benefit of such ladies that are troubled with virulent tongues he has prepared a cold bath over which there is fastened at the end of a long pole a very convenient chair curiously gilt and carved when the patient is seated in this chair the doctor lifts up the pole and gives her two or three total emersions in the cold bath till such time as she has quite lost the use of speech this operation so effectually chills the tongue and refrigerates the blood that a woman who at her entrance into the chair is extremely passionate and sonorous will come out as silent and gentle as a lamb the doctor told me he would not practice this experiment upon women of fashion had not he seen it made upon those of meaner condition with very good effect  the tatler no      chrysidis udas ebrius ante fores extinct a cum face cantat persius from thursday sept   to saturday sept      0 from my own apartment september   whereas by letters from nottingham we have advice that the young ladies of that place complain for want of sleep by reason of certain riotous lovers who for this last summer have very much infested the streets of that eminent city with violins and bassviols between the hours of twelve and four in the morning to the great disturbance of many of her majestys peaceable subjects and whereas i have been importuned to publish some edict against these midnight alarms which under the name of serenades do greatly annoy many welldisposed persons not only in the place abovementioned but also in most of the polite towns of this island  i have taken that matter into my serious consideration and do find that this custom is by no means to be indulged in this country and climate  it is indeed very unaccountable that most of our british youth should take such great delight in these nocturnal expeditions your robust trueborn briton that has not yet felt the force of flames and darts has a natural inclination to break windows while thse whose natural ruggedness has been soothed and softened by gentle passion have as strong a propensity to languish under them especially if they have a fiddler behind them to utter their complaints for as the custom prevails at present there is scarce a young man of any fashion in a corporation who does not make love with the townmusick the waits often help him through his courtship and my friend mr banister has told me he was proffered five hundred pounds by a young fellow to play but for one winter under the window of a lady that was a great fortune but more cruel than ordinary one would think they hoped to conquer their mistresses hearts as people tame hawks and eagles by keeping them awake or breaking their sleep when they are fallen into it  i have endeavored to search into the original of this impertinent way of making love which according to some authors is of great antiquity if we may believe monsieur dacier and other critics horaces tenth ode of the third book was originally a serenade and if i was disposed to show my learning i could produce a line of him in another place which seems to have been the burden of an old heathen serenade    audis minus and minus jam me tuo tongas pereunte noctes lydia dormis but notwithstanding the opinions of many learned men upon this subject i rather agree with them who look upon this custom as now practiced to have been introduced by castrated musicians who found out this way of applying themselves to their mistresses at these hours when men of hoarser voices express their passions in a more vulgar method it must be confessed that your italian eunuchs do practice this manner of courtship to this day  but whoever were the persons that first thought of the serenade the authors of all countries are unanimous in ascribing the invention to italy  there are two circumstances which qualified that country above all other for this midnight music  the first i shall mention was the softness of their climate  this gave the lover opportunities of being abroad in the air or of lying upon the earth whole hours together without fear of damps or dews but as for our tramontain lovers when they begin their midnight complaint with my lodging it is on the cold ground we are not to understand them in the rigor of the letter since it would be impossible for a british swain to condole himself long in that situation without really dying for his mistress a man might as well serenade in greenland as in our region milton seems to have had in his thoughts the absurdity of these northern serenades in the censure which he passes upon them   or midnight ball or serenede which the starved lover sings to his proud fair best quitted with disdain the truth of it is i have often pitied in a winter night a vocal musician and have attributed many of his trills and quavers to the coldness of the weather  the second circumstance which inclined the lalians to this custom was that musical genius which is so universal among them nothing is more frequent in that country than to hear a cobbler working to an opera tune you can scarce see a porter that has not one nail much longer than the rest which you will find upon enquiry is cherished for some instrument in short there is not a labourer or handicraft man that in the cool of the evening does not relieve himself with solos and sonnatas  the italian fooths his mistress with a plaintivee voice and bewails himself in such melting music that the whole neighborhood sympathizes with him in his sorrow  qualis populea maerens philomela sub umbra flet noctem rameque sedens miserabile carmen integrat and late moestis loca quaestibus implet on the contrary our honest countrymen have so little an inclination to music that they seldom begin to sing till they are drunk which also is usually the time when they are most disposed to serenade  the tatler no     for when upon their ungot heirs the entail themselves and all that is theirs what blinder bargain ever was driven or wager laid at six and seven to pass themselves away and turn their childrens tenants ere they are born hud from saturd sept   to tuesd sept       0 from my own apartment september    i have been very much solicited by clarinda flavia and lysetta to reassume my discourse concerning the methods of disposing honorably the unmarried part of the world and taking off those bars to it jointures and settlements which are not only the greatest impediments toward entering into that state but also the frequent causes of disturst and animosity in it after it is consummated i have with very much attention considered the case and among all the observations that i have made through a long course of years i have thought the coldness of wives to their husbands as well as disrespect from children to parents to arise from this one source this trade for minds and bodies in the lump without regard to either but as they are accompanied with such sums of money and such parceis of land cannot but produce a commerce between the parties concerned suitable to the mean motives upon which they at first came together i have heretofore given an account that this method of making settlements was first invented by a griping lawyer who made use of the covetous tempers of the parents of each side to force two young people into these vile measures of diffidence for no other end but to increase the skins of parchment by which they were put into each others possession out of each others power the law of our country has given an ample and generous provision for the wife even the third of the husbands estate and left to her good humor and his gratitude the expectation of further provision but the fantastical method of going further with relation to their heirs has a foundation in nothing but pride and folly for as all men wish their children as like themselves and as much better as they can possibly it seems monstrous that we should give out of our selves the opportunities of rewarding and discouraging them according to their deserts this wise institution has no more sense in it than if a man should begin a deed with whereas no man living knows how long he shall continue to be a reasonable creature or an honest man and whereas i b am going to enter in the state of matrimony with mrs d therefore i shall from henceforth make it indifferent to me whether from this time forward i shall be a fool or a knave and therefore in full and perfect health of body and as sound mind not knowing which of my children will prove better or worse i give to my firstborn be he perverse ungrateful impious or cruel the lump and bulk of my estate and leave one years purchase only to each of my younger children whether they shall be brave or beautiful modest or honorable from the time of the date hereof wherein i resign my senses and hereby promise to employ my judgment no further in the distribution of my worldly goods from the day of the date hereof hereby further confessing and covenanting that i am from henceforth married and dead in law  there is no man that is conversant in modern settlements but knows this is an exact translation of what is inserted in these instruments mens passions could only make them submit to such terms and therefore all unreasonable bargains in marriage ought to be set aside as well as deeds extorted from men under force or in prison who are altogether as much masters of their actions as he that is possessed with a violent passion  how strangely men are sometimes partial to themselves appears by the rapine of him that has a daughters beauty under his direction he will make no scruple of using it to force from her lover as much of his estate as is worth  0000 l and at the same time as a justice on the bench will spare no pains to get a man hanged that has taken but a horse from him  it is to be hoped the legislature will in due time take this kind of robbery into consideration and not suffer men to prey upon each other when they are about making the most solemn league and entering into the strictest bonds the only sure remedy is to fix a certain rate on every womans fortune one price for that of a maid and another for a widow for it is of infinite advantage that there should be no frauds or uncertainties in the sale of our women  if any man should exceed the settled rate he ought to be at liberty after seven years are over by which time his love may be supposed to abate a little if it is not founded upon reason to renounce the bargain and be freed from the settlement upon restoring the portion as a youth married under fourteen years old may be off if he pleases when he comes to that age and as a man is discharged from all bargains but that of marriage made when he is under twenty one  it grives me when i consider that these restraints upon matrimony take away the advantage we should otherwise have over other countries which are sunk much by those great checks upon propagation the convents it is thought chiefly owing to these that italy and spain want above half their complement of people were the price of wives always fixed and settled it would contribute to filling the nation more than all the encouragements that can possibly be given to foreigners to transplant themselves hither  i therefore as censor of britain till a law is made will lay down rules which shall be observed with penalty of degrading all that break them into pretty fellows smarts squibs hunting horns drums and bagpipes  the females that are guilty of breaking my orders i shall respectively pronounce to be kits hornpipes dulcimers and kettledrums such widows as wear the spoils of one husband i will bury if they attempt to rob another  i ordain that no woman ever demand one shilling to be paid after her husbands death more than the very sum she brings him or an equivalent for it in land  that no settlement be made in which the man settles on his children more than the reversion of the jointure or the value of it in money so that at his death he may in the whole be bound to pay his family but double to what he has received i would have the eldest as well as the rest have his provision out of this  when men are not able to come up to those settlements i have proposed i would have them receive so much of the portion only as they can come up to and the rest to go to the woman by way of pinmoney or separate maintenance in this i think i determined equally between the two sexes  if any lawyer varies from these rules or is above two days in drawing a marriage settlement or uses more words in it than one skin of parchment will contain or takes above five pounds for drawing it i would have him thrown over the bar  were these rules observed a woman with a small fortune and a great deal of worth would be sure to marry according to her deserts if the mans estate were to be less incumbered in proportion as her fortune is less than he might have with others  a man of a great deal of merit and not much estate might be chosen for his worth because it would not be difficult for him to make a settlement  the man that loves a woman best would not lose her for not being able to bid so much as another or for not complying with an extravagant demand  a fine woman would no more be set up to auction as she is now when a man puts in for her her friends or her self take care to publish it and the man that was the first bidder is made no other use of but to raise the price he that loves her will continue in waiting as long as she pleases if her fortune be thought equal to his and under pretense of some failure in the rentroll or difficulties in drawing the settlement he is put off till a better bargain is made with another  all the rest of the sex that are not rich or beautiful to the highest degree are plainly gainers and would be married so fast that the least charming of them would soon grow beauties to the batchelors  widows might be easily married if they would not as they do now set up for discreet only by being mercenary  the making matimony cheap and easy would be the greatest discouragement to vice the limiting the expense of children would not make men ill inclined or afraid of having them in a regular way and the men of merit would not live unmarried as they often do now because the goodness of a wife cannot be ensured to them out the loss of an estate is certain and a man would never have the affliction of a worthless heir added to that of a bad wife  i am the more serious large and particular on this subject because my lucubrations designed for the encouragement of virtue cannot have the desired success as long as this encumbrance of settlements continues upon matrimony  the tatler no     materiam superabat opus  ovid from tuesday sept    to thursday sept       0 from my own apartment september    it is my custom in a dearth of news to entertain my self with those collections of advertisements that appear at the end of all our public prints these i consider as accounts of news from the little world in the same manner that the foregoing parts of the paper are from the great if in one we hear that a sovereign prince is fled from his capital city in the other we hear of a tradesman who has shut up his shop and run away if in one we find the victory of a general in the other we see the desertion of a private soldier i must confess i have a certain weakness in my temper that is often very much affected by these little domestic occurrences and have frequently been caught with tears in my eyes over a melancholy advertisement  but to consider this subject in its most ridiculous lights advertisements are of great use to the vulgar first of all as they are instruments of ambition a man that is by no means big enough for the gazette may easily creep into the advertisements by which means we often see an apothecary in the same paper of news with a plenipotentiary or a runningfootman with an ambassador an advertisement from pickadilly goes down to posterity with an article from madrid and john bartlett of goodmansfields is celebrated in the same paper with the emperor of germany thus the fable tells us that the wren mounted as high as the eagle by getting upon his back  a second use which this sort of writings have been turned to of late years has been the management of controversy insomuch that above half the advertisements one meets with nowadays are purely polemical the inventors of strops for razors have written against one another this way for several years and that with great bitterness as the whole argument pro and con in the case of the morninggowns is still carried on after the same manner i need not mention the several proprietors of dr andersons pills nor take notice of the many satirical works of this nature so frequently published by dr clark who has had the confidence to advertise upon that learned knight my very worthy friend sir william read but i shall not interpose in their quarrel sir william can give him his own in advertisements that in the judgment of the impartial are as well penned as the doctors  the third and last use of these writings is to inform the world where they may be furnished with almost every thing that is necessary for life if a man has pains in his head cholicks in his bowels or spots in his clothes he may here meet with proper cures and remedies if a man would recover a wife or a horse that is stolen or strayed if he wants new sermons electuaries asses milk or any thing else either for his body or his mind this is the place to look for them in  the great art in writing advertisements is the finding out a proper method to catch the readers eye without which a good thing may pass over unobserved or be lost among commissions of bankrupt asterisks and hands were formerly of great use for this purpose of late years the n b has been much in fashion as also little cuts and figures the invention of which we must ascribe to the author of springtrusses i must not here omit the blind italian character which being scarce legible always fixes and detains the eye and gives the curious reader something like the satisfaction of prying into a secret  but the great skill in an advertiser is chiefly seen in the style which he makes use of he is to mention the universal esteem or general reputation of things that were never heard of if he is a physician or astrologer he must change his lodgings frequently and though he never saw any body in them besides his own family give public notice of it for the information of the nobility and gentry since i am thus usefully employed in writing criticisms on the works of these diminutive authors i must not pass over in silence an advertisement which has lately made its appearance and is written altogether in a ciceronian manner it was sent to me with five shillings to be inserted among my advertisements but as it is a pattern of good writing in this way i shall give it a place in the body of my paper  the highest compounded spirit of lavender the most glorious if the expression may be used enlivening scent and flavor that can possibly be which so raptures the spirits delights the gust and gives such airs to the countenance as are not to be imagined but by those that have tried it the meanest sort of the thing is admired by most gentlemen and ladies but this far more as by far it exceeds it to the gaining among all a more than common esteem it is sold in neat flint bottles fit for the pocket only at the goldenkey in wartonscourt near holbornbars for   s   d with directions at the same time that i recommend the several flowers in which this spirit of lavender is wrapped up if the expression may be used i cannot excuse my fellow laborers for admitting into their papers several uncleanly advertisements not at all proper to appear in the works of polite writers among these i must reckon the carminitive wind expelling pills if the doctor had called them only his carminitive pills he had been as cleanly as one could have wished but the second word entirely destroys the decency of the first there are other absurdities of this nature so very gross that i dare not mention them and shall therefore dismiss this subject with a public admonition to michael parrot that he do not presume any more to mention a certain worm he knows of which by the way has grown seven foot in my memory for if i am not much mistaken it is the same that was but nine foot long about six months ago  by the remarks i have here made it plainly appears that a collection of advertisements is a kind of miscellany the writers of which contrary to all authors except men of quality give money to the booksellers who publish their copies the genius of the bookseller is chiefly shown in his method of ranging and digesting these little tracts the last paper i took up in my hands places them in the following order the true spanish blacking for shoes etc the beautifying cream for the face etc pease and plasters etc nectar and ambrosia etc four freehold tenements of    l per annum etc  the present state of england etc annotations upon the tatler etc a commission of bankrupt being awarded against b l bookseller etc   the tatler no      si quid novisti rectius istis candidus imperti si non his utere mecum hor from thursday sept    to saturday sept       0 from my own apartment september    the hours which we spend in conversation are the most pleasing of any which we enjoy yet methinks there is very little care taken to improve our selves for the frequent repetition of them the common fault in this case is that of growing too intimate and falling into displeasing familiarities for it is a very ordinary thing for men to make no other use of a close acquaintance with each others affairs but to teaze one another with unacceptable allusions one would pass over patiently such as converse like animals and salute each other with bangs on the shoulder sly raps with canes or other robust pleasantries practiced by the rural gentry of this nation but even among those who should have more polite ideas of things you see a set of people who invert the design of conversation and make frequent mention of ungrateful subjects nay mention them because they are ungrateful as if the perfection of society were in knowing how to offend on the one part and how to bear an offense on the other in all parts of this populous town you find the merry world made up of an active and a passive companion one who has goodnature enough to suffer all his friend shall think fit to say and one who is resolved to make the most of his good humor to show his parts in the trading part of mankind i have ever observed the jest went by the weight of purses and the ridicule is made up by the gains which arise from it thus the packer allows the clothier to say what he pleases and the broker has his countenance ready to laugh with the merchant though the abuse is to fall on himself because he knows that as a gobetween he shall find his account in being in the good graces of a man of wealth among these just and punctual people the richest man is ever the better jester and they know no such thing as a person who shall pretend to a superior laugh at a man who does not make him amends by opportunities of advantage in another kind but among people of a different way where the pretended distinction in company is only what is raised from sense and understanding it is very absurd to carry on a rough raillery so far as that the whole discourse should turn upon each others infirmities follies or misfortunes  i was this evening with a set of wags of this class they appear generally by two and two and what is most extraordinary is that those very persons who are most together appear least of a mind when joined by other company this evil proceeds from an indiscreet familiarity whereby a man is allowed to say the most grating thing imaginable to another and it shall be accounted weakness to show an impatience for the unkindness but this and all other deviations from the design of pleasing each other when we meet are derived from interlopers in society who want capacity to put in a stock among regular companions and therefore supply their wants by stale histories sly observations and rude hints which relate to the conduct of others all cohabitants in general run into this unhappy fault men and their wives break into reflections which are like so much arabic to the rest of the company sisters and brothers often make the like figure from the same unjust sense of the art of being intimate and familiar it is often said such an one cannot stand the mention of such a circumstance if he cannot i am sure it is for want of discourse or a worse reason that any companion of his touches upon it  familiarity among the truly wellbred never give authority to trespass upon one another in the most minute circumstance but it allows to be kinder than we ought otherwise presume to be eusebius has wit humor and spirit but there never was a man in his company who wished he had less for he understands familiarity so well that he knows how to make use of it in a way that neither makes himself or his friend contemptible but if any one is lessened by his freedom it is he himself who always likes the place the diet and the reception when he is in the company of his friends equality is the life of conversation and he is as much out who assumes to himself any part above another as he who considers himself below the rest of the society familiarity in inferiors is sauciness in superiors condescension neither of which are to have being among companions the very word implying that they are to be equal when therefore we have abstracted the company from all considerations of their quality or fortune it will immediately appear that to make it happy and polite there must nothing be started which shall discover that our thoughts run upon any such distinctions hence it will arise that benevolence must become the rule of society and he that is most obliging must be most diverting  this way of talking i am fallen into from the reflection that i am wherever i go entertained with some absurdity mistake weakness or ill luck of some man or other whom not only i but the person who makes me those relations has a value for it would therefore be a great benefit to the world if it could be brought to pass that no story should be a taking one but what was to the advantage of the person of whom it is related by this means he that is now a wit in conversation would be considered as a spreader of false news is in business  but above all to make a familiar fit for a bosom friend it is absolutely necessary that we should always be inclined rather to hide than rally each others infirmities to suffer for a fault is a sort of atonement and no body is concerned for the offense for which he has made reparation  p s i have received the following letter which rallies me for being witty sooner than i designed but i have now altered my resolution and intend to be

reason i shall here publish to the world the life of a person who was neither man nor woman as written by one of my ingenious correspondents who seems to have imitated plutach in that multifarious erudition and those occasional differtation which he has wrought into the body of his history the life i am putting out is that of margery alias john young commonly known by the name of dr young who as the town very well knows was a woman that practiced physic in mans clothes and after having had two wives and several children died about a month since  sir i here make bold to trouble you with a short account of the famous dr youngs life which you may call if you please a second part of the farce of the sham doctor this perhaps will not seem so strange to you who if i am not mistaken have somewhere mentioned with honor your sister kirleus as a practitioner both in physic and astrology but in the common opinion of mankind a shequack is altogether as strange and astonishing a creature as the centaur that practiced physic in the days of achilles or as king phys in the rehearsal aesculapius the great founder of your art was particularly famous for his beard as we may conclude from the behavior of a tyrant who is branded by heathen historians as guilty both of sacrilege and blasphemy having robbed the statue of aesculapius of a thick bushy golden beard and then alleged for his excuse that it was a shame the son should have a beard when his father apollo had none this latter instance indeed seems something to favor a female professor since as i have been told the ancient statues of apollo are generally made with the head and face of a woman nay i have been credibly informed by those who have seen them both that the famous apollo in the belvidera did very much resemble dr young let that be as it will the doctor was a kind of amazon in physic that made as great devastations and slaughters as any of our chief heroes in the art and was as fatal to the english in these our days as the famous jean d arc was in those of our forefathers  i do not find any thing remarkable in the life i am about to write till the year      at which time the doctor being about twenty three years old was brought to bed of a bastard child the scandal of such a misfortune gave so great uneasiness to pretty mrs peggy for that was the name by which the doctor was then called that she left her family and followed her lover to london with a fixed resolution some way or other to recover her lost reputation but instead of changing her life which one would have expected from so good a disposition of mind she took it in her head to change her sex this was soon done by the help of a sword and a pair of breeches i have reason to believe that her first design was to turn manmidwife having her self had some experience in those affairs but thinking this too narrow a foundation for her future fortune she at length bought her a gold button coat and set up for a physician thus we see the same fatal miscarriage in her youth made mrs young a doctor that formerly made one of the same sex a pope  the doctor succeeded very well in his business at first but very often met with accidents that disquieted him as he wanted that deep magisterial voice which gives authority to a prescription and is absolutely necessary for the right pronouncing of those words take these pills he unfortunately got the nickname of the squeaking doctor if this circumstance alarmed the doctor there was another that gave him no small disquiet and very much diminished his gains in short he found himself run down as a superficial prating quack in all families that had at the head of them a cautious father or a jealous husband these would often complain among one another that they did not like such a smockfaced physician though in truth had they known how justly he deserved that name they would rather have favored his practice than have apprehended any thing from it  such were the motives that determined mrs young to change her condition and take in marriage a virtuous young woman who lived with her in good reputation and made her the father of a very pretty girl but this part of her happiness was soon after destroyed by a distemper which was too hard for our physician and carried off his first wife the doctor had not been a widow long before he married his second lady with whom also he lived in very good understanding it so happened that the doctor was with child at the same time that his lady was but the little ones coming both together they passed for twins the doctor having entirely established the reputation of his manhood especially by the birth of the boy of whom he had been lately delivered and who very much resembles him grew into good business and was particularly famous for the cure of venereal distempers but would have had much more practice among his own sex had not some of them been so unreasonable as to demand certain proofs of their cure which the doctor was not able to give them the florid blooming look which gave the doctor some uneasiness at first instead of betraying his person only recommended his physic upon this occasion i cannot forbear mentioning what i thought a very agreeable surprise in one of molieres plays where a young woman applies her self to a sick person in the habit of a quack and speaks to her patient who was something scandalized at the youth of his physician to the following purpose  i begun to practice in the reign of francis i and am now in the hundred and fiftieth year of my age but by the virtue of my medicaments have maintained my self in the same beauty and freshness i had at fifteen for this reason hippocrates lays it down as a rule that a student in physic should have a sound constitution and a healthy look which indeed seem as necessary qualifications for a physician as a good life and virtuous behavior for a divine but to return to our subject about two years ago the doctor was very much afflicted with the vapors which grew upon him to such a degree that about six weeks since they made an end of him his death discovered the disguise he had acted under and brought him back again to his former sex it is said that at his burial the pall was held up by six women of some fashion the doctor left behind him a widow and two fatherless children if they may be called so besides the little boy beforementioned in relation to whom we may say of the doctor as the good old ballad about the children in the wood says of the unnatural uncle that he was father and mother both in one these are all the circumstances that i could learn of doctor youngs life which might have given occasion to many obscene fictions but as i know those would never have gained a place in your paper i have not troubled you with any impertinence of that nature having stuck to the truth very scrupulously as i always do when i subscribe my self  sir your etc   i shall add as a postcript to this letter that i am informed the famous saltero who sells coffee in his musaeum at chelsea has by him a curiosity which helped the doctor to carry on his imposture and will give great satisfaction to the curious inquirer  the tatler no     omnibus invideas zoile nemo tibi martial from tuesd sept    to thursd sept       0 from my own apartment september  0 it is the business of reason and philosophy to sooth and allay the passions of the mind or turn them to a vigorous prosecution of what is dictated by the understanding in order to this good end i would keep a watchful eye upon the growing inclinations of youth and be particularly careful to prevent their indulging themselves in such sentiments as may imbitter their more advanced age i have now under cure a young gentleman who lately communicated to me that he was of all men living the most miserably envious i desired the circumstances of his distemper upon which with a sigh that would have moved the most inhumane breast mr bickerstaff said he i am nephew to a gentleman of a very great estate to whose favor i have a cousin that has equal pretensions with my self this kinsman of mine is a young man of the highest merit imaginable and has a mind so tender and so generous that i can observe he returns my envy with pity he makes me upon all occasions the most obliging condescensions and i cannot but take notice of the concern he is in to see my life blasted with this racking passion though it is against himself in the presence of my uncle when i am in the room he never speaks so well as he is capable of but always lowers his talents and accomplishments out of regard to me what i beg of you dear sir is to instruct me how to love him as i know he does me and i beseech you if possible to set my heart right that it may no longer be tormented where it should be pleased or hate a man whom i cannot but approve  the patient gave me this account with such candor and openness that i conceived immeiate hopes of his cure because in diseases of he mind the person affected is half recovered hen he is sensible of his distemper sir said i he acknowledgment of your kinsmans merit is  very hopeful symptom for it is the nature of ersons afflicted with this evil when they are inurable to pretend a contempt of the person nvied if they are taxed with that weakness a an who is really envious will not allow he is o but upon such an accusation is tormented ith the reflection that to envy a man is to alow him your superior but in your case when ou examine the bottom of your heart i am apt o think it is avarice which you mistake for eny were it not that you have both expectations from the same man you would look upon your ousins accomplishments with pleasure you that now consider him as an obstacle to your nterest would then behold him as an ornament o your family i observed my patient upon this ccasion recover himself in some measure and e owned to me that he hoped it was as i imained for that in all places but where he was his ival he had pleasure in his company this as the first discourse we had upon this malady and i do not doubt but after two or three ore i shall by just degrees soften his envy into mulation  such an envy as i have here described may ossibly creep into an ingenuous mind but the nvy which makes a man uneasy to himself and hers is a certain distortion and perverseness of temper that renders him unwilling to be pleased with any thing without him that has either beauty or perfection in it i look upon it as a distemper in the mind which i know no moralist that has described in this light when a man cannot discern any thing which another is master of that is agreeable for which reason i look upon the goodnatured man to be endowed with a certain discerning faculty which the envious are altogether deprived of shallow wits superficial critics and conceited fops are with me so many blind men in respect of excellencies they can behold nothing but faults and blemishes and indeed see nothing that is worth seeing show them a poem it is stuff a picture it is daubing they find nothing in architecture that is not irregular or in music that is not out of tune these men should consider that it is their envy which deforms every thing and that the ugliness is not in the object but in the eye and as for nobler minds whose merits are either not discovered or are misrepresented by the envious part of mankind they should rather consider their defamers with pity than indignation a man cannot have an idea of perfection in another which he was never sensible of in himself mr lock tells us that upon asking a blind man what he thought scarlet was he answered that he believed it was like the sound of a trumpet he was forced to form his conceptions of ideas which he had not by those which he had in the same manner ask an envious man what he thinks of virtue he will call it design what of goodnature and he will term it dullness the difference is that as the person beforementioned was born blind your envious men have contracted the distemper themselves and are troubled with a sort of an acquired blindness thus the devil in milton though made an angel of light could see nothing to please him even in paradise and hated our first parents though in their state of innocence  the tatler no      veniet manus auxilio quae sit mihi  hor from thursday sept

oblige our fraternity of young divines and among the rest  your humble servant highchurch   i am very proud of having a gentleman of this name for my admirer and may some time or other write such a treatise as he mentions in the mean time i do not see why our clergy who are very frequently men of good families should be reproached if any of them chance to espouse a handmaid with a rectory in

astrologers i most humbly presume to trouble you upon this head you know very well that in our ordinary almanacks the wind and rain snow and hail clouds and sunshine have their proper seasons and come up as regularly in their several months as the fruits and plants of the earth as for my own part i freely own to you that i generally steal my weather out of some antiquated almanac that foretold it several years ago now sir what i humbly beg of you is that you would lend me your state weatherglass in order to fill up this vacant column in my works this i know would sell my almanac beyond any other and make me a richer man than poor robin if you will not grant me this favor i must have recourse to my old method and will copy after an almanac which i have by me and which i think was made for the year when the great storm was i am  sir the most humble of your admirers t philomath   this gentleman does not consider what a strange appearance his almanac would make to the ignorant should he transpose his weather as he must do did he follow the dictates of my glass what would the world say to see summers filled with clouds and storms and winters with calms and sunshine according to the variations of the weather as they might accidentally appear in a state barometer but let that be as it will i shall apply my own invention to my own use and if i do not make my fortune by it it will be my own fault  the next letter comes to me from another selfinteressed solicitor  mr bickerstaff i am going to set up for a scrivener and have thought of a project which may turn both to your

manifest evils in the world of letters which i had overlooked but they open to me a very busy scene and it will require no small care and application to amend errors which are become so universal the affectation of politeness is exposed in this epistle with a great deal of wit and discernment so that whatever discourses i may fall into hereafter upon the subjects the writer treats of i shall at present lay the matter before the world without the least alteration from the words of my correspondent  to isaac bickerstaff esquire ir ere are some abuses among us of great conquence the reformation of which is pro our province though as far as i have been ant in your papers you have not yet considered them these are the deplorable ignorance that for some years has reigned among our english writers the great depravity of our taste and the continual corruption of our style i say nothing here of those who handle particular sciences divinity law physic and the like i mean the traders in history and politics and the belles lettres together with those by whom books are not translated but as the common expressions are done out of french latin or other language and made english i cannot but observe to you that till of late years a grubstreet book was always bound in sheepskin with suitable print and paper the price never above a shilling and taken off wholly by common tradesmen or country pedlars but now they appear in all sizes and shapes and in all places they are handed about from lapfulls in every coffeehouse to persons of quality are shown in westminster hall and the court of requests you may see them gilt and in royal paper of five or six hundred pages and rated accordingly i would engage to furnish you with a catalogue of english books published within the compass of seven years past which at the first hand would cost you a hundred pounds wherein you shall not be able to find ten lines together of common grammar or common sense  these two evils ignorance and want of taste have produced a third i mean the continual corruption of our english tongue which without some timely remedy will suffer more by the false refinements of twenty years past tha  has been improved in the foregoing hu and this is what i design chiefly to  upon leaving the former evils to your aversion  but instead of giving you a list of  refinements crept into our language  send you the copy of a letter i recei  time ago from a most accomplished person in this way of writing upon which i shall make some remarks it is in these terms sir i could nt get the things you sent for all about town  i thot to have come down my self and then i would h bot um but i have not dont and i believe i cannot dt that is pozz  tom begins to gimself airs because he is going with the plenipos  it is said the french king will bamboozl us again which causes many speculations the jacks and others of that kidney are very uppish and alert upon it as you may see by their phizzs  will hazard has got the hipps having lost to the tune of five hundrd pound tho he understands play very well no body better he has promist me upon rep to leave off play but you know it is a weakness he is too apt to give into tho he has as much wit as any man no body more he has lain incog ever since  the mobs very quiet with us now  i believe you thot i banterd you in my last like a country put  i shant leave town this month etc     this letter is in every point an admirable pattern of the present polite way of writing nor is it of less authority for being an epistle you may gather every flower in it with a thousand more of equal sweetness from the books pamlets and single papers offered us every day in  coffeehouses and these are the beauties inced to supply the want of wit sense hu and learning which formerly were look n as qualifications for a writer if a  wit who died forty years ago were  om the grave on purpose how would  le to read this letter and after he had  ugh that difficulty how would he be able to understand it the first thing that strikes your eye is the breaks at the end of almost every sentence of which i know not the use only that it is a refinement and very frequently practiced then you will observe the abbreviations and elisions by which consonants of most obdurate sound are joined together without one softening vowel to intervene and all this only to make one syllable of two directly contrary to the example of the greeks and romans altogether of the gothic strain and a natural tendency toward relapsing into barbarity which delights in monosyllables and uniting of mute consonants as it is observable in all the northern languages and this is still more visible in the next refinement which consists in pronouncing the first syllable in a word that has many and dismissing the rest such as phizz hipps mobb pozz rep and many more when we are already overloaded with monosyllables which are the disgrace of our language thus we cram one syllable and cut off the rest as the owl fattened her mice after she had bit off their legs to prevent them from running away and if ours be the same reason for maiming our words it will certainly answer the end for i am sure no other nation will desire to borrow them some words are hitherto but fairly split and therefore only in their way to perfection as incog and plenipo but in a short time it is to be hoped they will be further dockd to inc and plen this reflection has made me of late years very impatient for a peace which i believe would save the lives of many brave words as well as men the war has introduced abundance of polysyllables which will never be able to live many more campaigns speculations operations preliminaries ambassadors pallisadoes communication circumvallation battalions as numerous as they are if they attack us too frequently in our coffeehouses we shall certainly put them to flight and cut off the rear  the third refinement observable in the letter i send you consists in the choice of certain words invented by some pretty fellows such as banter bamboozle country put and kidney as it is there applied some of which are now struggling for the vogue and others are in possession of it i have done my utmost for some years past to stop the progress of mobb and banter but have been plainly born down by numbers and betrayed by those who promised to assist me  in the last place you are to take notice of certain choice phrases scattered through the letter some of them tolerable enough till they were worn to rags by servile imitators you might easily find them though they were not in a different print and therefore i need not disturb them  these are the false refinements in our style which you ought to correct first by argument and fair means but if those fail i think you are to make use of your authority as censor and by an annual index expurgatorius expunge all words and phrases that are offensive to good sense and condemn those barbarous mutilations of vowels and syllables in this last point the usual pretense is that they spell as they speak a noble standard for language to depend upon the caprice of every coxcomb who because words are the clothing of our thoughts cuts them out and shapes them as he pleases and changes them oftener than his dress i believe all reasonable people would be content that such refiners were more sparing in their words and liberal in their syllables and upon this head i should be glad you would bestow some advice upon several young readers in our churches who coming up from the university full freight with admiration of our town politeness will needs correct the style of their prayerbooks in reading the absolution they are very careful to say pardons and absolves and in the prayer for the royal family it must be endueum enrichum prosperum and bringum then in their sermons they use all the modern terms of art sham banter mob bubble bully cutting shuffling and palming all which and many more of the like stamp as i have heard them often in the pulpit from such young sophisters so i have read them in some of those sermons that have made most noise of late the design it seems is to avoid the dreadful imputation of pedantry to show us that they know the town understand men and manners and have not been poring upon old unfashionable books in the university  i should be glad to see you the instrument of introducing into our style that simplicity which is the best and truest ornament of most things in life which the politer ages always aimed at in their building and dress simplex munditiis as well as their productions of wit it is manifest that all new affected modes of speech whether borrowed from the court the town or the theater are the first perishing parts in any language and as i could prove by many hundred instances have been so in ours the writings of hooker who was a country clergyman and of parsons the jesuit both in the reign of queen elizabeth are in a style that with very few allowances would not offend any present reader much more clear and intelligible than those of sir h wootton sir rob naunton osborn daniel the historian and several others who writ later but being men of the court and affecting the phrases then in fashion they are often either not to be understood or appear perfectly ridiculous  what remedies are to be applied to these evils i have not room to consider having i fear already taken up most of your paper besides i think it is our office only to represent abuses and yours to redress them i am with great respect  sir your etc

we have indulged our selves in them become incorrigible we have a sort of proverbial expression of taking a woman down in her wedding shoes if you would bring her to reason an early behavior of this sort had a very remarkable good effect in a family wherein i was several years an intimate acquaintance  a gentleman in lincolushire had four daughters three of which were early married very happily but the fourth though no way inferior to any of her sisters either in person or accomplishments had from her infancy discovered so imperious a temper usually called a high spirit that it continually made great uneasiness in the family became her known character in the neighborhood and deterred all her lovers from declaring themselves however in process of time a gentleman of a plentiful fortune and long acquaintance having observed that quickness of spirit to be her only fault made his addresses and obtained her consent in due form the lawyers finished the writings in which by the way there was no pinmoney and they were married after a decent time spent in the fathers house the bridegroom went to prepare his seat for her reception during the whole course of his courtship though a man of the most equal temper he had artificially lamented to her that he was the most passionate creature breathing by this one intimation he at once made her understand warmth of temper to be what he ought to pardon in her as well as that he alarmed her against that constitution in himself she at the same time thought her self highly obliged by the composed behavior which he maintained in her presence thus far he with great success soothed her from being guilty of violences and still resolved to give her such a terrible apprehension of his fiery spirit that she should never dream of giving way to her own he returned on the day appointed for carrying her home but instead of a coach and six horses together with the gay equipage suitable to the occasion he appeared without a servant mounted on the skeleton of a horse which his huntsman had the day before brought in to feast his dogs on the arrival of their new mistress with a pillion fixed behind and a case of pistols before him attended only by a favorite hound thus equipped he in a very obliging but somewhat positive manner desired his lady to seat her self on the cushion which done away they crawled the road being obstructed by a gate the dog was commanded to open it the poor cur looked up and wagged his tail but the master to show the impatience of his temper drew a pistol and shot him dead he had no sooner done it but he fell into a thousand apologies for his unhappy rashness and begged as many pardons for his excesses before one for whom he had so profound a respect soon after their steed stumbled but with some difficulty recovered however the bridegroom took occasion to swear if he frighted his wife so again he would run him through and alas the poor animal being now almost tired made a second trip immediately on which the careful husband alights and with great ceremony first takes off his lady then the accoutrements draws his sword and saves the huntsman the trouble of killing him then says to his wife child prithee take up the saddle which she readily did and tugged it home where they found all things in the greatest order suitable to their fortune and the present occasion some time after the father of the lady gave an entertainment to all his daughters and their husbands where when the wives were retired and the gentleman passing a toast about our last married man took occasion to observe to the rest of his brethren how much to his great satisfaction he found the world mistaken as to the temper of his lady for that she was the most meek and humble woman breathing the applause was received with a loud laugh but as a trial which of them would appear the most master at home he proposed they should all by turns send for their wives down to them a servant was dispatched and answer was made by one tell him i will come by and by another that she would come when the cards were out of her hand and so on but no sooner was her husbands desire whispered in the ear of our last married lady but the cards were clapped on the table and down she comes with my dear would you speak with me he receives her in his arms and after repeated caresses tells her the experiment confesses his good nature and assures her that since she could now command her temper he would no longer disguise his own  i received the following letter with a dozen of wine and cannot but do justice to the liquor and give my testimony that i have tried it upon several of my acquaintance who were given to impertinent abbreviations with great success  mr bickerstaff i send you by this bearer and not per

complain of in your last the very first draught of it has some effect upon the speech of the drinker and restores all the letters taken away by the elisions so justly complained of will hazard was

upholsterer who i observed had long absented himself from the bench at the upper end of the mall having not seen him for some time i was in fear i should soon hear of his death especially since he never appeared though the noons have been of late pretty warm and the councils at that place very full from the hour of twelve to three which the sages of that board employ in conference while the unthinking part of mankind are eating and drinking for the support of their own private persons without any regard to the public  sir i should have waited on you very frequently to have discoursed you upon some matters of moment but that i love to be well informed in the subject upon which i consult my friends before i enter into debate with them i have therefore with the utmost care and pains applied my self to the reading all the writings and pamphlets which have come out since the trial and have studied night and day in order to be master of the whole controversy but the authors are so numerous and the state of affairs alters so very fast that i am now a fortnight behindhand in my reading and know only how things stood twelve days ago i wish you would enter into those useful subjects for if i may be allowed to say so these are not times to jest in as for my own part you know very well that i am of a public spirit and never regarded my own interest but looked further and let me tell you that while some people are minding only themselves and families and others are thinking only of their own country thing go on strangely in the north i foresee very great evils arising from the neglect of transactions at a distance for which reason i am now writing a letter to a friend in the country which i design as an answer to the czar of muscovys letter to the grand signior concerning his majesty of sweden i have endeavored to prove that it is not reasonable to expect that his swedish majesty should leave bender without forty thousand men and i have added to this an apology for the cossacks but the matter multiplies upon me and i grow dim with much writing therefore desire if you have an old green pair of spectacles such as you used about your fiftieth year that you send them to me as also that you would please to desire mr morphew to send me in a bushel of coals on the credit of my answer to his czarian majesty for i design it shall be printed for morphew and the weather grows sharp i shall take it kindly if you would order him also to send me the papers as they come out if there are no fresh pamphlets published i compute that i shall know before the end of next month what has been done in town to this day if it were not for an ill custom lately introduced by a certain author of talking latin at the beginning of papers matters would be in a much clearer light than they are but to our comfort there are solid writers who are not guilty of this pedantry the postman writes like an angel the moderator is fine reading it would do you no harm to read the postboy with attention he is very deep of late he is instructive but i confess a little satirical a sharp pen he cares not what he says the examiner is admirable and is become a grave and substantial author but above all i am at a loss how to govern my self in my judgment of those whose whole writings consist in interrogatories and then the way of answering by proposing questions as hard to them is quite as extraordinary as for my part i tremble at these novelties we expose in my opinion our affairs too much by it you may be sure the french king will spare no cost to come at the

in the examiner to be spurious     this unhappy correspondent whose fantastical loyalty to the king of sweden has reduced him to this low condition of reason and fortune would appear much more monstrous in his madness did we not see crowds very little above his circumstances from the same cause a passion to politics  it is no unpleasant entertainment to consider the commerce even of the sexes interrupted by difference in state affairs a wench and her gallant parted last week upon the words unlimited and passive and there is such a jargon of terms got into the mouths of the very silliest of the women that you cannot come into a room even among them but you find them divided into whig and tory what heightens the humor is that all the hard words they know they certainly suppose to be terms useful in the disputes of the parties i came in this day where two were in very hot debate and one of them proposed to me to explain to them what was the difference between circumcision and predestination you may be sure i was at a loss but they were too angry at each other to wait for my explanation but proceeded to lay open the whole state of affairs instead of the usual topics of dress gallantry and scandal  i have often wondered how it should be possible that this turn to politics should so universally prevail to the exclusion of every other subject out of conversation and upon mature consideration find it is for want of discourse look round you among all the young fellows you meet and you see those who have least relish for books company or pleasure though they have no manner of qualities to make them succeed in those pursuits shall make very passable politicians thus the most barren invention shall find enough to say to make one appear an able man in the topcoffeehouses it is but adding a certain vehemence in uttering your self let the thing you say be never so flat and you shall be thought a very sensible man if you were not too hot as love and honor are the noblest motives of life so the pretenders to them without being animated by them are the most contemptible of all sorts of pretenders the unjust affectation of any thing that is laudable is ignominious in proportion to the worth of the thing we affect thus as love of ones country is the most glorious of all passions to see the most ordinary tools in a nation give themselves airs that way without any one good quality in their own life has something in it romantic yet not so ridiculous as odious  advertisement mr bickerstaff has received silvias letter from the bath and his sister is

ter pure lecto poterunt recreare libello hor from tuesd october   to thursd october      0 from my own apartment october   when the mind has been perplexed with anxious cares and passions the best method of bringing it to its usual state of tranquillity is as much as we possibly can to turn our thoughts to the adversities of persons of higher consideration in virtue and merit than our selves by this means all the little incidents of our own lives if they are unfortunate seem to be the effect of justice upon our faults and indiscretions when those whom we know to be excellent and deserving of a better fate are wretched we cannot but resign our selves whom most of us know to merit a much worse state than that we are placed in for such and many other occasions there is one admirable relation which one might recommend for certain periods of ones life to touch comfort and improve the heart of man tully says somewhere the pleasures of an husbandman are next to those of a philosopher in like manner one may say for methinks they bear the same proportion one to another the pleasures of humanity are next to those of devotion in both these latter satisfactions there is a certain humiliation which exalts the soul above its ordinary state at the same time that it lessens our value of our selves it enlarges our estimation of others the history i am going to speak of is that of joseph in holy writ which is related with such majestic simplicity that all the parts of it strike us with strong touches of nature and compassion and he must be a stranger to both who can read it with attention and not be overwhelmed with the vicissitudes of joy and sorrow i hope it will not be a profanation to tell it ones own way here that they who may be unthinking enough to be more frequently readers of such papers as this than of sacred writ may be advertised that the greatest pleasures the imagination can be entertained with are to be found there and that even the style of the scriptures is more than humane  joseph a beloved child of israel became invidious to his elder brethren for no other reason but his superior beauty and excellence of body and mind insomuch that they could not bear his growing virtue and let him live they therefore conspire his death but nature pleaded so strongly for him in the heart of one of them that by his persuasion they determined rather to bury him in a pit than be his immediate executioners with their own hands when thus much was obtained for him their minds still softened toward him and they took the opportunity of some passengers to sell him into egypt israel was persuaded by the artifice of his sons that the youth was torn to pieces by wild beasts but joseph was sold to slavery and still exposed to new misfortunes from the same cause as before his beauty and his virtue by a false accusation he was committed to prison but in process of time delivered from it in consideration of his wisdom and knowledge and made the governor of pharaohs house in this elevation of his fortune his brothers were sent into egypt to buy necessaries of life in a famine as soon as they are brought into his presence he beholds but he beholds with compassion the men who had sold him to slavery approaching him with awe and reverence while he was looking over his brethren he takes a resolution to indulge himself in the pleasure of stirring their and his own affections by keeping himself concealed and examining into the circumstances of their family for this end with an air of severity as a watchful minister to pharaoh he accuses them as spies who are come into egypt with designs against the state this led them into the account which he wanted of them the condition of their ancient father and little brother whom they had left behind them when he had learned that his brother was living he demands the bringing him to egypt as a proof of their veracity  but it would be a vain and empty endeavor to attempt laying this excellent representation of the passions of man in the same colors as they appear in the sacred writ in any other manner or almost any other words than those made use of in the page it self i am obliged therefore to turn my designed narration rather into a comment upon the several parts of that beautiful and passionate scene when joseph expects to see benjamin how natural and how forcible is the reflection this affliction is come upon us in that we saw the anguish of our brothers soul without pity how moving must it be to joseph to hear reuben accuse the rest that they would not hear what he pleaded in behalf of his innocence and distress he turns from them and weeps but commands his passion so far as to give orders for binding one of them in the presence of the rest while he at leisure observed their different sentiments and concern in their gesture and countenance when benjamin is demanded in bondage for stealing the cup with what force and what resignation does judah address his brother  in what words shall i speak to my lord with what confidence can i say any thing our guilt is but too apparent we submit to our fate we are my lords servants both we and he also with whom the cup is found when that is not accepted how pathetically does he recapitulate the whole story and approaching nearer to joseph delivers himself as follows which if we fix our thoughts upon the relation between the pleader and the judge it is impossible to read without tears  sir let me intrude so far upon you even in the high condition in which you are and the miserable one in which you see me and my brethren to inform you of the circumstances of us unhappy men that prostrate our selves before you when we were first examined by you you enquired for what reason my lord enquired we know not but you enquired whether we had not a father or a brother we then acquainted you that we had a father an old man who had a child of his old age and had buried another son whom he had by the same woman you were pleased to command us to bring the child he had remaining down to you we did so and he has forfeited his liberty but my father said to us you know that my wife bare me two sons one of them was torn in pieces if mischief befall this also it will bring my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave accept therefore oh my lord me for your bondman and let the lad return with his brethren that i may not see the evil that shall come on my father here josephs passion grew too great for further disguise and he reveals himself with exclamations of transport and tenderness  after their recovery from their first astonishment his brethren were seized with fear for the injuries they had done him but how generously does he keep them in countenance and make an apology for them be not angry with your selves for selling me hither call it not so but think providence sent me before you to preserve life  it would be endless to go through all the beauties of this sacred narrative but any who shall read it at an hour when he is disengaged from all other regard or interests than what arise from it will feel the alternate passion of a father a brother and a son so warm in him that they will incline him to exert himself in such of those characters as happen to be his much above the ordinary course of his life   the tatler no     from thursd october   to saturd october      0 from my own apartment

see them lazy he that has so much to struggle with as the man who pretends to censure others must keep up his fire for an onset and may be allowed to carry his arms a little carelessly upon an ordinary march this paper therefore shall be taken up by my correspondents two of which have sent me the two following plain but sensible and honest letters upon subjects no less important than those of education and devotion  sir i am an old man retired from all acquaintance with the town but what i have from your papers not the worst entertainment of my solitude yet being still a wellwisher to my country and the commonwealth of learning a qua confitcor nullam aetatis meae partem abhorruisse and hoping the plain phrase in writing that was current in my younger days would have lasted for my time i was startled at the picture of modern politeness transmitted by your ingenious correspondent and grieved to see our sterling english language fallen into the hands of clippers and coyners that mutilated epistle consisting of hippo reps and suchlike enormous curtailings was a mortifying spectacle but with the reserve of comfort to find this and other abuses of our mother tongue so pathetically complained of and to the proper person for redressing them the censor of great britain  he had before represented the deplorable ignorance that for several years past has reigned amongst our english writers the great depravity of our taste and continual corruption of our style but sir before you give your self the trouble of prescribing remedies for these distempers which you own will require the greatest care and application give me leave having long had my eye upon these mischiefs and thoughts exercised about them to mention what i humbly conceive to be the cause of them and in your friend horaces words quo font derivata clades in patriam populumque fluxit  i take our corrupt ways of writing to proceed from the mistakes and wrong measures in our common methods of education which i always looked upon as one of our national grievances and a singularity that renders us no less than our situation  penitus toto divisos orb britannos this puts me upon consulting the most celebrated critics on that subject to compare our practice with their precepts and find where it was that we came short or went wide  but after all i found our case required something more than these doctors had directed and the principal defect of our english discipline to lie in the initiatory part which although it needs the greatest care and skill is usually left to the conduct of those blind guides viz chance and ignorance  i shall trouble you with but a single instance pursuant to what your sagacious friend has said that he could furnish you with a catalogue of english books that would cost you a hundred pounds at first hand wherein you could not find ten lines together of common grammar which is a necessary consequence of our mismanagement in that province  for can any thing be more absurd than our way of proceeding in this part of literature to push tender wits into the intricate mazes of grammar and a latin grammar to learn an unknown art by an unknown tongue to carry them a dark roundabout way to let them in at a backdoor whereas by teaching them first the grammar of their mother tongue so easy to be learned their advance to the grammars of latin and greek would be gradual and easy but our precipitate way of hurrying them over such a gulf before we have built them a bridge to it is a shock to their weak understandings which they seldom or very late recover in the mean time we wrong nature and slander infants who want neither capacity nor will to learn till we put them upon service beyond their strength and then indeed we baulk them  the liberal arts and sciences are all beautiful as the graces nor has grammar the severe mother of all so frightful a face of her own it is the vizard put upon it that scares children she is made to speak hard words that to them sound like conjuring let her talk intelligibly and they will listen to her  in this i think as on other accounts we show our selves true britains always overlooking our natural advantages it has been the practice of wisest nations to learn their own language by stated rules to avoid the confusion that would follow from leaving it to vulgar use our english tongue says a learned man is the most determinate in its construction and reducible to the fewest rules whatever language has less grammar in it is not intelligible and whatever has more all that it has more is superfluous for which reasons he would have it made the foundation of learning latin and all other languages  to speak and write without absurdity the language of ones country is commendable in persons of all stations and to some indispensibly necessary and to this purpose i would recommend above all things the having a grammar of our mother tongue first taught in our schools which would facilitate our youths learning their latin and greek grammars with spare time for arithmetic astronomy cosmography history etc that would make them pass the spring of their life with profit and pleasure that is now miserably spent in grammatical perplexities  but here methinks i see the reader smile and ready to ask me as the lawyer did sexton diego on his bequeathing rich legacies to the poor of the parish where are these mighty sums to be raised where is there such a grammar to be had i will not answer as he did even where your worship pleases no it is our good fortune to have such a grammar with notes now in the press and to be published next term  i hear it is a chargeable work and wish the publisher to have customers of all that have need of such a book yet fancy that he cannot be much a sufferer if it is only bought by all that have more need for it than they think they have  a certain author brought a poem to mr cowley for his perusal and judgment of the performance which he demanded at the next visit with a poetasters assurance and mr cowley with his usual modesty desired that he would be pleased to look a little to the grammar of it to the grammar of it what do you mean sir would you send me to school again why mr h  would it do you any harm  this put me on considering how this voyage of literature may be made with more safety and profit expedition and delight and at last for completing so good a service to request your directions in so deplorable a case hoping that as you have had compassion on our overgrown coxcombs in concerns of less consequence you will exert your charity toward innocents and vouchsafe to be guardian to the children and youth of great britain in this important affair of education wherein mistakes and wrong measures have so often occasioned their aversion to books that had otherwise proved the chief ornament and pleasure of their life i am with sincerest respect  sir your etc   st cl  nts oct   mr bickerstaff i observe as the season

astrum hor from saturd october   to tuesday october  0    0 from my own apartment october   among those inclinations which are common to all men there is none more unaccountable than that unequal love by which parents distinguish their children from each other sometimes vanity and selflove appear to have a share toward this effect and in other instances i have been apt to attribute it to mere instinct but however that is we frequently see the child that has been beholden to neither of these impulses in their parents in spite of being neglected snubbed and thwarted at home acquire a behavior which makes it as agreeable to all the rest of the world as that of every one else of their family is to each other i fell into this way of thinking from an intimacy which i have with a very good house in our neighborhood where there are three daughters of a very different character and genius the eldest has a great deal of wit and cunning the second has good sense but no artifice the third has much vivacity but little understanding the first is a fine but scornful woman the second is not charming but very winning the third no way commendable but very desirable the father of these young creatures was ever a great pretender to wit the mother a woman of as much coquettry this turn in the parents has biassed their affections toward their children the old man supposes the eldest of his own genius and the mother looks upon the youngest as her self renewed by this means all the lovers that approach the house are discarded by the father for not observing mrs marys wit and beauty and by the mother for being blind to the mien and air of mrs biddy come never so many pretenders they are not suspected to have the least thoughts of mrs betty the middle daughter betty therefore is mortified into a woman of a great deal of merit and knows she must depend on that only for her advancement the middlemost is thus the favorite of all her acquaintance as well as mine while the other two carry a certain insolence about them in all conversations and expect the partiality which they meet with at home to attend them wherever they appear so little do parents understand that they are of all people the least judges of their childrens merit that what they reckon such is seldom any thing else but a repetition of their own faults and infirmities  there is methinks some excuse for being particular when one of the offspring has any defect in nature in this case the child if we may so speak is so much the longer the child of its parents and calls for the continuance of their care and indulgence from the slowness of its capacity or the weakness of its body but there is no enduring to see men enamoured only at the sight of their own impertinencies repeated and to observe as we may sometimes that they have a secret dislike of their children for a degeneracy from their very crimes commend me to lady goodly she is equal to all her own children but prefers them to those of all the world beside my lady is a perfect hen in the care of her brood she fights and squabbles with all that appear where they come but is wholly unbiassed in dispensing her favors among them it is no small pains she is at to defame all the young women in her neighborhood by visits whispers intimations and hearsays all which she ends with thanking heaven that no one living is so blessed with such obedient and well inclined children as her self perhaps says she betty cannot dance like mrs frontinett and it is no great matter whether she does or not but she comes into a room with a good grace though she says it that should not she looks like a gentlewoman then if mrs rebecca is not so talkative as the mighty wit mrs clapper yet she is discreet she knows better what she says when she does speak if her wit be slow her tongue never runs before it this kind parent lifts up her eyes and hands in congratulation of her own good fortune and is maliciously thankful that none of her girls are like any of her neighbors but this preference of her own to all others is grounded upon an impulse of nature while those who like one before another of their own are so unpardonably unjust that it could hardly be equalled in the children though they preferred all the rest of the world to such parents it is no unpleasant entertainment to see a ball at a dancingschool and observe the joy of relations when the young ones for whom they are concerned are in motion you need not be told whom the dancers belong to at their first appearance the passion of their parents are in their faces and there is always a nod of approbation stolen at a good step or a graceful turn  i remember among all my acquaintance but one man whom i have thought to live with his children with equanimity and a good grace he had three sons and one daughter whom he bred with all the care imaginable in a liberal and ingenuous way i have often heard him say he had the weakness to love one much better than the other but that he took as much pains to correct that as any other criminal passion that could arise in his mind his method was to make it the only pretension in his children to his favor to be kind to each other and he would tell them that he who was the best brother he would reckon the best son this turned their thoughts into an emulation for the superiority in kind and tender affection toward each other the boys behaved themselves very early with a manly friendship and their sister instead of the gross familiarities and impertinent freedoms in behavior usual in other houses was always treated by them with as much complaisance as any other young lady of their acquaintance it was an unspeakable pleasure to visit or sit at meal in that family i have often seen the old mans heart flow at his eyes with joy upon occasions which would appear indifferent to such as were strangers to the turn of his mind but a very slight accident wherein he saw his childrens good will to one another created in him the godlike pleasure of loving them because they loved each other this great command of himself in hiding his first impulse to partiality at last improved to a steady justice toward them and that which at first was but an expedient to correct his weakness was afterward the measure of his virtue  the truth of it is those parents who are interested in the care of one child more than that of another no longer deserve the name of parents but are in effect as childish as their children in having such unreasonable and ungoverned inclinations a father of this sort has degraded himself into one of his own offspring for none but a child would take part in the passions of children  the tatler no     nescio qua natale solum dulcedine mentem tangit and immemorem non sinit esse sui ovid from tuesday october  0 to thursday october       0 from my own apartment october    i find in the registers of my family that the branch of the bickerstaffs from which i am descended came originally out of ireland this has given me a kind of natural affection for that country it is therefore with pleasure that i see not only some of the greatest warriors but also of the greatest wits to be natives of that kingdom the gentleman who writes the following letter is one of these last the matter of fact contained in it is literally true though the diverting manner in which it is told may give it the color of a fable  to isaac bickerstaff esquire at his house in great britain dublin sir finding by several passages of your tatlers that you are a person curious in natural knowledge i thought it would not be unacceptable to you to give you the following history of the migration of frogs into this country there is an ancient tradition among the wild philosophers of the kingdom that this whole island was once as much infested by frogs as that wherein whittington made his fortune was by mice insomuch that it is said mackdonald the first could no more sleep by reason of these dutch nightingales as they are called at paris than pharaoh could when they croaked in his bedchamber it was in the reign of this great monarch that st patrick arrived in ireland being as famous for destroying vermin as any ratcatcher of our times if we may believe the tradition he killed more in one day than a flock of storks could have done in a twelvemonth from that time for about five hundred years there was not a frog to be heard in ireland notwithstanding the bogs still remained which in former ages had been so plentifully stocked with those inhabitants  when the arts began to flourish in the reign of king charles the second and that great monarch had placed himself at the head of the royal society to lead them forward into the discoveries of nature it is said that several proposals were laid before his majesty for the importing of frogs into ireland in order to it a virtuoso of known abilities was unanimously elected by the society and entrusted with the whole management of that affair for this end he took along with him a sound ablebodied frog of a strong hale constitution that had given proofs of his vigor by several leaps which he made before that learned body they took ship and sailed together till they came within sight of the hill of hoath before the frog discovered any symptoms of being indisposed by his voyage but as the wind chopped about and began to blow from the irish coast he grew seasick or rather landsick for his learned companion ascribed it to the particles of the soil with which the wind was impregnated he was confirmed in his conjecture when upon the winds turning about his fellow traveller sensibly recovered and continued in good health till his arrival upon the shore where he suddenly relapsed and expired upon a rings end car in his way to dublin the same experiment was repeated several times in that reign but to no purpose a frog was never known to take three leaps upon irish turf before he stretched himself out and died  whether it were that the philosophers on this side the water despaired of ocking the island with this useful animal or whether in the following reign it was not thought proper to undo the miracle of a popish saint i do not hear of any further progress made in this affair till about two years after the battle of the boyne  it was then that an ingenious physician to the honor as well as improvement of his native country performed what the english had been so long attempting in vain this learned man with the hazard of his life made a voyage to leverpool where he filled several barrels with the choicest spawn of frogs that could be found in those parts this cargo he brought over very carefully and afterward disposed of it in several warm beds that he thought most capable of bringing it to life the doctor was a very ingenious physician and a very good protestant for which reason to show his zeal against popery he placed some of the most promising spawn in the very fountain that is dedicated to the saint and known by the name of st patricks well where these animals had the impudence to make their first appearance they have since that time very much increased and multiplied in all the neighborhood of this city we have here some curious enquirers into natural history who observe their motions with a design to compute in how many years they will be able to hop from dublin to wexford though as i am informed not one of them has yet passed the mountains of wicklow  i am further informed that several grasiers of the county of cork have entered into a project of planting a colony in those parts at the instance of the french protestants and i know not but the same design may be on foot in other parts of the kingdom if the wisdom of the british nation do not think fit to prohibit the further importation of english frogs i am  sir your most humble servant t b   there is no study more becoming a rational creature than that of natural philosophy but as several of our modern virtuosos manage it their speculations do not so much tend to open and enlarge the mind as to contract and fix it upon trifles  this in england is in a great measure owing to the worthy elections that are so frequently made in our royal society they seem to be in a confederacy against men of polite genius noble thought and diffusive learning and choose into their assemblies such as have no pretense to wisdom but want of wit or to natural knowledge but ignorance of every thing else i have made observations in this matter so long that when i meet with a young fellow that is an humble admirer of the sciences but more dull than the rest of the company i conclude him to be a fellow of the royal society  the tatler no     in nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas corpora  ovid from thursd october    to saturd october       0 from my own apartment october    coming home last night before my usual hour i took a book into my hand in order to divert my self with it till bedtime milton chanced to be my author whose admirable poem of paradise lost serves at once to fill the mind with pleasing ideas and with good thoughts and was therefore the most proper book for my purpose i was amusing my self with that beautiful passage in which the poet represents eve sleeping by adams side with the devil sitting at her ear and inspiring evil thoughts under the shape of a toad ithuriel one of the guardian angels of the place walking his nightly rounds saw the great enemy of mankind hid in this loathsome animal which he touched with his spear this spear being of a celestial temper had such a secret virtue in it that whatever it was applied to immediately flung off all disguise and appeared in its natural figure i am afraid the reader will not pardon me if i content my self with explaining the passage in prose without giving it in the authors own inimitable words   on he led his radiant files dazzling the morn these to the bower direct in search of whom they sought him there they found squat like a toad close at the ear of eve essaying by his devilish art to reach the organs of her fancy and with them forge illusions as he list phantasms and dreams or if inspiring venom he might taint the animal spirits that from pure blood arise like gentle breaths from rivers pure thence raise at least distempered discontented thoughts vain hopes vain aims inordinate destres blown up with high conceits ingendring pride him thus intent ithuriel with his spear touched lightly for no falsehood can endure touch of celestial temper but returns of force to his own likeness up he starts discovered and surpised as when a spark lights on a heap of nitrous powder laid fit for the tun some magazine to store against a rumored war the smutty grain with sudden blaze diffused inflames the air so started up in his own shape the fiend i could not forbear thinking how happy a man would be in the possession of this spear or what an advantage it would be to a minister of state were he master of such a white staff it would let him discover his friends from his enemies men of abilities from pretenders it would hinder him from being imposed upon by appearances and professions and might be made use of as a kind of state test which no artifice could elude  these thoughts made very lively impressions on my imagination which were improved instead of being defaced by sleep and produced in me the following dream i was no sooner fallen asleep but methoughts the angel ithuriel appeared to me and with a smile that still added to his celestial beauty made me a present of the spear which he held in his hand and disappeared to make trial of it i went into a place of public resort  the first person that passed by me was a lady that had a particular shyness in the cast of her eye and a more than ordinary reservedness in all the parts of her behavior she seemed to look upon man as an obscene creature with a certain scorn and fear of him in the height of her airs i touched her gently with my wand when to my unspeakable surprise she fell upon her back and kicked up her heels in such a manner as made me blush in my sleep as i was hasting away from this undisguised prude i saw a lady in earnest discourse with another and overheard her say with some vehemence never tell me of him for i am resolved to die a virgin i had a curiosity to try her but as soon as i laid my wand upon her head she immediately fell in labor my eyes were diverted from her by a man and his wife who walked near me hand in hand after a very loving manner i gave each of them a gentle tap and the next instant saw the woman in breeches and the man with a fan in his hand it would be tedious to describe the long series of metamorphoses that i entertained my self with in my nights adventure of whigs disguised in tories and tories in whigs men in red coats that denounced terror in their countenances trembling at the touch of my spear others in black with peace in their mouths but swords in their hands i could tell stories of noblemen changed into usurers and magistrates into beadles of freethinkers into penitents and reformers into whoremasters i must not however omit the mention of a grave citizen that passed by me with an huge clasped bible under his arm and a band of a most immoderate breadth but upon a touch on the shoulder he let drop his book and fell a picking my pocket  in the general i observed that those who appeared good often disappointed my expectation but that on the contrary those who appeared very bad still grew worse upon the experiment as the toad in milton which one would have thought the most deformed part of the creation at ithuriels stroke became more deformed and started up into a devil  among all the persons that i touched there was but one who stood the test of my wand and after many repetitions of the stroke stuck to his form and remained steady and fixed in his first appearance this was a young man who boasted of foul distempers wild debauches insults upon holy men and affronts to religion  my heart was extremely troubled at this vision the contemplation of the whole species so entirely sunk in corruption filled my mind with a melancholy that is inexpressible and my discoveries still added to my affliction  in the midst of these sorrows which i had in my heart methoughts there passed by me a couple of coaches with purple liveries there sat in each of them a person with a very venerable aspect at the appearance of them the people who were gathered round me in great multitudes divided into parties as they were disposed to favor either of those reverend persons the enemies of one of them begged me to touch him with my wand and assured me i should see his lawn converted into a cloak the opposite party told me with as much assurance that if i laid my wand upon the other i should see his garments embroidered with flowerdeluces and his head covered with a cardinals cap i made the experiment and to my great joy saw them both without any change distributing their blessings to the people and praying for those who had reviled them is it possible thought i that good men who are so few in number should be divided among themselves and give better quarter to the vicious that are in their party than the most strictly virtuous who are out of it are the ties of faction above those of religion  i was going on in my soliloquies but some sudden accident awakened me when i found my hand grasped but my spear gone the reflection on so very odd a dream made me figure to my self what a strange face the world would bear should all mankind appear in their proper shapes and characters without hypocrisy and disguise i am afraid the earth we live upon would appear to other intellectual beings no better than a planet peopled with monsters this should methinks inspire us with an honest ambition of recommending our selves to those invisible spies and of being what we would appear there was one circumstance in my foregoing dream which i at first intended to conceal but upon second thoughts i cannot look upon my self as a candid and impartial historian if i do not acquaint my reader that upon taking ithuriels spear into my hand though i was before an old decrepid fellow i appeared a very handsome jolly black man but i know my enemies will say this is praising my own beauty for which reason i will speak no

between two potentates of different sexes my ingenious kinsman mr humphry wagstaff who treats of every subject after a manner that no other author has done and better than any other can do has sent me the description of a city shower i do not question but the reader remembers my cousins description of the morning as it breaks in town which is printed in the  th tatler and is another exquisite piece

any man to criticize on the works of another who has not distinguished himself by his own performances a judge would make but an indifferent figure who had never been known at the bar cicero was reputed the greatest orator of his age and country before he wrote a book de oratore and horace the greatest poet before he published his art of poetry this observation arises naturally in any one who casts his eye upon this last mentioned author where he will find the criticisms placed in the latter end of his book that is after the finest odes and satyrs in the latin tongue  a modern whose name i shall not mention because i would not make a silly paper sell was born a critic and an examiner and like one of the race of the serpents teeth came into the world with a sword in his hand his works put me in mind of the story that is told of a german monk who was taking a catalogue of a friends library and meeting with a hebrew book in it entered it under the title of a book that has the beginning where the end should be this author in the last of his crudities has amassed together a heap of quotations to prove that horace and virgil were both of them modester men than my self and if his works were to live as long as mine they might possibly give posterity a notion that isaac bickerstaff was a very conceited old fellow and as vain a man as either tully or sir francis bacon had this serious writer fallen upon me only i could have overlooked it but to see cicero abused is i must confess what i cannot bear the censure he passes upon this great man runs thus the itch of being very abusive is almost inseparable from vainglory tully has these two faults in so high a degree that nothing but his being the best writer in the world can make amends for them the scurrilous wretch goes on to say i am as bad as tully his words are these and yet the tatler in his paper of september    has outdone him in both he speaks of himself with more arrogance and with more insolence of others i am afraid by his discourse this gentleman has no more read plutarch than he has tully if he had he would have observed a passage in that historian wherein he has with great delicacy distinguished between two passions which are usually complicated in humane nature and which an ordinary writer would not have thought of separating not having my greek spectacles by me i shall quote the passage word for word as i find it translated to my hand nevertheless though he was intemperately fond of his own praise yet he was very free from envying others and most liberally profuse in commending both the ancients and his contemporaries as is to be understood by his writings and many of those sayings are still recorded as that concerning aristotle that he was a river of flowing gold of plato s dialogue that if jupiter were to speak he would discourse as he did theophrastus he was wont to call his peculiar delight and being asked which of demosthenes his orations he liked best he answered the longest  and as for the eminent men of his own time either for eloquence or philosophy there was not one of them which he did not by writing or speaking favorably of render more illustrious  thus the critic tells us that cicero was excessively vainglorious and abusive plutarch that he was vain but not abusive let the reader believe which of them he pleases  after this he complains to the world that i call him names and that in my passion i said he was a flea a louse an owl a bat a small wit a scribbler and a nibbler when he has thus bespoken his readers pity he falls into that admirable vein of mirth which i shall set down at length it being an exquisite piece of raillery and written in great gaiety of heart after this list of names  viz flea louse owl bat etc i was surprised to hear him say that he has hitherto kept his temper pretty well i wonder how he will write when he has lost his temper i suppose as he now is very angry and unmannerly he will then be exceeding courteous and goodhumoured if i can outlive this raillery i shall be able to bear any thing  there is a method of criticism made use of by this author for i shall take care how i call him a scribbler again which may turn into ridicule any work that was ever written wherein there is a variety of thoughts this the reader will observe in the following words he meaning me is so intent upon being something extraordinary that he scarce knows what he would be and is as fruitful in his similes as a brother of his whom i lately took notice of in the compass of a few lines he compares himself to a fox to daniel burgess to the knight of the red cross to an oak with ivy about it and to a great man with an equipage i think my self as much honored by being joined in this part of his paper with the gentleman whom he here calls my brother as i am in the beginning of it by being mentioned with horace and virgil  it is very hard that a man cannot publish ten papers without stealing from himself but to show you that this is only a knack of writing and that the author is got into a certain road of criticism i shall set down his remarks on the works of the gentleman whom he here glances upon as they stand in his  th paper and desire the reader to compare them with the foregoing passage upon mine  in thirty lines his patron is a river the primum mobile a pilot a victim the sun any thing and nothing he bestows increase conceals his source makes the machine move teaches to steer expiates our offenses raises vapors and looks larger as he sets  what poem can be safe from this sort of criticism i think i was never in my life so much offended as at a wag whom i once met with in a coffeehouse he had in his hand one of the miscellanies and was reading the following short copy of verses which without flattery to the author is i think as beautiful in its kind as any one in the english tongue  flavia the least and flight est toy can with resistless art employ this fan in meaner hands would prove an engine of small force in love but she with such an air and mien not to be told or safely seen directs its wanton motions so that it wounds more than cupids bow gives coolness to the matchless dame to every other breast a flame when this coxcomb had done reading them heyday says he what instrument is this that flavia employs in such a manner as is not to be told nor safely seen in ten lines it is a toy a cupids bow a fan and an engine in love it has wanton motions it wounds it cools and inflames  such criticisms make a man of sense sick and a fool merry  the next paragraph of the paper we are talking of falls upon some body whom i am at a loss to guess at but i find the whole invective turns upon a man who it seems has been imprisoned for debt whoever he was i must heartily pity him but at the same time must put the examiner in mind that notwithstanding he is a critic he still ought to remember he is a christian poverty was never thought a proper subject for ridicule and i do not remember that i ever met with a satyr upon a beggar  as for those little retortings of my own expressions of being dull by design witty in october shining excelling and so forth they are the common cavils of every witlin who has no other method of showing his parts but by little variations and repetitions of the mans words whom he attacks  but the truth of it is the paper before me not only in this particular but in its very essence is like ovids echo   quae nec reticere loquenti nec prior ipsa loqui didicit  i should not have deserved the character of a censor had i not animadverted upon the abovementioned author by a gentle chastisement but i know my reader will not pardon me unless i declare that nothing of this nature for the future unless it be written with some wit shall divert me from my care of the public  the tatler no   0 ad populum phaleras  pers from thursd october    to saturd october       0 from my own apartment october  0 i do not remember that in any of my lucubrations i have touched upon that useful science of physic notwithstanding i have declared my self more than once a professor of it i have indeed joined the study of astrology with it because i never knew a physician recommend himself to the public who had not a sister art to embellish his knowledge in medicine it has been commonly observed in compliment to the ingenious of our profession that apollo was god of verse as well as physic and in all ages the most celebrated practitioners of our country were the particular favorites of the muses poetry to physic is indeed like the gilding to a pill it makes the art shine and covers the severity of the doctor with the agreeableness of the companion  the very foundation of poety is good sense if we may allow harace to be a judge of the art scribendi recte sapere est and principium and fons and if so we have reason to believe that the same man who writes well can prescribe well if he has applied himself to the study of both besides when we see a man making profession of two different sciences it is natural for us to believe he is no pretender in that which we are not judges of when we find him skilful in that which we understand  ordinary quacks and charlatans are thoroughly sensible how necessary it is to support themselves by these collateral assistances and therefore always lay their claim to some supernumerary accomplishments which are wholly foreign to their profession  about  0 years ago it was impossible to walk the streets without having an advertisement thrust into your hand of a doctor who was arrived at the knowledge of the green and red dragon and had discovered the female fern seed no body ever knew what this meant but the green and red dragon so amused the people that the doctor lived very comfortably upon them about the same time there was pasted a very hard word upon every corner of the streets this to the best of my remembrance was tetrachymagogon which drew great shoals of spectators about it who read the bill that it introduced with unspeakable curiosity and when they were sick would have no body but this learned man for their physician  i once received an advertisement of one who had studied thirty years by candlelight for the good of his countrymen he might have studied twice as long by daylight and never have been taken notice of but lucubrations cannot be overvalued there are some who have gained themselves great reputation for physic by their birth as the seventh son of a seventh son and others by not being born at all as the unborn doctor who i hear is lately gone the way of his patients having died worth five hundred pounds per annum though he was not born to a halfpenny  my ingenious friend doctor saffold succeeded my old contemporary doctor lilly in the studies both of physic and astrology to which he added that of poetry as was to be seen both upon the sign where he lived and in the bills which he distributed he was succeeded by doctor case who erased the verses of his predecessor out of the signpost and substituted in their stead two of his own which were as follow  within this place lives doctor case he is said to have got more by this distich than mr dryden did by all his works there would be no end of enumerating the several imaginary perfections and unaccountable artifices by which this tribe of men ensnare the minds of the vulgar and gain crowds of admirers i have seen the whole front of a mountebanks stage from one end to the other faced with patents certificates medals and great seals by which the several princes of europe have testified their particular respect and esteem for the doctor every great man with a sounding title has been his patient i believe i have seen twenty mountebanks that have given physic to the czar of moscovy the great duke of tuscany escapes no better the elector of brandenburg was likewise a very good patient  this great condescension of the doctor draws upon him much good will from his audience and it is ten to one but if any of them be troubled with an aching tooth his ambition will prompt him to get it drawn by a person who has had so many princes kings and emperors under his hands  i must not leave this subject without observing that as physicians are apt to deal in poetry apothecaries endeavor to recommend themselves by oratory and are therefore without controversy the most eloquent persons in the whole british nation i would not willingly discourage any of the arts especially that of which i am an humble professor but i must confess for the good of my native country i could wish there might be a suspension of physic for some years that our kingdom which has been so much exhausted by the wars might have leave to recruit it self  as for my self the only physic which has brought me safe to almost the age of man and which i prescribe to all my friends is abstinence this is certainly the best physic for prevention and very often the most effectual against a present distemper in short my recipe is take nothing  were the body politic to be physickd like particular persons i should venture to prescribe to it after the same manner i remember when our wholeisland was shaken with an earthquake some years ago there was an impudent mountebank who sold pills which as he told the country people were very good against an earthquake it may perhaps be thought as absurd to prescribe a diet for the allaying popular commotions and national ferments but i am verily persuaded that if in such a case a whole people were to enter into a course of abstinence and eat nothing but water gruel for a fortnight it would abate the rage and animosity of parties and not a little contribute to the cure of a distracted nation such a fast would have a natural tendency to the procuring of those ends for which a fast is usually proclaimed if any man has a mind to enter on such a voluntary abstinence it might not be improper to give him the caution of pythagoras in particular  abstine a fabis  abstain from beans that is say the interpreters meddle not with elections beans having been made use of by the voters among the athenians in the choice of magistrates  the tatler no     from saturd october    to tuesd october       0 from my own apartment october    a method of spending ones time agreeably is a thing so little studied that the common amusement of our young gentlemen especially of such as are at a distance from those of the first breeding is drinking this way of entertainment has custom of its side but as much as it has prevailed i believe there have been very few companies that have been guilty of excess this way where there have not happened more accidents which make against than for the continuance of it it is very common that events arise from a debauch which are fatal and always such as are disagreeable with all a mans reason and good sense about him his tongue is apt to utter things out of mere gaiety of heart which may displease his best friends who then would trust himself to the power of wine without saying more against it than that it raises the imagination and depresses the judgment were there only this single consideration that we are less masters of our selves when we drink in the least proportion above the exigencies of thirst i say were this all that could be objected it were sufficient to make us abhor this vice but we may go on to say that as he who drinks but a little is not master of himself so he who drinks much is a slave to himself as for my part i ever esteemed a drunkard of all vicious persons the most vicious for if our actions are to be weighed and considered according to the intention of them what can we think of him who puts himself into a circumstance wherein he can have no intention at all but incapacitates himself for the duties and offices of life by a suspension of all his faculties if a man considered that he cannot under the oppression of drink be a friend a gentleman a master or a subject that he has so long banished himself from all that is dear and given up all that is sacred to him he would even then think of a debauch with horror but when he looks still further and acknowledges that he is not only expelled out of all the relations of life but also liable to offend against them all what words can express the terror and detestation he would have of such a condition and yet he owns all this of himself who says he was drunk last night  as i have all along persisted in it that all the vicious in general are in a state of death so i think i may add to the nonexistence of drunkards that they died by their own hands he is certainly as guilty of suicide who perishes by a slow as he that is dispatched by an immediate poison in my last lucubration i proposed the general use of water gruel and hinted that it might not be amiss at this very season but as there are some whose cases in regard to their families will not admit of delay i have used my interest in several wards of the city that the wholesome restorative abovementioned may be given in tavern kitchens to all the mornings draught men within the walls when they call for wine before noon for a further restraint and mark upon such persons i have given orders that in all the offices where policies are drawn upon lives it shall be added to the article which prohibits that the nominee should cross the sea the words provided also that the abovementioned a b shall not drink before dinner during the term mentioned in this indenture  i am not without hopes but by this method i shall bring some unsizeable friends of mine into shape and breath as well as others who are languid and consumptive into health and vigor most of the selfmurderers whom i yet hinted at are such as preserve a certain regularity in taking their poison and make it mix pretty well with their food but the most conspicuous of those who destroy themselves are such as in their youth fall into this sort of debauchery and contract a certain uneasiness of spirit which is not to be diverted but by tippling as often as they can fall into company in the day and conclude with downright drunkenness at night these gentlemen never know the satisfaction of youth but skip the years of manhood and are decrepid soon after they are of age i was godfather to one of these old fellows he is now three and thirty which is the grand climacterick of a young drunkard i went to visit the crazy wretch this morning with no other purpose but to rally him under the pain and uneasiness of being sober  but as out faults are double when they affect others besides our selves so this vice is still more odious in a married than a single man he that is the husband of a woman of honor and comes home overloaded with wine is still more contemptible in proportion to the regard we have to the unhappy consort of his bestiality the imagination cannot shape to its self any thing more monstrous and unnatural than the familiarities between drunkenness and chastity the wretched astraea who is the perfection of beauty and innocence has long been thus condemned for life the romantic tales of virgins devoted to the jaws of the monsters have nothing in them so terrible as the gift of astraea to that bacchanal  the reflection of such a match as spotless innocence with abandoned lewdness is what puts this vice in the worst figure it can bear with regard to others but when it is looked upon with respect only to the drunkard himself it has deformities enough to make it disagreeable which may be summed up in a word by allowing that he who resigns his reason is actually guilty of all that he is liable to from the want of reason  p s among many other enormities there are two in the following letters which i think should be suddenly amended but since they are sins of omission only i shall not make remarks upon them till i find the delinquents persist in their errors and the inserting the letters themselves shall be all their present admonition  october    mr bickerstaff several that frequent divine service at s pauls as well as my self having with great satisfaction observed the good effect which your animadversion had on an excess in performance there it is requested that you will take notice of a contrary fault which is the unconcerned silence and the motionless postures of others who come thither if this custom prevails the congregation will resemble an audience at a playhouse or rather a dumb meeting of quakers your censuring such churchmutes in the manner you think

mr bickerstaff i was the other day in company with a gentleman who in reciting his own qualifications concluded every period with these words the best of any man in england thus for example he kept the best house of any man in england he understood this and that and the other the best of any man in england how harsh and ungrateful soever this expression might sound to one of my nation yet the gentleman was one whom it no ways became me to interrupt but perhaps a new term put into his bywords as they call a sentence a man particularly affects may cure him i therefore took a resolution to apply to you who i dare say can easily persuade this gentleman whom i cannot believe an enemy to the union to mend his phrase and be hereafter the wisest of any man in great britain i am  sir your most humble servant scoto britannus   advertisement whereas mr humphrey trelooby wearing his own hair a pair of buckskin breeches a huntingwhip with a new pair of spurs has complained to the censor

se juv from tuesday oct    to tursday oct       0 from my own apartment october    it was with very great displeasure i heard this day a man say of a companion of his with an air of approbation you know tom never fails of saying a spightful thing he has a great deal of wit but satyr is his particular talent did you mind how he put the young fellow out of countenance that pretended to talk to him such impertinent applauses which one meets with every day put me upon considering what true raillery and satyr were in themselves and this methought occurred to me from reflection upon the great and excellent persons that were admired for talents this way when i had ran over several such in my thoughts i concluded however unaccountable the assertion might appear at first sight that goodnature was an essential quality in a satyrist and that all the sentiments which are beautiful in this way of writing must proceed from that quality in the author goodnature produces a disdain of all baseness vice and folly which prompts them to express themselves with smartness against the errors of men without bitterness toward their persons this quality keeps the mind in equanimity and never lets an offense unseasonably throw a man out of his character when virgil said he that did not hate bavius might love maevius he was in perfect good humor and was not so much moved at their absurdities as passionately to call them sots or blockheads in a direct invective but laughed at them with a delicacy of scorn without any mixture of anger  the best good man with the worstnatured muse was the character among us of a gentleman as famous for his humanity as his wit  the ordinary subjects for satyr are such as incite the greatest indignation in the best tempers and consequently men of such a make are the best qualified for speaking of the offenses in humane life these men can behold vice and folly when they injure persons to whom they are wholly unacquainted with the same severity as others resent the ills they do themselves a goodnatured man cannot see an overbearing fellow put a bashful man of merit out of countenance or outstrip him in the pursuit of any advantage but he is on fire to succor the oppressed to produce the merit of the one and confront the impudence of the other  the men of the greatest character in this kind were horace and juvenal there is not that i remember one illnatured expression in all their writings not one sentence of severity which does not apparently proceed from the contrary disposition whoever reads them will i believe be of this mind and if they were read with this view it may possibly persuade our young fellows that they may be very witty men without speaking ill of any but those who deserve it but in the perusal of these writers it may not be unnecessary to consider that they lived in very different times horace was intimate with a prince of the greatest goodness and humanity imaginable and his court was formed after his example therefore the faults that poet falls upon were little inconsistencies in behavior false pretenses to politeness or impertinent affectations of what men were not fit for vices of a coarser sort could not come under his consideration or enter the palace of augustus juvenal on the other hand lived under domitian in whose reign every thing that was great and noble was banished the habitations of the men in power therefore he attacks vice as it passes by in triumph not as it breaks into conversation the fall of empire contempt of glory and a general degeneracy of manners are before his eyes in all his writings in the days of augustus to have talked like juvenal had been madness or in those of domitian like horace morality and virtue are every where recommended in horace as became a man in a polite court from the beauty the propriety the convenience of pursuing them vice and corruption are attacked by juvenal in a style which denotes he fears he shall not be heard without he calls to them in their own language with a barefaced mention of the villainies and obscenities of his contemporaries  this accidental talk of these two great men runs me from my design which was to tell some coxcombs that run about this town with the name of smart satirical fellows that they are by no means qualified for the characters they pretend to of being severe upon other men for they want goodnature there is no foundation in them for arriving at what they aim at and they may as well pretend to flatter as rail agreeably without being goodnatured  there is a certain impartiality necessary to make what a man says bear any weight with those he speaks to this quality with respect to mens errors and vices is never seen but in goodnatured men they have ever such a frankness of mind and benevolence to all men that they cannot receive impressions of unkindness without mature deliberation and writing or speaking ill of a man upon personal consideratious is so irreparable and mean an injury that no o ssessed of this quality is capable of doing it but in all ages there have been interpreters to ars when living of the same genius with the commentators into whose hands they fall when dead i dare say it is impossible for any man of e wit than one of these to take any of the f and twenty letters and form out of them a name to describe the character of a vicious man with greater life but one of these would immediately cry mr such a one is meant in that place but the truth of it is satyrists describe the age and backbiters assign their descriptions to private men  in all terms of reproof when the sentence appears to arise from personal hatred or passion it is not then made the cause of mankind but a misunderstanding between two persons for this reason the representations of a goodnatured man bear a pleasantry in them which shows there is no malignity at heart and by consequence are attended to by his hearers or readers because they are unprejudiced this deference is only what is due to him for no man thoroughly nettled can say a thing general enough to pass off with the air of an opinion declared and not a passion gratified i remember a humorous fellow at oxford when he heard any one had spoken ill of him used to say i will not take my revenge on him till i have forgiven him what he meant by this was that he would not enter upon this subject till it was grown as indifferent to him as any other and i have by this rule seen him more than once triumph over his adversary with an inimitable spirit and humor for he came to the assault against a man full of sore places and he himself invulnerable  there is no possibility of succeeding in a satirical way of writing or speaking except a man throws himself quite out of the question it is great vanity to think any one will attend a thing because it is your quarrel you must make your satyr the concern of society in general if you would have it regarded when it is so the goodnature of a man of wit will prompt him to many brisk and disdainful sentiments and replies to which all the malice in the world will not be able to repartee  the tatler no     insert se septus nebula mirabile dictu

reader that it was at present in my possession though i have not since made any use of it the tradition concerning this ring is very romantic and taken notice of both by plato and tully who each of them make an admirable use of it for the advancement of morality this gyges was the master shepherd to king candaules as he was wandering over the plains of lydia he saw a great chasm in the earth and had the curiosity to enter it after having descended pretty far into it he found the statue of an horse in brass with doors in the sides of it upon opening of them he found the body of a dead man bigger than ordinary with a ring upon his finger which he took off and put it upon his own the virtues of it were much greater than he at first imagined for upon his going into the assembly of shepherds he observed that he was invisible when he turned the stone of the ring within the palm of his hand and visible when he turned it toward his company had plato and cicers been as well versed in the occult sciences as i am they would have found a great deal of mystic learning in this tradition but it is impossible for an adept to be understood by one who is not an adept  as for my self i have with much study and application arrived at this great secret of making my self invisible and by that means conveying my self where i pleased or to speak in rosycrucian lore i have entered into the clefts of the earth discovered the brazen horse and robbed the dead giant of his ring the tradition says further of gyges that by the means of this ring he gained admission into the most retired parts of the court and made such use of those opportunities that he at length became king of lydia for my own part i who have always rather endeavored to improve my mind than my fortune have turned this ring to no other advantage than to get a thorough insight into the ways of men and to make such observations upon the errors of others as may be useful to the public whatever effect they may have upon my self  about a week ago not being able to sleep i got up and put on my magical ring and with a thought transported my self into a chamber where i saw a light i found it inhabited by a celebrated beauty though she is of that species of women whith we call a slattern her headdress and one of her shoes lay upon a chair her petticoat in one corner of the room and her girdle that had a copy of verses made upon it but the day before with her thread stockings in the middle of the floor i was so foolishly officious that i could not forbear gathering up her clothes together to lay them upon the chair that stood by her bedside when to my great surprise after a little muttering she cried out what do you do let my petticoat alone i was startled at first but soon found that she was in a dream being one of those who to use shakespeares expression are so loose of thought that they utter in their sleep every thing that passes in their imagination i left the apartment of this female rake and went into her neighbors where there lay a malecoquet he had a bottle of salts hanging over his head and upon the table by his bedside sucklings poems with a little heap of black patches on it his snuff box was within reach on a chair but while i was admiring the disposition which he made of the several parts of his dress his slumber seemed interrupted by a pang that was accompanied by a sudden oath as he turned himself over hastily in his bed i did not care for seeing him in his nocturnal pains and left the room  i was no sooner got into another bedchamber but i heard very harsh words uttered in a smooth uniform tone i was amazed to hear so great a volubility in reproach and thought it too coherent to be spoken by one asleep but upon looking nearer i saw the head dress of the person who spoke which showed her to be a female with a man lying by her side broad awake and as quiet as a lamb i could not but admire his exemplary patience and discovered by his whole behavior that he was then lying under the discipline of a curtainlecture  i was entertained in many other places with this kind of nocturnal eloquence but observed that most of those whom i found awake were kept so either by envy or by love some of these were sighing and others cursing in soliloquy some hugged their pillows and others gnashed their teeth  the covetous i likewise found to be a very wakeful people i happened to come into a room where one of them lay sick his physician and his wife were in close whisper near his bedside i overheard the doctor say to the poor gentlewoman he cannot possibly live

retire to their own apartments and feeling the influence of it i was hastening home when i saw a man had got half way into a neighbors house i immediately called to him and turning my ring appeared in my proper person there is something magisterial in the aspect of the bickerstaffs which made him run away in confusion  as i took a turn or two in my own lodging i was thinking that old as i was i need not go to bed alone but that it was in my power to marry the finest lady in this kingdom if i would wed her with this ring for what a figure would she that should have it make a visit with so perfect a knowledge as this would give her of all the scandal in the town but instead of endeavoring to dispose of my self and it in matrimony i resolved to lend it to my loving friend the author of

frequently than in the prosecution of studies hence it is that we meet crowds who attempt to be eloquent before they can speak they affect the flowers of rhetoric before they understand the parts of speech in the ordinary conversation of this town there are so many who can as they call it talk well that there is not one in twenty that talks to be understood this proceeds from an ambition to excel or as the term is to shine in company the matter is not to make themselves understood but admired they come together with a certain emulation rather than benevolence when you fall among such companions the safe way is to give your self up and let the orators declaim for your esteem and trouble your self no further it is said that a poet must be born so but i think it may be much better said of an orator especially when we talk of our townpoets and orators but the townpoets are full of rules and laws the townorators go through thick and thin and are forsooth persons of such eminent natural parts and knowledge of the world that they despise all men as unexperienced scholasticks who wait for an occasion before they speak or who speak no more than is necessary they had half persuaded me to go to the tavern the other night but that a gentleman whispered me prithee isaac go with us there is tom varnish will be there and he is a fellow that talks as well as any man in england  i must confess when a man expresses himself well upon any occasion and his falling into an account of any subject arises from a desire to oblige the company or from fullness of the circumstance it self so that his speaking of it at large is occasioned only by the openness of a companion i say in such a case as this it is not only pardonable but agreeable when a man takes the discourse to himself but when you see a fellow watch for opportunities for being copious it is excessively troublesome a man that stammers if he has understanding is to be attended with patience and good nature but he that speaks more than he need has no right to such an indulgence the man who has a defect in his speech takes pains to come to you while a man of a weak capacity with fluency of speech triumphs in outrunning you the stammerer strives to be fit for your company the loquacious man endeavors to show you you are not fit for his  with thoughts of this kind do i always enter into that mans company who is recommended as a person that talks well but if i were to choose the people with whom i would spend my hours of conversation they should be certainly such as labored no farther

enjoy all the freedom and improvement imaginable and yet be insensible of a contradiction to you in all the mistakes you can be guilty of his great good will to his friends has produced in him such a general deference in his discourse that if he differs from you in his sense of any thing he introduces his own thoughts by some agreeable circumlocution or he has often observed such and such a circumstance that made him of another opinion again where another would be apt to say this i am confident of i may pretend to judge of this matter as well as any body urbanus says i am verily persuaded i believe one may conclude in a word there is no man more clear in his thoughts and expressions than he is or speaks with greater diffidence you shall hardly find one man of any consideration but you shall observe one of less consequence form himself after him this happens to urbanus but the man who steals from him almost every sentiment he utters in a whole week disguises the theft by carrying it with quite a different air umbratilis knows urbanuss doubtful way of speaking proceeds from goodnature and goodbreeding and not from uncertainty in his opinions umbratilis therefore has no more to do but repeat the thoughts of urbanus in a positive manner and appear to the undiscerning a wiser man than the person from whom he borrows but those who know him can see the servant in his masters habit and the more he struts the less do his clothes appear his own  in conversation the medium is neither to affect silence or eloquence not to value our approbation and to endeavor to excel us who are of your company are equal inquiries the great enemies therefore to good company and those who transgress most against the laws of equality which is the life of it are the clown the wit and the pedant a clown when he has sense is conscious of his want of education and with an awkward bluntness hopes to keep himself in countenance by overthrowing the use of all polite behavior he takes advantage of the restraint good breeding lays upon others not to offend him to trespass against them and is under the mans own shelter while he intrudes upon him the fellows of this class are very frequent in the repetition of the words rough and manly when these people happen to be by their fortunes of the rank of gentlemen they defend their other absurdities by an impertinent courage and to help out the defect of their behavior add their being dangerous to their being disagreeable this gentleman though he displeases professes to do so and knowing that dares still go on to do so is not so painful a companion as he who will please you against your will and resolves to be a wit  this man upon all occasions and whoever he falls in company with talks in the same circle and in the same round of chat which he has learned at one of the tables of this coffeehouse as poetry is in it self an elevation above ordinary and common sentiments so there is no fop is so very near a madman in indifferent company as a poetical one he is not apprehensive that the generality of the world are intent upon the business of their own fortune and profession and have as little capacity as curiosity to enter into matters of ornament or speculation i remember at a full table in the city one of these ubiquitary wits was entertaining the company with a soliloquy for so i call it when a man talks to those who do not understand him concerning wit and humor an honest gentleman who sat next to me and was worth half a plumb stared at him and observing there was some sense as he thought mixed with his impertinence whispered me take my word for it this fellow is more knave than fool this was all my good friends applause of the wittiest man of talk that i was ever present at which wanted nothing to make it excellent but that there was no occasion for it  the pedant is so obvious to ridicule that it would be to be one to offer to explain him he is a gentleman so well known that there is none but those of his own class who do not laugh at and avoid him pedantry proceeds from much reading and little understanding a pedant among men of learning and sense is like an ignorant servant

acquaintance club or assembly in this town or kingdom one cannot but observe that in spite of what i am every day saying and all the moral writers since the beginning of the world have said the subject of discourse is generally upon one anothers faults this in a great measure proceeds from selfconceit which were to be endured in one or other individual person but the folly has spread it self almost over all the species and one cannot only say tom jack or will but in general that man is a coxcomb from this source it is that any excellence is faintly received any imperfection unmercifully exposed but if things were put in a true light and we would take time to consider that man in his very nature is an imperfect being our sense of this matter would be immediately altered and the word imperfection would not carry an unhinder idea than the word humanity it is a pleasant story that we forsooth who are the only imperfect creatures in the universe are the only beings that will not allow of imperfection some body has taken notice that we stand in the middle of existencies and are by this one circumstance the most unhappy of all others the brutes are guided by instinct and know no sorrow the angels have knowledge and they are happy but men are governed by opinion which is i know not what mixture of instinct and knowledge and are neither indolent nor happy it is very observable that critics are a people between the learned and the ignorant and by that situation enjoy the tranquillity of neither as critics stand among men so do men in general between brutes and angels thus every man as he is a critic and a coxcomb till improved by reason and speculation is ever forgetting himself and laying open the faults of others  at the same time that i am talking of the cruelty of urging peoples faults with severity i cannot but bewail some which men are guilty of for want of admonition these are such as they can easily mend and no body tells them of for which reason i shall make use of the pennypost as i have with success to several young ladies about turning their eyes and holding up their heads to certain gentlemen whom i remark habitually guilty of what they may reform in a moment there is a fat fellow whom i have long remarked wearing his breast open in the midst of winter out of an affectation of youth i have therefore sent him just now the following letter in my physical capacity  sir from the twentieth instant to the first of may next both days inclusive i beg of you to button your wastcoat from your collar to your wastband i am  your most

faithful servant bickerstaff censor   these little intimations do great service and are very useful not only to the persons themselves but to inform others how to conduct themselves toward them  instead of this honest private method or a friendly one face to face of acquainting people with things in their power to explain or amend the usual way among people is to take no notice of things you can help and nevertheless exposs you for those you cannot  plumbeus and levis are constantly in each others company they would if they took proper methods be very agreeable companions but they so extravagantly aim at what they are unfit for and each of them rallies the other so much in the wrong place that instead of doing each other the offices of friends they do but instruct the rest of the world to laugh at them with more knowledge and skill plumbeus is o a saturnine and sullen complexion levis of a mercurial and airy disposition both these gentlemen have but very slow parts but would mak a very good figure did they pursue what they ought if plumbeus would take to business h would in a fews years know the forms of orders so well as to direct and dictate with so much ease as to be thought a solid able and at the same time a sure man of dispatch levis with a little reading and coming more into company would soon be able to write a song or lead up a countrydance instead of these proper pursuits in obedience to their respective geniuss plumbeus endeavors to be the man of pleasure and levis the man of business this appears in their speech and in their dress plumbeus is ever egregiously fine and talking something like wit levis is ever extremely grave and with a silly face repeating maxims these two pardon each other for affecting what each is incapable of the one to be wise and the other gay but are extremely critical in their judgments of each other in their way toward what they pretend to plumbeus acknowledges levis a man of a great reach because it is what plumbeus never cared for being thought himself and levis allows plumbeus to be an agreeable rake for the same reason now were these dear friends to be free with each other as they ought to be they would change characters and be both as commendable instead of being as ridiculous as their capacities will admit of  were it not too grave all that i would urge on this subject is that men are bewildered when they consider themselves in any other view than that of strangers who are in a place where it is no great matter whether they can or unreasonable to expect they should have every thing about them as well as at their own home this way of thinking is perhaps the only one that can put this being into a proper posture for the ease of society it is certain this would reduce all faults into those which proceed from malice or dishonesty it would quite change our manner of beholding one another and nothing that was not below a mans nature would be below his character the arts of this life would be proper advances toward the next and a very good man would be a very fine gentleman as it now is humane life is inverted and we have not learned half the knowledge of this world before we are dropping into another thus instead of the raptures and contemplations which naturally attend a wellspent life from the approach of eternity even we old fellows are afraid of the ridicule of those who are born since us and ashamed not to understand as well as peevish to resign the mode the fashion the ladies the fiddles the balls and what not dick reptile who does not want humor is very

agreeable young gentleman who is endowed with all the good quallities that can make a man complete has this long time maid love to me in the most passionat manner that was posable he has left nothing unsaid to make me belive his affections real and in his letters expressed himself so hansomly and so tenderly that i had all the reason imaginable to belive him sinceir in short he positively has promised me he would marry me but i find all he said nothing for when the question was put to him he wouldnt but still would continue my humble servant and would go on at the old rate repeating the assurences of his fidelity and at the same time has none in him he now writs to me in the same endearing style he ust to do would have me spoke to no man but himself his estate is in his oune hand his father being dead my fortune at my oune disposal mine being also dead and to the full answers his estate pray sir be ingeinous and tell me cordially if you dont think i shall do my self an injurey if

sir you will do me a sensable pleasure and very great honor if you will pleas to insirt this poor scrole with your answer to it in your tatler pray fail not to give me your answer for on it depends the happiness of  disconsolat almeira   madam i have frequently read over your letter and am of opinion that as lamentable as it is it is the most common of any evil that attends our sex i am very much troubled for the tenderness you express toward your lover but rejoice at the same time that you can so far surmount your inclination for him as to resolve to dismiss him when you have my brothers opinion for it his sense of the matter he desired me to communicate to you oh almeira the common failing of our sex is to value the merit of our lovers rather from the grace of their address than the sincerity of their hearts he has expressed himself so handsomely can you say that after you have reason to doubt his truth it is a very melancholy thing that in this circumstance of love which is the most important of all others in female life we women who are they say always weak are still weakest the true way of valuing a man is to consider his reputation among the men for want of this necessary rule toward her conduct when it is too late we find our selves married to the outcasts of that sex and it is generally from being disagreeable among men that fellows endeavor to make themselves pleasing to us the little accomplishments of coming into a room with a good air and telling while they are with us what we cannot hear among our selves usually make up the whole of a womans mans merit but if we when we began to reflect upon our lover in the first place considered what figures they make in the camp at the bar on the change in their country or at court we should behold them in quite another view than at present  were we to behave our selves according to this rule we should not have the just imputation of favoring the silliest of mortals to the great scandal of the wisest who value our favor as it advances their pleasure not their reputation in a word madam if you would judge aright in love you must look upon it as in a case of friendship were this gentleman treating with you for any thing but your self when you had consented to his offer if he fell off you would call him a cheat and an impostor there is therefore nothing left for you to do but to despise him and your self for doing with regret  i am madam etc   i have heard it often argued in conversation that this evil practice is owing to the perverted taste of the wits in the last generation a libertine on the throne could very easily make the language and the fashion turn his own way hence it is that woman is treated as a mistress and not a wife it is from the writings of those times and the traditional accounts of the debauches of their men of pleasure that the coxcombs nowadays take upon them forsooth to be false swains and perjured lovers methinks i feel all the woman rise in me when i reflect upon the nauseous rogues that pretend to deceive us wretches that can never have it in their power to overreach any thing living but their mistresses in the name of goodness if we are designed by nature as suitable companions to the other sex why are we not treated accordingly if we have merit as some allow why is it not as base in men to injure us as one another if we are the insignificants that others call us where is the triumph in deceiving us but when i look at the bottom of this disaster and recollect the many of my acquaintance whom i have known in the same condition with the northern lass that occasions this discourse i must own i have ever found the perfidiousness of men has been generally owing to ourselves and we have contributed to our own deceit the truth is we do not conduct our selves as we are courted but as we are inclined when we let our imaginations take this unbridled swing it is not he that acts best is most lovely but he that is most lovely acts best when our humble servants make their addresses we do not keep our selves enough disingaged to be judges of their merit and we seldom give our judgment of our lover till we have lost our judgment of him  while clarinda was passionately attended and addressed to by strephon who is a man of sense and knowledge in the world and cassio who has a plentiful fortune and an excellent understanding she fell in love with damon at a ball from that moment she that was before the most reasonable creature of all my acquaintance cannot hear strephon speak but it is something so out of the way of ladies conversation and cassio has never since opened his mouth before us but she whispers me how seldom do riches and sense go together the issue of all this is that for the love of damon who has neither experience understanding or wealth she despises those advantages in the other two which she finds wanting in her lover or else thinks he has them for no reason but because he is her lover this and many other instances may be given in this town but i hope thus much may suffice to prevent the growth of such evils at edinburgh  the tatler no     by isaac bickerstaff esquire  media sese tulit obvia

riding in enfield chase i met a young lady whom i could hardly get out of my head and for ought i know my heart ever since she was mounted on a pad with a very wellfancied furniture she sat her horse with a very graceful air and when i saluted her with my hat she bowed to me so obligingly that whether it was her civility or beauty that touched me so much i know not but i am sure i shall never forget her she dwells in my imagination in a figure so much to her advantage that if i were to draw a picture of youth health beauty or modesty i should represent any or all of them in the person of that young woman  i do not find that there are any descriptions in the ancient poets so beautiful as those they draw of nymphs in their pastoral dresses and exercises virgil gives venus the habit of a spartan huntress when she is to put aeneas in his way and relieve his cares with the most agreeable object imaginable diana and her train are always described as inhabitants of the woods and followers of the chase to be well diverted is the safest guard to innocence and methinks it should be one of the first things to be regarded among people of condition to find out proper amusements for young ladies i cannot but think this of riding might easily be revived among them when they consider how much it must contribute to their beauty this would lay up the best portion they could bring into a family a good stock of health to transmit to their posterity such a charming bloom as this gives the countenance is very much preferable to the real or affected feebleness or softness which appear in the faces of our modern beauties  the comedy called the ladies cure represents the affectation of wan looks and languid glances to a very entertaining extravagance there is as the lady in the play complains something so robust in perfect health that it is with her a point of breeding and delicacy to appear in public with a sickly air but the natural gaiety and spirit which shine in the complexion of such as form to themselves a sort of diverting industry by choosing recreations that are exercises surpass all the false ornaments and graces that can be put on by applying the whole dispensary of a toilet an healthy body and a cheerful mind give charms as irresistible as inimitable the beauteous dictynna who came to town last week has from the constant prospect in a delicious country and the moderate exercise and journeys in the visits she made round it contracted a certain life in her countenance which will in vain employ both the painters and poets to represent the becoming negligence in her dress the severe sweetness of her looks and a certain innocent boldness in all her behavior are the effect of the active recreations i am talking of  but instead of such or any other as innocent and pleasing method of passing away their time with alacrity we have many in town who spend their hours in an indolent state of body and mind without either recreations or reflections i am apt to believe there are some parents imagine their daughters will be accomplished enough if nothing interrupts their growth or their shape according to this method of education i could name you twenty families where all the girls hear of in this life is that it is time to rise and to come to dinner as if they were so insignificant as to be wholly provided for when they are fed and clothed  it is with great indignation that i see such crowds of the female world lost to humane society and condemned to a laziness which makes life pass away with less relish than in the hardest labor palestris in her drawing room is supported by spirits to keep off the returns of spleen and melancholy before she can get over half the day for want of something to do while the wench in the kitchen sings and scowrs from morning to night  the next disagreeable thing to a lazy lady is a very busy one a man of business in good company who gives an account of his abilities and dispatches is hardly more insupportable than her they call a notable woman and a manager lady goodday where i visited the other day at a very polite circle entertained a great lady with a recipe for a poultice and gave us to understand that she had done extraordinary cures since she was last in town it seems a countryman had wounded himself with his sith as he was mowing and we were obliged to hear of her charity her medicine and her humility in the harshest tone and coursest language imaginable  what i would request in all this prattle is that our females would either let us have their persons or their minds in such perfection as nature designed them  the way to this is that those who are in the quality of gentlewomen should propose to themselves some suitable method of passing away their time this would furnish them with reflections and sentiments proper for the companions of reasonable men and prevent the unnatural marriages which happen every day between the most accomplished women and the veriest oafs the worthiest men and the most insignificant females were the general turn of womens education of another kind than it is at present we should want one another for more reasons than we do as the world now goes the common design of parents is to get their girls off as well as they can and make no conscience of putting into our hands a bargain for our whole life which will make our hearts ache every day of it  i shall therefore take this matter into serious consideration and will propose for the better improvement of the fair sex a female library this collection of books shall consist of such authors as do not corrupt while they divert but shall tend more immediately to improve them as they are women they shall be such as shall not hurt a feature by the austerity of their reflections nor cause one impertinent glance by the wantonness of them they shall all tend to advance the value of their innocence as virgins improve their understanding as wives and regulate their tenderness as parents it has been very often said in these lucubrations that the ideas which most frequently pass through our imaginations leave traces of themselves in our countenances there shall be a strict regard had to this in my female library which shall be furnished with nothing that shall give supplies to ostentation or impertinence but the whole shall be so digested for the use of my students that they shall not go out of character in their enquiries but their knowledge appear only a cultivated innocence  the tatler no     per varios casus per tot discrimina rerum tendimus  virg

required much greater talents to fill up and become a retired life than a life of business upon this occasion he rallied very agreeably the busy men of the age who only valued themselves of being in motion and passing through a series of trifling and insignificant actions in the heat of his discourse seeing a piece of money lying on my table i defy says he any of these active persons to produce

hundred more of my own quality who lay under the same confinement the only relief we had was to be taken out and counted over in the fresh air every morning and evening after an imprisonment of several years we heard some body knocking at our chest and breaking it open with an hammer this we found was the old mans heir who as his father lay a dying was so good as to come to our release he separated us that very day what was the fate of my companions i know not as for my self i was sent to the apothecarys shop for a pint of sack the apothecary gave me to an herbwoman the herbwoman to a butcher the butcher to a brewer and the brewer to his wife who made a present of me to a nonconformist preacher after this manner i made my way merrily through the world for as i told you before we shillings love nothing so much as traveling i sometimes fetched in a shoulder of mutton sometimes a playbook and often had the satisfaction to treat a templer at a twelvepenny ordinary or carry him with three friends to westminster hall  in the midst of this pleasant progress which i made from place to place i was arrested by a superstitious old woman who shut me up in a greazy purse in pursuance of a foolish saying that while she kept a queen elizabeths shilling about her she should never be without money i continued here a close prisoner for many months till at last i was exchanged for eight and forty farthings  i thus rambled from pocket to pocket till the beginning of the civil wars when to my shame be it spoken i was employed in raising soldiers against the king for being of a very tempting breadth a sergeant made use of me to inveigle country fellows and list them in the service of the parliament  as soon as he had made one man sure his way was to oblige him to take a shilling of a more homely figure and then practice the same trick upon another thus i continued doing great mischief to the crown till my officer chancing one morning to walk abroad earlier than ordinary sacrificed me to his pleasures and made use of me to seduce a milkmaid this wench bent me and gave me to her sweetheart applying more properly than she intended the usual form of to my love and from my love this ungenerous gallant marrying her within few days after pawned me for a dram of brandy and drinking me out next day i was beaten flat with an hammer and again set a running  after many adventures which it would be tedious to relate i was sent to a young spendthrift in company with the will of his deceased father the young fellow who i found was very extravagant gave great demonstrations of joy at the receiving the will but opening it he found himself disinherited and cut off from the possession of a fair estate by virtue of my being made a present to him this put him into such a passion that after having taken me in his hand and cursed me he squirred me away from him as far as he could fling me i chanced to light in an unfrequented place under a dead wall where i lay undiscovered and useless during the usurpation of oliver cromwell  about a year after the kings return a poor cavalier that was walking there about dinnertime fortunately cast his eye upon me and to the great joy of us both carried me to a cooksshop where he dined upon me and drank the kings health when i came again into the world i found that i had been happier in my retirement than i thought having probably by that means escaped wearing a monstrous pair of breeches  being now of great credit and antiquity i was rather looked upon as a medal than an ordinary coin for which reason a gamester laid hold of me and converted me into a counter having got together some dozens of us for that use we led a melancholy life in his possession being busy at those hours wherein current coin is at rest and partaking the fate of our master being in a few moments valued at a crown a pound or a sixpence according to the situation in which the fortune of the cards placed us i had at length the good luck to see my master break by which means i was again sent abroad under my primitive denomination of a shilling  i shall pass over many other accidents of less moment and hasten to that fatal catastrophe when i fell into the hands of an artist who conveyed me under ground and with an unmerciful pair of sheers cut off my titles clipped my brims retrenched my shape rubbed me to my inmost ring and in short so spoiled and pillaged me that he did not leave me worth a groat you may think what a confusion i was in to see my self thus curtailed and disfigured i should have been ashamed to have shown my head had not all my old acquaintance been reduced to the same shameful figure excepting some few that were punched through the belly in the midst of this general calamity when every body thought our misfortune irretrievable and our case desperate we were thrown into the furnace together and as it often happens with cities rising out of a fire appeared with greater beauty and luster than we could ever boast of before what has happened to me since this change of sex which you now see i shall take some other opportunity to relate in the mean time i shall only repeat two adventures as being very extraordinary and neither of them having ever happened to me above once in my life the first was my being in a poets pocket who was so taken with the brightness and novelty of my appearance that it gave occasion to the finest burlesque poem in the british language entitued from me the splendid shilling the second adventure which i must not omit happened to me in the year   0  when i was given away in charity to a blind man but indeed this was by  mistake the person who gave me having heedesly thrown me into the hat among a pennyorth of farthings  the tatler no   0 scis

enormities in dress and behavior which are not cognizable in any other courts of this realm the vintners case which i there tried is still fresh in every mans memory that of the petticoat gave also a general satisfaction not to mention the more important points of the cane and perspective in which if i did not give judgments and decrees according to the strictest rules of equity and justice i can safely say i acted according to the best of my understanding but as for the proceedings of that court i shall refer my reader to an account of them written by my secretary which is now in the press and will shortly be published under the title of lillies reports  as i last year presided over a court of justice it is my intention this year to set my self at the head of a court of honor there is no court o this nature any where at present except in france where according to the best of my intelligence it consists of such only as are marshals of that kingdom i am likewise informed that there is not one of that honorable board at present who has not been driven out of the field by the duke of marlborough but whether this be only an accidental or a necessary qualification i must confess i am not able to determine  as for the court of honor of which i am here speaking i intend to sit my self in it as president with several men of honor on my right hand and women of virtue on my left as my assistants the first place of the bench i have given to an old tangereen captain with a wooden leg the second is a gentleman of a long twisted periwig without a curl in it a muff with very little hair upon it and a threadbare coat with new buttons being a person of great worth and second brother to a man of quality the third is a gentleman usher extremely well read in romances and grandson to one of the greatest wits in germany who was some time master of the ceremonies to the duke of wolfembuttel  as for those who sit further on my right hand as it is usual in public courts they are such as will fill up the number of faces upon the bench and serve rather for ornament than use  the chief upon my left hand are an old maiden lady that preserves some of the best blood of england in her veins  a welsh woman of a little stature but high spirit  an old prude that has censured every marriage for these thirty years and is lately wedded to a young rake  having thus furnished my bench i shall establish correspondencies with the horseguards and the veterans of chelsea college the former to furnish me with twelve men of honor as often as i shall have occasion for a grand jury and the latter with as many good men and true for a petty jury  as for the women of virtue it will not be difficult for me to find them about midnight at crimp and basset  having given this public notice of my court i must further add that i intend to open it on this day sevennight being monday the twentieth instant and do hereby invite all such as have suffered injuries and astronts that are not to be redressed by the common laws of this land whether they be short bows cold salutations supercilious looks unreturned smiles distant behavior or forced familiarity as also all such as have been aggrieved by any ambiguous expression accidental justle or unkind repartee likewise all such as have been defrauded of their right to the wall tricked out of the upper end of the table or have been suffered to place themselves in their own wrong on the backseat of the coach these and all of these i do as i above said invite to bring in their several cases and complaints in which they shall be relieved with all imaginable expedition  i am very sensible that the office i have now taken upon me will engage me in the disquisition of many weighty points that daily perplex the youth of the british nation and therefore i have already discussed several of them for my future use as how far a man may brandish his cane in the telling a story without insulting his hearer what degree of contradiction amounts to the lie how a man should resent anothers staring and cocking a hat in his face if asking pardon is an atonement for treading upon ones toes whether a man may put up a box on the ear received from a stranger in the dark or whether a man of honor may take a blow of his wife with several other subtilties of the like nature  for my direction in the duties of my office i have furnished my self with a certain astrological pair of scales which i have contrived for this purpose in one of them i lay the injuries in the other the reparations the first are represented by little weights made of a metal resembling iron and the other in gold these are not only lighter than the weights made use of in averdupois but also than such as are used in troyweight the heaviest of those that represent the injuries amount but to a scruple and decrease by so many subdivisions that there are several imperceptible weights which cannot be seen without the help of a very fine microscope i might acquaint my reader that these scales were made under the influence of the sun when he was in libra and describe many signatures on the weights both of injury and reparation but as this would look rather to proceed from an ostentation of my own art than any care for the public i shall pass it over in silence  the letter of the  th instant enquired for by another of the   th came to hand

life to possess our minds in such a manner as to be always well satisfied with our own reflections the way to this state is to measure our actions by our own opinion and not by that of the rest of the world the sense of other men ought to prevail over us in things of less consideration but not in concerns where truth and honor are engaged when we look into the bottom of things what at first appears a paradox is a plain truth and those professions which for want of being duly weighed seem to proceed from a sort of romantic philosophy and ignorance of the world after a little reflection are so reasonable that it is direct madness to walk by any other rules thus to contradict our desires and to conquer the impulses of our ambition if they do not fall in with what we in our inward sentiments approve is so much our interest and so absolutely necessary to our real happiness that to contemn all the wealth and power in the world where they stand in competition with a mans honor is rather good sense than greatness of mind  did we consider that the mind of a man is the man himself we should think it the most unnatural sort of selfmurder to sacrifice the sentiment of the soul to gratify the appetites of the body bless us is it possible that when the necessities of life are supplied a man would flatter to be rich or circumvent to be powerful when we meet a poor wretch urged with hunger and cold asking an alms we are apt to think this a state we could rather starve than submit to but yet how much more despicable is his condition who is above necessity and yet shall resign his reason and his integrity to purchase superfluities these are both abject and common beggars but sure it is less despicable to beg a supply to a mans hunger than his vanity but custom and general prepossessions have so far prevailed over an unthinking world that those necessitous creatures who cannot relish life without applause attendance and equipage are so far from making a contemptible figure that distressed virtue is less esteemed than successful vice but if a mans appeal in cases that regarded his honor were made to his own soul there would be a bafis and standing rule for our conduct and we should always endeavor rather to be than appear honorable mr collier in his essay on fortitude has treated this subject with great wit and magnanimity what says he can be more honorable than to have courage enough to execute the commands of reason and conscience to maintain the dignity of our nature and the station assigned us to be proof against poverty pain and death it self i mean so far as not to do any thing that is scandalous or sinful to avoid them to stand adversity under all shapes with decency and resolution to do this is to be great above title and fortune this argues the soul of an heavenly extraction and is worthy the offspring of the deity  what a generous ambition has this man pointed to us when men have settled in themselves a conviction by such noble precepts that there is nothing honorable that is not accompanied with innocence nothing mean but what has guilt in it i say when they have attained thus much though poverty pain and death may still retain their terrors yet riches pleasures and honors will easily lose their charms if they stand between us and our integrity  what is here said with allusion to fortune and fame may as justly be applied to wit and beauty for these latter are as adventitious as the other and as little concern the essence of the soul they are all laudable in the man who possesses them only for the just application of them a bright imagination while it is subservient to an honest and noble soul is a faculty which makes a man justly admired by mankind and furnishes him with reflections upon his own actions which add delicates to the feast of a good conscience but when wit descends to wait upon sensual pleasures or promote the base purposes of ambition it is then to be contemned in proportion to its excellence if a man will not resolve to place the foundation of his happiness in his own mind life is a bewildered and unhappy state incapable of rest or tranquillity for to such a one the general applause of valor wit nay of honesty it self can give him but a very feeble comfort since it is capable of being interrupted by any one who wants either understanding or goodnature to see or acknowledge such excellencies this rule is so necessary that one may very safely say it is impossible to know any true relish of our being without it look about you in common life among the ordinary race of mankind and you will find merit in every kind is allowed only to those who are in particular districts or sets of company but since men can have little pleasure in these faculties which denominate them persons of distinction let them give up such an empty pursuit and think nothing essential to happiness but what is in their own power the capacity of reflecting with pleasure on their own actions however they are interpreted  it is so evident a truth that it is only in our own bosoms we are to search for any thing to make us happy that it is methinks a disgrace to our nature to talk of the taking our measures from thence only as a matter of fortitude when all is well there the vicissitudes and distinctions of life are the mere scenes of a drama and he will never act his part well who has his thoughts more fixed upon the applause of the audience than the design of his part  the life of a man who acts with a steady integrity without valuing the interpretation of his actions has but one uniform regular path to move in where he cannot meet opposition or fear ambuscade on the other side the least deviation from the rules of honor introduces a train of numberless evils and involves him in inexplicable mazes he that has entered into guilt has bid adieu to rest and every criminal has his share of the misery expressed so emphatically in the tragedian  mackbeth shall sleep no more it was with detestation of any other grandeur but the calm command of his own passion that the excellent mr cowley cries out with so much justice  if ere ambition did my fancy cheat with any thought so mean as to be great continue heaven still from me to remove the humble blessings of that life i love the tatler no     narratur and prisci catonis saepe mero caluisse virtus hor from thursd nov

cheerful use of wine  from my country house oct    mr bickerstaff your discourse against drinking in tuesdays tatler i like well enough in the main but in my humble opinion you are become too rigid where you say to this effect were there only this single consideration that we are the less masters of our selves if we drink the least proportion beyond the exigence of thirst i hope no one drinks wine to allay this appetite this seems to be designed for a loftier indulgence of nature for it were hard to suppose that the author of nature who imposed upon her her necessities and pains does not allow her her pleasures and we may reckon among the latter the moderate use of the grape and though i am as much against excess or whatever approaches it as your self yet i conceive one may safely go farther than the bounds you there prescribe not only without forfeiting the title of being ones own master but also to possess it in a much greater degree if a mans expressing himself upon any subject with more life and vivacity more variety of ideas more copiously more fluently and more to the purpose argues it he thinks clearer speaks more ready and with greater choice of comprehensive and significant terms i have the good fortune now to be intimate with a gentleman remarkable for this temper who has an inexhaustible source of wit to entertain the curious the grave the humorous and the frolic he can transform himself into different shapes and adapt himself to every company yet in a coffeehouse or in the ordinary course of affairs appears rather dull than sprightly you can seldom get him to the tavern but when once he is is arrived to his pint and begins to look about and like his company you admire a thousand things in him which before lay buried then you discover the brightness of his mind and the strength of his judgment accompanied with the most graceful mirth in a word by this enlivening aid he is whatever is polite instructive and diverting what makes him still more agreeable is that he tells a story serious or comical with as much delicacy of humor as cervantes himself and for all this at other times even after a long knowledge of him you shall scarce discern in this incomparable person a whit more than what might be expected from one of a common capacity doubtless there are men of great parts that are guilty of downright bashfulness that by a strange hesitation and reluctance to speak murder the finest and most elegant thoughts and render the most lively conceptions flat and heavy  in this case a certain quantity of my white or red cordial which you will is an easy but an infallible remedy it awakens the judgment quickens memory ripens understanding disperses melancholy chears the heart in a word restores the whole man to himself and his friends without the least pain or indisposition to the patient to be taken only in the evening in a reasonable quantity before going to bed note my bottles are sealed with three flowerdeluces and a bunch of grapes beware of counterfeits i am  your most humble servant etc   whatever has been said against the use of wine upon the supposition that it enfeebles the mind and renders it unfit for the duties of life bears forcibly to the advantage of that delicious juice in cases where it only heightens conversation and brings to light agreeable talents which otherwise would have lain concealed under the oppression of an unjust modesty i must acknowledge i have seen many of the temper mentioned by this correspondent and own wine may very allowably be used in a degree above the supply of mere necessity by such as labor under melancholy or are tonguetyd by modesty it is certainly a very agreeable change when we see a glass raise a lifeless conversation into all the pleasures of wit and good humor but when caska adds to his natural impudence the fluster of a bottle that which fools called fire when he was sober all men abhor as outrage when he is drunk thus he that in the morning was only saucy is in the evening tumultuous it makes one sick to hear one of these fellows say they love a friend and a bottle noisy mirth has something too rustic in it to be considered without terror by men of politeness but while the discourse improves in a well chosen company from the addition of spirits which flow from moderate cups it must be acknowledged that leisure time cannot be more agreeably or perhaps more usefully employed than at such meetings but there is a certain prudence in this and all other circumstances which makes right or wrong in the conduct of ordinary life sir jeoffrey wildacre has nothing so much at heart as that his son should know the world betimes for this end he introduces him among the sots of his own age where the boy learns to laugh at his father from the familiarity with which he sees him treated by his equals this the old fellow calls living well with his heir and teaching him to be too much his friend to be impatient for his estate but for the more exact regulation of society in this and other matters i shall publish tables of the characters and relations among men and by them instruct the town in making sets and companies for a bottle this humor of sir jeoffrey shall be taken notice of in the first place for there is methinks a sort of incest in drunkenness and sons are not to behold fathers stripped of all reverence  it is shocking in nature for the young to see those whom they should have an awe for in circumstances of contempt i shall therefore utterly forbid that those in whom nature should admonish to avoid too gross familiarities shall be received in parties of pleasure where there is the least danger of excess i should run through the whole doctrine of drinking but that my thoughts are at present too much employed in the modelling my court of honor and altering the seats benches bar and canopy from that of the court wherein i last winter sat upon causes of less moment by the way i shall take an opportunity to examine what method is to be taken to make joiners and other artificers get out of a house they have once entered not forgetting to tie them under proper regulations it is for want of such rules that i have a day or two longer than i expected been tormented and deafened with hammers insomuch that i neither can pursue this discourse or answer the following and many other letters of

novembris hora nona antemeridiana the court being sat an oath prepared by the censor was administered to the assistants on his right hand who were all sworn upon their honor the women on his left hand took the same oath upon their reputation twelve gentlemen of the horseguards were impannelled having unanimously chosen mr alexander truncheon who is their right hand man in the troop for their foreman in the jury mr truncheon immediately drew his sword and holding it with the point toward his own body presented it to the censor mr bickerstaff received it and after having surveyed the breadth of the blade and sharpness of the point with more than ordinary attention returned it to the foreman in a very graceful manner the rest of the jury upon the delivery of the sword to their foreman drew all of them together as one man and saluted the bench with such an air as signified the most resigned submission to those who commanded them and the greatest magnanimity to execute what they should command  mr bickerstaff after having received the compliments on his right hand cast his eye upon the left where the whole female jury paid their respects by a low courtesy and by laying their hands upon their mouths their forewoman was a professed platonist that had spent much of her time in exhorting the sex to set a just value upon their persons and to make the men know themselves  there followed a profound silence when at length after some recollection the censor who continued hitherto uncovered put on his hat with great dignity and after having composed the brims of it in a manner suitable to the gravity of his character he gave the following charge which was received with silence and attention that being the only applause which he admits of or is ever given in his presence  the nature of my office and the solemnity of this occasion requiring that i should open my first session with a speech i shall cast what i have to say under two principal heads  under the first i shall endeavor to show the necessity and usefulness of this newerected court and under the second i shall give a word of advice and instruction to every constituent part of it  as for the first it is well observed by phaedrus an heathen poet nisi utile est quod facimus frustra est gloria which is the same ladies as if i should say it would be of no reputation for me to be president of a court which is of no benefit to the public now the advantages that may arise to the wealpublick from this institution will more plainly appear if we consider what it suffers for the want of it are not our streets daily filled with wild pieces of justice and random penalties are not crimes undetermined and reparations disproportioned how often have we seen the lie punished by death and the liar himself deciding his own cause nay not only acting the judge but the excutioner have we not known a box on the ear more severely accounted for than manslaughter in these extrajudicial proceedings of mankind an unmannerly jest is frequently as capital as a premeditated murder  but the most pernicious circumstance in this case is that the man who suffers the injury must put himself upon the same foot of danger with him that gave it before he can have his just revenge so that the punishment is altogether accidental and may fall as well upon the innocent as the guilty  i shall only mention a case which happens frequently among the more polite nations of the world and which i the rather mention because both sexes are concerned in it and which therefore you gentlemen and you ladies of the jury will the rather take notice of i mean that great and known case of cuckoldom supposing the person who has suffered insults in his dearer and betterhalf supposing i say this person should resent the injuries done to his tender wife what is the reparation he may expect why to be used worse than his poor lady run through the body and left breathless upon the bed of honor what then will you on my right hand say must the man do that is affronted must our sides be elbowed our shins broken must the wall or perhaps our mistress be taken from us may a man knit his forhead into a frown toss up his arm on pish at what we say and must the villain live after it is there no redress for injured honor yes gentlemen that is the design of the judicature we have here established  a court of conscience we very well know was first instituted for the determining of several points of property that were too little and trivial for the cognizance of higher courts of justice in the same manner our court of honor is appointed for the examination of several niceties and punctilios that do not pass for wrongs in the eye of our common laws but notwithstanding no legislators of any nation have taken into consideration these little circumstances they are such as often lead to crimes big enough for their inspection though they come before them too late for their redress  besides i appeal to you ladies here mr bickerstaff turned to his left hand if these are not the little stings and thorns in life that make it more uneasy than its most substantial evils confess ingenuously did you never lose a mornnings devotions because you could not offer them up from the highest place of the pew have you not been in pain even at a ball because another has been taken out to dance before you do you love any of your friends so much as those that are below you or have you any favorites that walk on your right hand you have answered me in your looks i ask no more  i come now to the second part of my discourse which obliges me to address my self in particular to the respective members of the court in which i shall be very brief  as for you gentlemen and ladies my assistants and grand juries i have made choice of you on my right hand because i know you very jealous of your honor and you on my left because i know you very much concerned for the reputation of others for which reason i expect great exactness and impartiality in your verdicts and judgments  i must in the next place address my self to you gentlemen of the council you all know that i have not chosen you for your knowledge in the litigious parts of the law but because you have all of you formerly fought duels of which i have reason to think you have repented as being now settled in the peaceable state of benchers my advice to you is only that in your pleadings you are short and expressive to which end you are to banish out of your discourses all synonymous terms and unnecessary multiplications of verbs and nouns i do moreover forbid you the use of the words also and likewise and must further declare that if i catch any one among you upon any pretense whatsoever using the particle or i shall incessantly order him

the writer an opportunity of showing his parts without incurring any danger of being examined or contradicted among all the authors of this kind our renowned countryman sir john mandeville has distinguished himself by the copiousness of his invention and greatness of his genius the second to sir john i take to have been ferdinand mendez pinto a person of infinite adventure and unbounded imagination one reads the voyages of these two great wits with as much astonishment as the travels of ulysses in homer or of the red cross knight in spencer all is enchanted ground and fairy land  i have got into my hands by great chance several manuscripts of these two eminent authors which are filled with greater wonders than any of those they have communicated to the public and indeed were they not so well attested would appear altogether improbable i am apt to think the ingenious authors did not publish them with the rest of their works lest they should pass for fictions and fables a caution not unnecessary when the reputation of their veracity was not yet established in the world but as this reason has now no further weight i shall make the public a present of these curious pieces at such times as i shall find my self unprovided with other subjects  the present paper i intend to fill with an extract of sir johns journal in which that learned and worthy knight gives an account of the freezing and thawing of several short speeches which he made in the territories of nova zembla i need not inform my reader that the author of hudibras alludes to this strange quality in that cold climate when speaking of abstracted notions clothed in a visible shape he adds that apt simile  like words congealed in northern air not to keep my reader any longer in suspense the relation put into modern language is as follows  we were separated by a storm in the latitude of    insomuch that only the ship which i was in with a dutch and a french vessel got safe into a creek of nova zembla we landed in order to resit our vessels and store our selves with provisions the crew of each vessel made themselves a cabin of turf and wood at some distance from each other to fence themselves against the inclemencies of the weather which was severe beyond imagination we soon observed that in talking to one another we lost several of our words and could not hear one another at above two yards distance and that too when we sat very near the fire after much perplexity i found that our words froze in the air before they could reach the ears of the person to whom they were spoken i was soon confirmed in this conjecture when upon the increase of the cold the whole company grew dumb or rather deaf for every man was sensible as we afterward found that he spoke as well as ever but the sounds no sooner took air than they were condensed and lost it was now a miserable spectacle to see us nodding and gaping at one another every man talking and no man heard one might observe a seaman that could hail a ship at a league distance beckoning with his hands straining his lungs and tearing his throat but all in vain   nec vox nec verba sequuntur we continued here three weeks in this dismal plight at length upon a turn of wind the air about us began to thaw our cabin was immediately filled with a dry clattering sound which i afterward found to be the crackling of consonants that broke above our heads and were often mixed with a gentle hissing which i imputed to the letter s that occurs so frequently in the english tongue i soon after felt a breeze of whispers rushing by my ear for those being of a soft and gentle substance immediately liquefied in the warm wind that blew across our cabin these were soon followed by syllables and short words and at length by entire sentences that melted sooner or later as they were more or less congealed so that we now heard every thing that had been spoken during the whole three weeks that we had been silent if i may use that expression it was now very early in the morning and yet to my surprise i heard some body say sir john it is midnight and time for the ships crew to go to bed this i knew to be the pilots voice and upon recollecting my self i concluded that he had spoken these words to me some days before though i could not hear them before the present thaw my reader will easily imagine how the whole crew was amazed to hear every man talking and see no man opening his mouth in the midst of this great surprise we were all in we heard a volley of oaths and curses lasting for a long while and uttered in a very hoarse voice which i knew belonged to the boatswain who was a very choleric fellow and had taken his opportunity of cursing and swearing at me when he thought i could not hear him for i had several times given him the strappado on that account as i did not fail to repeat it for these his pious soliloquies when i got him on shipboard  i must not omit the names of several beauties in wapping which were heard every now and then in the midst of a long sigh that accompanied them as dear kate pretty mrs peggy when shall i see my sue again this betrayed several amors which had been concealed till that time and furnished us with a great deal of mirth in our return to england  when this confusion of voices was pretty well over though i was afraid to offer at speaking as fearing i should not be heard i proposed a visit to the dutch cabin which lay about a mile further up into the country my crew were extremely rejoiced to find they had again recovered their hearing though every man uttered his voice with the same apprehensions that i had done   et timide verba intermissa retentat at about half a miles distance from our cabin we heard the groanings of a bear which at first startled us but upon enquiry we were informed by some of our company that he was dead and now lay in salt having been killed upon that very spot about a fortnight before in the time of the frost not far from the same place we were likewise entertained with some posthumous snarls and barkings of a fox  we at length arrived at the little dutch settlement and upon entering the room found it filled with sighs that smelt of brandy and several other unsavourly sounds that were altogether inarticulate my valet who was an irishman fell into so great a rage at what he heard that he drew his sword but not knowing where to lay the blame he put it up again we were stunned with these confused noises but did not hear a single word till about half an hour after which i ascribed to the harsh and obdurate sounds of that language which wanted more time than ours to melt and become audible  after having here met with a very hearty welcome we went to the french cabin who to make amends for their three weeks silence were talking and disputing with greater rapidity and confusion than ever i heard in an assembly even of that nation their language as i found upon the first giving of the weather sell asunder and dissolved i was here convinced of an error into which i had before fallen for i fancied that for the freezing of the sound it was necessary for it to be wrapped up and as it were preserved in breath but i found my mistake when i heard the sound of a kit playing a minuet over our heads i asked the occasion of it upon which one of the company told me that it would play there above a week longer if the thaw continued for says he finding our selves bereft of speech we prevailed upon one of the company who had this musical instrument about him to play to us from morning to night all which time we employed in dancing in order to dissipate our chagrin and tuer le temps  here sir john gives very good philosophical reasons why the kit could be heard during the frost but as they are something prolix i pass them over in silence and shall only observe that the honorable author seems by his quotations to have been well versed in the ancient poets which perhaps raised his fancy above the ordinary pitch of historians and very much contributed to the embellishment of his wriings  the tatler no      nec te tua plurima pantheu labentem pietas nec apollinis insula texit virg from

self to redress whether or no you shall think it a proper case to come before your court of honor i cannot tell but thus it is i am chaplain to an honorable family very regular at the hours of devotion and i hope of an unblameable life but for not offering to rise at second course i found my patron and his lady very sullen and out of humor though at first i did not know the reason of it at length when i happened to help my self to a jelly the lady of the house otherwise a devout woman told me that it did not become a man of my cloth to delight in such frivolous food but as i still continued to sit out the last course i was yesterday informed by the butler that his lordship had no further occasion for my service all which is humbly submitted to your consideration by  sir your most humble servant etc   the case of this gentleman deserves pity especially if he loves sweetmeats to which if i may guess by his letter he is no enemy in the mean time i have often wondered at the indecency of discarding the holiest man from the table as soon as the most delicious parts of the entertainment are served up and could never conceive a reason for so absurd a custom is it because a liquorish palate or a sweet tooth as they call it is not consistent with the sanctity of his character this is but a trifling pretense no man of the most rigid virtue gives offense by any excesses in plumbpudding or plumbporridge and that because they are the first parts of the dinner is there any thing that tends to incitation in sweetmeats more than in ordinary dishes certainly not sugarplumbs are a very innocent diet and conserves of a much colder nature than your common pickles i have sometimes thought that the ceremony of the chaplains flying away from the dessert was typical and figurative to mark out to the company how they ought to retire from all the luscious baits of temptation and deny their appetites the gratifications that are most pleasing to them or at least to signify that we ought to stint our selves in our most lawful satisfactions and not make our pleasure but our support the end of eating but most certainly if such a lesson of temperance had been necessary at a table our clergy would have recommended it to all the laymasters of families and not have disturbed other mens tables with such unseasonable examples of abstinence the original therefore of this barbarous custom i take  have been merely accidental the chaplain tired out of pure complaisance to make roo for the removal of the dishes or possibly f the ranging of the dessert this by degre grew into a duty till at length as the fashion improved the good man found himself cut  from the third part of the entertainment an if the arrogance of the patron goes on it is n impossible but in the next generation he m see himself reduced to the tithe or tenth di of the table a sufficient caution not to pa with any privilege we are once possessed of  was usual for the priest in old times to feast on the sacrifice nay the honeycake while the hungry laity looked upon him with great devotion or as the late lord rochester describes it i a very lively manner  and whiie the priest did eat the people stared at present the custom is inverted the lai feast while the priest stands by as an humbl spectator this necessarily puts the good man upon making great ravages on all the dishe that stand near him and distinguishing himself by voraciousness of appetite as knowing tha his time is short i would fain ask these stif neckd patrons whether they would not take  ill of a chaplain that in his grace after meat should return thanks for the whole entertainment with an exception to the dessert and ye i cannot but think that in such a proceeding  would but deal with them as they deserved what would a roman catholic priest think who is always helped first and placed next the ladies should he see a clergyman giving hi company the slip at the first appearance of the tarts or sweetmeats would not he believ that he had the same antipathy to a candie orange or a piece of puffpast as some have  a cheshire cheese or a breast of mutton yet to so ridiculous a height is this foolish custom grown that even the christmas pie which in its very nature is a kind of consecrated cate and a badge of distinction is often forbidden to the druid of the family strange that a sirloin of beef whether boiled or roasted when entire is exposed to his utmost depredations and incisions but if minced into small pieces and tossed up with plumbs and sugar changes its property and forsooth is meat for his master  in this case i know not which to censure the patron or the chaplain the insolence of power or the abjectness of dependence for my own part i have often blushed to see a gentleman whom i knew to have much more wit and learning than my self and who was bred up with me at the university upon the same foot of a liberal education treated in such an ignominious manner and sunk beneath those of his own rank by reason of that character which ought to bring him honor this deters men of generous minds from placing themselves in such a station of life and by that means frequently excludes persons of quality from the improving and agreeable conversation of a learned and obsequious friend  mr oldham lets us know that he was affrighted from the thought of such an

proceedings of the court of honor held in sheerlane on monday the  0th of november    0 before isaac bickerstaff esquire censor of great britain peter plumb of london merchant was indicted by the honorable mr thomas gules of gulehall in the country of salop for that the said peter plumb did in lombard street london between the hours of two and three in the afternoon meet the said mr thomas gules and after a short salutation put on his hat value fivepence while the honorable mr gules stood bareheaded for the space of two seconds it was further urged against the criminal that during his discourse with the prosecutor he feloniously stole the wall of him having clapped his back against it in such a manner that it was impossible for mr gules to recover it again at his taking leave of him the prosecutor alleged that he was the cadet of a very ancient family and that according to the principles of all the younger brothers of the said family he had never sullied himself with business but had chosen rather to starve like a man of honor than do any thing beneath his quality he produced several witnesses that he had never employed himself beyond the twisting of a whip or the making of a pair of nutcrackers in which he only worked for his diversion in order to mae a present now and then to his friends the prisoner being asked what he could say for himself cast several reflections upon the honorable mr gules as that he was not worth a groat that no body in the city would trust him for a halspenny that he owed him money which he had promised to pay him several times but never kept his word and in short that he was an idle beggarly fellow and of no use to the public this sort of language was very severely reprimanded by the censor who told the criminal that he spoke in contempt of the court and that he should be proceeded against for contumacy if he did not change his style the prisoner therefore desired to be heard by his council who urged in his defense that he put on his hat through ignorance and took the wall by accident they likewise produced several witnesses that he made several motions with his hat in his hand which are generally understood as an invitation to the person we talk with to be covered and that the gentleman not taking the hint he was forced to put on his hat as being troubled with a cold there was likewise an irish man who deposed that he had heard him cough three and twenty times that morning and as for the wall it was alleged that he had taken it inadvertently to save himself from a shower of rain which was then falling the censor having consulted the men of honor who sat at his right hand on the bench found they were all of opinion that the defense made by the prisoners council did rather aggravate than extenuate his crime that the motions and intimations of the hat were a token of superiority in conversation and therefore not to be used by the criminal to a man of the prosecutors quality who was likewise vested with a double title to the wall at the time of eir conversation both as it was the upper and and as it was a shelter from the weather the evidence being very full and clear the ry without going out of court declared their opinion unanimously by the mouth of their foreman that the prosecutor was bound in honor o make the sun shine through the criminal or s they afterward explained themselves to whip im through the lungs  the censor knitting his brows into a frown and looking very sternly upon the jury after a ittle pause gave them to know that this court was erected for the finding out of penalties suitable to offenses and to restrain the outrages of private justice and that he expected they should moderate their verdict the jury therefore retired and being willing to comply with the advices of the censor after an hours consultation declared their opinion as follows  that in consideration this was peter plumbs first offense and that there did not appear any malice prepense in it as also that he lived in good reputation among his neighbors and that his taking the wall was only se defendendo the prosecutor should let him escape with life and content himself with the slitting of his nose and the cutting off both his ears mr bickerstaff smiling upon the court told them that he thought the punishment even under its present mitigation too severe and that such penalties might be of ill consequence in a trading nation he therefore pronounced sentence against the criminal in the following manner that his hat which was the instrument of offense should be forfeited to the court that the criminal should go to the warehouse from whence he came and thence as occasion should require proceed to the exchange or garraways coffeehouse in what manner he pleased but that neither he nor any of the family of the plumbs should hereafter appear in the streets  london out of their coaches that so the foo way might be left open and undisturbed for their betters  dathan a peddling jew and t r   welshman were indicted by the keeper of  alehouse in westminster for breaking the peac and two earthen mugs in a dispute about the antiquity of their families to the great detriment of the house and disturbance of the whole neighborhood dathan said for himself that he was provoked to it by the welshman who pretended that the welsh were an ancienter people than the jews whereas says he i can show by this genealogy in my hand that i am the son of mesheck that was the son of naboth that was the son of shalem that was the son of  the welshman here interrupted him and told him that he could produce shennalogy as well as himself for that he was john ap rice ap shenkin ap shones he then turned himself to the censor and told him in the same broken accent and with much warmth that the jew would needs uphold that king cadwallader was younger than issachar mr bickerstaff seemed very much inclined to give sentence against dathan as being a jew but finding reasons by some expressions which the welshman let fall in asserting the antiquity of his family to suspect that the said welshman was a praeadamite he suffered the jury to go out without any previous admonition after some time they returned and gave their verdict that it appearing the persons at the bar did neither of them wear a sword and that consequently they had no right to quarrel upon a point of honor to prevent such frivolous appeals for the future they should both of them be tossed in the same blanket and there adjust the superiority as they could agree it between themselves the censor confirmed the verdict  richard newman was indicted by major punto for having used the words perhaps it may be so in a dispute with the said major the major urged that the word perhaps was questioning his veracity and that it was an indirect manner of giving him the lie richard newman had nothing more to say for himself than that he intended no such thing and threw himself upon the mercy of the court the jury brought in their verdict special  mr bickerstaff stood up and after having cast his eyes over the whole assembly hemmed thrice he then acquainted them that he had laid down a rule to himself which he was resolved never to depart from and which as he conceived would very much conduce to the shortening the business of the court i mean says he never to allow of the lie being given by construction implication or induction but by the sole use of the word it self he then proceeded to show the great mischiefs that had arisen to the english nation from that pernicious monosyllable that it had bred the most fatal quarrels between the dearest friends that it had frequently thind the guards and made great havoc in the army that it had sometimes weakened the city trained bands and in a word had destroved many of the bravest men in the isle of great britain for the prevention of which evils for the future he instructed the jury to present the word it self as a nuisance in the english tongue and further promised them that he would upon such their presentment publish an edict of the court for the entire banishment and exclusion of it out of the discourses and conversation of all civil

nation is distinguished by productions that are peculiar to it great britain is particularly fruitful in religions that shoot up and flourish in this climate more than in any other we are so famous abroad for our great variety of sects and opinions that an ingenious friend of mine who is lately returned from his travels assures me there is a show at this time carried up and down in germany which represents all the religions of great britain in waxwork notwithstanding that the pliancy of the matter in which the images are wrought makes it capable of being molded into all shapes and figures my friend tells me that he did not think it possible for it to be twisted and tortured into so many skrewd faces and wry features as appeared in several of the figures that composed the show i was indeed so pleased with the design of the german artist that i begged my friend to give me an account of it in all its particulars which he did after the following manner  i have often says he been present at a show of elephants camels dromedaries and other strange creatures but i never saw so great an assembly of spectators as were met together at the opening of this great piece of waxwork we were all placed in a large hall according to the price that we had paid for our seats the curtain that hung before the show was made by a master of tapestry who had woven it in the figure of a monstrous hydra that had several heads which brandished out their tongues and seemed to hiss at each other some of these heads were large and entire and where any of them had been lopped away there sprouted up several in the room of them insomuch that for one head cut off a man might see ten twenty or an hundred of a smaller size creeping through the wound in short the whole picture was nothing but confusion and bloodshed on a sudden says my friend i was startled with a flourish of many musical instruments that i had never heard before which was followed by a short tune if it might be so called wholly made up of jars and discords among the rest there was an organ a bagpipe a groaningboard a stentorophonicktrumpet with several wind instruments of a most disagreeable sound which i do not so much as know the name of after a short flourish the curtain was drawn up and we were presented with the most extraordinary assembly of figures that ever entered into a mans imagination the design of the workman was so well expressed in the dumb show before us that it was not hard for an englishman to comprehend the meaning of it  the principal figures were placed in a row consisting of seven persons the middle figure which immediately attracted the eyes of the whole company and was much bigger than the rest was formed like a matron dressed in the habit of an elderly woman of quality in queen elizabeths days the most remarkable parts of her dress was the beaver with the steeple crown the scarf that was darker than sable and the lawn apron that was whiter than ermin her gown was of the richest black velvet and just upon her heart studded with large diamonds of an inestimable value disposed in the form of a cross she bore an inexpressible cheerfulness and dignity in her aspect and though she seemed in years appeared with so much spirit and vivacity as gave her at the same time an air of old age and immortality i found my heart touched with so much love and reverence at the sight of her that the tears ran down my face as i looked upon her and still the more i looked upon her the more my heart was melted with the sentiments of filial tenderness and duty i discovered every moment something so charming in this figure that i could scarce take my eyes off it on its right hand there sat the figure of a woman so covered with ornaments that her face her body and her hands were almost entirely hid under them the little you could see of her face was painted and what i thought very odd had something in it like artificial wrinkles but i was the less surprised at it when i saw upon her forehead an oldfashioned tower of gray hairs her headdress rose very high by three several stories or degrees her garments had a thousand colors in them and were embroidered with crosses in gold silver and silk she had nothing on so much as a glove or a slipper which was not marked with this figure nay so superstitiously fond did she appear of it that she sat crosslegged i was quickly sick of this tawdry composition of ribands silks and jewels and therefore cast my eye on a dame which was just the reverse of it i need not tell my reader that the lady before described was popery or that she i am now going to describe is presbytery she sat on the left hand of the venerable matron and so much resembled her in the features of her countenance that she seemed her sister but at the same time that one observed a likness in her beauty one could not but take notice that there was something in it sickly and splenatick her face had enough to discover the relation but it was drawn up into a peevish figure sowred with discontent and overcast with melancholy she seemed offended at the matron for the shape of her hat as too much resembling the triple coronet of the person who sat by her one might see likewise that she dissented from the white apron and the cross for which reasons she had made her self a plain homely dowdy and turned her face toward the sectaries that sat on her left hand as being afraid of looking upon the matron lest she should see the harlot by her  on the right hand of popery sat judaism represented by an old man embroidered with phylacteries and distinguished by many typical figures which i had not skill enough to unriddle he was placed among the rubbish of a temple but instead of weeping over it which i should have expected from him he was counting out a bag of money upon the ruins of it  on his right hand was deism or natural religion this was a figure of an halfnaked awkward country wench who with proper ornaments and education would have made an agreeable and beautiful appearance but for want of those advantages was such a spectacle as a man would blush to look upon  i have now continued my friend given you an account of those who were placed on the right hand of the matron and who according to the order in which they sat were deism judaism and popery on the left hand as i told you appeared presbytery the next to her was a figure which somewhat puzzled me it was that of a man looking with horror in his eyes upon a silver basin filled with water observing something in his countenance that looked like lunacy i fancied at first that he was to express that kind of distraction which the physicians call the hydrophobia but considering what the intention of the show was i immediately recollected my self and concluded it to be anabaptism  the next figure was a man that sat under a most profound composure of mind he wore an hat whose brims were exactly parallel with the horizon his garment had neither sleeve nor skirt nor so much as a superfluous button what they called his cravat was a little piece of white linen quilled with great exactness and hanging below his chin about two inches seeing a book in his hand i asked our artist what it was who told me it was the quakers religion upon which i desired a sight of it upon perusal i found it to be nothing but a newfashioned grammar or an art of abridging ordinary discourse the nouns were reduced to a very small number as the light friend babylon the principal of his pronouns was thou and as for you ye and yours i found they were not looked upon as parts of speech in this grammar all the verbs wanted the second person plural the participles ended all in ing or ed which were marked with a particular accent there were no adverbs besides yea and nay the same thrift was observed in the prepositions the conjunctions were only hem and ha and the interjections brought under the three heads of sighing sobbing and groaning  there was at the end of the grammar a little nomenclature called the christian mans vocabulary which gave new appellations or if you will christian names to almost every thing in life i replaced the book in the hand of the figure not without admiring the simplicity of its garb speech and behavior  just opposite to this row of religions there was a statue dressed in a fools coat with a cap of bells upon his head laughing and pointing at the figures that stood before him this idiot is supposed to say in his heart what davids fool did some thousands of years ago and was therefore designed as a proper representative of those among us who are called atheists and infidels by others and freethinkers by themselves  there were many other groupes of figures which i did not know the meaning of but seeing a collection of both sexes turning their backs upon the company and laying their heads very close together i enquired after their religion and found that they called themselves the philodelphians or the family of love  in the opposite corner there sat another little congregation of strange figures opening their mouths as wide as they could gape and distinguished by the title of the sweet singers of israel  i must not omit that in this assembly of wax there were several pieces that moved by clockwork and gave great satisfaction to the spectators behind the matron there stood one of these figures and behind popery another which as the artist told us were each of them the genius of the person they attended that behind popery represented persecution and the other moderation the first of these moved by secret springs toward a great heap of dead bodies that lay piled upon one another at a considerable distance behind the principal figures there were written on the foreheads of these dead men several ha words as praeadamites sabbatarians camnians muggletonians brownists independants msonites camisars and the like at the approac of persecution it was so contrived that as she held up her bloody flag the whole assembly of dead men like those in the rehearsal started up and drew their swords this was followed by great clashings and noise when in the midst of the tumult the figure of moderation moved gently toward this new army which upon her holding up a paper in her hand inscribed liberty of conscience immediately fell into a heap of carcasses remaining in the same quiet posture that they

censor of great britain elizabeth makebate of the parish of st catherines spinster was indicted for surreptitiously taking away the hassock from under the lady graveairs between the hours of four and five on sunday the   th of november the prosecutor deposed that as she stood up to make a courtesy to a person of quality in a neighboring pew the criminal conveyed away the hassock by stealth insomuch that the prosecutor was obliged to fit all the while she was at church or to say her prayers in a posture that did not become a woman of her quality the prisoner pleaded inadvertency and the jury were going to bring it in chancemedley had not several witnesses been produced against the said elizabeth makebate that she was an old offender and a woman of a bad reputation it appeared in particular that on the sunday before she had detracted from a new petticoat of mrs mary doelittle having said in the hearing of several credible witnesses that the said petticoat was scowred to the great grief and detriment of the said mary doelittle there were likewise many evidences produced against the criminal that though she never failed to come to church on sunday she was a most notorious sabbathbreaker and that she spent her whole time during divine service in disparaging other peoples clothes and whispering to those who sat next her upon the whole she was found guilty of the indictment and received sentence to ask pardon of the prosecutor upon her bare knees without either cushion or hassock under her in the face of the court  n b as soon as the sentence was executed on the criminal which was done in open court with the utmost severity the first lady of the bench on mr bickerstaffs right hand stood up and made a motion to the court that whereas it was impossible for women of fashion to dress themselves before the church was half done and whereas many confusions and inconveniences did arise thereupon it might be lawful for them to send a footman in order to keep their places as was usual in other polite and well regulated assemblies the motion was ordered to be entered in the books and considered at a more convenient time  charles cambrick linendraper in the

prosecutor alleged that over against the old fox at knightsbridge he mentioned the word linen that at the further end of kensington he made use of the term smock and that before he came to hammersmith he talked almost a quarter of an hour upon weddingshifts the prosecutors woman confirmed what her lady had said and added further that she had never seen her lady in so great a confusion and in such a taking as she was during the whole discourse of the criminal the prisoner had little to say for himself but that he talked only in his own trade and meant no hurt by what he said the jury however found him guilty and represented by their forewoman that such discourses were apt to sully the imagination and that by a concatenation of ideas the word linen implied many things that were not proper to be stirred up in the mind of a woman who was of the prosecutors quality and therefore gave it as their verdict that the linendraper should lose his tongue mr bickerstaff said he thought the prosecutors ears were as much to blame as the prisoners tongue and therefore gave sentence as follows that they should both be placed over against one another in the midst of the court there to remain for the space of one quarter of an hour during which time the linendraper was to be gagged and the lady to hold her hands close upon both her ears which was executed accordingly  edward callicoat was indicted as an accomplice to charles cambrick for that he the said edward callicoat did by his silence and his smiles seem to approve and abet the said charles cambrick in every thing he said it appeared that the prisoner was foreman of the shop to the aforesaid charles cambrick and by his post obliged to smile at every thing that the other should be pleased to say upon which he was acquitted  josias shallow was indicted in the name of dame winifred sole relict of richard dainty esquire for having said several times in company and in the hearing of several persons there present that he was extremely obliged to the widow dainty and that he should never be able sufficiently to express his gratitude the prosecutor urged that this might blaft her reputation and that it was in effect a boasting of favors which he had never received the prisoner seemed to be much astonished at the construction which was put upon his words and said that he meant nothing by them but that the widow had befriended him in a lease and was very kind to his younger sister the jury finding him a little weak in his understanding without going out of the court brought in their verdict ignoramus  ursula goodenough was accused by the lady betty woudbe for having said that she the lady betty woudbe was painted the prisoner brought several persons of good credit to witness to her reputation and proved by undeniable evidences that she was never at the place where the words were said to have been uttered the censor observing the behavior of the prosecutor found reason to believe that she had indicted the prisoner for no other reason but to make her complexion be taken notice of which indeed was very fresh and beautiful he therefore asked the offender with a very stern voice how she could presume to spread so groundless a report and whether she saw any colors in the lady woudbes face that could procure credit to such a falsehood do you see says he any lillies or roses in her cheeks any bloom any probability  the prosecutor not able to bear such language any longer told him that he talked like a blind old fool and that she was ashamed to have entertained any opinion of his wisdom but she was soon put to silence and sentenced to wear her mask for five months and not to presume to show her face till the town should be empty  benjamin buzzard esquire was indicted for having told the lady everbloom at a public ball that she looked very well for a woman of her years the prisoner not denying the fact and persisting before the court that he looked upon it as a compliment the jury brought

noses having chosen for my text the following verses out of hudibras  so learned talicotius from the brawny part of porters bum cut supplemental noses which lasted as long as parent breech but when the date of nock was out off dropped the sympathetick snout notwithstanding that there is nothing obscene in natural knowledge and that i intend to give as little offense as may be to readers of a wellbred imagination i must for my own quiet desire the critics who in all times have been famous for good noses to refrain from the lecture of this curious tract these gentlemen were formerly marked out and distinguished by the little rhinocerical nose which was always looked upon as an instrument of derision and which they were used to cock toss or draw up in a contemptuous manner upon reading the works of their ingenious contemporaries it is not therefore for this generation of men that i write the present transaction  minus aptus acutis naribus horum hominum  but for the sake of some of my philosophical friends in the royal society who peruse discourses of this nature with a becoming gravity and a desire of improving by them  many are the opinions of learned men concerning the rise of that fatal distemper which has always taken a particular pleasure in venting its spite upon the nose i have seen a little burlesque poem in italian that gives a very pleasant account of this matter the fable of it ns thus mars the god of war having served during the siege of naples in the shape of a french colonel received a visit one night from venus the goddess of love who had been always his professed mistress and admirer the poem says she came to him in the disguise of a suttling wench with a bottle of brandy under her arm let that be as it will he managed matters so well that she went away bigbellied and was at length brought to bed of a little cupid this boy whether it were by reason of any bad food that his father had eaten during the siege or of any particular malignity in the stars that reigned at his nativity came into the world with a very sickly look and crazy constitution as soon as he was able to handle his bow he made discoveries of a most perverse disposition he dipped all his arrows in poison that rotted every thing they touched and what was more particular aimed all his shafts at the nose quite contrary to the practice of his elder brothers who had made a humane heart their burt in all countries and ages to break him of this roguish trick his parents put him to school to mercury who did all he could to hinder him from demolishing the noses of mankind but in spite of education the boy continued very unlucky and though his malice was a little softened by good instructions he would very frequently let fly an invenomed arrow and wound his votaries oftener in the nose than in the heart thus far the fable  i need not tell my learned reader that correggio has drawn a cupid taking his lesson from mercury conformable to this poem nor that the poem it self was designed as a burlesque upon fracastorius  it was a little after this fatal siege of naples that talicotius begun to practice in a town of germany he was the first clapdoctor that i meet with in history and a greater man in his age than our celebrated dr wall he saw his species extremely mutilated and disfigured by this new distemper that was crept into it and therefore in pursuance of a very seasonable invention set up a manufacture of noses havin first got a patent that none should presume t make noses besides himself his first patien was a great man of portugal who had done goo services to his country but in the midst of the unfortunately lost his nose talicotius grafted  new one on the remaining part of the gristle o cartilaginous substance which would sneeze smell take snuff pronounce the letters m or n and in short do all the functions of a genuine and natural nose there was however one misfortune in this experiment the portugueses complexion was a little upon the subfusk with very black eyes and dark eyebrows and the nose being taken from a porter that had a white german skin and cut out of those parts that are not exposed to the sun it was very visible that the features of his face were not fellows in a word the comde resembled one of those maimed antique statues that has often a modern nose of fresh marble glewed to a face of such a yellow ivory complexion as nothing can give but age to remedy this particular for the future the doctor got together a great collection of porters men of all complexions black brown fair dark sallow pale and ruddy so that it was impossible for a patient of the most outoftheway color not to find a nose to match it  the doctors house was now very much enlarged and become a kind of college or rather hospital for the fashionable cripples of both sexes that resorted to him from all parts of europe over his door was fastened a large golden snout not unlike that which is placed over the great gates at brazennose college in oxford and as it is usual for the learned in foreign universities to distinguish their houses by a latin sentence the doctor writ underneath this great golden proboscis two verses out of ovid  militat omnis amans habet and sua castra cupido pontice creed mihi militat omnis amans it is reported that talicotius had at one time in his house twelve german counts nineteen french marquisses and a hundred spanish cavaliers besides one solitary english esquire of whom more hereafter though the doctor had the monopoly of noses in his own hands he is said not to have been unreasonable indeed if a man had occasion for a high roman nose he must go to the price of it a carbuncle nose likewise bore an excessive rate but for your ordinary short turnedup noses of which there was the greatest consumption they cost little or nothing at least the purchasers thought so who would have been content to have paid much dearer for them rather than to have gone without them  the sympathy betwixt the nose and its parent was very extraordinary hudibras has told us that when the porter died the nose dropped of course in which case it was always usual to return the nose in order to have it interred with its first owner the nose was likewise affected by the pain as well as death of the original proprietor an eminent instance of this nature happened to three spaniards whose noses were all made out of the same piece of brawn they found them one day shoot and swell extremely upon which they sent to know how the porter did and heard upon enquiry that the parent of the noses had been severely kicked the day before and that the porter kept his bed on account of the bruises it had received this was highly resented by the spaniards who found out the person that had used the porter so unmercifully and treated him in the same manner as if the indignity had been done to their own noses in this and several other cases it might be said that the porters led the gentlemen by the nose  on the other hand if any thing went a with the nose the porter felt the effects of  insomuch that it was generally articled with  patient that he should not only abstain from  his old courses but should on no pretense whsoever smell pepper or eat mustard on whi occasion the part where the incision had be made was seized with unspeakable twinges a prickings  the englishman i before mentioned was so ve irregular and relapsed so frequently into the dstemper which at first brought him to the lear talicotius that in the space of two years he wo out five noses and by that means so torment the porters that if he would have given  00 for a nose there was not one of them that wo accommodate him this young gentleman w born of honest parents and passed his first yea in foxhunting but accidentally quitting t woods and coming up to london he was  charmed with the beauties of the playhou that he had not been in town two days befo he got the misfortune which carried off this p of his face he used to be called in germa the englishman of five noses and the gentlman that had thrice as many noses as he h ears such was the raillery of those times  i shall close this paper with an admonition  the young men of this town which i think t more necessary because i see several new fre colored faces that have made their first apearance in it this winter i must therefore asure them that the art of making noses is etirely lost and in the next place beg them not  follow the example of our ordinary town rake who live as if there was a talicotius to be met wit at the corner of every street whatever youn men may think the nose is a very becoming p of the face and a man makes but a very silly figu without it but it is the nature of youth n to know the value of any thing till they have lost it the general precept therefore i shall leave with them is to regard every townwoman as a particular kind of siren that has a design upon their noses and that amidst her flatteries and allutements they will fancy she speaks to em in that humorous phrase of old plautus  ego tibi faciem denasabo mordicus  keep your face out of my way or i will bite off your nose the tatler no     from thursd dec   to

into peoples hands as they pass the streets which give us notice of the present residence the past travels and infallible medicines of doctors useful in their generation though much below the character of the renowned talicotius but upon a nice calculation of the successes of such adepts i find their labors tend mostly to the enriching only one sort of men that is to say the society of

that those who can plead courtship and were unjustly rejected shall not be liable to the pains and penalties of celibacy but such as pretend an aversion to the whole sex because they were ill treated by a particular female and cover their sense of disappointment in women under a contempt of their favor shall be proceeded against as batchelors convict i am not without hopes that from this slight warning all the unmarried men of fortune taste and refinement will without further delay become lovers and humble servants to such of their acuaintance as are most agreeable to them under ain of my

that i have made a collection of all the memorable handsome things done by private men in my time as a specimen of my manner of noting such actions take the following fragment out of much more which is written in my yearbook on the remarkable will of a gentleman whom i shall here call celamico  this day died that plain and excellent man my much honored friend celamico who bequeathed his whole estate to a gentleman no way related to him and to whom he had given no such expectation in his lifetime he was a person of a very enlarged soul and thought the nearest relation among men to be the resemblance of their minds and sentiments he was not mistaken in the worth of his successor who received the news of this unexpected good fortune with an air that showed him less moved with the benefit than the loss of the benefactor  advertisement notice is hereby given that on monday the   th instant the case of the visit comes on between the hours of ten and eleven at the court of honor

tuesday the  th of november last past between the hours of eight and nine in the evening the indictment set forth that the said mr treatall upon the serving up of the supper desired the ladies to take their places according to their different age and seniority for that it was the way always at his table to pay respect to years the ind ctment added that this produced an unspeakable confusion in the company for that the ladies who before had pressed together for a placo at the upper end of the table immediately crowded with the same disorder toward the end that was quite opposite that mrs frontly had the insoleuce to clap her self down at the very lowest place of the table that the widow partlett seated her self on the right hand of mrs frontly alleging for her excuse that no ceremony was to be used at a round table that mrs fidges and mrs fescue disputed above half an hour for the same chair and that the latter would not give up the cause till it was decided by the parish register which happened to be kept hard by the indictment further said that the rest of the company who sat down did it with a reserve to their right which they were at liberty to assert on another occasion and that mrs mary pippe an old maid was placed by the unanimous vote of the whole company at the upper end of the table from whence she had the confusion to behold several mothers of families among her inferiors the criminal alleged in his defense that what he had done was to raise mirth and avoid ceremony and that the ladies did not complain of his rudeness till the next morning having eaten up what he had provided for them with great readiness and alacrity the censor frowning upon him told him that he ought not to discover so much levity in matters of a serious nature and upon the jurys bringing him in guilty sentenced him to treat the whole assembly of ladies over again and to take care that he did it with the decorum which was due to persons of their quality  rebecoa shapely spinster was indicted by mrs sarah smack for speaking many words resiecting upon her reputation and the heels of her silk slippers which the prisoner had maliciousiy suggested to be two inches higher than they really were the prosecutor urged as an aggravation of her guilt that the prisoner was her self guilty of the same kind of forgery which she had laid to the prosecutors charge for that she the said rebecca shapely did always wear a pair of steel bodice and a false rump the censor ordered the slippers to be produced in open court where the heels were adjudged to be of the statutable size he then ordered the grand jury to search the criminal who after some time spent therein acquitted her of the bodice but found her guilty of the rump upon which she received sentence as is usual in such cases  william trippit esquire of the middle temple brought his action against the lady elizabeth prudely for having refused him her hand as he offered to lead her to her coach from the opera the plaintiff set forth that he had entered himself into the list of those volunteers who officiate every night behind the boxes as gentlemenushers of the playhouse that he had been at a considerable charge in white gloves periwigs and snuffboxes in order to qualify himself for that employment and in hopes of making his fortune by it the council for the defendant replied that the plaintiff had given out that he was within a month of wedding their client and that she had refused her hand to him in ceremony lest he should interpret it as a promise that she would give it him in marriage as soon as their pleadings on both sides were finished the censor ordered the plaintiff to be cashiered from his office of gentleman usher to the playhouse since it was too plain that he had undertaken it with an ill design and at the same time ordered the defendant either to marry the said plaintiff or to pay him half a crown for the new pair of gloves and coachhire that he was at the expense of in her service  the lady townly brought an action of debt against mrs flambeau for that the said mrs flambeau had not been to see the said lady townly and wish her joy since her marriage with sir ralph notwithstanding she the said lady townly had paid mrs flambeau a visit upon her first coming to town it was urged in the behalf of the defendant that the plaintiff had never given her any regular notice of her being in town that the visit she alleged had been made on a monday which she knew was a day on which mrs flambeau was always abroad having set aside that only day in the week to mind the affairs of her family that the servant who enquired whether she was at home did not give the visitingknock that it was not between the hours of five and eight in the evening that there was no candles lighted up that it was not on mrs flambeaus day and in short that there was not one of the essential points observed that constitute a visit she further proved by her porters book which was produced in court that she had paid the lady townly a visit on the twenty fourth day of march just before her leaving the town in the year   0  0 for which she was still creditor to the said lady townly to this the plaintiff only replied that she was now under covert and not liable to any debts contracted when she was a single woman mr bickerstaff finding the cause to be very intricate and that several points of honor were likely to arise in it he deferred giving judgment upon it till the next session day at which time he ordered the ladies on his left hand to present to the court a table of all the laws relating to visits  winifred lear brought her action against richard sly for having broken a marriage contract and wedded another woman after he had engaged himself to marry the said winifred lear she alleged that he had ogled her twice ar an opera thrice in st jamess church and once at powels puppetshow at which time he promised her marriage by a sideglance as her friend could testify that sat by her mr bickerstaff finding that the defendant had made no further overture of love or marriage but by looks and ocular engagement yet at the same time considering how very apt such impudent seducers are to lead the ladies hearts astray ordered the criminal to stand upon the stage in the haymarket between each act of the next opera there to be exposed to public view as a false ogler  upon the rising of the court mr bickerstaff having taken one of these counterfeits in the very fact as he was ogling a lady of the grand jury ordered him to be seized and prosecuted upon the statute of ogling he likewise directed the clerk of the court to draw up an edict against these common cheats that make women believe they are distracted for them by staring them out of countenance

friends house about eleven a clock with a design to renew my visit but upon asking for him his servant told me he was just sat down to dinner in short i found that my old fashioned friend religiously

engaged in the depth of politics at the time when their forefathers were laid down quietly to rest and had nothing in their heads but dreams as we have thus thrown business and pleasure into the hours of rest and by that means made the natural night but half as long as it should be we are forced to piece it out with a great part of the morning so that near two thirds of the nation lie fast asleep for several hours in broad daylight this irregularity is grown so very fashionable at present that there is scarce a lady of quality in great britain that ever saw the sun rise and if the humor increases in proportion to what it has done of late years it is not impossible but our children may hear the bellman going about the streets at nine a clock in the morning and the watch making their rounds till eleven this unaccountable disposition in mankind to continue awake in the night and sleep in sunshine has made me enquire whether the same change of inclination has happened to any other animals for this reason i desired a friend of mine in the country to let me know whether the lark rises as early as he did formerly and whether the cock begins to crow at his usual hour my friend has answered me that his poultry are as regular as ever and that all the birds and the beasts of his neighborhood keep the same hours that they have observed in the memory of man and the same which in all probability they have kept for these five thousand years  if you would see the innovations that have been made among us in this particular you may only look into the hours of colleges where they still

from twelve a clock to three and where it will fix no body knows  i have sometimes thought to draw up a memorial in the behalf of supper against dinner setting forth that the said dinner has made several encroachments upon the said supper and entered very far upon his frontiers that he has banished him out of several families and in all has driven him from his head quarters and forced him to make his retreat into the hours of midnig and in short that he is now in danger of be entirely confounded and lost in a breakfast the who have read lucian and seen the complai of the letter t against

to say the life of man is too short for a storyteller  methusalem might be half an hour in telling what a clock it was but as for us postdiluvians we ought to do every thing in have and in our speeches as well as actions remember that our time is short a man that talks for a quarter of an hour together in company if i meet him frequently takes up a great part of my span a quarter of an hour may be reckoned the eight and fortieth part of a day a day the three hundred and sixtieth part of a year and a year the threescore and tenth part of life by this moral arithmetic supposing a man to be in the talking world one third part of the day whoever gives another a quarter of an hours hearing makes him a sacrifice of more than the four hundred thousandth part of his conversable life  i would establish but one great general rule to be observed in all conversation which is this that men should not talk to please themselves but those that hear them this would make them consider whether what they speak be worth hearing whether there be either wit or sense in what they are about to say and whether it be adapted to the time when the place where and the person to whom it is spoken  for the utter extirpation of these orators and rytellers which i look upon as very great ts of society i have invented a watch which ides the minute into twelve parts after the e manner that the ordinary watches are dided into hours and will endeavor to get a tent which shall oblige every club or comny to provide themselves with one of these atches that shall lie upon the table as an ourglass is often placed near the pulpit to easure out the length of a discourse  i shall be willing to allow a man one round of y watch that is a whole minute to speak in t if he exceeds that time it shall be lawful for y of the company to look upon the watch or  call him down to order  provided however that if any one can make  appear he is turned of threescore he may take o or if he pleases three rounds of the watch without giving offense provided also that this ule be not construed to extend to the fair sex ho shall still be at liberty to talk by the ordiary watch that is now in use i would likewise rnestly recommend this little automaton which ay be easily carried in the pocket without any cumbrance to all such as are troubled with this firmity of speech that upon pulling out their watches they may have frequent occasion to onsider what they are doing and by that means t the thread of their story short and hurry to  conclusion i shall only add that this watch ith a paper of directious how to use it is sold  charles lillies  i am afraid a tatler will be thought a very imoper paper to censure this humor of being alkative but i would have my readers know at there is a great difference

action of assault and battery for that he the said mr heedless having espied a feather upon the shoulder of the said colonel struck it of gently with the end of a walkingstaff value three pence it appeared that the prosecutor did not think himself injured till a few days after the aforesaid blow was given him but that having ruminated with himself for several days and conferred upon it with other officers of the militia he concluded that he had in effect been cudgelled by mr heedless and that he ought to resent it accordingly the council for the prosecutor alleged that the shoulder was the tenderest part in a man of honor that it ad a natural antipathy to a stick and that ery touch of it with any thing made in the ashion of a cane was to be interpreted as a ound in that part and a violation of the perns honor who received it mr heedless relied that what he had done was out of kindess to the prosecutor as not thinking it proper r him to appear at the head of the trainedands with a feather upon his shoulder and rther added that the stick he had made use of n this occasion was so very small that the procutor could not have felt it had he broken it  his shoulders the censor hereupon directed e jury to examine into the nature of the staff r that a great deal would depend upon that rticular upon which he explained to them e different degrees of offense that might be iven by the touch of crabtree from that of ane and by the touch of cane from that of  plain hazle stick the jury after a short persal of the staff declared their opinion by the outh of their foreman that

said the censor i shall decide this cause  the law of retaliation if mr heedless did e colonel a good office the colonel will by is means return it in kind but if mr heedless ould at any time boast that he had cudgelled e colonel or laid his staff over his shoulders e colonel might boast in his turn that he has ushed mr heedlesss jacket or to use the rase of an ingenious author that he has rubd

storyteller that before he met the prisoner he had hindered one of the prisoners acquaintance from the pursuit of his lawful business with the account of his second marriage and that he had detained another by the button of his coat that very morning till he had heard several witty sayings and contrivances of the prosecutors eldest son who was a boy of about five years of age upon the whole matter mr bickerstaff dismissed the accusation as frivolous and sentenced the prosecutor to pay damages to the prisoner for what the prisoner had lost by giving him so long and patient an hearing he further reprimanded the prosecutor very severely and told him that if he proceeded in his usual manner to interrupt the business of mankind he would set a fi upon him for every quarter of an hours

that the profecutor would often times look full in his face but that when he bowed to the said prosecutor he would take no notice of  or bow to some body else that sat quite on the other side of him he likewise alleged that severa ladies had complained of the prosecutor wh ter ogling them a quarter of an hour upon eir making a courtesy to him would not rern the civility of a bow the censor oberving several glances of the prosecutors eye and perceiving that when he talked to the court he looked upon the jury found reason  suspect that there was a wrong cast in his ight which upon

their pretensions to the pleasures and gallantries of youth in proportion to the alteration they find in themselves by the approach of age and infirmities the infirmities of this stage of life would be much fewer if we did not affect those which attend the more vigorous and active part of our days but instead of studying to be wiser or being contented with our present follies the ambition of many of us is also to be the same sort of fools we formerly have been i have often argued as i am a professed lover of women that our sex grows old with a much worse grace than the other does and have ever been of opinion that there are more wellpleased old women than old men i thought it a good reason for this that the ambition of the fair sex being confined to advantageous marriages or shining in the eyes of men their parts were over sooner and consequently the errors in the performance of them the conversation of this evening has not convinced me of the contrary for one or two fop women shall not make a balance for the crowds of coxcombs among our selves diversified according to the different pursuits of pleasure and business  returning home this evening a little before my usual hour i scarce had seated my self in my easy chair stirred the fire and stroaked my cat but i heard some body come rumbling up stairs i saw my door opened and a humane figure advancing toward me so fantastically put together twas some minutes before i discovered it to be my old and intimate friend sam trusty immediately i rose up and placed him in my own seat a compliment i pay to few the first thing he uttered was isaac fetch me a cup of your cherrybrandy before you offer to ask me any question he drunk a lusty draught sat silent for some time and at last broke out i am come quoth he to insult thee for an old fantastic dotard as thou art in ever defending the women i have this evening visited two widows who are now in that state i have often heard you call an afterlife i suppose you mean by it an existence which grows out of past entertainments and is an untimely delight in the satisfactions which they once set their hearts upon too much to be ever able to relinquish have but patience continued he till i give you a succinct account of my ladies and of this nights adventure they are much of an age but very different in their characters the one of them with all the advances which years have made upon her goes on in a certain romantic road of love and friendship which she fell into in her teens the other has transferred the amorous passions of her first years to the love of cronies petts and favorites with which she is always surrounded but the genius of each of them will best appear by the account of what happened to me at their houses about five this afternoon being tired with study the weather inviting and time lying a little upon my hands i resolved at the instigation of my evil genius to visit them their husbands having been our contemporaries this i thought i could do without much trouble for both live in the very nex street i went first to my lady camomile and the butler who had lived long in the family and seen me often in his masters time ushered me very civilly into the parlour and told me though my lady had given strict orders to be denied he was sure i might be admitted and bid the blackboy acquaint his lady that i was to wait upon her in the window lay two letters one broke open the other fresh sealed with a wafer the first directed to the divine cosmelia the second to the charming lucinda but both by the indented characters appeared to have been writ by very unsteady hands such uncommon addresses increased my curiosity and put me upon asking my old friend the butler if he knew who those persons were very well says he this is from mrs furbish to my lady an old schoolfellow and great crony of her ladyships and this the answer i enquired in what country she lived oh dear says he but just by in the neighborhood why she was here all this morning and that letter came and was answered within these two hours they have taken an odd fancy you must know to call one another hard names but for all that they love one another hugely by this time the boy returned with his ladys humble service to me desiring i would excuse her for she could not possibly see me nor any body else for it was opera night  methinks says i such innocent folly as two old womens courtship to each other should rather make you merry than put you out of humor peace good isaac says he no interruption i beseech you i got soon to mrs feebles she that was formerly betty frisk you must needs remember het tom feeble of brazennose fell in love with her for her fine dancing well mrs ursula without further ceremony carries me directly up to her mistresss chamber where i found her environed by four of the most mischievous animals that can ever infest a family an old shock dog with one eye a monkey chaned to one side of the chimney a great gray squirrel to the other and a parrat waddling in the middle of the room however for a while all was in a profound tranquillity upon the mantletree for i am a pretty curious observer stood a pot of lambetive electuary with a stick of liquorish and near it a phyal of rose water and powder of tutty upon the table lay a pipe filled with bettony and coltsfoot a roll of waxcandle a silver spittingpot and a seville orange the lady was placed in a large wicker chair and her feet wrapped up in flannel supported by cushions and in this attitude would you believe it isaac was she reading a romance with spectacles on the first compliments over as she was industriously endeavoring to enter upon conversation a violent fit of coughing seized her this awakened shock and in a trice the whole room was in an uproar for the dog barked the squirrel squealed the monkey chattered the parrat screamed and ursula to appease them was more clamorous than all the rest you isaac who know how any harsh noise affects my head may guess what i suffered from the hideous din of these discordant sounds at length all was appeased and quiet restored a chair was drawn for me where i was no sooner seated but the parrat fixed his horny beak as sharp as a pair of sheers in one of my heels just above the shoe i sprung from the place with an unusual agility and so being within the monkeys reach he snatches off my nw bob wig and throws it upon two apples that were roasting by a sullen seacoal fire i was nimble enough to save it from any further damage than singeing the foretop i put it on and composing my self as well as i could i drew my chair toward the other side of the chimney the good lady as soon as she had recovered breath employed it in making a thousand apologies and with great eloquence and a numerous train of words lamented my misfortune in the middle of her harangue i felt something scratching near my knee and feeling what it should be found the squirrel had got into my coatpocket as i endeavored to remove him from his burrow he made his teeth meet through the fleshy part of my forefinger this gave me an unexpressible pain the hungary water was immediately brought to bath it and goldbeaters skin applied to stop the blood the lady renewed her excuses but being now out of all patience i abruptly took my leave and hobbling down stairs with heedless have i set my foot full in a pail of water and down we came to the bottom together here my friend concluded his narrative and with a composed countenance i began to make him compliments of condoleance but he started from his chair and said isaac you may spare your speeches i expect no reply when i told you this i knew you would laugh at me but the next woman that makes me ridiculous shall be a young one  the tatler no     qui genus humanum ingenio superavit and omnes restinxit stellas exortus uti aerius sol lucr from thursd dec    to saturd dec       0 from my own apartment december    i have heard that it is a rule among the conventuals of several orders in the romish church to shut themselves up at a certain time of the year not only from the world in general but from the members of their own fraternity and to pass away several days by themselves in settling accounts between their maker and their own souls in cancelling unrepented crimes and renewing their contracts of obedience for the future such stated times for particular acts of devotion or the exercise of certain religious duties have been enjoined in all civil governments whatever deity they worshipped or whatever religion they professed that which may be done at all times is often totally neglected and forgotten unless fixed and determined to some time more than another and therefore though several duties may be suitable to every day of our lives they are most likely to be performed if some days are more particularly set apart for the practice of them our church has accordingly instituted several seasons of devotion when time custom prescription and if i may so say the fashion it self call upon a man to be serious and attentive to the great end of his being  i have hinted in some former papers that the greatest and wisest of men in all ages and countries particularly in rome and greece were renowned for their piety and virtue it is now my intention to show how those in our own nation that have been unquestionably the most eminent for learning and knowledge were likewise the most eminent for their adherence to the religion of their country  i might produce very shining examples from among the clergy but because priestcraft is the common cry of every cavelling empty scribbler i shall show that all the laymen who have exerted a more than ordinary genius in their writings and were the glory of their times were men whose hopes were filled with immortality and the prospect of future rewards and men who lived in a dutiful submission to all the doctrines of revealed religion  i shall in this paper only instance sir francis bacon a man who for the greatness of genius and compass of knowledge did honor to his age and country i could almost say to humane nature it self he possessed at once all those extraordinary talents which were divided amongst the greatest authors of antiquity he had the sound distinct comprehensive knowledge of aristotle with all the beautiful lights graces and embellishments of cicero one does not know which to admire most in his writings the strength of reason force of style or brightness of imagination  this author has remarked in several parts of his works that a thorough infight into philosophy makes a good believer and that a smattering in it naturally produces such a race of despicable infidels as the little profligate writers of the present age whom i must confess i have always accused to my self not so much for their want of faith as their want of learning  i was infinitely pleased to find among the works of this extraordinary man a prayer of his own composing which for the elevation of thought and greatness of expression seems rather the devotion of an angel than a man his principal fault seems to have been the excess of that virtue which covers a multitude of faults this betrayed him to so great an indulgence toward his servants who made a corrupt use of it that it stripped him of all those riches and honors which a long series of merits had heaped upon him but in this prayer at the same time that we find him prostrating himself before the great mercyseat and humbled under afflictions which at that time lay heavy upon him we see him supported by the sense of his integrity his zeal his devotion and his love to mankind which give him a much higher figure in the minds of thinking men than that greatness had done from which he was fallen i shall beg leave to write down the prayer it self with the title to it as it was found among his lordships papers written in his own hand not being able to furnish my reader with an entertainment more suitable to this solemn time  a prayer or psalm made by my lord bacon chancellor of england most gracious lord god my merciful father from my youth up my creator my redeemer my comforter thou o lord soundest and searchest the depths and secrets of all hearts thou acknowledgest the upright of heart thou judge the hypocrite thou ponderest mens thoughts and doings as in a balance thou measurest their intentions as with a line vanity and crooked ways cannot be hid from thee  remember o lord how thy servant has walked before thee remember what i have first sought and what has been principal in my intentions i have loved thy assemblies i have mourned for the divisions of thy church i have delighted in the brightness of thy sanctuary this vine which thy right hand has planted in this nation i have ever prayed unto thee that it might have the first and the latter rain and that it might stretch her branches to the seas and to the floods the state and bread of the poor and oppressed have been precious in mine eyes i have hated all cruelty and hardness of heart i have though in a despised weed procured the good of all men if any have been my enemies i thought not of them neither has the sun almost set upon my displeasure but i have been as a dove free from superfluity of maliciousness thy creatures have been my books but thy scriptures much more i have sought thee in the courts fields and gardens but i have found thee in thy temples  thousands have been my sins and ten thousands my transgressions but thy sanctifications have remained with me and my heart through thy grace has been an unquenched coal upon thine altar  o lord my strength i have since my youth met with thee in all my ways by thy fatherly compassions by thy comfortable chastisements and by thy most visible providence as thy favors have increased upon me so have thy corrections so as thou have been always near me o lord and ever as my worldly blessings were exalted so secret darts from thee have pierced me and when i have ascended before men i have descended in humiliation before thee and now when i thought most of peace and honor thy hand is heavy upon me and has humbled me according to thy former loving kindness keeping me still in thy fatherly school not as a bastard but as a child just are thy judgments upon me for my sins which are more in number than the sands of the sea but have no proportion to thy mercies for what are the sands of the sea earth heavens and all these are nothing to thy mercies besides my innumerable sins i confess before thee that i am debtor to thee for the gracious talent of thy gifts and graces which i have neither put into a napkin nor put it as i ought to exchangers where it might have made best profit but misspent it in things for which i was least fit so i may truly say my soul has been a stranger in the course of my pilgrimage be merciful unto me o lord for my saviors sake and receive me unto thy bosom or guide me in thy ways  the tatler no      o te bollane cerebri felicem aiebam tacitus cum quidlibet ille garriret  hor from saturd dec    to tuesd dec       0 from my own apartment at my coming home last night i found upon my table the following petition or project sent me from lloyds coffeehouse in the city with a present of port wine which had been bought at a late auction held in that place  to isaac bickerstaff esquire censor of great britain lloyds coffeehouse lombard street dec    we the customers of this coffeehouse observing that you have taken into your consideration the great mischiefs daily done in this city by coffeehouse orators do humbly beg leave to represent to you that this coffeehouse being provided with a pulpit for the benefit of such auctions that are frequently made in this place it is our custom upon the first coming in of the news to order a youth who officiates as the kidney of the coffeehouse to get into the pulpit and read every paper with a loud and distinct voice while the whole audience are sipping their respective liquors we do therefore sir humbly propose that there be a pulpit erected within every coffeehouse of this city and the adjacent parts that one of the waiters of the coffeehouse be nominated as reader to the said pulpit that after the news of the day has been published by the said lecturer some politician of good note do ascend into the said pulpit and after having chosen for his text any article of the said news that he do establish the authority of such article clear the doubts that may arise thereupon compare it with parellel texts in other papers advance upon it wholesome points of doctrine and draw from it salutary conclusions for the benefit and edification of all that hear him we do likewise humbly propose that upon any such politicians quitting the pulpit he shall be succeeded by any other orator that finds himself moved by the same public spirit who shall be at full liberty either to enforce or overthrow what the other has said before him and may in the same manner be succeeded by any other politician who shall with the same liberty confirm or impugn his reasons strengthen or invalidate his conjectures enlarge upon his schemes or erect new ones of his own we do likewise further propose that if any person of what age or rank soever do presume to cavil at any paper that has been read or to hold forth upon it longer than the space of one minute that he be immediately ordered up into the pulpit there to make good any thing that he has suggested upon the floor we do likewise further propose that if any one plays the orator in the ordinary coffeehouse conversation whether it be upon peace or war on plays or sermons business or poetry that he be forth with desired to take his place in the pulpit  this sir we humbly presume may in a great measure put a stop to those superficial statesmen who would not dare to stand up in this manner before a whole congregation of politicians notwithstanding the long and tedious harangues and dissertations which they daily utter in private circles to the breaking of many honest tradesmen the seducing of several eminent citizens the making of numberless malcontents and to the great detriment and disquiet of her majestys subjects  i do heartily concur with my ingenious friends of the abovementioned coffeehouse in these their proposals and because i apprehend there may be reasons to put an immediate stop to the grievance complained of it is my intention that till such time as the aforesaid pulpits can be erected every orator do place himself within the bar and from thence dictate whatsoever he shall think necessary for the public good  and further because i am very desirous the proper ways and means should be found out f the suppressing of storytellers and fine talke in all ordinary conversation whatsoever i do isist that in every private club company  meeting over a bottle there be always an elbo chair placed at the table and that as soon a any one begins a long story or extends his dicourse beyond the space of one minute he  forthwith thrust into the said elbow chair  less upon any of the companys calling out t the chair he breaks off abruptly and holds hi tongue  there are two species of men notwithstanding any thing that has been here said whom  would exempt from the disgrace of the elbo chair the first are those buffoons that have  talent of mimicking the speech and behaviou of other persons and turning all their patron friends and acquaintance into ridicule i loo upon your pantomime as a legion in a man or at least to be like virgils monster with an hundred mouths and as many tongues  linguae centum sunt oraque centum and therefore would give him as much time to talk in as would be allowed to the whole body of persons he represents were they actually in the company which they divert by proxy provided however that the said pantomime do not upon any pretense whatsoever utter any thing in his own particular opinion language or character  i would likewise in the second place grant an exemption from the elbow chair to any person who treats the company and by that means may be supposed to pay for his audience a guest cannot take it ill if he be not allowed to talk in his turn by a person who puts his mouth to a better employment and stops it with good beef and mutton in this case the guest is very agreeably silenced and seems to hold his tongue under that kind of bribery which the ancients called bos in lingua  if i can once extirpate the race of solid and substantial humdrums i hope by my wholesome and repeated advices quickly to reduce the insignificant tittletattles and matteroffactmen that abound in every quarter of this great city  epictetus in his little system of morality prescribes the following rule with that beautiful simplicity which shines through all his precepts beware that thou never tell thy dreams in company for notwithstanding thou may take a pleasure in telling thy dreams the company will take no pleasure in hearing them  this rule is conformable to a maxim which i have laid down in a late paper and must always inculcate into those of my readers who find in themselves an inclination to be very talkative and impertinent that they should not speak to please themselves but those that hear them  it has been often observed by witty essaywriters that the deepest waters are always the most silent that empty vessels make the greatest sound and tinckling cymbals the worst music the marquess of hallifax in his admirable advice to a daughter tells her that good sense has always something sullen in it but as sullenness does not only imply silence but an illnatured silence i wish his lordship had given a softer name to it since i am engaged unawares in quotations i must not omit the satyr which horace has written against this impertinent talkative companion and which i think is fuller of humor than any other satyr he has written this great author who had the nicest taste of conversation and was himself a most agreeable companion had so strong an antipathy to a great talker that he was afraid some time or other  would be mortal to him as he has very humorously

relate to very great mischiefs in the most important articles of life love and friendship  dorsetshire december  0 mr bickerstaff it is my misfortune to be enamoured of a lady that is neither very beautiful very witty nor at all wellnatured but has the vanity to think she excels in all these qualifications and therefore is cruel insolent and scornful when i study to please her she treats me with the utmost rudeness and ill manners if i approach her person she fights she scratches me if i offer a civil salute she bites me insomuch that very lately before a whole assembly of ladies and gentlemen she ripped out a considerable part of my left cheek this is no sooner done but she begs my pardon in the most handsome and becoming terms imaginable gives her self worse language than i could find in my heart to do lets me embrace her to pacify her while she is railing at her self protests she deserves the esteem of no one living says i am too good to contradict her when she thus accuses her self this attones for all tempts me to renew my addresses which are ever returned in the same obliging manner thus without some speedy relief i am in danger of losing my whole face notwithstanding all this i dote upon her and am satisfied she loves me because she takes me for a man of sense which i have generally thought except in this one instance your reflections upon this strange amor would be very useful in these parts where we are overrun with wild beauties and romps i earnestly beg your assistance either to deliver me from the power of this unaccountable enchantment or by some proper animadversions civilize the behavior of this agreeable rustic i am  sir your most humble servant ebenezer   mr bickerstaff i now take leave to address you in your character of censor and complain to you that among the various errors in conversation which you have corrected there is one which though it has not escaped a general reproof yet seems to deserve a more particular severity it is an humor of jesting on disagreeable subjects and insisting on the jest the more it creates uneasiness and this some men think they have a title to do as friends is the design of jesting to provoke or does friendship give a privilege to say things with a design to shock how can that be called a jest which has nothing in it but bitterness it is generally allowed necessary for the peace of company that men should a little study the tempers of each others but certainly that must be in order to shun what is offensive not to make it a constant entertainment the frequent repetition of what appears harsh will unavoidably leave a rancour that is fatal to friendship and i doubt much whether it would be an argument of a mans good humor if he should be rouzed by perpetual teazing to treat those that do it as his enemies in a word whereas it is a common practice to let a story die merely because it does not touch i think such as mention one they find does are as troublesome to society and as unfit for it as wags men of fire good talkers or any other apes in conversation and therefore for the public benefit i hope you will cause them to be branded with such a name as they deserve i am  sir yours patient friendly   the case of ebenozer is a very common one and is always cured by neglect these fantastical returns of affection proceed from a certain vanity in the other sex supported by a perverted taste in ours i must publish it as a rule that no faults which proceed from the will either in a mistress or a friend are to be tolerated but we should be so complaisant to ladies to let them displease when they aim at doing it pluck up a spirit ebenezer recover the use of your judgment and her faults will appear or her beauties vanish her faults begin to please me as well as my own is a sentence very prettily put into the mouth of a lover by the comic poet but he never designed it for a maxim of life but the picture of an imperfection if ebenezer takes my advice the same temper which made her insolent to his love will make her submissive to hi indifference  i cannot wholly ascribe the faults mentioned i the second letter to the same vanity or prid in companions who secretly triumph over their friends in being sharp upon them in things where they are most tender but when this for of behavior does not proceed from that source it does from barrenness of invention and an inability to support a conversation in a way less offensive it is the same poverty which makes men speak or write smuttily that forces them to talk vexingly as obscene language is an address to the lewd for applause so are sharp allusions an appeal to the illnatured but mean and illiterate is that conversation where one man exercises his wit to make another exercise his patience  advertisement whereas plagius has been told again and again both in public and private that he preaches excellently well and still goes on to preach as well as ever and all this to a polite and learned audience this is to desire that he would not hereafter be so eloquent except to a country congregation the proprietors of tillotsons works having consulted the learned in the law whether preaching a sermon they have purchased is not to be construed publishing their copy  mr dogood is desired to consider that his story is severe upon a weakness and not a folly  the tatler no   0 cum pulchris tunicis sumet nova consilia and spes hor from thursday dec    to saturday dec  0    0 from my own apartment december    according to my late resolution i take the holydays to be no improper season to entertain the town with the addresses of my correspondents in my walks every day there appear all round me very great offenders in the point of dress an armed tailor had the impudence yesterday in the park to smile in my face and pull off a laced hat to me as it were in contempt of my authority and censure however it is a very great satisfaction that other people as well as my self are offended with these improprieties the following notices from persons of different sexes and qualities are a sufficient instance how useful my lucubrations are to the public  jacks coffeehouse near guildhall dec    cousin bickerstaff it has been the peculiar blessing of our family to be always above the smiles or frowns of fortune and by a certain greatness of mind to restrain all irregular fondnesses or passions from hence it is that though a long decay and a numerous descent have obliged many of our house to fall into the arts of trade and business no one person of us has ever made an appearance that betrayed our being unsatisfied with our own station of life or has ever affected a mien or gesture unsuitable to it  you have up and down in your writings very justly remarked that it is not this or the other profession or quality among men that gives us honor and esteem but the well or ill behaving our selves in those characters it is therefore with no small concern that i behold in coffeehouses and public places my brethren the tradesmen of this city put off the smooth even and ancient decorum of thriving citizens for a fantastical dress and figure improper for their persons and characters to the utter destruction of that order and distinction which of right ought to be between st jamess and milkstreet the camp and cheapside  i have given my self some time to find out how distinguishing the frays in a lot of muslins or drawing up a regiment of thread laces or making a panegyric on pieces of sagathy or scotchplod should entitle a man to a laced hat or sword a wig tied up with ribands or an embroidered coat the college say this enormity proceeds from a sort of delirium in the brain which makes it break out first about the head and for want of timely remedies fall upon the left thigh and from thence in little mazes and windings run over the whole body as appears by pretty ornaments on the buttons buttonholes garterings sides of the breeches and the like i beg the favor of you to give us a discourse wholly upon the subject of habits which will contribute to the better government of conversation amongst us and in particular oblige  sir your affectionate cousin felix tranquillus   to isaac bickerstaff esquire censor of great britain the humble petition of ralph nab haberdasher of hats and many other poor sufferers of the same trade shows that for some years last past the use of gold and silver galloon upon hats has been almost universal being undistinguishably worn by soldiers squires lords footmen beaus sportsmen traders clerks prigs smarts cullies pretty fellows and sharpers  that the said use and custom has been two ways very prejudicial to your petitioners first in that it has induced men to the great damage of your petitioners to wear their hats upon their heads by which means the said hats last much longer whole than they would do if worn under their arms secondly in that very often a new dressing and a new lace supply the place of a new hat which grievance we are chiefly sensible of in the springtime when the company is leaving the town it so happening commonly that a hat shall frequent all winter the finest and best assemblies without any ornaments at all and in may shall be tricked up with gold or silver to keep company with rusticks and ride in the rain  all which premises your petitioners humbly pray you to take into your consideration and either to appoint a day in your court of honor when all pretenders to the galloon may enter their claims and have them approved or rejected or to give us such other relief as to your great wisdom shall seem meet  and your petitioners etc order my friend near temple bar the author of the huntingcock to assist the court when this petition is read of which mr lilly to give him notice  to isaac bickerstaff esquire censor of great britain the humble petition of elizabeth slender spinster shows that on the  0th of this instant decembe her friend rebecca hive and your petitioner walking in the strand saw a gentleman before us in a gown whose periwig was so long and so much powdered that your petitioner took notice of it and said she wondered that lawyer would so spoil a new gown with powder to which it was answered that he was no lawyer but a clergyman upon a wager of a pot of coffee we overtook him and your petitioner was soon convinced she had lost  your petitioner therefore desires your worship to cite the clergyman before you and to settle and adjust the length of canonical periwigs and the quantity of powder to be made use of in them and to give such other directions as you shall think fit  and your petitioner etc q whether this gentleman be not chaplain to a regiment and in such case allow powder accordingly  after all that can be thought on these subjects i must confess that the men who dress with a certain ambition to appear more than they are are much more excusable than those who betray in the adoing their persons a secret vanity and inclination to shine in things wherein if they did succeed it would rather lessen than advance their character for this reason i am more provoked at the allegations relating to the clergyman than any other hinted at in these complaints i have indeed a long time with much concern observed abundance of pretty fellows in sacred orders and shall in due time let them know that i pretend to give ecclesiastical as well as civil censures a man well bred and well dressed in that habit adds to the sacredness of his function and agreeableness not to be met with among the laity i own i have spent some evenings among the men of wit of that profession with an inexpressible delight their habitual care of their character gives such a chastisement to their fancy that all which they utter in company is as much above what you meet with in other conversations as the charms of a modest are superior to those of a light woman i therefore earnestly desire our young missionaries from the universities to consider where they are and not dress and look and move like young officers it is no disadvantage to have a very handsome white hand but were i to preach repentance to a gallery of ladies i would methinks keep my gloves on i have an unfeigned affection to the class of mankind appointed to serve at the altar therefore am in danger of running out of my way and growing too serious on this occasion for which reason i shall end with the following epistle which by my interest in tom trot the pennypost i procured a copy of  to the rev mr ralph incense chaplain to the countess dowager of brumpton sir i heard and saw you preach last sunday i am an ignorant young woman and understood not half you said but ah your manner when you held up both your hands toward our pew did you design to win me to heaven or your self  your humble servant penitence gentle   advertisements mr proctorstaff of clarehall in cambridge  received as a kinsman according to his reques bearing date the  0th instant  the distressed son of aesculapius is desired to be more particular  the tatler no     from saturday dec  0 to tuesday jan      0 the printer having informed me that there are as many of these papers printed as will make four volumes i am now come to the end of my ambition in this matter and have nothing further to say to the world under the character of isaac bickerstaff this work has indeed for some time been disagreeable to me and the purpose of it wholly lost by my being so long understood as the author i never designed in it to give any man any secret wound by my concealment but spoke in the character of an old man a philosopher an humorist an astrologer and a censor to allure my reader with the variety of my subjects and insinuate if i could the weight of reason with the agreeableness of wit the general purpose of the whole has been to recommend truth innocence honor and virtue as the chief ornaments of life but i considered that severity of manners was absolutely necessary to him who would censure others and for that reason and that only chose to talk in a mask i shall not carry my humility so far as to call my self a vicious man but at the same time must confess my life is at best but pardonable and with no greater character than this a man would make but an indifferent progress in attacking prevailing and fashionable vices which mr bickerstaff has done with a freedom of spirit that would have lost both its beauty and efficacy had it been pretended to by mr steel  as to the work it self the acceptance it has met with is the best proof of its value but i should err against that candor which an honest man should always carry about him if i did not own that the most approved pieces in it were written by others and those which have been most excepted against by my self the hand that has assisted me in those noble discourses upon the immortality of the soul the glorious prospects of another life and the most sublime ideas of religion and virtue is a person who is too fondly my friend ever to own them but i should little deserve to be his if i usurped the glory of them i must acknowledge at the same time that i think the finest strokes of wit and humor in all mr bickerstaffs lucubrations are those for which he is also beholden to him  as for the satirical parts of these writings those against the gentlemen who profess gaming are the most licentious but the main of them i take to come from losing gamesters as invectives against the fortunate for in very many of them i was very little else but the transcriber if any have been more particularly marked at such persons may impute it to their own behavior before they were touched upon in publicly speaking their resentment against the author and professing they would support any man who should insult him when i mention this subject i hope major general davenport brigadier bisset and my lord forbes will accept of my thanks for their frequent good offices in professing their readiness to partake any danger that should befall me in so just an undertaking as the endeavor to banish fraud and couzenage from the presence and conversation of gentlemen  but what i find is the least excusable part of all this work is that i have in some places in it touched upon matters which concern both the church and state all i shall say for this is that the points i alluded to are such as concerned every christian and freeholder in england and i could not be cold enough to conceal my opinion on subjects which related to either of those characters but politics apart i must confess it has been a most exquisite pleasure to me to frame characters of domestic life and put those parts of it which are least observed into an agreeable view to enquire into the seeds of vanity and affectation to lay before my readers the emptiness of ambition in a word to trace humane life through all its mazes and recesses and show much shorter methods than men ordinarily practice to be happy agreeable and great  but to enquire into mens faults and weaknesses has something in it so unwelcome that i have often seen people in pain to act before me whose modesty only make them think themselves liable to censure this and a thousand other nameless things have made it an irksome task to me to personate mr bickerstaff any longer and i believe it does not often happen that the reader is delighted where the author is displeased  all i can now do for the further gratification of the town is to give them a faithful index and explication of passages and allusions and sometimes of persons intended in the several scattered parts of the work at the same time the succeeding volumes shall discover which of the whole have been written by me and which by others and by whom as far as i am able or permitted  thus i have voluntarily done what i think all authors should do when called upon i have published my name to my writings and given my self up to the mercy of the town as
