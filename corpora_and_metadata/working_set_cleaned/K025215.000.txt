a treatise of the gravel and stone showing i their nature causes difference and symptoms ii the method of curing them iii how to ease and remove the fits when present and iv to prevent them for the future   with their proper remedies prescribed and easily to be prepared by the patients themselves  written in compassion to those who are unhappily afflicted with these torturous diseases by a late learned and eminent physicain of the college from his many years practical observations and experience in these cures  and is allowed by every one of the many physicians of note that have perused it and must by the whole faculty of physic to be the most rational discourse on the gravel and stone ever written and the method and medicines for their relief and cure the most safe and efficacious that can be advised to  london printed for j torbuck in clarecourt near drury lane and e torbuck at the half moon in exeterexchange in the strand mdccxxxviii price   s  the preface the person who publishes this short discourse and directions having experienced for several years last past in his own practice both as a physician and surgeon the great and indeed wonderful effects of the methods and medicines herein laid down and prescribed for the ease and cure of the gravel and stone thought it a duty incumbent upon him to make the same known as much as possible for the universal benefit of mankind that those who unhappily labor under the severity of these cruel diseases and have not heard of the remedies and may at any time stand in need of the assistance that will be afforded by them may have it in their power wherever they may chance to be so they have but the book in their pockets of applying them and that either prepared by themselves or having them prepared by an apothecary  the whole of what is here written is with some variations and small additions taken from the works of no less a man than the late worthy sir richard blackmore knt doctor of physic and fellow of the royal college of physicians in london and in his time physician in ordinary to his late majesty king william by saying of which it is enough without any encomium of mine or any ones else as to his learning consummate knowledge and long experience in the cure of diseases in general as well as of these in particular his fame therein as well as his integrity humanity and compassionate regar to his afflicted and distressed patients being sufficiently known in london  all therefore that i shall say is that every patient under the torture of these merciless diseases will not fail i speak by repeated experience to find relief and a cure if they but make timely and distinct application of the remedies and live up to the easy rules and directions so plainly and faithfully without any reserve herein laid down and explained and as they are medicines not prescribed at random or at a venture but upon the judicious and sedate consideration of the author in a regular way grounded upon reason and low experience and which the doctor had ever found successful when he had been called to the relief of patients in these deplorable distresses they are the more to be regarded and particularly so as they in every circumstance have corresponded with the opinions of the best of physicians and by consequence must stand approved by the whole faculty of physic  and though the doctor seems to explode the possibility of dissolving the stone yet he has confined his opinion to those only of them that are hard and compact those of them that are porus light and friable he admits may he dissolved or at leastwise crumbled or divided into small fragments or parts so as to be rendered passable and has herein also prescribed such remedies which he has long experienced to have done it  physicians i well know very much differ as to the possibility of dissolving the stone many of them affirming it has been done without any distinction of hard or soft and may be daily done and have recited the cases of many patient cured thereby nor are there wanting as many who as flatly deny the possibility thereof for the first i have now before me the works of several authors of good credit and the cases of diverse patients in confirmation of their assertions and in particular one of the said authors lately famed therein says that though the dissolution of the stone by medicines has been for a long time exploded as impracticable yet i must confess says he i never could come into that notion i always was of opinion says he that no distemper was incurable and that only our ignorance of the causes made some more difficult to handle than others but that if we could see into the original spring of the most obstinate and stubborn maladies we should find them as tractable and easy to cure as those that lie more obvious to our view and i persuade myself continues he that if the positions i have advanced in defense of a dissolution of the stone be brought to the test of reason the arguments will be unanswerable and that though some may object against the most evident matters of fact yet no arguments are strong against demonstration  and in confidence of these his sentiments and proofs of his assertions he names several cases where there has been a manifest dissolution by several prescriptions he gives and one of them in particular which he says he has more than ordinary experienced successful and recommends it as a most sovereign lithontriptick and believes that a more powerful dissolvent is not yet known to mortals  but of these i shall say more in a second part which i purpose in no long time god willing to make public according as i have noted at the end of this first part  i of the nature causes difference and symptoms of the gravel and stone the disease of the stone either in the kidneys or the bladder and that of the gout which are nearly related are two of the most cruel and inexorable tyrants that persecute the race of mankind so great is their violence and so unextinguished their fury that they afflict the unhappy patients with such frequent and insufferable tortures as make life an undesirable possession and rather a burden too hard to bear than a state of satisfaction and enjoyment and had not the allwise divine author planted in our nature so strong an aversion to death and dissolution it is highly probable that many grown utterly impatient of undergoing such a weight of misery would lay hands upon themselves and soon put an end to their calamities and their lives together the grievance or the first to much overbalancing the pleasure of the last some it is true of these forlorn creatures have endeavored to ease themselves by adventuring on these tragical expedients and no doubt multiudes more woud follow their example did not a principle of religion among christians and a powerful instinct of selfpreservation among all men control their impatience and prevent selfexecution nor is it a wondr they should prefer the shades and tranquillity or the grave to the heats and inquietudes of such acute diseases  but it must be allowed that of this pair so near y allied the stone and the gout the first is the most terrible and distinguished for its fierceness and cruelty this lictor and minister of death inflicts above all others the sharpest and most insufferable tortures what a melancholy scene what a moving spectacle of mortal nature is it to see the unhappy patient extended on the rack groaning and crying out in agonies of distress and unspeakable torment ever night is half spent he wishes for day when day appears he longs for night distracted with his sufferings he lies wakeful counting the hours any one of which when protracted and multiplied by raging misery seems a numerous train so sluggish and unprogressive does time grow under grievous sufferings he changes his pillow but not his pain newmakes his bed but keeps his old inquietudes and though he often turns from side to side he never leaves his agonies behind they hapless state know no cessation or interruption if they sometimes remit and abate their violence they soon recover their strength rekindle their rage and insult the patient with as great fury as before it must therefore be a commendable action and becoming an aesculapian worthy to endeavor with all his might to repel or disable this plague that so much infests mankind and therefore accordingly i have undertaken to assist those who have already attacked this pest with skill and vigor for this is not the work of a single aggressor but as in hunting down a forest beast or that enormous bird the ostrich many champions unite their power armed with various instruments of death cutlasses lances hooks and javelins that with different weapons and mutual assistance they may subdue the enemy or at least oblige him to retreat so as a ready auxiliary i bring my forces such as they are to join those of abler combatants in order to quell this formidable enemy at least to diminish his strength and restrain his fury  as to the nature of the disease there are scarce any part of the body privileged from breeding stones in their larger cavities or more minute interstices which are in some measure diversified according to the nature of the bowels or organs where they are produced they are found sometimes in the external muscles of the body as well as in the lungs the stomach the liver the gall bladder the bowels or contents of the abdomen as well as in the tongue the brain and even the blood it self for several credible authors have affirmed that upon opening a vein small stones together with the spouting blood have rushed into the receiver in all which nest the petrifying principles meeting and embracing each other produce a single stone or a quarry of them but this discourse is confined to the stone in the kidneys and that in the bladder which in this dissertation i shall consider as the same and not as the disease of a distinct species when it is formed and settled in either kidney it is accompanied with various symptoms according as it is large or small smooth or rugged fixed or loose closely or slightly coherent i e hard and solid or friable and porous  of the minute stone that is the grit and gravel formed of sandy rudiments in the kidneys or bladder which however are perfect stones there are three sorts distinguished by their color that is white yellow and red white is the native complexion of these little bodies atoms indeed in respect of those of the largest dimension as are the sands on the shore when compared with the rock at whose feet they lie these primitive stones are however so close and unporous that the cohesion of their parts are not to be unclasped and dissolved but with great difficulty insomuch that they imitate the hardness of the diamond and will polish glass like the dust of that jewel as celebrated authors assert and it facilitates our belief of the indissoluble structure of this grit when we reflect on the like quality in that called hourglass sand which is found by experience to be less porous or more solid than flint and therefore the operators in glass have laid aside the first and now employ the last as materials for their finest works but these minute white stones cannot as i conceive give nephritick pains or a fit of the stone unless a collection or congeries of them are involved or united by some adventitious mucous slimy or other anomalous matter so as to form a moles or bulk large enough to obstruct the mouths or channels of the urinary passages and that it is true may sometimes happen but generally speaking since the minute pale stones are so smooth and small that they may enter with ease the orifices of the urinary aquaeducts and passing through those conveyances may without creating pain or trouble be excluded with the common stream and though there should be a great quantity of that small incoherent sand it may however without difficulty flow through the ureters into the bladder with the serous current and together with it be discharged  as to the yellow gravel it is evident that the minute particles that compose it are stained with that color by the alkalizate or lixivial salts of the urine which abounds with such contents and this mixture in the small yellow stones is the reason why they are less solid and more dissoluble than the white of a purer composition which is likewise observed and from the same reason in the stones generated in the receptacle of the gall whose parts have not that strict connection and close structure as the white  the red gravel receives that complexion from being infected with a little drop of blood issuing from some lacerated vein where the gravel lay  all these if they are ragged and uneven may by pricking vellicating or wounding the tender membranes that include them cause either duller and heavier or more acute pains according as they are armed with more or less pointed angles whilst they lie in the pelvis or basin of the kidneys and there roused and disturbed by the motion of the body on foot or horseback rub upon and fret the neighboring membranes and so nephritick sufferings may arise from gravel which consists in real and perfect stones as before observed though called sand or a friable gritty matter by reason of their small dimension this is the first nephritick symptom before a larger stone is formed which however is vexatious and often attended not only with pain but much inquietude sickness of the stomach and a general disorder of the whole economy while the sandy atoms that lie heaped up in the kidneys are worked and agitated by the motion of the back or loins irritate and gaul their membranes of exquisite sense during their confinement in those lodgings  it ought to be observed that there are often sound in the urine of persons in good health or at least not much distempered a red gravel or sand that sticks to the sides of the urinal or chamber pot that receives it but this is not the genuine gravel that causes nephritick sufferings but the production of the blood in persons of a scorbutic disposition or a warm temperament and is distinguished from the true gravel in this that the last falls down immediately after the urine is rendered to the bottom of the receiver whereas the spurious kind does not break off from its mixture and union with the urine till after some hours standing in that vessel when it is at length loosed from its embraces precipitated and thrust down by the cold of the air and afterward if the urine be gradually heated again it will recover its former connection with it which is not the case of the genuine nephritick gravel besides there is often observed in persons of such a constitution a thin substance floating on the surface of their urine imitating melted fat or grease but when it is skimmed off and dried upon a paper placed in the sun it discovers it self to consist of gritty saline concretions united together by some viscous or slimy bonds  if the stones are of a larger size than those called sand or gravel they affect humane bodies with yet more painful and afflictive symptoms and supposing that their figure is unequal and varied with many angles then their points especially upon bodily motion vex and vellicate the repositories where they are nested and as so many sharp thorns in the sides of the pelvis continually grieve prick or wound their membranes whence arises the frequent discharge of bloody urine a common symptom of this cruel disease which if fresh and newly let out of the veins gives the urine a red color and the blood is discernable to the sight but if it has lain for some time extravasate in the bladder or if but a few drops stay in that manner in the kidneys by turning to grumous and coagulated clots they impart a dark and blackish tincture to the urine not unlike to that of coffee this is a symptom likewise that often accompanies this distemper it is true also that pale limpid water sometimes attends the paroxysms of the stone like that observed in convulsive hypocondriacal and hysteric passions and from the same cause that is the spasmodick disorder or contraction of the system of the nerves during the fit  another symptom that accompanies the stones last described is great sickness of the somach nausea and frequent vomitings or strainings to vomit for while the fibers in the kidneys are grieved and lacerated by the rough stone or stones bred and confined there the suffering is propagated to the stomach by a consent of parts or communication of nerves from one of those bowels to the other and this is so distinguishing a symptom of this disease in the kidneys that other symptoms without this are not sufficient to induce the physician to pronounce the distemper the stone  if the stone in the kidneys be some degree larger and likewise jagged it creates unsufferable pains while it remains in the pelvi or basin of the kidneys grating and lacerating the enclosing membrane or while if strives through the ureters and wounds the fibers as they make their way  when the stone formed in the kidneys is grown yet larger and so disproportioned to the mouth of the ureter that it cannot enter even though its superficies is smooth and equal it will obstruct the orifice of that tube while it attempts to pass into it or will stick in the channel of it and while it continues fixed there as it stops the current of the water through the pipe so it creates exqusite and enormous misery by distending the sensible membranes and if it be unequal and ragged it will produce the most afflictive tortures till it is protrude by art or nature through the ureter and excluded into the bladder this happens as often as the stone grows to a greater size than is suitable to the inlet and passage of that tube and the effect is the same if the stone though not of a disproportinate bulk to pass the ureter should however lie across the orifice for then it will obstruct the descent of the urine and create great disorder till it find a proper position and its figure is adapted to the inlet and then it enters and is at last discharged  after the stone has made its passage through the ureters for some years by stretching and enlarging the road so often it becomes capacious enough to receive much larger stones than the first and to let them through into the bladder so that the cavity of the ureter through which they have passed so long is by degrees sometimes extended to a fingers breadth as unquestionable authors assure us the stone of the kidneys is likewise considered as loose or fixed if as loose and floating or not adherent to any part of that bowel but is always attempting to pass the ureters to the bladder it produces the painful symptoms before described but if it is fixed it then nests itself and settles in the substance of the kidneys where it grows by accretion of parts and spreads ike branching coral through the body of the kidney and while it lodges there in this quiet and inactive state the patient may sometimes feel heaviness or a weight in the back which however is but an inconsiderable suffering and some in this condition have felt no symptom at all and dyed of other distempers and when they were after death dissected by the srgeon a considerable stone has been discovered propagated through the kidney of which however the patient never complained  and this was the case as i have been informed of the late lord mohuns father who being opened after he dyed of a wound received in a duel a large stone was discovered spreading through the kidney of which notwithstanding in his life time he was entirely unconscious i likewise knew an eminent divine of a very lean and unmuscular constitution who told me in conversation that suspecting he had a stone in the kidneys tried one night in bed if he could not feel it and by pressing his loins much emaciated with his long fingers he assured me he felt the stone and then said h i reflected it must be a large one propagated through that bowel and therefore that no medicinal methods should be attempted to break it lest the fragments falling into the pelvis should stop the passage of the ureters and create great fits of the stone upon this said he i fll asleep and during many years thought of it no more till of late some incident which he named and i have forgotten brought again to his mind this observation and when he some years afterward died and was dissected a large stone was found in his kidney which though he felt as said before yet lying undisturbed and quiet in its nest it gave him little uneasiness  the stone we are discoursing of is either lighter or heavier or which is the same thing more porus and friable or more close and solid the particles that compose the first hang together by a slight connection which is easily broken and dissolved like flocks of frozen snow the sides of a sponge or the unsolid and porus substance of the pumicestone and these by any internal or external violence or milder motion are often separated and crumbled into parts that drop into the ureters and pass into the bladder to be discharged and these fragments like the small sandy and gritty stones spoken of before produce the same troublesome effects  i have accounted for the stones that owe their production to the kidneys and shall now pursue their progress and follow their course to the bladder when the stone generated in the urinary strainer is discharged by the ureter into the common receiver it too often happens that it acquires so large a dimension that the outlet of the bladder is not wide enough to let it through and therefore of necessity it must remain imprisoned there where by the accession of new petrifying particles and gritty matter continually descending from the kidneys and adhering to it its size is gradually augmented till it is yet more incapable of being excluded where if it is loose and floating it produces many grievous symptoms for though it be only smooth and equal and so does not lacerate the bladder yet it will often as it plays against the neck of it and attempts to pass through stop the mouth of the aquaeduct that conveys away the urine and by so doing produces very great torment while the bladder is excessively distended and unable to discharge the enclosed deluge and if the stone be uneven and rugged it will by goading and wounding the encompassing membranes create exquisite pain and bloody urine and by long repeated cruelties of this kind it frequently forms an ulcer in the lacerated part which is discovered by the secretion of putrid matter mingled with the urine for when it has stood some hours a pale slimy sediment is precipitated to the bottom of the receiver like the excrement of the nose or the whites of eggs and is distinguished from the like matter that descends to the bladder from an ulcer in the kidneys by the odor which is strong and faetid if the purulent mater comes from an ulcer in the bladder but that derived from one in the kidneys has no such offensive smell as said above and the case is the same when an ulcer arises in the kidneys or the neck of the bladder not from the stone but from other causes such as produce ulcers in the lungs in the intestines or other internal parts that is the impurities and incongruous particles which by reason of their disproportionate size and figure cannot slide through the strait passages of the glands but stick in them till more of the like nature entangled there increase the obstruction and swell the parts whence by degrees they are inflamed putrify and by their disruption form an ulcer and when this disease is produced in the kidneys or the bladder the putrid contents issuing from them and together with the urine excluded into the receiver show themselves as i have said by their viscous and ropy quality and are diversified by their faetid or inoffensive smell and it should be observed that their mucous and slimy nature distinguishes these contents from others that proceed from a scorbutic or unhealthful habit of body when much white mealy and light matter appears in the sediment and which being without connection upon shaking the glass will rise and float incoherent in the urine but unslimy as well as without faetor this therefore as i have said does not proceed from any internal ulcer but is a defect arising from some irregular and depraved state of the blood that communicates with its serum such matter to the kidneys  the suppression of urine occasioned by a stone too large to pass the urethra is not attended with sickness and vomiting as when a stone sticks in its passage through the ureters there being no communication of nerves between the bladder and the stomach to convey the sensations from one to the other but exquisite and grievous pains however attend it from the distention of the bladder as i have said and sometimes a smaller stone that has entered the mouth of the urethra yet being too great to slide through stops near the entrance or in the middle and creates a total suppression of urine as well as great torment  i have now accounted for the nature properties and symptoms of this disease and have likewise in carrying on my discourse intermixed an ennumeration of its various kinds discriminated by the receptacles where the stone is contained or by its different color or various shape and figure and now i shall proceed to search into the causes of it  the remote antecedent cause of the stone is a defect in the digestive faculty of the stomach or that of the blood or nervous juices whence such impurities and feculent portions remain as produce the coagulations and concrescencies that become the foundation of the stone whose rudiments and primitive materials consist in a close combination of a volatile in a superior and acid salt in an inferior proportion that these two are the petrifying principles is known by experience that shows us that this is the effect of acids and alkalies meeting together as for example juice of lemon and salt of tartar let it be supposed then that from the inordinate and depraved concoctions beforenamed such hard coalitions slimy coagulations or cretaceous confederacies should be left behind and it is easy to conceive how when yet more hardened and prepared in the blood they may by the power of the urinous salts in the kidneys be soon converted into gritty sandy atoms which clustring together and cohering form at length a stone of the lowest size that by the daily accession of new similar particles acquires a far greater dimension in the kidneys and yet a greater after its descent from that bowel to the bladder for while it is detained from being too large to be excluded it has more room to receive augmentation whilst constantly fed by the sandy rivulets that empty themselves through the outlets of the ureters into that cistern where it grows by such accretion till sometimes it becomes exceeding large thus petrified fossils and flints in the earth as well as rotten sticks and pieces of wood turned to stone owe their growth as well as production to lapidescent or stony particles that continually accede to and stctly embrace the former collected materials but as to the intrinsic nature of he stone bred in living creatures and those last named that is minerals and vegetables there is a vast difference for the greatest part of the first are formed of volatile salts or animal alkalies but the other are not composed of any such ingredients it is truly remarked that those who are obnoxious to the stone are generally of a hot constitution as it is likewise observed of gouty patients by which means their blood is more inclined to breed cretaceous hard and gritty combinations which by a certain degree of heat are soon advanced into proper materials for the gout and stone diseases so nearly related that they are easily convertible into each other but of these subjects i have discoursed at large in my treatise of the gout to which i refer the reader  when the seeds or principles of the stone that is the viscous tough or sandy concretions not to be dissolved and separated from the blood bearing however a figure and dimension proper to enter the papillary glands the strainers in the kidneys they are there yet more indurated and acquire a gritty and sabulous constitution though even in the blood itself before the serum is separated from it by the secretory glands small stones are often formed as they are in all the parts of the body as before observed  it is remarkable that those countries that lie upon the river rhine and the northern parts of france who drink a thin sharp pale wine which is more replenished with tarcar than other fruits of the vine concocted by a hotter sun are most obnoxious to the stone in the kidneys for such wines convey to the blood in great plenty a sort of petrifying fluid whose redundant acid particles before their nature is changed to an alkali by the active princples of the blood meeting and combining with the volatile salts there the result is a hard and tartarous production easily formed into a stone  the voluptuous life of those that eat and drink deliciously every day cannot but administer to the blood the seeds and principles of the stone in constitutions disposed and prepared for that distemper for these costly and luxurious meats and drinks excessively and constantly ingested being unequal to the digest ve power of the stomach fill it with a load of crudities and unconcocted foods which transmitted by the ministry of the lacteal passages to the veins communicate to the blood not only great plenty of noxious impurities but likewise a rich chyle abundant in volatile salts with such a proportion of acids as are apt to create this distemper  a sedentary and inactive life especially when the persons are of a vigorous and hot complexion much promotes the production of the stone for while the blood runs lazy and unagitated in its channels for want of due labor and exercise of the limbs to push on its streams with due celerity it is easy to conceive how the crude and impure parts run into various concrescencies and coagulations on the contrary when due activity either by the labor of the hands or by riding or other exercises of the body the motion of the blood is accelerated it is obvious to apprehend that by the rencounters and mutual collisions of the parts dashing and rubbing upon each other they are broken divided and attenuated till they become so minute and so well mixed that the tough slimy and yet harder combinations are unlocked and dissolved by which means the seeds and rudiments of the stone are prevented and the cause removed and therefore in this case as in the gout the sedentary lawyer the overthoughtful person the hard student and the inactive indolent and voluptuous gentleman are obnoxious to this grievous distemper as are likewise men of covetous tempers while the laborious husbandman and mechanic the daily traveller and indefatigable sportsman are seldom attacked and tortured by it for these keep the body in a healthful state while their repeated exercise helps their digestive faculties to do their duty and refine the blood by a constant expulsion of inordinate and incongruous humors  ii the method of curing the gravel and stone first of the lowest degree of this disease that is the small sandlike grit either white red or yellow which though very minute yet are true stones and distinct from the scorbutic red matter that does not separate and fall down from the urine till after some hours standing and then is precipitated by the impression of the cold from the ambient air as above described the cure of this distemper consists in the carrying off the sabulous and sandy atoms and preventing the generation of more and so cutting off the supplies that use to fill the room of the forther that are discharged with the urine and it is highly necessary to attempt this lest otherwise the small stones continuing undisturbed should unite and adhere to each other and receiving gradual augmentation from new particles daily arriving should grow to a stone of great bulk and become incapable of passing the ureters or at least without great difficulty and pain and when they slide through and drop into the bladder should contract there a large size as before described for it is highly probable that the stone is very seldom originally generated in that receptacle and that all or at least the far greatest part found there descend thither from the kidneys and receive their increase from the sandy and gritty supplies transmitted to it through the ureters it has therefore been an unhappy neglect committed by some patients that though they have long perceived a considerable quatity of gravel discharged with their urine and have felt the trouble and uneasiness of it in their kidneys have however taken little care to clear them of these gritty materials and prevent the breeding of more from which omission at length stones of a bigger bulk always painful and often fatal have been produced  it is therefore evidently the interest of all persons when they observe that a quantity of such sand and gravel the rudiments and mother of bigger stones is excluded with the urine from the bladder to endeavor by proper means to free the kidneys from these noxious inhabitants and prevent the generation of new supplies and in the first place it is requisite to convey away the gravel that is already bred for which purpose the following method is most efficacious  first purgatives  take over night going to bed of elixir salutis three spoonfuls and the next morning drink a quart or three pints of purging mineral waters such as those of epsom dulledge acton northal etc and at night going to bed  take of milkwater two ounces compound water of horseradish half an ounce twelve drops of liquid laudanum and three drachms of diacodium make it a draught repeat both medicines every other day and night for three times  after an interval of three weeks do the same and sooner if the symptoms of the gravel call for it  or drink alone two quarts of such purging waters several days and then rest  the reason why these waters are very beneficial for the purpose intended is that a considerable part of them pass by urine and in their passage through the kidneys wash away in their current the sand and gravel and suffer them not to lodge there till they grow to a stone of a large size and it is the same in respect of the bladder for the same flood that rushes down through the ureters carries off the gritt from the receiver and expels it with the urine  diuretics to be employed in the intervals of purging for the same purpose are such as follow  take of roots of chervil stone parsley eringo fennel sorrel each half an ounce of seeds of burdock anise and sweet fennel each a dram of juniper berries three drachms boil these ingredients in three pints of spring water to a quart add to it a dram of purified nitre strain it and add a pint of rhenish wine drink a quarter of a pint morning and evening  or take millepedes alive and washed fifty bruise them in a mortar with a quarter of a pint of rhenish wine and four ounces of compound horseradish water make a strong expression for a draught to be taken twice a day  but the most effectual diuretic for carrying off gravel and clearing the parts afflicted with it are mineral unpurging waters such as those of the bath tunbridge the spaw and other chalybeate springs for these rushing with a plentiful tide through the urinary organs where the gravel is lodged as well as generated disturbs its several nests and rolls along in its stream the sandbeds it meets in its way till at length they are discharged in the urine but this is not the only advantage that attends the drinking copiously chalybeate waters for besides this it very much contributes the laying the axe to the root of the disease and preventing the generation of such petrifying seeds as shall be shown afterward there are other diuretic remedies useful in this distemper as a mixture of water french brandy and juice of lemon called punch if made small and not intoxicating though taken in a considerable quantity juice or syrup of lemons syrup of marshmallows and fresh oil of sweet almonds of each an equal portion mixed and beat together with as much sugar as is sufficient to give them a consistency taken to a spoonful or two often in a day is very beneficial so is a spoonful or two of compound juniperwater of cologne or holland drank now and then in a glass of white wind add to these remedies the exercise of the body by riding sometimes on a hard trotting horse sometimes by hurrying in a coach over paved stones or other rugged and uneven ground if the patient can bear it which by the repeated working and concussion of the back move and dislodge the gravel in the kidneys and force it thence into the bladder whence it is excluded with the water  now to prevent the production of little stones or gravel all those remedies are required as most effectual that have an operative virtue to loose and disengage all viscous and tough coagulations and dissolve the cohesion and structure of cretaceous and gritty coalitions whence small stones and gravel are created some in the blood and others in the urinary strainers this is indeed a matter of the greatest importance in this case for if this is effected the formidable and pernicious disease will be crushed in embrio and not suffered to arrive at a mature state i shall therefore set down the medicines endowed with the greatest force for procuring this end  it is easy to see that those remedies that restore the blood when depraved to its native temperament and keep it in that just and salutary constitution which specifially belongs to this animal fluid are in general to be chosen and in this case in particular those are to be insisted on that are most capable of disjoyning and separating the associated viscous and sandy particles that conspire to the formation of a stone and so to attenuate and refine them that they may easily incorporate with the blood and produce an uniform and equal mixture  and for this purpose chalybete medicines prepared by art or nature are the most preferable and since patients afflicted with this disease are commonly of a hotter constitution than others those preparations that have the least sulphur left in their composition are most beneficial to them such as the salt of steel or the tincture of it in wine but above all mineral waters impregnated with steel in embrio are in this case most celebrated which not only dilute and attemper the blood and carry off in their current the sandy and petrifying materials as before explained but likewise by their active virtue animate ferment and exalt the blood break the cohesion of the knotty and cretaceous seeds of the stone and by wresting the particles from each others embraces prevent the engendering of this disease by the confederacy of such impurities so that these salutary springs are not only highly useful in freeing the veins from immiscible and hurtful matter cleansing the urinary channels and rolling away in their flood the gravel lodged in the cavities through which their waters make their way but they likewise very much contribute to the recovery of a just crasis or constitution of blood by destroying the principles and rudiments of this disease ere yet they combine in a stone of large size and reach a mature state which they effect in the manner described  but if hard and gravelly materials associate and unite in the kidneys by a slight structure and are rather entangled one with another and hang together like a piece of sponge hoarfrost or a flake of snow than strictly cohere whence they become very porus and friable or if when more closely complicated and connected they grow to a greater bulk and create great pain either in the kidneys or the ureters by grating the membranes with their unequal and ragged figure in their passage or by their too large and disproportionate size stop at the entrance or in their way through these tubes in such cases the proper remedies do remove them from the kidneys and oblige them to pass the uteters into the bladder are such as these  iii how to remove a fit of the gravel or stone take three or four spoonfuls of elixir salutis or of the tincture or infusion of sena and rhubarb and anniseeds over night and a quart of purging mineralwater the next morning and the night following take this draught  of milkwater two ounces of compound horseradishwater three drachms of crude opium colated a grain and half syrup of marshmallows half an ounce make it a draught and if the stone or gravel be not removed but the fit continues take the next morning two quarts of the same purging waters either epsom dulledge acton etc and the night following the same composing draught and so the next morning and night for three times during the fit and if notwithstanding the paroxysm is still prolonged then let the patient take the following draught going to bed every night if the pains are violent or otherwise every other night  take of oil of sweetalmonds and ounce of the pectoral decoction a quarter of a pint of syrup of meconium ten drachms make a draught  take also such oily and diuretic medicines as follow  take of oil of sweetalmonds and linseed drawn without fire each an ounce of syrup of lemons and marshmallows each ten drachms of saffron a scruple of fine sugar as much as is sufficient let it all be well mixed in a marble mortar and made a linctus let the patient take a spoonful or two often in a day and night  small punch likewise especially if made with spawwater is useful to push on the stone or gravel when either of them sticks in the ureters and to clear the kidneys of the beds of sand collected there  juniperwater especially that of cologne or holland and the diuretic apozem above set down are beneficial  to be more particular let the patient in the paroxysm that eludes the force of the forementioned remedies take the following  take of flowers of camomile two handfuls roots of marshmallows six drachms of wild carrotseed half an ounce of venice turpentine dissolved with the white of an egg three drachms of the electuary of hiera cum agarick six drachms make it a clyster  or take of the common emollient decoction twelve ounces adding to the ingredients juniper berries six drachms seeds of the wild carrot three drachms dissolve in it of lenitive electuary ten drachms use it for a clyster  let one of these clysters be given every day for three or four times  for easing the paroxysm it will likewise be very advantageous for the patient to sit up to the waste in a bath of lukewarm water and repeat it two or three times or in a medicated bath which may be made thus  take of the leaves of mallows marshmallows pellitory of the wall each three handfuls flowers of camomile melilot and elder each two handfuls tops of camomile two handfuls juniper berries six ounces of linseed and fenugreekseed each two ounces boil all in a sufficient quantity of spring water and let the patient sit in it lukewarm up to the waste in a bathing tub  in this case also there are vast varieties of remedies prescribed by celebrated authors as fomentations liniments plasters etc to be externally applied which notwithstanding are little availing for removing a fit of the stone or gravel the most effectual are certainly the use of purging mineral waters three or four times and takng at night after their operation a grain and half of opium as beforementioned or an equivalent quantity of liquid laudanum that is about thirty drops  but in case that method should not succeed the next most valuable medicines are pills made of veniceturpentine or rather chios taken to the quantity of a scruple alone or mixed with an equal part of rhubarb  or thus  take of venice or chiosturpentine four scruples of rhubarb a dram of salt of tartar half a dram cinnamon half a scruple of balsamic syrap as much as will make a mass to be formed into pills of ordinary size take four every other day at bed time  for the same end emulsions are conducive such as these  of sweetalmonds blanched number fifteen of seeds of melons pumpions violets each two drachms bruise them together in a marble mortar pouring on them gradually a quart of barleywater strain it for use drink often of it a quarter of a pint or six ounces day or night  or take of seeds of violets three drachms of seeds of pumpions melons white poppies each two drachms eight blanched sweetalmonds bruise them together in a mortar and pour upon them milkwater and corn poppywater each a pint strain it and make it an emulsion to be drank as the others  oily medicines are likewise very useful as they envelop and soften the acid and acrimonious juices and promote the expulsion of the stone as thus  take two spoonfuls of linseedoil newly drawn without fire twice a day  or take new oil of sweetalmonds and linseedoil drawn without fire each an ounce of syrup of marshmallows and violets of each six drachms of syrup of lemons half an ounce of saffron rubbd fine half a scruple mix them well to make a linctus take a spoonful often shaking it well  or take an ounce of fresh oil of sweetalmonds in a quarter of a pint of the decoction for the syrup of marshmallows and repeat it frequently  riding in a coach or on horseback in rough unequal ground or our paved streets conduces much to the discharge of the stone or gravel when either one or the other sticks in the ureter or pelvis if the patient can endure it  and while these remedies are made use of opiate medicines must be given mingled with them or alone to abate the spasmodick contraction of the tender membrans and give ease to the disordered and afflicted spirits that they being lulled to rest and quiet may cease their convulsive grasps and the mean time the stone or gravel solicited by city smooth remedies slippery and gentle diuretics may slide through the ureters and drop r pass into the bladder without resistance  take of crude opium dissolved and srained a grain and half or two grain of the pectoral decoction a quater of a pint syrup of lemons three drachms make it a draught to be taken at night or at any time when the pain is violent and repeat it as the symptoms shall require  or take of cinnabar of antimony half a scruple crabbseyes and coral of each six grains laudanum opiatum a grain and half make it a powder to be taken at the draught now prescribed  if the patient is disposed to vomiting or straining to vomit let him take two spoonfuls of the following mixture and repeat it four or five times once in four hours  take of mintwater or barley cinnamon water two ounces of juice of lemons two ounces of salt of wormwood a dram and half of laudanum a grain and half make a mixture  for easing the pain and facilitating the passage of the stone or gravel various diuretic remedies are recommended by eminent physicians the following decoction of forrestus is for this purpose much cried up  take of seeds of mallows marshmallows each two drachms and half of fat lenten figgs cut and sliced number nine sebestens in number seven boil these ingredients in three quarts of water to three pints this soft and slippery decoction like that for making syrup of marshmallows or the pectoral decoction in the london dispensatory may be improved by other diurclick ingredients viz seeds of burdock roots of fennel violets eringo wild carrots juniper berries etc  in a fit of the stone likewise the decoction of the flowers of camomile is much applauded by some worthy physicians and that of the waterlilly and if some drops of sweet spirit of salt or vitriol were added to each draught of such diuretic apozems their force would be still improved  iv to preserve from or prevent the return of fits of the stone or gravel when the paroxysms cease gentle purgatives of sena rhubarb elixir salutis etc taken once in a month or six weeks are beneficial as they cleanse the stomach and their appending roads from their impurities and the crude and unconcocted remains of the foods ingested but the best way is frequently to use purging mineral waters and in the intervals diuretic and alterative remedies should be taken such as these that follow  take of the pulp of candied citronpeel and of the root of marshmallows each an ounce of species dialthaeae and diatragacanth frigid each a dram and half of crabbseyes two drachms of the seeds of purslain and white poppies each a dram of the fruit of alkakengi two scruples of gumm arabic two drachms syrup of marshmallows as much as will make an electuary take the quantity of a large nutmeg or small chestnut twice a day drinking after it a quarter of a pint of the decoction for the syrup of marshmallows  but for cleansing the kidneys and carrying off the sand and gritty concrescences lest by daily augmentation they should at last form a larger stone slippery and oily remedies and turpentine such as mentioned above whey and above all unpurging mineral waters of all kinds but chiefly the chaybeate such as tunbridge must be relied upon or the islington waters called newtunbridge millepedes are also a good diuretic in this case but i have above treated on this subject where i have discoursed on the gravel and small sandy concretions which are the minutest real stones and the seeds and rudiments that by their consluence and coherence produce those of a greater dimension and to that discourse i refer the reader for the true method of preserving the patient from the return of his paroxysms is to prevent the generation of such fabulous materials out of which the stone is made or to carry them off before they have formed such large bodies  it is very useful in a paroxysm of the stone to go into a bath of spring water moderately warm which by stopping sweat and perspiration and soothing the spirits relaxing and dilating the fibers promotes urine and therefore the protrusion and expulsion of the stones that hang or stick in the ureters which after they have acquired a considerable magnitude will notwithstanding strive and make their way for a while through th tubes which are much stretched and enlarged by being the beaten road for stones to pa from the kidneys to the bladder yet at lengt they increase to such a size that when they have entered the orifice of the ureter a are incapable of proceeding farther they plug up the passage and stop the current of the urine and if afterward another stone of such a disproportionate size should fall from the kidney into the mouth of the other tube a total suppression of urine and death in a short time that is in ten or eleven days are the consequence for a total and destructive stoppage of the urine cannot arise from the obstruction of one ureter for nature that has framed so many double organs for other functions two eyes two ears two jugular veins two lobes of the lungs etc that if one of these instruments should be lost or become defective the other at least in a great measure might perform the office of both so it has evidently for the more certain and effectual secretion of the urine provided a pair of conveyances one in each kidney that if one be entirely disabled and stopped up the other may do double duty and discharge the portion of serum that used to run through the other aquaeduct it is therefore evident to a demonstration that no total suppression of the urine can happen where both the ureters are not entirely stopped and it is hard to conceive how at any time two stones should at once fall down one from each kidney and stop in the same instant each of those organs of separation if therefore a full stoppage of water happens and neither of the ureters was before that time obstructed it is most agreeable to reason that we should assign another cause of that event that is a paralytick impotence of the secretory small tubes and papillary glands which strain the serum from the blood through the kidneys and ureters into the bladder for if these secretory tubes by a paralysis affecting the spirits residing in them quite lose their tension and falling flat together close up their foramina or passages no serum can be longer separated from the blood or conveyed into the receptacle of the urine and this will prove as effectual and adaequate a cause of a total obstruction of urine as if both the ureters were completely stopped by the falling of two stones of disproportionate size into their mouths and this was the case of an illustrious person one of the first rank of the english nobility who having for several years been afflicted with the gout one day felt a severe pain in one of his shoulders which after some time ceased to afflict him but he had not been long at ease when the flow of his urine was entirely interrupted and continued so to the eleventh day when the noble patient expired notwithstanding all the means and methods that his physicians of whom i had the honor to be one could direct for his recovery upon opening the dead body there appeared when the kdneys were divided some small stones in the pelvis and others entangled in the fibers or strings of the kidneys but no stone in the mouth or channel of either ureter so nothing can be more certain nor more obvious to the meanest capacity than this that the stone could not be the cause of hindering the water from descending into the bladder no stone being found in the ureters nor in the kidneys of a size capable of stopping the tubes beforenamed and had there been bred in the kidneys any stones of a sufficient bigness to have completely stopped the ureters yet it must be supposed as before suggested that two stones of such a magnitude fell at the same instant one into the orifice of each ureter else a total suppression of urine could not have followed and this must be supposed scarce ever to have happened and is but barely possible but de facio there were no such stoppage found in either ureter yet notwithstanding one of the physicians declared his opinion and obstinately persevered in it that the suppression of urine of which the patient dyed proceeded from the stone in the kidneys  these are the best preservatory means against the return of this formidable disease since the true and effectual way as mentioned above is either to enable the active principles of the blood to keep the mass in such an equal regular and just mixture and to refine and exalt it to such an healthful state as may prevent the generation of hard and gritty concrescences that as they are the foundation of the stone so they administer materials for the superstructure and for procuring this end the remedies already enumerated are most availing in as much as they animate and enliven the spirits refine and elevate the mass of blood and dissolve and sever cretaceous or sandy coalitions by maintaining its circulation with a due celerity to these may be added such medicines as subdue the acid and acrimonious quality of the juices by blunting and smoothing their sharp points and angles such as coral crabbseyes crabbsclaws oystershells and other testaceous absorbing and correcting powders given with assesmilk or mixed with other ingredients in pius or electuaries and likewise those that are proper to assist the digestive faculty of the stomach to concoct the foods and liquors it receives into a wholesome welllaboured and duly mixed mass of chyle that the unconcocted and faeculent parts the first seeds and principles which by their union and coacervation produce the stone may be prevented  the forms of such medicines that promote digestion in the stomach are such as these  take of conserve of roman wormwood of candied citron peel or the outward yellow rind of the orange each an ounce of coral crabbseyes and pearl each a dram of candied nutmegs a dram and half of salt of wormwood and tartar each two scruples of compound powder of wakerobin and the leaves of chamaepitys each a dram and half of the syrup from candied nutmeg as much as will make an electuary take the quantity of a large nutmeg every morning and evening drinking after it a glass of wormwoodwine or the infusion of the root of gentian or twenty drops of the tincture of gentian in a glass of white wind  or take of the tops of roman wormwood and the lesser centaury each half a pugil of the root of gentian and virginian snakeroot each a dram of cardamom seeds two scruples of coriander seeds two drachms and half of salt of tartar a dram infuse all in a sufficient quantity of spring water to a quart strain it and add to it of compound wormwood and compound gentian water each an ounce and half take a quarter of a pint each morning fasting and also in the afternoon about three hours after dinner  sometimes take of elixir propriet at is tartarised five and twenty or thirty drops in a glass of mountain white wind twice a day viz at about eleven and four  besides these remedies moderate exercise pure and well ventilated air regularity and temperance in eating and drinking must be carefully observed without which the best methods of physic may be unavailing  as to those medicines called by the greek physicians lithontriptica that is such as break and dissolve the stone either in the kidneys or bladder and to which many empiricks have pretended assuring us that they gradually wear and crumble it away and reduce it to such minute fragments that they easily pass the ureters into the bladder and with the same ease slide through and are excluded thence together with the urine i acknowledge i am incapable of conceiving how a medicine ingested by the mouth can produce this effect it is true that the celebrated carthaginian general hannibal as historians report found means by vinegar or some invented sharp and acid liquor to dissolve the alpine rocks and so to eat his way through those mountains into italy but if any patient afflicted with the stone should swallow a proper quantity of this powerful fluid were it to be had or any other of like virtue since it must first undergo a great alteration by the ferment and digestive faculty of the stomach and then a farther by mixing with the bilious humors descending from the gallbladder and afterward with the acid juices issuing from the pancreas and then another by passing the lacteal strainers and mingling its stores with the lympha brought by numerous waterpipes into the common receptacles then another by its admission into the veins where during repeated circulations with great celerity the parts by innumerable attritions reverberations and glances from their violent shing and beating one upon another receive comminution and are attenuated exalted and smoothed till they acquire a refined volatile state and at last of all since they must receive another alteration by entering and passing the urinary strainers in the kidneys let i say all these changes be contemplated and will not do you think the medicine ingested be unedged and disarmed of its sharp points and angles and lose all its dissolving or stonecutting quality for no a cid juices not vinegar itself continue acid after they have mingled and circulated with the blood and have felt for some time the digestive power of its active principles  those bold persons therefore that pretend to be masters of remedies which given by the mouth will break or dissolve the stone in the kidneys or the bladder impose upon mankind not only because the medicine loses its peculiar qualities by undergoing such a variety of changes and alterations as have been enumerated but likewise by mingling and being diluted with above twenty pound of blood for few men have less and frequently running its circuit with it by which means it becomes quite another thing before it reaches the stone it was designed to dissolve or crumble to pieces  it must be observed that as abovementioned there are some porus light and friable stones whose constructure is so slight that they will by a little shock or collision crumble and be divided into small fragments while the parts of others so strictly cohere that they are scarcely capable of separation and it is of these harder and more solid stones that i speak when i say they cannot be broken or cut in pieces by remedies given at the mouth but they defy the edge of the keenest lithontriptick weapon in all the arsenals of greece  when therefore stones or gravel are at any time removed from the kidneys and excluded with the urine it is not by virtue of any stonebreaking medicine acting upon them but by the operation of its diuretic quality exciting a great separation of serum which rushing in a swift current through the kidneys washes away in its streams the gravel and stones lodged there that by their proportionate magnitude are capable of passing the ureters as a sudden storm or sharp shower of rain rolls down the streets in its torrent the sand and loose stones as well as other promiscuous impurities to be carried off by the common drain though it is very probable that sometimes this flood of serum transmitted from the veins by its immoderate quantity as well as the strength of its tide in its passage through the kidneys may likewise disunite and shatter to pieces some smaller friable stones whose parts hang together by a very slight connection  but if nature or art can afford any medicines that are capable of breaking a hard large stone in the bladder the most probable way of making them effectual would be to inject them directly into the bladder for then having undergone none of those various alterations above enumerated which those remedies must do that are taken by the mouth they would exert their stonedissolving virtue if they have any entire and undiminished and would have the great advantage of acting upon it by immediate contact by which means the stone in the bladder if it could be effected by medicines would be wasted and moulder away but experience shows that this is not found practicable for were such a medicine discovered it would prevent the tortures and misery of many unhappy patients and make the useful art of cutting for the stone unnecessary of which i shall speak afterward  when large stones are bred in the kidneys or such as cannot pass but with great pain and difficulty all forcing diuretic medicines must be forborne and only such as are smooth oily and slippery should be employed lest such as powerfully provoke urine should disturb and push forward the bigger that lay quiet in the kidneys into the ureters where they will either stop at the entrance or stick in the passage and by that means either shut up the mouth or create a violent fit of pain together with bloody urine if their surface be rough and ragged and therefore in such cases slimy soft and mucilaginous remedies are chiefly to be depended on to promote the slipping of the stone into the bladder and if active diuretics have been employed in vain to push on the stone which often happens in a violent paroxysm opiate medicines of good force should be given that the fibers of the enclosing membranes whilst stimulated by the torture of the stone and urged by the medicine designed to expel it being eased and lulled by their narcotick virtue may cease to contract themselves and clasp the stone so closely and by dilating and relaxing themselves while at ease may make way for it to slide through into the bladder but if the stone in the kidneys is large solid and branches through their substance no means at all should be used for its cure for if here are any remedies that have power to break and dislodge its fragments which i believe as i have said there are not what would that be but to send them down to stop the ureters or to give unsufferable torments by sticking in their channels  as to the stone in the bladder which as said above is no more than a stone first bred in the kidney and thence conveyed through the ureters where it receives its oblong figure into the bladder and gains there such a magnitude that it becomes incapable of being expelled with the urine being fed and augmented continually with new gritt and sandy materials washed from the kidneys and falling down into the bladder when it first descends into that receptacle and its size does not exceed a due proportion while it floats in the urine it often plays aims and offers at the orifice of the urethra but its figure or position not being accommodated to it cannot pass through that urinary channel and then it not only creates great uneasiness by lying cross its mouth but likewise often by interrupting the streams of urine and sometimes by totally obstructing the passage when the gravel or stone or stones are yet small enough to enter and pass the urethr to facilitate their discharge the veins should be filled with such diuretic liquors as i have before set down that they may communicate a constant flow of urine to the bladder which being commonly kept full will be the more apt to eject the stone together with the flood that distends it but if it grows so great that it becomes unable to make its way by reason of its disproportionate size it will be daily augmented by the accretion or addition of new gritt or gravel carried from the kidneys through the ureters by the streams of urine as sand and small stones are rolled along from a rising ground by rills of water that flow down its sides now these sands or minute concretions as i have explained above are the seeds or mother of the stone that is the principles or first materials that combine for the formation of it in the kidneys and afterward to its augmentation in the bladder and to hinder its increasing there to a great magnitude those remedies are to be used which were enumerated before for cutting off the generation of gravel and such sandy and fabulous combinations to which i refer the reader  but if through neglect or the inability of methods and medicines to prevent the breeding of sand and gravel in the kidneys which washed away by the urine into the bladder constantly feed and amplify the stones confined there which grow not like animals and vegetables by nourishment admitted by the mouth or the root and conveyed and distributed to the outward parts from the inward but by the daily access accumulation and adhesion of hard sandy particles to the surface of the stone if i say the stone by the arrival and complication of new petrifying principles becomes large and ponderous and being attended with a terrible train of symptoms that render the patient a great object of compassion while death is more eligible than life and no effectual means can be suggested how it may be cut dissolved or crumbled to pieces as i have before demonstrated all that can be done by medicine is to quiet or reduce the enormous pains and torments inflicted by this cruel disease and for the effecting of this only crude opium or its preparations the gift of divine benignity to mitigate the tortures and alleviate the extreme miseries of mankind can be depended on this is the patients refuge and the only consolation to allay his agonies and restrain the rage of his sufferings and therefore in this case let him take the following pills  take of saffron beat small three grains of extract of gentian six grains of crude opium dissolved and strained a grain and half balsamic syrup enough to make it into pills for one dose to be taken in violent pains and repeated when the force of the first is worn off if the torments continue  but if the quantity of opium prescribed is not sufficient to remove the pain it may gradually be increased by adding a quarter of a grain and if that likewise should be ineffectual add half a grain and so on till the patient has found what is the just quantity that will relieve him and when he has taken his measure and settled the proportion he will be obliged to take it as often as his agonies shall make it absolutely necessary all smooth soft and slippery meats and drinks as well as medicines must be chosen for those of an opposite nature will irritate and enrage the paroxysm especially if an ulcer attends the stone which is an incurable disease and as ulcers produced either in the kidneys or the neck of the bladder from other causes besides the stone elude the force of all remedies which is likewise the case of all other internal ulcers in the lungs liver etc so those that arise from the fretting and laceration of the membranes in the kidneys or the bladder by stones of a rough and ragged superficies can never be healed at least while the stone continuing there is always wearing and wounding the part where it lodges and therefore all that can be done is to drink plentifully of smooth and soft liquors besides taking slippery and oily remedies that may constantly dilute and wash away the ulcerous matter lest gathering together in too great a quantity it should stop the passage of the urine which obstruction is sometimes so great that the surgeons hand is necessarily required to pass his catheter into the bladder for the relief of the patient through which the imprisoned urine may flow freely out and the patient is obliged to fly to this refuge for ease as often as clysters and other medicines ingested by the mouth are ineffectual the soft and smooth liquors that may assist the patient by diluting the corrupt matter and making it fit to flow are mead or other liquors made of honey also decoctions of barley liquorish marshmallows dried figgs and raisins of the sun stoned or rather the following apozem  take of flowers of mallows an handful of root of marshmallows half an ounce of sweet fennelroot an ounce of leaves of violet parietaria each a pugil of anise and carraway seeds each a dram and half boil all in three pints of spring water to a quart strain it and add of syrup of marshmallows three ounces and six drachms of the tincture of saffron made with treaclewater drink half a pint or six ounces of it three times a day  the smoothest and softest spring water should be chosen for common drink such as that of bristol or any other that rises from chalkhills a good draught likewise of white wind and new ale mind this now and then repeated is useful to dislodge and carry off the noxious and impure matter issuing from an ulcer in the kidneys or bladder and the sediment of each of them is distinguished by their slimy glutinous and ropy quality from the white mealy and light contents found often in the urine from scorbutic causes as above suggested that by shaking the glass will presently rise and float in the bosom of it which however has no weight nor viscous nor gritty quality but swims in pale discontinued and incoherent matter communicated to the urine from the blood abounding with such impurities and they are discriminated from one another by a faetid and offensive smell proper to the matter discharged from an ulcer in the bladder and contracted from long mixing with the urine which is not found in those slimy contents that flow down from the kidneys and are excluded with the serous streams as i have above explained  after all when notwithstanding the due care and observance of the best rules to prevent it the stone in the bladder grows very large and the pains are greater than humane patience can bear the last refuge from this dreadful tormentor is manual operation when incision is made into the bladder and the stone extracted through the wound so strong is the principle of selfpreservation and so terrible the idea and apprehension of death that to continue a little longer in being men submit not only to a great variety of lingering sufferings and calamities but likewise to the acutest fains or which their yiedling to this method of curing the stone is a most convincing evidence  though the cutting for the stone is a painful operation and attended with the hazard of life yet many patients have been relieved by it and continued well after it for many years especially those that were cut in their youth yet it must be acknowledged that many also have miscarried either from the nature of the stone their ill habit of body the unskilfulness of the operator or his want or sufficient knowledge in surgery to heal the wound and this misfortune often happens likewise from the patients deferring the operation too long out of an abhorrence of the violence of the cure or from flattering hopes that the disease will not arise to that extremity and torment them with such insufferable symptoms it is therefore the interest of persons afflicted with it to undergo the operation by which the stone is extracted when as yet it is of a moderate size and therefore more easily to be drawn through the wound and before their strength is exhausted by long sufferings and repeated paroxysms of torture and before the ulcer that is often formed by it becomes deep and inveterate and then while their vigor is unwasted and their constitution otherwise hail and the stone not of an extraordinary magnitude the operation is likely to be successful and if these rules were observed the lives of many of these unhappy patients might be saved that are lost for want of a timely submission to this method of cure  when the stone lapsed from the kidneys into the bladder are not augmented there to that proportion as makes them incapable of entering into the mouth of the urethra yet sometimes after it has entered it is however too large to make its way through that aquaeduct and therefore stops in the road where it not only creates great pain but likewise obstructs the current of the water till at length there is no remedy left but the surgeons art who in this case easily relieves the sufferer by cutting upon the stone where he feels it lodged and thrusting it forth through the orifice of the wound and this is the most practicable and least dangerous instance of cutting for the stone  as for cutting into the bladder and extracting the stone thence various methods have been invented of which a distinct and accurate history is not the business of this dissertation it is enough for me in this place to mention the most practicable and safest way and this as i am informed is that of cutting into the bladder in the region above the os pubis lately brought into use whether there occur any dark and obscure hints of this practice in ancient or modern authors or whether the first invention does honor to the ingenious surgeon mr douglass it is certain that either as reviver or inventor of this new method he has deseryed well of mankind and merited the thanks and esteem of all the faculty since all ways of performing this operation known before were accompanied with more difficulty more suffering and greater hazard of life  before the patient consents to undergo this method of cure great care and caution should be used that the operator may be sure himself and so able to satisfy the patient that there is a stone in the bladder the cause of all his painful symptoms and fit to be extracted for there have been other diseases of the bladder that have so perfectly imitated the stone in all its symptoms and have imposed upon surgeons eminent in their art who after strict search have pronounced the case to be the stone yet when they have cut the patient to relieve him no stone has been found and upon opening the dead body either a fungus or some excrescency grown to a great bigness in the neck of the bladder or some other disease or error of nature in the bladder appeared to be the only cause of all the nephreticklike symptoms that afflicted the patient and therefore i say the undertaker before he attempts the operation ought with the greatest deliberation and most careful scrutiny to get the fullest conviction in himself of the real existence of the stone in the place he expects to find it  finis note when i first began with this little piece i designed to have ended it with something relating to the dissolution of the stone in the kidneys and bladder but when i came to read over the various authors pro and con upon the subject thereof and saw the necessity there would be of transcribing the methods and reciting the cases where it had and where it had not been practicable i found it would swell it to a bigness beyond what i intended it and besides i having at this present two patients one with a stone in the left kidney and the other in the bladder under my directions in order to a dissolution by the same means and methods others have assured me they have succeeded in i was willing to wait a while as it cannot but be a work of some time to see the event thereof before i did it though i hope now it will not be long and then i shall i believe be able and i am sure gladly willing to communicate the success and show how and by what means the same was brought about for the service of my fellow creatures i intending to publish them with the others i have named as a second part to make this first part complete
