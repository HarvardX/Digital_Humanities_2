an ode to the genius of scandal  price one shilling  an ode to the genius of scandal  qui capit facit i say nothing london printed for g kearsly at no    in fleetstreet mdcclxxxi  the author of the following ode intending it solely for the amusement of his intimate acquaintance printed only the requisite number of copies one who has long been happy in his friendship and who was favored with the poem thought a more enlarged publication might prove beneficial to mankind in correcting an evil of which every one complains with this view he offers it to the world and he hopes the intention will justify the act  if those who with a taste for satire possess the powers of ridicule are by the perusal awakened to a sense of the unhappiness the indiscriminate exercise of that dangerous talent may possibly occasion to innocence and worth and if the tranquillity of an individual is preserved the writers wishes will be gratified  to the author no suitable excuse can be offered  but the motive this if his delicacy rejects his heart must approve to the public no apology will be thought necessary the spirit and elegance of the composition the philanthropy it breathes must recommend it to encomium and secure to it the applause it so justly merits  cambridge oct  0      an ode oh thou whose allconsoling power can soothe our cares to rest whose touch in spleens most vaprish hour can calm each female breast thee i invoke great genius hear  pity a ladys sighs  without thy kind relief be near poor coquetina dies haste thee then and with thee bring many a little venomed sting many a tale that no one knows of shallbenameless belles and beaux justimported curtain lectures winks and nods and shrewd conjectures half a dozen strange suspicions built on stranger suppositions unknown marriages some twenty private childbed linen plenty and horns just fitted to some peoples heads and certain powdered coats and certain tumbled beds teach me powerful genius teach thine own mysterious art safe from retaliations reach how i may throw detractions dart so shall my hand an altar raise sacred to thy transcendent praise and daily with assiduous care some grateful sacrifice prepare the first informations of lost reputations as offerings to thee i will consign and the earliest news of surpised billetdoux shall constant be served at thy shrine intrigues by the score never heard of before shall the sacrifice daily augment and by each morning post some favorite toast a victim to thee shall be sent heavens methinks i see thy train softly tripping over the plain all the alphabet i view stepping forward two and two hush for as they coupled walk sure i hear the letters talk though lowlyfearful whisperings half smother the well concerted tales they blab of one another lord whod have thought our cousin d could think of marrying mrs e true i dont like these things to tell but faith i pity mr l and was i he the bride to vex i would go and court my lady x indeed they say that charlotte u with fanny m and we guess who occasioned all  for you must know they set their caps at mr o and as he courted mrs e they thought if she would have cousin d that things might be through captain a just brought about in their own way oh how the pleasing style regales my ear  heavens what new forms are these which now appear see yonder in the thickest throng designing envy sculks along big with malicious laughter fiction and cunning swell her train while stretching far behind in vain poor truth comes panting after now now indeed i burn with sacred fires  it is scandals self that every thought inspires i feel allpotent genius now i feel thy working magic through each artry steal at thy command my fancy warms and sweetly paints the altered scene  her touch now every grace deforms and blackens every mien each moment to my prying eyes some fresh disfigured beauties rise each minute i perceive some flaw that even illnatures self never saw hark some airy whisprer hints in accents wisely faint that bright cleora rather squints  rosetta uses paint  that though some fops of celia prate yet be not here is the praise for if she should be passing straight  hem  she may thank her stays each fool of delias figure talks and celebrates her fame but for my part whenever she walks i think she is rather lame and mind maam chloe toss her head lord how the creature stares well  i thank god it cannot be said i give myself those airs but soft what figures this i now see come his awful frown strikes even scandal dumb  ah me the blood forsakes my trembling cheek while sternly thus methinks i hear him speak peace snarling woman peace it is candor bids thee cease  candor  at whose insulted name even thy face should burn with shame too long i have silent seen the venom of thy spleen  too long with secret pain observed black scandals reign but now with indignation stung justice demands my tongue and bids me drag the lurking fiend to light and hold her deeds of darkness up to sight look on this prospect and if ever thy brow can feel compunctions sickening blush it is now mark yonder weeping maid sadly deserted laid beside that mournful willow there every day in silent woe she bids her tears incessant flow and every night forlornly pining mute on her lilly hand reclining bedews her waking pillow sweet girl she was once most enchantingly gay each youth felt her charms and acknowledged their sway no arts did she use to acquire a grace twas good humor alone that enlivened her face pure nature had leave in her actions to speak  the wildness of youth gave the blush to her cheek and her looks uninstructed her thoughts would impart since her eyes only flashed from the warmth of her heart herself undesigning no schemes she suspected  never dreaming of ambush defense she neglected with the youth that she loved at the moons silver hour in confidence tender she stole to the bower there he hoped to have all his desires obtained but she spurned at the insult her virtue sustained and he in revenge for his baffled endeavor gave a hint  twas enough  she was ruined for ever a thousand kind females the story augmented  each day grinning envy additions invented till satiated malice had gained all her ends had robbed her of character  happiness  friends and now sad innocent  alone  shunned as a pest she makes her moan and in unheard despair yields all resigned to soulconsuming care yet many a time her wandering brain turns with its fevrish weight of pain and then a thousand childish things the pretty mad one rudely sings or mute on the ground she gazes and weeps as she scatters her daisies and then in a strain more distractedly loud she chants the sad thoughts of her fancy and shivers and sings of her cold shroud  ah poor nancy nay weep not now  it is now too late  thy friendship might have stopped her fate rather now hide thy head in conscious shame  thy mouth too buzzed the tale that stained her fame but come  again  turn here thine eyes and view another victim rise  observe that crested warrior  his name could make whole hostile ranks disordered fly victory followed where the hero came and conquest darted from his vengeful eye his was true courage on good prudence built  an arm prepared to extirpate or save twas only raised to crush presuming guilt or lend its vigor to the honest brave yet even a man thus formed with every nobler passion warmed at envys infamous command fell by dark scandals secret hand  lothario dearest of his friends wronged him  he scorned to ask amends  in real valor calmness we admire it is your mock honor that is so soon on fire souls truly great no rash resentments seek  his friendship pardoned ever his rage could speak yet for a deed that challenged brightest fame scandal bedamnd him with a cowards name nay more secure her vengeance to pursue proclaimed the man that owned him coward too and see with proudly sullen air the injured hero stalks alone and though his looks betray his care disdains to vent a single groan save when by some distracting thought to wild impatience madly wrought with sudden stamp the ground he beats as memory paints his former feats how once kneedeep in blood immoveably he stood and in the howling battles roar with gaping wounds all covered over his single arm durst firm oppose a phalanx of assailing foes and mark with starting rage possessed wildly he bares his furrowed breast and as his scars he views with aching eyes oh it is too much the faultring vetran cries  yet scorning still to let his pangs appear bites hard his quivering lip and gulps the starting tear these are the triumphs scandal claims  triumphs derived from ruined names  such as to generous minds unknown an honest soul would scorn to own nor think vain woman while you sneer at others faults that you are clear no  turn your back  you undergo the selfsame malice you to others show and soon by some malicious tale overthrown like these shall fall unpitied and unknown oh then ye blooming fair attend  oh take kind candor for your friend nor forfeit for a mean delight that power over man that is yours by right to woman every charm was given designed by all indulgent heaven to soften every care yes ye were formed to bless mankind to harmonize and soothe the mind and guard us from despair but when from those sweet lips we hear illnatures whisper envys sneer your power that moment dies each coxcomb makes your name his sport and fools when angry will retort what men of sense despise leave then such low pursuits as these and take a nobler road to please  let candor guide your way  so shall you daily conquests gain and captives glorying in your chain be proud to own your sway the end
