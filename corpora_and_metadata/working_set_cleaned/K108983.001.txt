the younger brother  the younger brother a novel in three volumes  written by mr dibdin  thus runs the world away shakespeare vol i  london printed for the author and sold at his warehouse no     strand opposite the adelphi  dedication to the most noble the marquis of salisbury my lord to neglect any proper opportunity of testifying my devotion to your lordship would be unjust unworthy and ungrateful therefore i only comply with the most manifest propriety in humbly soliciting your protection to this work  yet my lord though the propriety is strong though the task is indispensible though the subject warmly gratifies my best pride yet never was effort so uncommonly difficult  great men have patronized public characters and the encouragement of genius has been in many instances the most brilliant distinction of english nobility but there is no example of such an act of beneficence as that which your lordship has extended toward me no benefactor ever had the power to confer a favor of equal magnitude nor were those favors that have been conferred given from any such noble motive or independent principle  it was reserved for your lordship to dignify patronage by blending solicitous condescension with spontaneous liberality  if then men of great and celebrated talents have found their thanks inadequate to inferior favors in attempting to describe the true color of my acknowledgments how greatly must i fail who can express so little and who have been honored so much  my sanctuary is in my mind no mans feelings can be more alive than mine are nor was there ever an occasion on which they were so sensibly or so worthily roused i humbly hope therefore your lordship will in your goodness take my thanks upon trust and give me credit for that gratitude which glows in my heart but which no language can convey to my pen  with the truest zeal and most perfect devotion  i am my lord your lordships greatly honored obliged and obedient servant c dibdin strand jan        preface there cannot be any thing  0 fallacious as the cavils of those authors who complain of being unjustly treated by the public the judgment of the public like those laws to which they owe their existence as a respected and a happy people  spite of the factious few whose impotent clamor serves as its shadow to display the light of reason  never fails to decide firmly yet indulgently and nothing can more completely confirm character and security than the dispassionate determination of the one and the unbiassed decision of the other  but though the judgment of the public and the laws of the land contain in themselves all we know of reason and equity yet nothing can be so difficult as to make a fair appeal to either the sons of chicane in both so clog up the course and so poison the air that the career is fatiguing and dangerous and thus many with fair pretensions turn back their pursuits and purposes unaccomplished and rather resign the honors of the race than strive to reach a delusive goal to obtain an unavailing victory  perhaps the painter who had been ruined by going to law without bringing any thing to issue had these ideas in his mind when he drew a picture of justice supported by hunger and thirst  but i shall leave those laws which the prudence of our forefathers has established for the security of property  which are in this country a monument of sober reflection sound wisdom and solid judgment which are at this moment dispensed by men of brilliant talents correct information and invincible integrity and which are only inconvenient because they are abused inefficient because their essence is perverted and oppressive because they are held out as snares for the good and the worthy by the wicked and the worthless  and speak of those other laws which civilization has established for the security of fame and which being of a wider extent and without so decided a criterion are productive of much more sportive mischief than the others both because the scribbling pettifoggers have warmer imaginations than the legal ones and because their nefarious freaks though full as rascally may be exercised with impunity  according to this illicit lawyers  for i really ought to make this distinction  so they possess a plentiful stock of cunning and craft need not be overburdened with intellects but this is not the case with the other class illicit writers cannot combat opinions without some stock of general information their competitors being men of abilities and thus it happens that as you may call a lawyer a dunce and welcome so you do not call him a rogue so you may call a scribbler a rogue and welcome so you do not call him a dunce which is like footes stroke at a society who sometime ago set themselves up as reformers under the appellation of the christian club  having talked of hanging and being told that such an insinuation would give offense for that a brother of one of the members had been hanged he changes his ground and talks of damning  that is right says the other damn as much as you please for though the christian club may have some fears of the gallows they do not value damnation of a brass farthing  the truth of this distinction which i have made will i think be pretty clearly established by a consideration that the traffic of the lawyers depends on certain things called goods chattles houses hereditaments  in short any thing that can be conveyed  whereas the scribblers cannot always convey the object of their traffic even in idea a lampoon is not attachable or if it were it would be of no value there is nothing tangible in a modern pindaric ode or if there were as shakespeare has it those that touch pitch will be defiled nor can poor priscian bring his action of battery though we see his head broken every day  thus while they steer clear of hitting the man they may discharge whole vollies of their pointless arrows at the writer with safety he has no objection to their picking up their crumbs at his expense the sun nurtures myriads of insects that at once inhale poison and preservation from his genial influence  as i certainly allude to the abuse with which in my life i have been so foully bespattered it should seem as if i had drawn this conclusion with a view to announce myself a man of genius were i so weak i should be in a lamentable error indeed for an author with the smallest pretensions to fame i ought by this time to have been abused ten times more than i have unless indeed i rate the quality of the abuse in addition to the quantity and so by throwing one lump of invidious rascality into the scale make it preponderate in my favor  i am afraid however i am not so lucky for in this case i must take in the idea that the slander of a rogue is a compliment to an honest man and i have already said that every thing beyond literary defamation is here out of the question i have therefore nothing left for it but a comparative view of that abuse which has been levelled at others and myself and upon that enumeration i shall be driven to estimate my own labors at that humble rate which the public will always give its due praise but which aspires at nothing more  to begin with the ancients has any writer sustained more rank and foul abuse than homer who after all is so justly styled the father of poetry and if they began with the father no wonder they have so completely gone through all the family  it has been said that the muses themselves set him up a rival in hesiod whom they invited to reside with them on mount helicon and that they might initiate him into all their mysteries actually took him into their service and endowed him with their own celestial genius tutored thus by his heavenly instructresses he is said to have won a tripod from homer at a poetical controversy at chalcis but alexander laughs at this business construing it into a compliment to homer and saying that hesiod might well win a prize from homer when not kings but peasants were the judges  when you come to virgil these candid reporters allow nothing more than that he was the translator and imitator of homer to prove which they instance his sending aeneas to hell in positive imitation of the odyssey the conversation of the gods the games the ships and many other things but what sort of an imitator of homer must he have been if it be true as le mercier informs us that homer wrote neither the iliad nor the odyssey  but that they were compiled from the works of all the eminent writers of that time impressing very strongly an idea that homer was merely a ballad singer and that he invented nothing but only promulgated the grubstreet doctrine of greece  it is said also that virgil imitated hesiod in his georgics and theocritus in his pastorals terrence too is said to have been no more than the translator of plautus livy the imitator of herodotus and sallust of thucidides who had before been imitated in his writings  which after all were obscure  by zenephon and in his orations by demosthenes horace they report stole his art of poetry from aristotles rhetoric and as to aristotle himself some have gone so far as to question whether we have any thing genuine of his at all and they offer the following circumstance as a notable proof of this vague and strange opinion  theophrastus received as a legacy the writings of aristotle the heirs of theophrastus buried them in the ground at scepsis a town of troas to hide them from king pergamus here they lay concealed a hundred and sixty years and were at the end of that time sold to one appellicon a rich citizen of athens they fell afterward into the hands of sylla after that they were possessed by tyrannian a grammarian and next they became the property of andronicus of rhodes who first made them public about two hundred and fifty years after the death of aristotle  thus we have a virgil who imitated a homer who never was a writer  and we have a horace who stole from the works of an aristotle which works it is insinuated are spurious but neither is zoilus himself of philadelphus nor le mercier the zoilus of france to be put in the smallest competition with father ardouine who determined to put the matter out of doubt roundly asserts upon his own single authority that homer virgil and horace were all forged by monks in the twelfth century perhaps it was upon some occasion like this that pascal said it was easier to find monks than reasons  thus go on these aristarchuses in criticism the defenders of virgil assuming great candor tell us that they subscribe to those charges brought against him above mentioned but that he certainly excelled hesiod justice however obliges them to confess that he fell short of theocritus in the same proportion as the latin is inferior to the greek they confess too that he stole from lucretius but this they add was a proof of his esteem for him they then heartily hint that it was little better than receiving stolen goods for that lucretius himself is suspected of having taken some of his works from empedocles and others and yet in the same breath they say that lucretius ranks before all other latin authors they defend virgil from a charge that lucan was a greater poet combating the opinions of heinsius corneille heron and fielding who all give the palm to lucan but to make this defense as left handed as possible they allow that the pharsalia is more complete than the aeneid because there is a fault in the chronology which anacronism however to gloss over they insist that virgil intended it as a beauty and then follow up this cold compliment by saying that lucan though an original was an original of no value the deduction therefore is that it is doubtful whether virgil was not a worse poet than lucan who after all has no great merit himself but a modern critic has gone a great deal beyond this asserting that though the whole reputation of virgil stands upon three specimens of imitation though he has no invention no originality no creation yet he deserves all his fame  and how does he make this out why truly by attributing this fame to his style which he calls the pickle that has preserved his mummy from corruption  were i to advert to the long catalogue of opposite opinions which will very easily occur to any man of reading who has a faithful and retentive memory it would be an intrusion on the patience of every intelligent reader i have instanced abundantly enough to prove that cavillers find it difficult to convince that envy beholds pigmy imperfections and neglects giant beauties and that fools in search of defects and contradictions deprive themselves of that pleasure and improvement with which heaven permits men of superior talents to adorn the world  it is with me a matter of infinite concern that if candor be the criterion of genius the ancients possessed more genius than the moderns when euripides died sophocles went into mourning and yet to prove that sophocles was fond of applause he died with joy at the success of one of his own tragedies what can be more noble than the declaration of theodore gaza that if all the works then extant were to be thrown into the sea the last that would merit such a fate would be the works of plutarch or the forbearance of zenophon who might have had the writings of thucidides attributed to him but he disdained it  if the cotemporaries of terence acknowledge that he has imitated plautus they never fail to add that it was making gold out of dross by one it was said that the very prostitutes of terence speak with more modesty than the honest women of plautus cicero speaking of the purity of terence calls him the regulator of the latin tongue alexander when he sacked thebes spared the house and posterity of pindar plato was called the divine zenophon from his sweetness and beauty is called the be and the attic muse his works are said to have inspired scipio the african and lucullus in like manner as those of homer fired the mind of alexander  when do we hear in these times such warmth and candor as that of appolonius molus who on hearing cicero harrangue exclaimed  poor greece now thou art utterly undone  the romans had before conquered thee in arms now they have conquered thee in eloquence  these few instances among many that occur to me prove that the ancients possessed every merit that has been attributed to them and show that the greatest effort of the human mind is to rise superior to envy  the influence of this fiend however lay only dormant till the inestimable works of these great men were universally diffused the moment that opportunity occurred she shook off her torpor awoke walked abroad and looked so terrible that modest reason sighed blushed and retired  to be plain it is remarkable that the more modern we get the more the number of cavillers increases and really as cavilling is a very ungracious thing this is lucky for them both because the task becomes every day more and more difficult and because the dunces become every day more and more stupid thus the labor by being given into so many hands is infinitely less tremendous  the quantum of abuse must be always the same and how hard it is to fall to the lot of one man wholly to employ himself in searching out the faults of his neighbor when by an honest appropriation of his time he might manifest some perfection of his own this feat of hardihood however we see milbourn almost singlehanded attempt against dryden though the portion of abuse is as great and the quality as malevolent as all that vast cargo of grubstreet filth with which pope was bespattered by all the heroes immortalized in the dunciad and if we want a climax we have nothing to do but look at that flock of critical crows who even yet have not left off gorging on the literary carcass of doctor johnson  but if i were to go into that large field of observation which it would be necessary to traverse to get at the diverse schisms that have at times distracted the state of literature i should make it the field of battle between the moderns and the ancients in france i should set corneille and racine against sophocles and euripides malherbe against pindar moliere against menander and aristophanes nay plautus and terence the countess de la suse and madame dacier would pull caps with sapho in italy petrarch and guarini would attack ovid and tibullus tasso would menace to their teeth homer and virgil camoes lopez de vega calderone and cervantes would single out their respective antagonists for the honor of spain and portugal and i should involve literature in that chaos of prejudices and opinions from which men of the best learning find it so extremely difficult to separate its constituent parts  did i extend the scene to england instead of the preface to a work i must necessarily make this a work of itself so many so extraordinary so vague so diversified have been the real or affected opinions in this country as to what constitutes the essence of literary perfection that you have only to transmute them as you ring changes upon bells and every english writer at different times has and has not possessed it  i shall therefore by way of corroborating my assertion that no man is entitled to any large portion of literary fame till he has been handsomely abused only instance some of that prodigious load of foul and slanderous filth which  as good sometimes grows out of evil  procured the world those two monuments of genius and justice mac flecnoe and the dunciad and i the more readily do this to show that one specimen is as good as a thousand because were i to produce a thousand nothing could be said in them but what is already said here nay nor even in one of these that is not said in the other  milbourn as i before mentioned is the author of nearly all the calumny against dryden  popes calumniators are dennis theobald oldmixon and a variety of others who one should think were more than adequate to the task for they had nothing to do but copy what had been written before dryden upon this single and pope upon this complicate authority are every thing that can be said of the worst men and the worst writers  dryden is a mere renegado from monarchy poetry and good sense pope is an open enemy to his country and the commonwealth of learning  dryden is a true republican son of a monarchical church and a republican atheist pope is both a romancatholic whig and a protestant tory  dryden has notoriously traduced the king the queen the lords the gentlemen and libelled the whole nation and its representatives  pope has abused the persons of the king the queen both houses of parliament the privy council the bench of bishops the established church and the ministry  dryden looks upon gods gospel as a foolish fable like the pope to whom he is a pitiful purveyor his very christianity may be questioned he ought to expect more severity than other men as he is more unmerciful in his reflections on others with as good a right as his holiness he sets up for poetical infallibility  pope is a popish rhymester bred up with a contempt of the sacred writings his religion allows him to destroy heretics not only with his pen but with fire and sword and such were all those unhappy wits whom he sacrificed to his accursed popish principles it deserved vengeance to suggest that mr pope has less infallibility than his namesake at rome  drydens libel meaning mac flecknoe is all bad matter beautiful which is all that can be said of it with good meter mr drydens genius did not appear in any thing more than his versification and whether he is to be ennobled for that only is a question  popes smooth numbers in the dunciad are all that recommend it nor has it any other merit it must be owned he has got a notable knack of rhyming and writing smooth verse  drydens virgil is so called to show it is not that virgil so admired in the augustan age but a virgil of another stamp a silly impertinent nonsensical writer none but a bavius a maevius or a bathyllus carped at virgil and none but such unthinking vermin admire his translator  popes homer does not talk like homer but like pope and he who translated him one would swear had a hill in tiperary for his parnassus and a puddle in some bog for his hypocrene he has no admirers among those who can distinguish discern and judge  dryden deserves to be whipped for his ignorance of greek  pope undertook to translate homer from the greek of which he knows not one word into english of which he understands as little  dryden imposed upon his subscribers by holding out a partially and unseasonably celebrated name which imposition extended even to the picking of their pockets  popes subscribers have been deceived in their expectations in proportion as he has drained their pockets  the epithets which have been bestowed on these great men are still more curious milbourn thus calls dryden an ape a crafty ape dressed in a gaudy gown whips put into an apes paw to play pranks with none but apish and papish brats will heed him  dennis is just as kind to pope let us take says he the initial letter of his christian name and the initial and final letters of his surname viz a p e and they give you the same idea of an ape as his face  dryden according to milbourn is also an ass a camel says he will take upon him no more burden than is sufficient for his strength but there is another beast that crouches under all  pope is ingeniously paid the same compliment by dennis it is my duty says he to pull off the lions skin from this little ass  dryden is after this a frog poet squab says milbourn endued with poet maroes spirit an ugly croaking kind of vermin which would swell to the bulk of an ox  dennis imitating his preceptor says almost the same thing of pope a squab short gentleman a little creature that like the frog in the fable swells and is angry that it is not allowed to be as big as an ox  dryden is after this and so is pope a knave a coward a fool and a thing which indeed  if a pun may be pardoned  seems the only thing left for them to say  if then ignorance imposition cowardice knavery profligacy irreligion and treason are requisite attributes to establish the same of dryden and pope why what a vile and peasant slave am i my calumniators have gone but a very little way indeed toward ascertaining my merit by this criterion i beg therefore they will bestir themselves and as in this novel i have given them new opportunity  especially as they may find in it a mirror that will reflect some of their own faces  i assure them they cannot afford me a more sensible pleasure than to avail themselves of it as usual unawed by truth candor or consistency  having indubitably proved that it is my interest to be abused i shall now for the advantage of those who though they intend enmity confer kindness show in what way it may best or rather most expediently be done  first i would have them keep no sort of measures but indulge their rancour as much as possible let their method be to hold such trifles as probability propriety and decency in contempt to use perpetually epithets which are appropriate to rage disappointment and vexation to enforce terms that imply candor ingenuousness and liberality  thus in proportion as they are bursting with envy so at least in their own opinions they will conceal it like the silly bird that thrusts its head into a hedge to hide its body from its pursuers  if they would detect nonsense i would have them write nonsense themselves because this will show practically what it is ignorance of their subject is a good thing because it serves to exercise the ingenuity of the reader ill manners is not amiss for it often bullies the reader into a fancied comprehension of what in reality is incomprehensible  i would have all their outworks of criticism fortified with threats denunciations and menaces i would have these supported by impudence arrogance and cruelty i would have them place about fascines of hints insinuations and conjectures and when by a powerful onset of truth and conviction they were driven from these i would have them take shelter in their strong hold of ipse dixit that anticipater of argument that reconciler of absurdity that friend of ignorance that vehicle of malevolence that poisoned arrow that coiled snake that baneful flower that smiling precipice  ipse dixit  the skulking retreat of the shuffler the hypocrite the villain the traitor and the rascal ipse dixit  that shall blast the faith of honor that shall fully the purity of virtue that shall pervert truth sanctify mischief emulate murder annihilate order reprobate morality dignify sacrilege profane the throne and defy heaven  let them utter ipse dixits then like so many fiats but never let them presume to argue lest detected by ignorance forsaken by truth and exposed to scorn they betray frontless impudence and scowling envy hidden by a filmy veil of candor  there are some subjects however with which i would not advise them to tamper in particular let them not risk the awkward predicament in which they would stand if they were hardy enough to censure the public for the warm and liberal reception afforded to my labors let them not venture to slander those men of worth and honor who approve in me in opposition to them a life of regularity sobriety and industry and above all as it is impossible for human invention  not even their invention  to give any other motive to the honorable and generous support by which i have the happiness to be distinguished by that nobleman who presides over public amusements than unexampled and transcendant benevolence let them instead of attempting to describe it scowl bite their malignant quills gnash their teeth and hang their recreant heads in sullenness and despair  with these instructions i think they can hardly miss their way if there should be any danger of it  as it would be a pity that such charitable intentions should reap nothing but shame and confusion  by way of consummating their noble and manly purpose let them boldly assert that i have written none of this book let them be so ungratefully severe as to say it is not i who have given them this friendly advice but some outcast from society and as novelty in slander is as catching as in any thing else  having gone every other length  suppose this time by way of variety it were to be attributed to some murderer i think as mr bays has it the circumstance would elevate and surprise but this after all i leave to themselves for it is impossible i should be an adept in an employ the motives of which i scorn and the malignity of which i detest  if by officiously pointing out their readiest road it should appear to them that i have by anticipation betrayed the cloven foot and they should be therefore induced to forego their intentions from an apprehension of detection  for assassins are always cowards  let it be remembered that i shall set it down for a sulky perverseness and even though no single word of abuse shall be breathed against me i shall take very comfortably to myself the same portion of fame as if such advantageous circumstance had really happened and set it down with all the composure in the world as a large figure to go toward that aggregate of slander which i have so plainly shown is necessary to constitute the fame of a writer and which upon that ground of argument i am so ambitious to merit  having gone through the painful part of my duty  for there is nothing so painful as that which is unavailing and there is nothing so unavailing as giving advice to the incorrigible  a few words will bring me to the end of this preface a few very pleasing words they are these that in this as in every other instance where i have offered any production to the public having portrayed vice in its ugliest form and filthiest colors having hunted craft and art to the toils having invited the broad laugh against vain and insuperable folly having excited the admiration and commended the practice of virtue and honor i fearlessly trust my book to its fortune safe in the criticism of the candid and secure in the indulgence of the liberal for the moral i inculcate is the folly of wickedness and the wisdom of rectitude a doctrine which shows that while irritated vice multiplies deformity by breaking the mirror of nature it remains entire and unfullied to the eye of virtue that consciously reflects its own unspotted loveliness  the younger brother book i containing more incidental matter than is generally comprised in several volumes  yet less than any book in this history chapter i shows upon what grounds the author founds his pretensions to the readers indulgence  as it very often happens that readers get half through a work without knowing its drift  not unfrequently because the author does not know it himself  i hold it necessary to preclude all possibility of any such thing in the perusal of this work by premising what according to my conception ought to be the tendency of productions similar to this and what i here mean to inculcate in particular  a novel as the word is now understood and established is a general title for any work which springs solely from the imagination yet so delineates men and manners as to place all its events within view of probability it is a kind of mean betwixt history which records mere fact and romance which holds out acknowledged fiction  as however pleasure and instruction are the only end that any admitted exercise of the imagination can propose these all labor with different materials to produce the same effect history not only teaches mankind to shun vice and imitate virtue by instancing those events which are most condusive to so laudable an end but shows the propriety of the doctrine it enforces by authenticating the possibility of such conduct  the novelist who is the biographer of an imaginary hero chooses for his source manners in general his margin cannot swell with authorities nor can he  by way of notes  cite the contrary opinions of great men concerning the vices or virtues of those characters he celebrates so they possess the same qualities in common with the rest of mankind and the events brought about by their means are such as our observation points out to be natural his task is completely performed and he has a right to expect as much credit for relating circumstances that might have happened as he who  as far as he can clear his narrative from the cobwebs of tradition and disentangle it from the labyrinth of contradictory authority  records facts that did happen  romances are figuratively in nature and literally fictitious they are intended by lifting the mind above probability to enforce moral by figure and allegory and they attain their end  and indeed laudably  for they rouse those torpid minds into action which cannot relish writings that are kept within the bounds of simple nature  this species of composition is remarkably gratifying to weak minds it is  if i may be permitted so to express myself  an honorable fraud for exaggerate the beauty of virtue how you can it will still be lovely whereas vice being ugly in itself becomes more hideous when it is caricatured  these three different vehicles for the conveyance of truth and morality seem to require different conductors and indeed it has seldom happened that any one man has equally succeeded in them  romance seems to require a poetic soul strong in conception fertile in invention and various in expression history wants nothing but a perspicuous style authentic information and invincible veracity  he who writes novels must partake of all these qualities he must unite in his imagination the glow of poetry with the steadiness of narrative  the latter must be as a curb to the former not however to damp its spirit but to prevent it from running away  like the alderman who at a lord mayors feast would have made himself sick if his physician had not sat by the side of him  thus i think it becomes pretty evident that novel writing holds a very respectable stand in literature and i sincerely believe that men of considerable talents would very often practice it were it not for those spurious productions with which the press teems under the appellation of novels which means any love story calculated to madden the minds of sentimental country ladies to trouble the domestic happiness of old gentlemen who marry young girls and to overturn the purity imbibed at boarding schools  these are sure to make their way into all the circulating libraries in the kingdom provided they are sufficiently stuffed with dying lovers inexorable parents and impertinent chambermaids with the addition of three or four elopements half a dozen duels and an attempt or two at a rape to which may be added a little suicide or a smattering of incest  especially if it be written by a lady  by way of zest to make it go down the more glib  being about to give a novel to the world i thought it incumbent on me to say thus much from which the reader will naturally conclude that i intend throughout this work to keep nature and probability in sight to reject that which is frivolous and impertinent and to adopt only what by means of amusement may bring about instruction  it will nevertheless be necessary to say further that in portraying nature i shall make her neither a flattering likeness nor a caricature nor is it necessary for let her sit for her picture ever so often she never will exhibit the same face twice yet shall the general resemblance always be striking for it has been well observed that she takes every various hue of the camelion yet torture her how you will her form is as constant as the polypus no two human faces though composed of the same features ever were known to be correctly alike and the luminous mind of lavater did he attempt the arduous and absurd task of searching for any such would exactly resemble the lanthorn of aesop  to these general remarks  which i conceived it expedient to place here  i shall add particular ones whenever they appear to be necessary and now i invite the reader to the examination of a faithful though a bold representation of human life for i declare upon my word as a man there is not a character or circumstance in this whole work which i do not experimentally know from a close observation and mankind to have virtual existence  chapter ii contains a description  two houses  a citizen  and a reflection upon death  a bridge thrown over the high road at the entrance of a village in warwickshire called castlewick is the separation of two estates one of which had been at the period this history commences for half a century in the possession of the family of hazard and the other for almost treble that space in the family of roebuck  nature had been equally bountiful in the distribution of her favors on either side of the road which fortuitous advantage art had been industriously called in to improve if a neat hamlet and a white spire gave a more modern termination to the view through a group of pines and cedars from hazard lawn an old market town and a contiguous mouldering castle became visible through an avenue of elms from roebuck park  every chinese temple urn or statue on one side erected to fancy consecrated to friendship or dedicated to the arts had on the other its rival grotto cavern or hermitage here was seen a clump of elms there a row of oaks while the meandering avon  lest the lord of one mansion should be jealous of its favors lavished on the other  not only by the advantage of a distant height plunged up a rocky cliff to delight one favorite with the awful concussion of a beautiful cascade which falling lessened into a gurgling rivulet but also opening its smooth capacious bosom moved on in majestic silence through the possessions of the other stretching out on one side a small irregular stream which supplied the house watered the garden and turned the village mill  old rust the grandfather of lord hazard was a skinner in the city his profession unluckily made him rather a byeword for he had such a voracious thirst or hunger after money  for gold can be both eaten and drank  that it was archly said he would skin any thing for profit nay some are of opinion that from this very remark originated the epithet skinflint be that as it may he certainly amassed a very large fortune and having run through the regular progression of liveryman common councilman deputy alderman sheriff and lord mayor he married in his seventyfirst year a girl of sixteen without a sixpence who bore him  or somebody else  a son portioned three of her sisters granted a pension to an irish relation set up a coach and bought a villa till at length having expostulated stormed threatened prayed and entreated to no purpose poor rust  think of it with horror ye antiquated adonises  died raving mad in st lukes hospital  previous to his insanity however he took care to make a will vesting his whole possessions in the hands of trustees for the use of his son his remains were therefore scarcely laid in the earth when the widow with a moderate annuity was obliged to sink into retirement and of her it will not be necessary to say more than that she died when her son who was purposely kept from her by his guardians came to be eighteen years old  young rust besides the possession of uncommon talents was wonderfully calculated for commerce before he was thirty he considerably augmented his deceased fathers wealth and a few years afterward  having bought a large estate which gave him the entire nomination of four members of parliament  he became so material an object to the minister that he was made one of those peers which it was then expedient to create lest the balance of power in the constitution should be found to lean too much to the side of the people  no longer mr rust then but baron hazard he pulled down the old mansion on the estate he had purchased and built that very chateau we have already commemorated as he had a towering ambition he now married into an honorable family not overburdened with riches was shortly blessed with several children and had made some rapid strides toward an improvement in both church and state but  so transitory is the felicity of lords as well as inferior beings  he did not live long to enjoy that success his hopes seemed to promise  for sitting up a whole night to compose a speech which was to have introduced a plan to destroy pluralities and root out corruption he caught a cold which being followed by a fever he was hurried out of the world having scarcely time to settle his affairs  the young lord  but here kind reader let us both give a sigh to the memory of lord hazard and admire that the wisest designs in this sublunary existence are liable like a grain of sand to be scattered at the will of providence  chapter iii containing one appeal to the house of lords  and another to the reader  the young lord  for we shall have no occasion for the rest of the family  saw himself his own master at a very early period of life a circumstance which together with dissipated company at the university and a profligate tutor contributed to form in him the strongest principles of debauchery and libertinism  when he became of age his licentiousness made him the terror of the neighborhood it is true he was a little checked in his wild career by the wise and wholesome counsels of his mother to which he at first affected to listen but becoming more and more hardened her precepts and conduct were altogether disregarded till at length worn out with preaching to no purpose she retired into the bosom of her own family with a firm determination to consider herself entirely alienated from her disgracious son  lord hazard being now left to the unbridled influence of his headstrong passions stopped at nothing to gratify them the farmers wives and daughters if they had the smallest pretensions to beauty were sure to become objects first of his generosity then his gratification and afterward his neglect or if they durst dispute his impetuous wishes his unalterable resentment but as the swiftest cannon ball which neither edifices of wood nor stone can oppose may be stopped in its very strongest velocity by the dull resistance of a wool pack so were the vehement pursuits of lord hazard effectually checked by that dullest of all dull things according to the bachelors  ay and many of the married men too  a wife  my lords tutor whose name was viney and who as i hinted before had the highest ascendancy over his pupil  having ever been cnofiderably more useful to him in the conduct of his love affairs than in his study of the classics  had also another pupil indeed his attention to this last mentioned scholar on whom he had expended a large part of that money which the bounty to lord hazard  for his lordship was liberal to excess  had lavished on him would appear very enigmatical did we not derive it from its natural motive  this scholar then was no other than his sister who without a penny had married an irish fortune hunter and was very shortly saved the trouble of breaking his heart by a kind friend of his who killed him in a duel viney had connived at this marriage which soon after it was consummated was found to be a mutual bite however as his sister was left a blooming widow of twentytwo he easily comforted himself by considering her market as not yet over in a word he had long in idea married her to lord hazard this will account for his generosity nor when it is considered how completely this same mr viney ruled his pupil will it appear very unaccountable that the lady should become at length in reality what she had long been in imagination  marriage stopped for a while the excesses of lord hazard he doated on his wife and having taken this step viney became his privy counselor in a stronger degree than ever his tone however was soon changed he found her a mixture of arrogance meanness bridled wantonness and ignorant affectation nor is it difficult to divine where it might have ended if he had not accidentally discovered after having been about three months blessed with an heir that she had an intrigue with his valet de chamber  this roused him at once she was properly detected the necessary steps were taken and a divorce obtained she recriminated indeed but he was a lord and his success certain thus having received satisfaction for the injuries he had sustained he legally banished her for ever from his presence granting her only a decent provision for life  any one experienced in the human heart will easily see the part viney took upon his sisters detection he exclaimed against her with the greatest violence and was the forwardest in procuring his lordship that redress which he knew it was not in his power to prevent  this conduct established him more firmly than ever in the good graces and household of lord hazard the first of which advantages he often declared  loudly to the world  was the ultimate end of all his wishes because said he  softly to himself  it brings about the other  i have already shown that marriage proved a pretty tight curb to the excesses of this young nobleman and one would think his divorce had given him a reasonable surfeit of marriage but i know not how it is some men seem to be the bubble of their own arts their whole study is to overreach themselves and if they stumble on tolerable content it is because things take a different turn from what they designed  thus it happened with our peer every resolution he took in consequence of being a widower was wrong and yet he hit upon happiness when he only meant revenge  this was his argument he had married a woman of spirit who had injured him in the strongest degree and for this indignity he was determined to take vengeance on her whole sex idly forgetting that this was revenging himself on a whole hive for the sting of a single be besides he himself was to blame the fault lay in his own want of discernment had he fairly examined the ground of the business he would have plainly seen that it originated with viney who had taught him nothing but what disgraced his birth and deprived him of the use of that valuable goodness of heart which he really possessed and which had he fallen into proper hands might have induced him to have dispensed the gifts of fortune nobly instead of licentiously  to put this worthy project in execution lord hazard resolved once more to try the married state resolutely vowing to conduct himself in so authoritative a manner to his second wife that she should not dare even to think without his previous permission he had scarcely come to this resolution but his uneasiness on his late disgrace vanished he looked round for a wife with the greatest eagerness till at length with vineys assistance who was still consulted he thought he had found one to his wish  but how was he astonished when he plainly saw it would be impossible to avail himself of any one of those prudent determinations those ingenious precautions he had been so long and so industriously arming himself with he had now such a wife that to control her was impossible to advise her useless  if my readers think he was again caught after so much wary and cautious resolution after such anticipation of success i hope it will be confessed he deserved it  certainly he was disappointed but in that satisfactory way that a man would be at finding a lawyer who taking a brief should refuse a fee lady hazard could not be controuled advised or entreated for she had so high a sense of her duty such equanimity of temper and such sweetness of manners that she anticipated her lords very wishes he had received her from her father a wealthy country neighbor who wanted to aggrandize his family the young lady who had all her life made it her study to please her father found it no irksome task to watch and comply with the tempers of her husband  so true it is that a dutiful daughter has gone a great way toward becoming a good wife  if ever an extraordinary event new molded a mans mind this unexpected merit in his wife had that effect on lord hazard he saw in an instant that his whole life had been one delusion that while he had sought for pleasure he had neglected happiness and therefore resolved doubly to cherish it since it had complacently condescended to come home to him  nobody had ever dared to tell him he was a dupe to viney he now saw it himself he did not however think proper to withdraw his protection from him but contented himself only with giving him a handsome rectory to which that worthy incumbent shortly removed  in about a twelvemonth after this second marriage  but hold all great events should be ushered in with cautious preparation  a watchmaker would have called the circumstance i am about to celebrate the main spring of this history a sailor would have said it was its helm and an alderman its marrow  it is something therefore of material consequence and of course proper to be given in a new chapter and with a particular introduction  all which ceremony though it may be the limbs and outward flourishes of writing is not without its use and though more than phedrus have said that a tree should be estimated by its fruit and not by its leaves yet it must be considered that without the proper shelter afforded by the leaves no fruit could arrive to perfection  chapter iv which  first adjusting a very abstruse dogma in literature  introduces the hero to the reader  it falls out sometimes at the theater that at the very moment the audience are sitting with expectation on its utmost stretch an actor with a woebegone countenance comes on the stage to announce the indisposition of the principal actress  this once happened of desdemona and as there was no lady in the company competent to the part but her whose name was in the bills a gentleman undertook it at a very short warning the spectators were as usual content per force but after waiting a considerable time the apologizer was a second time obliged to come on who assured the audience the play would soon begin but at present desdemona was not shaved  i hope it will not be thought by mentioning this case in point that i mean to introduce in a ludicrous way a matter of such eminent importance as that i now take the liberty of presenting to the readers notice but my amor propre is wounded for being forced  at the very critical moment i considered myself happy beyond all example in the mode of introducing my hero  to stopped short and put my readers in the exact situation of the spectators above described i am obliged to exculpate myself from any intentional offense by fairly laying the truth before them and humbly appealing to their candor or  according to the language of the standing theatrical apology  their usual indulgence  i was going to begin this chapter in a most lovely style by saying that the bees came about somebodys cradle and left their honey on his lips giving proof that he would be sweet and eloquent in discourse but casting in my mind who this somebody could be it presently struck me  for i do bear a brain  that the point was not settled  this prodigy is related of st ambrose of milan doctor johnson who ought to have known something about the matter says it was pindar but fenelon affirms it was said of plato by his preceptor seneca who while the circumstance was warm in his mind dreamt that a cygnet flew to his bosom which by degrees became covered with feathers of a most beautiful and dazzling whiteness and which taking wing flew with a force and rapidity superior to an eagle  and these prodigies were so strongly verified in this great man that cicero said of him when he grew up if jupiter had condescended to speak like man he would have used the language of plato  now it cannot be denied but that here is proof upon proof on the side of fenelon and as he gathered this intelligence for the improvement of princes one would think that he must have made a point of collecting his materials from the best authorities but as there is no court of criticism to appeal to from the fiat of dr johnson  his ipse dixit being always final upon these occasions  if the reader please it shall stand for pindar not for the living pindar because every body knows that instead of honey he deals in nothing but gall  in this case it is melancholy to lose the beautiful dream of seneca and the fine saying of cicero but ornament and flourish must give way to truth and dr johnson besides mr boswell informs us that the doctor had but a pitiful opinion of fenelon for that he would not allow telemachus to be written more than pretty well  having established this important point i shall regularly proceed to the business of introducing my hero who having set the poets together by the ears before he was born will be allowed to have given a pretty good specimen of the work he was to cut out for them afterward  many and various are the portents and omens that are said to have announced the births deaths and marriages of great men and women and i could muster up a long catalogue of them from the lady who made so handsome a deluge as to swallow up all asia to tom thumb  which is a pretty touch of the bathos  who was swallowed up by a cow but that it would insensibly draw me into an imitation of certain authors who are fonder of showing their reading than their good manners  i shall be forgiven however since a great man and a prodigy are almost synonimous terms if i lament that nature did not go a single step out of her road to introduce our hero neither his father nor his mother having dreamt any thing prodigious on the occasion  viney indeed had a confused idea in a dream of a basilisk which kept continually in his way and the nurse as she nodded by the fire side while lady hazard was in labor dreamt that her young master  for she always said it would be a boy  spoke the moment he came into the world and that he believed any thing you said to him which she sagaciously interpreted as a sure sign that he would be very learned and very much imposed upon  the truth of which observation the reader may perhaps have occasion to admire before he and i part  lady hazards being brought to bed of a son to the great joy of that honorable family seems then to be the event i hinted at in the third chapter it really took place about a twelve month after the marriage and three years and a quarter  for i love to be exact  after the birth of the first son whom lord hazard called zekiel after his grandfather and this our hero charles after himself  the happiness of lord hazard would now have been complete had it not been imbittered by a consideration that the whole estate being willed away with the title he could not do his youngest son the justice he wished to amend however this deficiency he resolved to make him a paragon of learning and as he knew very well that had not the former part of his own life been devoted to idleness it would have been less given to dissipation he resolved to add a complete study of the arts to his sons education  in the contemplation of this plan he took great delight at length when zekiel had attained his eleventh year he was sent to eaton school to leave the coast clear for a proper attention to the education of charles which his lordship was determined to superintend himself  many essays were made upon his tender intellects which gave very promising hopes and now the difficulty was to get him a tutor lord hazard fairly owned he despaired of finding one to his wish he declared he had himself witnessed so much ill conduct in men of that description that he should be very cautious indeed how he made a choice  these doubts he often imparted to lady hazard who said she had mixed very little in the world and therefore was happy whenever he was so good as to give her his opinion in order that she might form hers she could not help thinking however that he was warmer on that subject than he otherwise would have been had not an ill choice been made in a tutor for him she hoped he would be able to find a man who should have talents and yet be honest  if said my lord i could form a tutor he should be ingenuous above all things not ashamed if he found any of those trivial vices creeping on him to which human nature is subject to confess and amend them such a kind of man cannot design to do ill because he is sorry for his own infirmity ingenuousness has a tendency to gratitude which is with me the first of virtues i declare if i was obliged to accuse a man of a crime and he could prove his motive to be in the smallest degree similar to any thing i had ever forgiven in myself i should instantly feel an inclination to pardon him it is the sneaking underhand villain i hate the hypocrite the deceiver who studies to be a rascal who stings while he fawns but he who acts from mere intuitive principles may correct his frailty by his judgment and at any rate you have a declared enemy and know how to be on your guard one stands some chance with a lion but who can provide against the venom of a slow worm  thus ended a conversation which the reader may hereafter think i had a reason for inserting  very little passed in this family worthy relation till master charles was twelve years old when one day my lord brought a gentleman who he said answered in every particular that description of person he had so long and so fruitlessly sought for as a tutor for his darling son as to zekiel he did not believe him to be his son at all though he had in vain tried to prove him legally illegitimate he therefore took very little further notice of him than to remit him money nor did he express either astonishment or dissatisfaction at being told he was both an arrant dunce and an arrant puppy on the contrary he sarcastically observed he would do well enough for a lord  having brought matters in the family of lord hazard to a sort of stand still the reader and i will now if he please take a walk across the bridge into roebuck park but upon recollection being come now to the center which commands a view of the whole village of castlewick and its inhabitants making a part of our dramatis personae we will take a short view of that little community which had really something to recommend it to our notice  chapter v in which a village is described not unlike an anthill  the village of castlewick contained about five hundred inhabitants about half the men and boys were generally employed at the trade of woolcombing part of the women and girls in carding spinning twisting and knitting the more intelligent and experienced of the men in journeying to large towns to purchase sheep and supply factors clothiers and hosiers with wool yarn worsted stockings nightcaps socks and such other articles as they manufactured the lower order of the men and boys were employed in tilling manuring and enclosing and the remainder of the women busied themselves in household affairs buying and selling the necessaries of life and such other occupations as the vicar  for this parish had no curate  pointed out to them  the vicar had two deputies the clerk and the schoolmaster and these three were all the persons in the village who did no bodily labor  for castlewick could boast neither lawyer exciseman nor apothecary  their good pastor undertook to regulate the temporal as well as spiritual concerns of his flock and by a scrupulous discharge of his duty as their treasurer showed them more than by a thousand precepts how much it was their interest to act with truth and integrity toward each other not that his preaching was not of a piece with his example for every sunday they heard some new lesson of sweet and comfortable morality from his mouth for he instead of describing religion as a denunciation of vengeance and the deity as delighting in punishment softened that high duty into a gentle and intelligent system of morality by inculcating the principles of social virtue and brotherly love and representing the creator as an indulgent father watching with anxious and tender care over the interest and happiness of his children and regarding their virtuous endeavors with a smile of celestial benevolence  thus troubling his hearers with nothing beyond the reach of that capacity which had fallen to their share and leaving the discussion of dogmas to larger communities who better understood cavilling  the clerk and the schoolmaster kept an account of the receipts and disbursements throughout the parish these were faithfully audited by the vicar ten of the most considerable of the inhabitants who acted as a committee for the rest were called in every week to the vestry where the books were always forth coming for general inspection  every other regulation for the pleasure and advantage of this happy community was proportionably wise and salutary thus cheerfulness smiled on their labors content converted their pittance into plenty health ease and good humor accompanied their steps and they passed their time in the exercise of as much moral rectitude as would have immortalized them  had they been born ancient spartans  without dreaming they did more than a common duty for the sake of general convenience  by this time i believe the reader begins to suspect that the vicar however well disposed to lend a helping hand toward the regulation of this little commonwealth as well as the clerk and the schoolmaster who kept the account of their finances were but subordinate actors in this performance and here introduced like the sentinels in hamlet and the servants in the orphan  both of which circumstances voltaire is very angry at  only to usher in the capital personage who having once made his appearance is to receive all the applause  it must be owned that the motions of castlewick appeared to be as regular as those of its church clock which clock though any blacksmith could wind it up and set it a going must have required a much better mechanic to have invented it originally if there should be a hidden first cause for this it will be announced in its proper place in the mean time i cannot prevail upon myself to repent my having introduced these sons of industry insignificant as they are the mind is often both improved and amused by the most trifling objects the smaller the mite the more worthy the curiosity of the philosopher  chapter vi which proves that some of the old fashions are not to be despised  my reader and i having passed through the rookery that received us as we left the bridge are now within sight of the mansion of sir sydney walter roebuck lord of the manor of castlewick and member of parliament for the borough of neitherside  the grandfather of this gentleman  for were i to trouble the reader with any thing anterior my description would resemble a game of chess where bishops knights castles and the king and queen are continually crossing each other indeed i have two other reasons for not going farther back one is that in the course of this history sir sidney will talk to us a little about the fame of his ancestors himself and the other that for ought i could ever learn their lives were take them all in all such a uniform mixture of morality loyalty and brotherly love that the description of one would serve for the whole their tempers might not be unaptly compared to a bowl of punch for though made up of the same contrariety of ingredients in common with the rest of their fellow creatures the mixture was so happily blended that they diffused comfort and cheerfulness to all around them  the grandfather then having taken umbrage at court for being turned out of the cabinet only because he maintained that the lancashire witches were harmless old women  for which indeed dr johnson would have been as angry with him as the council were for he tells us he will not say there never was any such thing as witchcraft for that probably there might have been but that it had ceased  retired to the mansion of his forefathers which gothic and stately structure the reader and i are looking at  there having sat contentedly down with a quiet conscience an active mind and a princely fortune he considered  which was nothing more than his daily custom  how he might best be serviceable to his fellow creatures  he had not deliberated long on the subject before he determined to build the village of castlewick and like another bishop blaze set up the trade of woolcombing nor was this would he argue a project unworthy his rank wool was the staple commodity of that country he so dearly loved and for which his ancestors had so gallantly shed their blood the wool sack was the emblem of honor for it sustained the leading member of the house and took place in that assembly of every thing but the throne he had yet a better reason his scheme would give employment to his tenants and other poor neighbors and he should be sure to receive the daily blessings of many families who would owe a subsistence to their honest labors under the auspices of his bounty  this gentleman lived to see his benevolent plan carried into execution and he enjoined his son to pursue it this injunction was faithfully complied with but the present sir sidney considerably increased the number of houses and inhabitants altered the former rules and orders into a more regular and digested set of laws and called in the vicar and his adherents as the reader has already seen to assist him in their execution  thus burning the lancashire witches was productive of one public benefit at least for had not the humanity of good old sir sidney taken fire at the cruel proposition in all probability the village of castlewick would never have been built  the surviving gentleman of this family i now take the liberty of introducing in form to the reader he had many singularities one i have already hinted at another was a fixed aversion to cards and dice yet he was a strenuous encourager of all athletic sports he would sometimes pitch the bar himself and was allowed to be the best bowler at cricket within ten miles he was an admirer of the arts and never failed to bring with him from town at the end of every sessions a poet a painter and a musician who were obliged  and so indeed were all others who wished for his esteem  to accompany him in the different departments of his duty as he called the regulation of his little commonwealth nay sometimes he would set them to work on which occasion he enjoyed their awkwardness  seeing once the wig of a counselor catch in the girt of a twisting mill as he was unhandily turning it round it afforded no small diversion to the baronet who facetiously exclaimed my good old friend you let your learning fly about at a strange rate  no man was more admired nor sought less to be so than sir sidney even the boobies with whom he could not mix because he never swore gamed nor drank pint bumpers declared he was a gruffish odd sort of a hearty cock in short his heart was benevolent his means were ample he was in the prime of life surrounded with hundreds of sincere friends  which is a bold thing to sayrespected valued esteemed adored almost deified and yet he was not happy i could tell the reader why but shall only so far indulge him as to say that according to sir sidneys own account his unhappiness was occasioned by a phantom he had seen which had so possessed him that he could not rest in his bed till he had opened his mind to it  for were i to unriddle the whole secret of this ghost the spirit and the readers curiosity would vanish together  i shall therefore collect together all the leading circumstances that i may the more adroitly introduce the time when the place where and the manner how it appeared and this has been a privilege to authors and old women time immemorial a climax having ever been allowed the proper moment to introduce a catastrophe and the candles burning blue a signal for the approach of a hobgoblin  as soon therefore as i shall have terrified my readers into a belief of the proper prognostic the ghost shall stalk forth to suffer this sooner would be inartificial and consequently an impeachment of my capacity of tantalizing the reader which would be an indelible disgrace to the fraternity of novel writers some of whom have excited no other sensation  i hope however i shall be forgiven if i differ in the main from this mode of constructing my work and not deemed an innovator if i endeavor to make satisfaction keep pace with expectation  chapter vii containing the necessary shadow to heighten the beauties of castlewick  i mean to lead the reader on chapter after chapter through this history in the same manner as we are led day after day through life they who experience the largest portions of human happiness are sure to have some unpleasant moments in every fourandtwenty hours whereas the same degree of misery will not so far overcome the fortitude of others but they find now and then a transient gleam of pleasure which like an accidental creek through the wall of a dungeon magnifies the light of comfort by peeping in upon obscurity  at the close of every dull day we naturally look forward in hopes of finding the next more agreeable thus people comfort themselves with tomorrow is a new day  we shall see how matters will go tomorrow and thus cherish a laudable expectation though it end perhaps only in disappoinment  i am led to these remarks by the recollection of my having promised to tell the reader what sir sidney wanted to make him completely happy to do this suddenly and without preparation would seem to show that i know not the way to elevate and surprise a mystery which more than mr bays have thought the most essential requisite of an author  as no reader therefore can reasonably desire me to violate a standing rule i shall now proceed to unfold a nice chain of circumstances which will lead directly to the main event  in the description that has been given of castlewick i more than doubt i have been shrewdly suspected of that kind of embellishment in which heroes are said to deal when speaking of their exploits and lovers when extolling the charms of their mistresses in fact to suppose a body of nearly five hundred people of different sexes ages and complexions could be perfectly secure from evil in themselves or guarded against the temptations of others would be to suppose an order of beings that certainly shall not intrude themselves here my intention being to treat of human creatures the best of whom i am afraid are not exempt from frailty i would only have it understood that vices existed in castlewick no longer than till they were found out at which time the parties were for the first offense reprehended for a second mulct for a third condemned to have no intercourse with their neighbors and for a fourth considered as incorrigible and without favor or affection banished from the place and deprived for ever of any claim to its advantages  when this happened which i will say was very seldom the offenders generally took refuge in another village about three miles distant called little hockley the inhabitants of which place were mostly tenants of lord hazard and as that nobleman had found no great difficulty in bringing over the men and the women too to any of his purposes it may easily be supposed they were a very likely people to afford such a left handed asylum  little hockley then was as famous for springes trammel nets and pitched battles as castlewick was for cricket quoits and tranquillity and if one was without an attorney that a proper number of that worthy fraternity might be kept up the other maintained two nay a spruce young man who indeed had been porter to an obscure druggist in a blind alley near rosemarylane established himself there as an apothecary who when lord hazard first began to reside at his seat ordered a new sign and added to his former qualifications surgeon and manmidwife  one great pleasure of the wicked wights of little hockley was to torment their more fortunate neighbors of castlewick this they effected by certain railings and backbitings to which exploits of their fancy they added others which were achieved by means of their fingers for scarcely a week past but some hog was hamstrung horse lamed or house dog hanged sucking pigs and chickens disappeared from their sties and roosts without the assistance of a fox the cows were milked in the night by twohanded urchins and lambs ran away with by twolegged wolves  these depredations ceased now and then upon sir sidneys application to lord hazard but they constantly broke out again in the mean time certain defiances were breathed and sometimes a few blows exchanged  the vicar was not without frequent apprehensions that some of his parishioners meeting with so many insulting provocations and being healthy spirited men would once for all take such a revenge as might involve the community in trouble for one or two of them had been already cited to the quarter sessions where it required the whole interest of sir sidney to prevent their paying heavy damages though what they did was perhaps in resentment of some insult offered to a wife or daughter  at the time lord hazard petitioned the lords for his divorce sir sidney was attending with great earnestness his duty in the lower house taking advantage of this opportunity a month had scarcely passed before the hockley men grown more audacious than ever had irritated their peaceable neighbors so often that three stout bruising matches had already been the consequence and though the hockley boxers would have cut no contemptible figure in the learned mr mendozas school yet it so happened  perhaps because a right cause is half the victory  the men of castlewick were the conquerors  seeing matters at this extremity and unwilling to trouble sir sidney the vicar determined to pay a visit to the curate of little hockley for that parish which was a rectory had not been blessed with a sight of its incumbent for ten years indeed that worthy member of the church who was also a member of a gaming club commuted for the tithes and all other immunities of his living and had given up among other advantages the right of appointing a curate  the gentleman who made this purchase lived in the neighborhood and was called major malplaquet he had distinguished himself in the wars of the low countries when very young under the famous duke of malborough and was now late in life in quiet possession of his paternal seat and a very fine fortune  the major had a chaplain who it must be confessed did not look much like a clergyman he had been in the wars too and indeed he fought much better than he prayed i will illustrate his character by an anecdote  a clergyman being on a visit to a captain of a man of war a smart gale sprung up so suddenly that the vessel parted her cable and was hurried out to sea no harm happened but it gave the crew a great deal of trouble the boatswain who in the language of his messmates was a dry hand coming upon the forecastle cried sink me if i did not think as this would be the case i will be keelhauled if we have had a bit of good luck since that there parson came aboard of all the fish that swims i cannot abide a parson i never sailed but once before with a parson and then we had not a fair wind the whole voyage  never but once said one of his companions why a chaplains parson ent he  avast that slack chatter said the boatswain a chaplain a parson hey  why i tell you he is says the other he wears black and says prayers  why then i suppose retorted the boatswain the devils an alderman because he wears horns  all the chaplains i ever knew were honest hearty cocks good fellows who would not mind making a curtain of their black gown to hide a pretty lass none of your grave thinking gentlemen but roaring boys who showing you what they are and telling you what they ought to be leave you to your choice whether you will go to heaven by their preaching or to the southward by their example  this worthy member of the church militant whose name was standfast had in his younger days  for he was now near fifty  performed as many exploits of the buckish kind as ever distinguished the mohawks sweaters or any other set of desperados who used formerly to parade the streets of london to the terror of every decrepid watchman and the demolition of his lanthorn he was the very man who once proposed to give the waiter of a coffeehouse a rouleau to see how he would look  besides all this he had killed his man and having absconded to flanders he ran away with a nun from a convent married her spent her fortune set her adrift and entered a volunteer in the army where the officers  finding him a genteel man  being informed of his function procured him a chaplaincy  in this situation standfast was particularly noticed by major malplaquet who being a man of singular credulity so attached himself to his new acquaintance that he soon became his all in all indeed the chaplain had many qualities that rendered him agreeable to the major he would drink claret play at put and beat a reveille with any man in the corpse besides these winning accomplishments he had other accommodating methods of endearing himself to his patron he often complimented him with the possession of some yielding female he had himself grown tired of and never failed if husbands or fathers grew impertinent and troublesome to brazen the matter out in short having gained a consummate knowledge of the world by a scrupulous hardness of belief a total want of every feeling but selfinterest and a critical exercise of observation he penetrated every mans characteristic foible and worked upon it as he pleased  such was the rev mr standfast private chaplain to major malplaquet and curate of little hockley to this person i am going to introduce the vicar of castlewick who conscious of the rectitude of his own intentions was indulging himself in the flattering hope that his efforts in conjunction with those of the curate would effectually make up every breach between the two contending parties  chapter viii being full of pastime and prodigality  to the qualities already celebrated in tiger standfast  for so had he been nicknamed by his companions from the utter impossibility of taming him  i shall add that let him converse with whom he might he as the phrase is knew his man and was always provided with so many shifts and turns that come what would he was never off his guard besides he had an admirable knack of siding with his enemy the better to laugh at him  i thought it necessary to premise this lest the reader should wonder how it came about that the moment he saw mr mildman he should not only welcome him with all imaginable courtesey but declare he intended the next morning to have paid him a visit in order to consult with him on the very subject which had now brought them together  adding as he took the good old vicar by the hand that he had a hard time of it indeed but bad examples were terrible things and if lord hazard would encourage his tenants in idleness  which mr mildmans experience must have long taught him is the corner stone of the temple of corruption  of what avail were all his prayers nay his tears in enforcing either their duty toward god or their neighbor  the astonished vicar could scarcely credit his ears he had not to learn the general character of standfast but on the contrary had both heard and believed much ill of him and indeed on his way had uncharitably as he now thought conjured up a number of difficulties in his mind which he expected would be thrown in the way of his beneficent plan  this standfast well knew and as the first blow in argument as well as boxing is a manifest advantage he had the inward satisfaction  i say inward because his features betrayed no such sensation  of seeing his antagonist struck aghast  to pursue this first blow therefore he thus went on i see mr mildman you are shocked to find i have no more influence over my parishioners  the vicar to whom truth was as habitual as perjury is to an attorney with the utmost simplicity of heart immediately answered you have not at all divined the subject of my astonishment i was admiring that the world could be so unnecessarily slanderous to have described you as a dissolute and immoral character and one who  pardon me for using the expression was a scandal to your cloth whereas you appear to me    ah cried standfast poor deluded wretches i forgive them but what do they say it is of consequence that i should clear my character to you their slander i smile at but your ill opinion what do they say dear mr mildman  why sir replied the vicar since i see you bear it with a proper firmness i will tell you  sit down sir said standfast  the vicar having complied with his request proceeded to inform him that in the first place it was said he drank very hard for a clergyman not a drop more in general than two bottles at a sitting said standfast and never more than four four bottles exclaimed the vicar why what is that cried standfast very calmly if my dear sir you had been in countries where i have you must have drank ay ay it is better to be carried off to bed in liquor than in an ague then between ourselves the major is a notable toper never stirs till the sixth bottle though there should be only he and i to drink it and i dare not disoblige my patron i hate ingratitude i only ask you mr mildman if any thing could induce you to thwart the will of sir sidney  sir cried the vicar with a look of extreme sensibility it is the study of my life to deserve his bounty  that was spoken said standfast too warmly not to have come from the heart you must my dear sir pledge me in a glass to sir sidneys health here bring some wine  the vicar who though he never was drunk in his life could take a glass or two and very frequently did at sir sidneys table made no great difficulty to comply  two bottles of wine were immediately brought two glasses poured out and soon emptied to the health of the vicars patron standfast asked mr mildman if he liked his port as well as sir sidneys at the same time excusing himself from drinking any saying that nothing but claret agreed with him  the vicar commended the wine but said it had a dryish sour smack after it  gout de la terreinne nothing else said standfast it is the very excellence of it  perhaps so said the vicar but to our business no sir said standfast you shall purge me of all my secret faults it has long been my ambition to be known to you and i promise most truly if you can use any fair argument before you go to convince me of the least impropriety in my conduct i will amend it immediately  sir said the vicar it is handsomely said and after this declaration i will not believe you the man you have been represented to me you a murderer  a murderer echoed standfast i abhor the idea  i dare say you do sir cried the vicar and yet the wicked world says you killed a man in a duel  oh is that all said standfast i was compelled to it poor ned  he was a worthy fellow  i had a great regard for him but he would insist upon it so i ran him through the body  mercy on us cried the vicar and do you feel no remorse for having the blood of a fellow creature upon your head  not in an affair of honor said standfast it was impossible to be avoided  honour cried the vicar with great vehemence it is a prostitution of the word can it be honor because a man has perhaps unwittingly affronted me to shed his blood and desolate his family is it honor because there are men of desperate fortunes with whom it is safer to face a pistol than a halter that i must either fear to detect their villainy or put my life upon a footing with theirs  spoken like an oracle my dear sir said standfast but it will sometimes unavoidably happen that two men of perfect honor who wish one another extremely well shall suddenly dispute till grown warm one or the other shall use an opprobious epithet which his friend cannot brook what is to be done  the man must be knocked down you know  knocked down hollowed the vicar and so make the breach too wide for all possibility of reparation no sir the highest courage is to pity passion not take advantage of it convince a man into a concession and your triumph is doubly noble why should a fally of passion be sooner resented than the sally of a madman besides according to your own rules not to speak of its wickedness can any thing be so silly as duelling a man receives an injury what is the satisfaction he asks why truly he invites the aggressor in terms of perfect politeness to meet him at a certain time where he requests as an atonement for the wrong that his adversary may exert all his skill to take away his life  the vicar who had now drank two glasses made the above declaration with uncommon vehemence standfast in a pretended rapture embraced him confessed he was become his convert and filling the glasses for the third time gave the major for a toast  this the vicar could not avoid drinking he determined however it should be the last three glasses being at any time his utmost stint he had scarcely drank when whether it was owing to the gout de la terreinne or being warm upon the subject or what i shall not now take upon me to say but certainly he gave manifest signs of being disordered from top to toe his eyes sparkled his head became dizzy and his chair was of the same use to him as a pole is to a ropedancer for without it he assuredly would have tumbled down nor could he help testifying some applause at the end of a little chansonette which standfast had been negligently singing at this the latter declared with a violent oath that he was the heartiest companion he ever knew  the vicar blamed him severely for swearing but stamping his foot to enforce the rebuke he trod upon the leg of a dog that lay before the fire the cur having received a private intimation from his master flew at the vicar who with great difficulty and an exclamation of damn the dog got out of his way  standfast now fell foul of the vicar telling him that he might plainly see there were provocations that might induce a man to swear that the words themselves were no more than other words and that men used indiscriminately god bless you and its opposite expression when neither a benediction nor a curse was in their hearts which he was sure was the case in relation to the vicar as the exclamation against the dog was certainly uttered without the smallest premeditated malice  oh sir said poor mildman whose speech now became affected i would not wish the destruction of the smallest reptile as to the poor dumb creature what he did was natural i trod upon him and he flew at me i did him an injury and he resented it  just my case said standfast in the affair of the duel  oh no cried the vicar as to the duel  the duel  you see in relation to the duel  a man that is intoxicated with passion   is as bad interrupted standfast as a man intoxicated with liquor  oh yes cried the vicar that is another terrible evil when a man is drunk he feels  that is the liquor mounts to his head  and if the giddiness  which is the effect of  what is the matter with me  i  but it is no such thing  it is  im  im  impossible that  oh dear me    poor mildman sinking back in his chair now fell fast asleep which standfast no sooner saw than he ordered in two sturdy fellows who were at hand and bid them lay the vicar in a certain field where some of his flock would be sure to find him  this was all that standfast really meant for being a perfect school boy at a frolic and having long indulged a desire of touching the vicar on the side of his sobriety upon hearing of his coming to consult with him he had infused a few grains of crude opium into a bottle of port which caused that gout de la terreine the vicar complained of and so acted both upon his head and his unsuspicious temper as at the third glass to throw him into a complete state of intoxication  this deception i should have imparted at the beginning of this chapter but for my constant observance of that necessary etiquette which i hinted to my readers in the beginning of the last  the two fellows however who carried out the vicar were not so easily contented to get the parson completely into their clutches was such a triumph that they were determined to make the most of it they therefore stripped him of his coat put him on an old jerkin patched with a hundred different colors set him in the middle of a field upon a broken chair propt up by a few stakes to prevent him from falling where he looked exactly like a figure placed to frighten the crows  very fortunately for the poor vicar the clerk and the schoolmaster passed over the field a few minutes after the hockley men had left him they were going to little hockley with a view to meet the good man and learn the success of his enterprise and were scarcely within a hundred yards of the supposed scarecrow when they saw it move of itself as it appeared for there was not a breath of wind stirring upon this looking with more attention it got upon its legs staggered two or three paces and fell down  perfectly convinced it must be a human being they went up to it but what words can describe their astonishment when they heard the voice and beheld the features of the vicar  the two men who had stood aloof now made their appearance they were soon afterward joined by almost half the village who seeing the vicar in the hands of his friends began to open upon them  fine doings indeed said one ay ay the still sow sucks all the grains yes yes cried another there be black sheep at castlewick as well as at other places the clerk and schoolmaster retorted that they were sure some trick had been played  odd rot it said a third a rear trick to be sure here must your parson cum to zee our parson and nothing would zarve un as he zed but bleeding the zellers and zo you do zee after he had got mean drunk we took and geed un an airing in our veeld to fright away the crows   odds wounds cried another your drunken parson makes a mortal good scarecrow at which they all set up a horse laugh  the clerk and the schoolmaster having asked the vicar several questions and found from his utter incapacity to give a rational answer they stood very little chance of knowing the truth  for as to a single tittle to his prejudice nothing could induce them to credit it  they contented themselves with demanding his coat hat and wig which were peremptorily refused the ringleader swearing they should be put upon a figure of the vicar and that very night burnt in effigy  seeing that all their attempts to recover these spoils were in vain their next care was how to get home their charge when fortunately a tilted cart happening to go by they called the driver who knowing them with great readiness assisted to convey the vicar to his vehicle heartily concerned at his deplorable condition and vowing revenge against those who had reduced him to it  the cart set off one way and the crowd another shouting in triumph as they bore away their trophies and swearing to exhibit them upon a pile of faggots as soon as it should be dark  whether they did so or not will be known hereafter but not in the next chapter that being appropriated for another subject besides the reader may wish to be released for a time from the brutes of little hockley nay it is not impossible but he may in some small degree revolt at these latter circumstances what a shocking indignity to make so amiable a man drunk let him swear and afterward introduce him as a scarecrow  to these objections  for i own i am myself shocked at the facts  i must beg to plead that i am only the historian of these transactions but if i were the inventor i really think that they are the very cunning of the scene for the more attrocious the hockley men appear the more luster will be thrown round the worthies of castlewick  as for the swearing i own i had some idea of smothering it but i will prove beyond contradiction that it is natural even in the excellent mr mildman  the reader cannot wish for a more truly moral character to illustrate the position than doctor johnson this great man we are told by mr boswel while on his tour once made use of the words what the devil  i forget whether it was on that evening the young lady sat upon his knee for then there would have been no great improbability in his feeling the gentleman he mentioned a little busy  but he hastily recalled himself and corrected his expression  now what the devil from dr johnson perfectly sober i insist upon it is about upon a par with damn the dog from mr mildman drunk for drunkenness has the same effect upon the spirits whether we fall into it by accident or design nay drugs and charms may very likely create a stronger delirium and i have no manner of doubt but that if dr johnson could that evening have been prevailed upon to drink fermented liquor it is within bare possibility  for i contend for no more  that he might have whispered to his friend boswell that the lady was a damned fine girl or some such buckishness  chapter ix showing who are the proper confidents in cases of love  standfast as soon as he understood what had been done with the vicar appeared well enough satisfied though he did not fail to declare that the matter had been carried a great deal too far however at the majors in the evening he gave the story in all its perfection enlarging a little indeed on one article which was in saying that the vicar drank like a fish  but said he looking very earnestly at mrs malplaquet few virtues are so practicable as people would feign teach us to believe the detection of one hypocrite has in it merit enough to atone for fifty sins openly committed what say you major  why i say replied the major that hypocrisy is a low sin a kind of rank and file vice and ought to be drumed out of every regiment of honest fellows dont you think so chicken said he to his wife  certainly i do said she and as no man alive has less of that meanest of vices than yourself i may the more freely utter my detestation of it  you may be assured the worst of hypocrites is he who covers his deceit with the practice of other vices all you can do with such a man is not to trust him too far but how dreadful it is to be always doubting a man you would wish to think well of you will say he keeps you a stranger to his hypocrisy and leaves you almost secure he is no such character by openly avowing his other sins this very circumstance ought to excite your suspicion of his honesty for what does he see in one friend more than another unless perhaps to make him his dupe  this may be all very true madam said standfast but i must say it appears to me to be a very uncharitable kind of judgment i hope there are no such persons as you describe  i am sure sir i should be as willing to hope so as you said the lady but i cannot give myself that indulgence for uncharitable as it may be i still insist that there is one such character at least in the world  come come i hope not said the major if it were only for the honor of the corpse of human nature  well said the lady since it has gone so far i beg that i may have leave to prove what i advance merely to clear myself from mr standfasts imputation of uncharitableness  i will suppose a case a gentleman shall be in your house as mr standfast is receive your protection countenance and friendship and in the moment you are heaping benefits upon him  in full assurance that you count every thing upon his gratitude  shall harbor dishonorable designs against your wife shall eternally teaze her when she is alone behave himself so particular to her in company that she is obliged to force that deportment into constraint which she could wish should be cheerfulness and in the mean time she dreads to make her persecutions known for fear of ill consequences from the anger of her husband in what order of hypocrites would you class this man what would he deserve  deserve cried the major to be flogged till every thread of hemp was worn off the cat of nine tails but pray now chicken do you mean this as mere general conversation or is there any thing intended by it  oh that is impossible said standfast nudging her at the same time under the table  perhaps not cried the lady enjoying his confusion at any rate you have no objection to my making it known i hope  i  no  oh no madam  i  not the least  and then recovering himself a little  not the smallest objection you may be assured  very well sir said mrs malplaquet since it is a matter of such perfect indifference to you i will take an opportunity when i am tete a tete with my husband of endeavoring to show him his friends from his enemies at present added she i should be obliged to you to ring the bell it may recover you from your fright  standfast did as he was desired the ladys woman made her appearance and she retired to her chamber saying as she went out adieu major and for you mr standfast i wish you this and every night as sweet a repose with all your virtues as that of mr mildman with all his hypocrisy  the two gentlemen being left to themselves a silence of a few minutes ensued at length the major got up suddenly and having shut the door and locked it advanced to standfast in a most determined stride and uttered in as determined a tone looke sir  if i thought i harbored a rascal in my house i would not wait for a court martial  his ears  damme his ears should in two minutes be nailed against the wall in terrorum to all scoundrels who dared to come as spies into a gentlemans camp that my wife meant something is evident that she would not run a risk of exasperating me without cause is as evident tell me therefore what you know of the matter for fire me mr standfast but it shall be explained  standfast who had taken good time to sort his cards began now to consider how he should play his game and knowing the majors credulity to his strongest suit after stipulating for a patient hearing he thus began  you very well know major you are upwards of seventy whereas your lady is not more than twentyfive she married you against her will out of mere filial piety and i sincerely believe has been as faultless in her conduct as she is beautiful in her person you have often said our souls were congenial and that though there were no consanguinity between us nature made us brothers is it wonderful then i should admire what you do when the desertion of a recreant pin has displayed her spreading bosom bursting like a lily from its pod or a friendly style betrayed her taper leg to my view i will not deny but it has fired my imagination and in the sweet madness of that delicious moment i have been a rascal  have loved your wife  have told her of it   oh major you do not know what it is to cherish a hopeless passion you are happy you possess the object of your wishes while i pine in despair  in despair ay and so you ought cried the major what the devil would the man have have not you my friendship my credit my purse  none of which i deserve said standfast  why no i think not indeed returned the major if you cannot be content without my wife into the bargain no no i choose if you please sir to have her affections to myself  come come said standfast major that is too much you know she did not marry you for love she may have a friendship for you but assure yourself no affection at her age for a man of yours  why grumbled the major there may be something in that but still sir that is nothing to you  it is so far something to me said standfast that it serves me to exculpate myself for if she had loved you i would sooner have cut my tongue out of my mouth than have suffered it even to have whispered my passion but you see how very excuseable i am younger than you by almost twenty years versed all my life in the arts of pleasing women and you know very well how many i have spared you in the charming days of our youth  well well said the major that i dont pretend to deny  many a delicious girl returned standfast that doted on me have i torn from my own arms to present to my friend  so you have  so you have  said the major  and what thanks you gave me for it said standfast dont you remember the little auburn haired wench at ghent  what the counsellors wise cried the major she was a charming woman by my faith come give me some wine i wonder what is become of her  i dont know said standfast but major neither you nor i boggled at her being married that i recollect  true true cried the major but that you know was a different affair  it was indeed returned standfast for i insist upon it i showed myself in that instance capable of a more exalted friendship than you are for i loved her possessed her and yet gave her up to you deprived myself of a sweet felicity to oblige my friend ah major you never got the start of me but in this last business how different things used to be the gayest the most accomplished yielded to me in the art of pleasing and till i was satisfied none dared attempt to make a choice  now a foolish woman who loves neither of us is to sow dissension between two friends who are all the world to each other  damme cried the major but she shall not and if it was only a mistress curse me if i dont think that tongue of yours would prevail with me not to stand upon niceties but you know standfast as it is  oh cried the chaplain however miserable i may be i will consume in silence rather than utter another syllable  well that is friendly said the major however returned the chaplain i hope you will lay an injunction on mrs malplaquet to treat me with civility  oh you may depend upon that answered the major  and i think said standfast i may venture to insist that i am not the hypocrite the lady has thought proper to call me ill answer for that said the major  no no repeated the chaplain any scoundrel if you please mrs malplaquet but a hypocrite  after this upon asking the major if there was any remaining animosity his patron shook him heartily by the hand and swore he believed him to be the worthiest fellow upon earth for where said he is there another man who being in love with your wife would have the honesty to confess it to your face  having brought this dialogue between tame credulity and unblushing impudence to an end i shall only add that this worthy friendship seemed to be stronger cemented by what had passed  the remainder of the conversation turned on their former exploits in which standfast did not lose sight of the main point but enlarged wherever he could on the satisfaction he had always received in administering to the majors pleasures  at length the major was led off to bed in much about the same state of inebriety as the reader may remember to have seen mr mildman  before i take my leave of this chapter i shall say a word or two concerning mrs malplaquet  this lady who was one of those living sacrifices which avarice offers up at the shrine of interest had to say the truth a very difficult task to perform her parents though sprung from an honorable family were of a younger branch and therefore could give her but a thousand pounds the only man she ever loved had deserted her for a pert piece of deformity with just thirty times that sum thus being perfectly indifferent what became of herself she gave her hand as the good chaplain has already kindly noticed to the major out of perfect obedience to her friends  the life she had led since  the only pleasurable moments of which were those she passed alone  may be easily guessed the audacious importunities of standfast were much bolder than either he or she had described and he having repeated them in some way that night so as extremely to offend her  though she was remarkable for complacency and sweetness of temper  her anger had so far got the better of her forbearance as to force from her that declaration of standfasts dishonorable intentions which the reader has already seen he contrived by the power he had over his patron so to palliate as to leave her the object of resentment rather than him  i mention this for fear mrs malplaquet for whom i would wish to interest the reader should be wrongfully supposed to be one of those outrageously virtuous ladies who are eternally singing forth their own praises lest the world from its natural uncharitableness should unkindly imagine they are entitled to no praise at all  a practice at present in great and general credit and really i do not see why it should not for who so proper to be the herald of a mans merits as himself since he is surely competent to speak to his own motives from a thorough knowledge of whence they originate and if he should turn the best side outward it ought to be considered as a meritorious expedient to put himself upon a footing with his neighbor and so pay him in his own coin appearance being as requisite to establish one sort of reputation as paper to establish another neither of which could sustain any solid credit without such assistance for honor is a commerce as well as business and such ideal resources often prevent bankruptcies in both  chapter x containing two new characters  perfectly original  the worthy curate in his way home exulting at this new instance of his influence over the major uttered or rather i believe reflected the following soliloquy  zounds what an escape  but it is nothing to a genius like mine poor dolt how gloriously i ride him as to madam i fancy she will tell no more tales this is reducing things to a system but i always said it to palliate an accusation if you take a man by that foible his generosity you are sure to be safe men are always liberal when there is nothing required but words  but to expedients this woman is a fool i had a scheme to her advantage her husband cannot live long especially as i drench him and would she join me we might make a comfortable thing on it when once i should have preached his funeral sermon well if she will kick down her basket of glass ware that is her business i will try her however once more i am secure from any impertinent tattling the major will hear no more complaints if she comes to i shall be charmed for to say the truth she is a lovely woman if not shall i stake my interest against her folly no not were she a venus  tomorrow i will begin the attack and if she should not capitulate in a week i will then appear to raise the siege but it shall be only to prepare a mine which when once sprung shall either destroy her or make her prisoner at the mercy of her conqueror in which case she will not find in me the continence of pompey or alexander  no no my business is to talk of virtue let fools practice it who are content to take it for their reward  whether all or any part of standfasts plan was put in execution will hereafter be seen when he came to the above period he had just finished his meditation and his walk and having knocked at his door was let in by his confidential servant who beat scrub out of sight in point of variety in his employments for as scrub had one employment for every day in the week mr flush  for that was his name  had one for almost every day in the year nor to say the truth was there ever any person better cut out for a great mans appendage for i hope the reader already allows mr standfast to be a great man and as to mr flush or mr kiddy flush  for he had also a nick name  if a fork be necessary to a knife fuel to a fire a scabbard to a sword a bucket to a well a bailiff to an attorney or a bully to a bawd the services of that faithful adherent were essentially material and absolutely necessary to his worthy principal nay i question if kiddy was not very near if not altogether as great an original as his master  as however my opinion is of very little consequence if my good reader does not coincide with it i think it absolutely incumbent on me to delineate the portrait of the said flush or kiddy  for he was as often called one as the other  so let the claim to superiority rest either on the side of the man or master as it shall appear by the drawing and as it is usual in portraits to illustrate the character by some cymbolical ornament through the means of which you can lay your finger on the canvas and say this is a general for he has a truncheon in his hand and this a butcher for he has a nosegay in his bosom so will i give the like infallible traits to know the characteristic marks of kiddys most striking qualities  as to his person it was for his size  for he was only four feet eleven inches high  the most compact that ever was seen but then as if nature had been fearful had she finished the front of this well proportioned structure equal to the rest of the work lest she should have been tempted to have thrown down her tools in despair his face was the most singular piece of deformity that can be conceived  his nose and chin like the head and tail of a weathercock pointed different ways yet not east and west nor north and south but to the zenith and nadir  some were of opinion that he had no mouth when he was born but that the operator had made an incision to serve for one and that being in a hurry and his scissors none of the sharpest he had not only cut it in an oblique direction from the right side of the under jaw up to the left cheek bone but also zig zag so that when he laughed  indeed laugh he never did  but when he grinned  for his teeth were pretty even which lends probability to the business of the incision   but pray excuse me from relating how he looked when he grinned till i have described his eyes one of which the left was smaller than the other and whether it envied the superior size of its neighbor or was awed by conscious humility at its own insignificance i really cannot say but it fairly slunk into the opposite corner without even deigning or perhaps daring to cast one single glance to the right while the other in triumphant pride rolled or rather goggled about and appeared itself an argus looking a hundred ways at once  to these unlovely marks  which in females are called certificates for their honesty  i must add that kiddy was frightfully seamed with the small pox and that he received no addition in point of beauty from an explosion of gunpowder when he was abroad which stripped the skin off his face except on a small part of one of his cheeks and one or two other places and thereby left such a violent redness for ever after that his face looked something like a rump steak or rather like red ochre in the grinding in which if you take up the muller you may see an appearance like branches of trees which answers exactly to seams of the small pox or to add one more simile which shall take in beard and all  for his beard like that of hudibras was orange tawny  his complexion was like a red wine syllabub where here and there appears a splotch of white curd the whole gently tinged with a sprinkling of nutmeg  as to the grinning after i have said so much i think i should affront the reader by describing it he knows every feature now as well as i do and if he chooses to call up a grin in his imagination and when he has so done does not grin himself i can only say he is not the reader i took him for  kiddy flush had been employed from his youth up to beat the drum distribute the bills and slang the figures of a puppet show where he had learnt a smattering of every thing he could scrape the fiddle vault on the slack wire swear a good round hand coax the girls get boozy and i am afraid thieve for if he had not this last qualification i cannot see why they should send him handcuffed which they really did on board a transport whose destination was to the american plantations  in short not to conceal the disgrace kiddy was certainly transported to america from whence he contrived to get retransported to ireland there he found means to get engaged as a drummer in the same regiment where standfast was chaplain indeed kiddy flush was the very person who taught tiger standfast to beat that reveille which has been already celebrated as a chef doeuvre  were i to run through all the scenes so full of srolic whim dissipation and singular dissoluteness which were practiced by this trim tram this horse and his rider i might as well at once have given the world the adventures of tiger standfast and his man kiddy but as that is not totally my intention i shall content myself with noticing that these worthy associates finding themselves very necessary to each other a league was entered into between them that mutual assistance should be given  to put the matter a little technically  in all breezes frisks plots queerings tricks humbugs and bambouzlings that they might find it expedient to engage in that the agreement should be understood as a partnership between them with this sole distinction that flush should be openly considered as a servant and in that character be kept in subordination before company but permitted to speak his mind freely openly and without reserve when nobody should be present  kiddy flush at the time of his first introduction to the reader  for nothing is so advantageous as to bring on your principal characters with a good grace  was what is called half gone in his own language a little cockish for i must tell the reader  and that is really the last explanation i will trouble him with about kiddy  that among the rest of his oddities his choice of words was the most singular it was composed of the cant terms of both his professions to which he occasionally added a miserable pun and now and then a little bad french which he had picked up on his travels the whole interlarded with newfangled oaths  kiddy had just been witness to a curious scene in the village and was bursting to disclose it to his master on his arrival at the same time it must be remembered that standfasts head was entirely filled with what had passed at the majors  kiddy then scarcely suffered his master to sit down before he began with i say master there has been rum gig going forward this evening gig what do you mean said standfast his mind still running on his late adventure nay nothing said flush no rang only we had like to have come off with tats that is all shiver me if we had not been cute we should some of us have taken a leap without nobody to hold the blanket  standfast thinking he alluded to the scrape he had so narrowly got out of replied why how the devil came you to know any thing about it why lord love you said kiddy i know the whole maneuver of the thing and i must say it was bunglingly managed bunglingly said standfast damme if i think any man in the world ever drew himself out of such a hobble with half so much grace to have them both upon me the old soldier and his wife  why master what are you upon said flush the jonse i means bent no old soldiers nor their wives but a parcel of sheep biting poltroons  flats  mazards  who instead of pelting it out like hearties sneaked away to the boozing cases and left the enemy masters of the champ of battle  he here acquainted standfast that at the moment of exhibiting the effigy of the vicar on its funeral pile a party of heroes from castlewick who had heard from the clerk and the schoolmaster of the indignity intended to be offered to their worthy pastor rushed in saved those precious relics from the flames and bore them off in triumph while the affrighted hockleymen fled amazed scarcely offering to resist  and it was well they did for the vicars adherents would have died on the spot rather than have yielded  however said flush for the honor of the cause i rallied the scums and spoke a speech to them as near as i can remember in these um here words  says i  splinter your joints what are you about will you after this pretend to call yourselves hearty culls rum codgers or valiant dickies you lump the castlewickites  you be damned dont you see the queer kids have made off with the toggies but however this here i will say  you had no maulers and they took you by surprise dont be down hearted then to day is for them tomorrow may be for us kallenge them nolens volens to the field fifty against fifty like worthies thump it out kindly and then if you lose why you die like cocks and we will sing tiddium over your graves what say you my good master to my horation was it not great high and crackish  oh very great indeed general flush returned standfast what effect had it effect exclaimed flush damme it took like a train in an hour the kallenge was sent a categorical returned and tomorrow at five we beat to arms  bravo cried standfast but remember i know nothing of this stay a thought strikes me i can make this matter of use my pretty piece of temptation yonder is squeamish i will think on it but it is late good night flush  hearten your soldiers and dont forget that i must be a stranger to the whole business  the master and man here parted the one went to snooze as he called it and the other to meditate how he could make this accident of advantage to him  in this situation if the reader please we will leave them and return to the majors late as it is as i am anxious to make known what passed in the mind of mrs malplaquet after she retired to her appartment  that lady had a most faithful and honest friend in her handmaid emma who was almost as singular a character as flush though a perfect contrast for nothing in nature could be more harmless  emma was the daughter of a bookseller in london who having a large family and being in no very flourishing circumstances was prevailed on to put her out as a ladys companion an advantageous recommendation brought her into the care of mrs malplaquet where she had been now retained for almost three years in which time she had made herself so necessary and so agreeable to her lady that nothing i believe could have prevailed on her to part with so valuable an acquisition  what made her company so particularly desirable was the astonishing fund of information she had treasured up by sitting in her fathers shop her mind was a kind of circulating library in little and i sincerely wish romances were always attended with the same good effects they produced in her for there is scarcely a good moral inculcated by them that she did not act up to not that she had not formed a decided opinion of writings as well as writers but she rarely broached that opinion thinking with madam dacier that silence was the best ornament of the female sex it was evident however that it was wisely and judiciously chosen for at the head of her favorite authors she placed dr johnson though i rather think her great admiration of him must have been as a critic for the doctor is known to have entertained a rooted dislike to mythology and indeed every figurative writing which does not square with what he calls truth and morality whereas emma maintained that morality being the noblest drift of literature those writings were the most perfect which brought virtue into danger that she might rise the more triumphant and that such productions received an additional force and beauty from allegory and mythological allusion  the various merits of our literary abigail will gradually unfold themselves as we go on i thought it necessary to say so much to account for mrs malplaquets determination of disclosing to her the business of standfasts audacity and to advise with her what steps she should take  emma heard the whole affair with great deliberation and pausing for some moments her lady asked her of what she was considering  i am looking madam said she over the catalogue of my mind to see if i have ever read any thing like it and upon recollection the same thing occurs in the nonjuror one of cibbers plays which is taken from the tartuffe of moliere who had it i believe from plautus  and if i might advise you should serve your parson as the lady in that play does hers  how is that said mrs malplaquet for i really forget why madam replied emma she pretends to be caught in his snare while she is laying one for him and placing her husband so as to overhear a pretended love scene between them his villainy is detected and he is turned out of the house  i like the idea said the lady of all things in the world and with thy assistance am ready to set about it but how emma if he should turn the tables upon us for he is very subtle i know it very well madam said emma for at this moment he is making as strong love to me as to yourself but i promise you he finds me a very pamela  the lady expressed some surprise at this intelligence and asked her maid if she was not uneasy at it  on the contrary cried emma i am charmed for to resist temptation is the proper exercise of virtue and serves as a kind of moral penance to strengthen us in our duty oh i assure you madam you need not be uneasy one look from virtue though a lamb will as surely make vice crouch as the lion did at the sight of una  by this time mrs malplaquet was undrest and soon after her maid retired which opportunity i shall seize to account for my having given two such subordinate characters as flush and emma so particular an introduction  to say the truth then i think that though the clown should say no more than is set down for him yet he should say all that is set down for him the devil has been considered by some as the principal character in paradise lost comus on all hands is allowed to have the better of the lady will any one pretend to say don quixote would be any thing without sancho in all the spanish plays the servants are the principal characters and i have heard the soldier in wests general wolf spoken of as the best figure in the groupe emma would have defended this argument by saying that honor is drawn in as masterly a style as sophia and flush would have told you that both man and master were human puppets moved by the same slangs in short i write for all readers and i hope i have scarcely a character but some one or other will pitch upon for my hero  chapter xi in which the historian fulfils his promise to the reader  the challenge from the hockleymen having been as mr flush informed us accepted by the castlewickites a large plain known by the name of the cricket green situated near the high road about midway between the two villages was pitched upon for the scene of action thither repaired the combatants and there were they drawn up in battle array every man poising his hedgestake when a gentleman in a post chaise and four who had ordered the postilion to mend his pace when he first saw a mob assembled came up and cried out in a pretty authoritative voice that if the inhabitants of castlewick did not desist they should lose his favor for ever  the castlewickites expected a very different word of command finding however their present general to be no other than sir sidney they thought proper to throw down what mr flush called maulers upon this the hockley men began to spring forward with an exulting shout and would have dealt death among their unarmed enemies had not another authoritative voice commanded a suspension of hostilities on their part  this voice proceeded from no less a person than mr flush who having deliberately weighed the probable consequence of such violent proceedings began to think they would not be altogether so consistent with prudence he considered that the quarrel had originated with standfast and that there would be enough to do without this new outrage to set matters to rights about the vicar it was therefore his business in quality of his masters friend  by means of which he knew he should be also his own  to soften matters and having an excellent opportunity owing to this piece of cowardice on the part of his adherents he holloed out as loud as his shrill pipe would permit him   why pink your livers what are going for to do would ye stiffen your timbers go for to be such poltroons as to brush the jackets of a parcel of naked men dont you see they have canted away their whackers  then speaking in a lower tone to his lieutenant general  said he the show is over we must let down the rug so do you parley to the hearties while i palaver the old rum kid yonder  upon this he came up to sir sidney and was beginning to state the case in a very advantageous way to his master and himself when their attention was drawn off by a violent screaming at a short distance directing their eyes to where the sound proceeded from they saw a coach overturned to which sir sidney ran and was indeed followed by the whole mob friends and enemies  the coach belonged to major malplaquet and there were in it at the time of this accident that gentleman his lady and the reverend mr standfast neither the lady nor the curate received any material injury but the majors head had pitched against a ragged stone by which means his skull was dangerously fractured  the combatants their cause of quarrel and every other consideration was now absorbed in this melancholy accident  the major was with difficulty listed into his coach where sir sidney who had never seen him before offered to accompany him recommending his chaise to mrs malplaquet into which mr standfast very politely offered to accompany her with a view as he said of keeping up her spirits  the lady however thought proper to refuse both offers and insisted upon going with her husband she however did not neglect to thank sir sidney with tears for his kind concern which indeed was as manifest as if the wounded person had been his own brother for he had by this time dispatched three servants to different surgeons not but mr standfast appeared in some concern too but the glances he cast at the lady and the opera tune he softly whistled while he assisted his dying patron pretty well evinced that his mind ran rather upon the future than the present  sir sidney would not leave the major a moment but supported him in the coach with the utmost care and tenderness all the way home where by the time they arrived and the major was put to bed arrived also two of the surgeons who agreed that the major had not many hours to live they however bled him prepared bandages and one of them began to prepare for the operation of the trepan resolved that their patient should go out of the world secundum artem they were however disappointed for falling into a delirium he erupted a blood vessel  which one of the surgeons very judiciously observed must have been injured by the fall  and was instantly suffocated  mrs malplaquet did not faint away nor even go into hysterics upon this occasion she felt however very severely it is true her tears did not prevent her from thanking sir sidney on the contrary she acknowledged his singular goodness in terms of the most lively gratitude yet her grief though it appeared only decent and proper was from the heart she no more than the vicar would have wished the destruction of the vilest reptile and though she never regarded the major with the ardour of love yet he had ever been kind and she grateful  i shall pass over the funeral at which sir sidney by a particular invitation from mrs malplaquet was present and only say that when all proper ceremonies and decent solemnities were over the widow after paying some legacies  the principal of which was three thousand pounds to the reverend mr standfast as a trifling acknowledgment of his disinterested and honorable attachment  for the chaplain had frequently hinted that if a man left any thing to a friend it had better be in money which would prevent litigation the widow i say after discharging these obligations found herself in the possession of a plentiful fortune  one circumstance however i must not fail to mention which is that mr mildman at the desire of mrs malplaquet preached the funeral sermon nor can i avoid noticing that sir sidney furnished the epitaph which was no more than what follows here are deposited the remains of  this epitaph emma declared to be perfect in all its requisites for it told who was the person buried and very concisely pointed out his good qualities you also learnt by it when he died and how old he was nay so much was she pleased that she doubted not if it had been written in latin but that dr johnson himself must have been perfectly content with it for her part she liked it as well as it was and that for a very good reason as she humbly conceived namely because she did not understand latin indeed she owned that this was one of the spots that candor obliged her to acknowledge were now and then to be discovered in the doctor he was very angry that dr smollets epitaph was not written in latin and when he went into an apothecarys shop with mr boswell instead of asking for some trifling medicine he had occasion for he called for paper pen and ink and wrote it down in latin  these manners and opinions she thought  for nobody was so open to conviction as emma  were upon erudition what rust is upon a coin which no one knows the value of but the possessor  nothing could be so clear she said as what she advanced it was not every bodys lot to be blessed with so much learning as the doctor which she maintained was very fortunate for if all men were arrived at such perfection as himself and were able like him of advancing incontrovertible ipse dixits argument would be at an end and of course literature along with it but as he was the only one who had ever pretended to be infallible and who certainly was so except in a few trifling points like this it might so happen that latin epitaphs would prove a sarcasm where they were meant to be a panegyric for to praise a dead person in a language he was unacquainted with while living though a tacit would be a very strong satire besides being a cruel inconvenience to his family who must in this case be obliged to get the parson to construe the virtues of the deceased who after all perhaps might not be able to do it off hand she therefore clearly apprehended that as dr johnson had issued a literary bill enacting that an epitaph could not be perfect which did not mention the particulars before rehearsed the next infallible writer  if ever this country should be blessed with another should be petitioned to move by way of rider that for the benefit of the public in general all such epitaphs should be done in english but said she finishing her harrangue dear doctor johnson put me in mind at last of domitius afer who would be an orator when he could no longer be audible and of whom quintilian said that he would rather sail than desist  it is now high time i should account for that strange jumble of accidents which in so short a time saved an hundred men from bodily hurt and yet killed another who had no concern at all in the fray  the reader will recollect that standfast had a scheme in agitation it was this he knew mrs malplaquet to be of a most tender and compassionate temper and he thought he could wound her through this weak side he had therefore lured the major and her out by way of an afternoons ride intending when they arrived at the field of battle to exclaim against the barbarity of the disputants to jump out of the carriage and to insist on their going peaceably home  this he thought the lady would take in such a light as must greatly forward his designs the contemplation of this scheme on his side and the hopes of detecting him on the side of mrs malplaquet made them on that afternoon better satisfied with each other than they had been a long time and gave the major such real pleasure that he declared as they were in the carriage that he never passed so happy a day in his life without divining poor man that it would be his last  mr standfasts kind intentions were however forestalled by sir sidney who through an unexpected dissolution of parliament was posting down to be rechosen for the borough of neitherside  thus are men saved or destroyed by the turn of a straw thus the villagers slept in whole skins thus the major was hurried into the other world thus were the designs of mr standfast frustrated and thus  for i cannot longer refrain from declaring it  did sir sidney see that phantom we formerly spoke of that disturber of his peace to whom he longed to open his mind  this is the secret i hinted to the reader at the end of the sixth chapter and i only desire to be resolved had i then divulged it  and thereby have neglected to bring him acquainted with the heartburnings of the two villages the contrast between the two parsons the singular friendship of standfast and the major the amiable cast of mrs malplaquet the extraordinary qualities of her maid the wonderful and surprising talents of mr flush and every other person or thing that conduced to bring about that event which introduced sir sidney to mrs malplaquet  whether it would not have been doing things in a bungling and unworkmanlike manner  besides i have now no further trouble with these people the reader is perfectly acquainted with them and if in future they should be thrown in his way let them speak for themselves  to be sure had they never appeared at all sir sidney might have been heartwhole but since a number of circumstances are likely to grow out of this accidental interview i have even given it as it happened and shall now tell the reader when time had fully confirmed the baronet in his first opinion of the widow that she was a very handsome and what was more to him a very valuable woman he resolved to throw his fortune into her lap and his person into her arms and for this purpose he was determined to make her a proposal to that effect as soon as decency should permit it  several reasons urged him to this first there was a secret which to make amends for my late transgression shall be almost immediately disclosed to the reader  perhaps my readiness to indulge him may be attributed to malevolence because in doing so i shall be obliged to show a speck in the character of sir sidney which to some may appear black place it in what light i will to this accusation however i plead not guilty solemnly declaring that in the most unrighteous moments of his life i truly believe he had as reasonable a stock of piety as any bishop would desire as much temperance soberness and chastity even in his very excesses as a gouty alderman under a regimen and at any rate as little desire of doing an injury to man woman or child as a lord chancellor  this however need not hinder the reader from exercising his own judgment which i not only desire he may do but also with the most critical care and nicety and when all the circumstances dangers temptations motives and inducements are clearly and fairly examined if he should not acquit sir sidney of every thing worse than venial frailty i must honestly take shame to myself for having palmed on the world as an exemplary character a mere mortal made up of flesh and blood and subject to wishes inclinations and desires like other men  i could say certainly that the very excellence of sir sidneys heart sprung from having as vigorous and turbulent passions as any rake in christendom and never having improperly given them the reins but once in his life but some of my readers may think that once too much and as a blot at backgammon is no blot till it is hit and a blot of ink is the easier discoverable in proportion to the whiteness of the paper on which it falls and as an atom is not only magnified but more deformed by being seen through a microscope so i fear this one fault will intrude itself on the readers remembrance in the very act of relieving distressed genius or wiping a tear from the cheek of an orphan if it should be so i must submit for a reader like a pope is infallible and from his fiat there is no appeal  the story of sir sidneys incontinence  for incontinence it was and such things like murder will out  shall be told in the next chapter which will finish the first book of this history and while the reader takes time to consider what heinous crime this can possibly be let me bespeak his charity by informing him that sir sidney being once foreman of a grand jury whom the judge recommended to find a bill against a murderer because as he said such and such circumstances were which could not have been yet proved answered with an honest fervor  my lord in my opinion the prejudgment of an offense is half as criminal as the commission of it  chapter xii which contains the trial of sir sidney  the pleadings on both sides  the verdict and sentence  and finishes the first book of this history  we are now going to enter upon action every thing already related having happened previous to the time when the reader and i entered the rookery or as mr bays has it long before the beginning of this play we there left sir sidney apparently possessed of every comfort upon earth and yet unhappy this seeming paradox has been partly accounted for but let us hope as mrs malplaquet is now entirely mistress of herself that the bar to the completion of the baronets wishes may be removed  the major has now been dead nearly a twelvemonth and sir sidney has had many opportunities of confirming himself in the good opinion he originally entertained of the widow but as at his time of life marriage was no maygame he honestly solicited to be acquainted with every secret of her heart frankly offering to encourage her by laying open the exact situation of his own  mrs malplaquet liked the proposal so well that she did not hesitate to give him every information concerning herself which i formerly gave the reader not forgetting to own with an ingenuous frankness that she had loved before and though were she to form a character she knew of no quality she would wish to make a part of it that sir sidney did not perfectly possess yet that warmth of affection which she had formerly cherished would never again she sincerely believed take place in her heart  sir sidney scarcely heard her to an end when he exclaimed  madam in opening my own heart i should have used the very same words i have loved and will imitate you by confessing that the object of my affection whether alive or dead is still dear to me your resemblance of her first induced my admiration of you and the consonance of your sentiments with hers inspired me with an esteem of the truest kind which perhaps in marriage more securely ensures happiness than what is generally called love  to conside in your tender bosom the secret of my passion is now my duty and if you will have the patience to hear me i shall show you that those who are capable of most tenderness are effectively the least happy  but as old aesop said when prometheus took the clay to form man he tempered it with tears  the lady testified great impatience and the baronet proceeded to satisfy her in the following words  being about ten years ago in the south of france i became acquainted with a gentleman of the name of le clerc he had a daughter who at the time i first visited in the family was just come home from a convent conversations between french and english too often turn on the subject of religion as to mr le clerc he was not satisfied with continually chanting forth the praises of that only and exclusive worship which according to him would procure salvation but he daily exhorted me to embrace his faith  this inconvenience i should have got rid of by renouncing his acquaintance or removing to another town but i had no such power i had spoken you may be assured warmly though not like an enthusiast of our own mild reasonable worship representing it as the true medium between frantic zeal and subtle hypocrisy and though all my arguments served but to root the fathers opinion the stronger i plainly began to perceive i had made a convert of the daughter  in the convent where she boarded lived also several english ladies who had already began to stagger her sentiments  no wonder then her conversion was completed by the man she loved yes madam plain downright and sincere as i was a beautiful girl of nineteen gentle as a cherub and good as an angel doated on me nor was i behind hand with her i promise you for my affection was exactly of that sort which receives its pleasure by reflecting what it has given  this was the charm that withheld me we consulted together on the most expedient means to gratify our mutual wishes and though i dreaded the event it was resolved that i should offer myself to her father as the husband of my dear annette i did so he heard me to an end and then very explicitly informed me that he would consent to my marriage with his daughter upon condition i changed my religion  i spoke of this as an unsurmountable objection when he heartily told me he saw how matters were and would immediately send his daughter to a severer convent to prevent her from throwing herself into the arms of a heretic  i had scarcely returned to my lodgings to reflect on this adventure and the measures i ought to take in consequence of it when my servant came running to tell me that a post chaise was waiting at the door with a lady in it who desired to see me immediately guess what was my surprise when i beheld my annette who told me in as few words as possible that her father was at that moment gone to the abbess of a certain convent to agree to her entire exclusion from the world that she had chosen the moment of his absence to come to me and knowing how much my mind was above the false delicacy of sacrificing to ridiculous form and unnecessary ceremony she proposed at once going off for some town where we might be married in the protestant faith  you may be sure i did not hesitate but leaving my affairs to my faithful servant whom i ordered to stay and watch the motions of the enemy i leaped into the chaise and we were more than twenty leagues on our road to geneva when poor annette was taken so very ill that it was impossible for us to proceed  i was in hopes her indisposition had proceeded from the fatigue the hurry of her spirits and those fears which were natural upon having taken so precipitate a resolution but i found myself lamentably mistaken her disorder increased and i was greatly alarmed for her life by degrees however she recovered and though very weak we apprehended no more dangerous symptoms  during all this time as we were thrown among a parcel of boors i was obliged to give her every attendance i decently could this attention procured so free and uninterrupted an intercourse between us that is it wonderful when the rose began to revisit her cheeks and my whole soul was in a trance of happiness at the prospect of retrieving an inestimable treasure that a few days before i had dreaded to lose for ever  is it wonderful thus unrestrained considering ourselves as man and wife we became so by every tie but the ceremony i will not comment on the circumstance perhaps it was inexcusable perhaps i ought not to have disclosed it but nothing could be purer than our intentions were and i have no opinion of secrets which are revealed after marriage  mrs malplaquet  which i think was very handsome in her  scarcely called it a fault because of the peculiarity of their situation and their intention of setting matters honorably to rights nay she undertook to defend the conduct of the lady at which sir sidney was so greatly charmed that he sung forth very lavishly in praise of the widows generosity liberality and candor and declared that except now and then a sigh to the memory of annette he should never have an intruding care  well madam returned the baronet three weeks passed in pleasures which it is not in my power to describe at the end of this time my annette having recovered sufficient strength to undergo the fatigue of her journey we set out for geneva but scarcely had we got within a league and a half of those frontiers where by exercising the right of a husband i could have silenced the pretensions of a father when being overtaken by a posse of horsemen headed by le clerc my annette was torn from me while i was overpowered and carried before the general of the police of the neighboring town  this gentleman heard my story to an end laughed at my folly for not getting sooner out of danger took a handsome present of me and gave me a letter to the father of annette advising him to make up the breach by consenting to our marriage  i scarcely gave myself time for sleep or any other refreshment before i threw myself at the feet of mr le clerc i got nothing from him however but a volley of reproaches to which i answered that his daughter was affianced to me that i considered her as my wife and would employ my whole fortune as well as the interest of the english ambassador who was my particular friend to do myself justice  every argument procured me a new insult i therefore went to paris for the purpose of consulting my friend the ambassador but as we were then upon the eve of a war and he expected every moment to be recalled it was out of his power to do me any service  thus disappointed i returned once more to provence there i found le clerc ten times more furious than ever he loaded me with a thousand invectives it had it seems been found out that annette was with child and he swore he would rather see her expire than that she should bring a heretic into the world vainly i represented to him that he was now compelled by every motive of honor and justice to make us one he vowed my destruction  after hovering about the place for a considerable while  employing every emissary my purse could procure to trace out where they had sequestered annette  and having learnt no more than that she was admitted into a convent at a considerable distance till she should lie in upon condition of taking the veil immediately afterward i was musing one day what further course to pursue when my servant came running in with the greatest horror pictured in his countenance and told me if i did not immediately fly i should be imprisoned for life for that his dear lady  so he always called annette  had died in childbed after bringing forth a girl and that her father out of revenge had procured a lettre de cachet against my person  shocked as i was at this fatal news i did not however neglect my safety to which i was not a little prompted by a lively desire to succor the little innocent pledge of our tender affection i therefore followed my man through a back field mounted a horse of my own  for i feared to go post  and made the best of my way toward savoy  on the road my man informed me that the postilion who drove us to the house where annette was taken ill happened to set a company down at provence some time afterward where being told among other things of the bustle le clerc had made in searching after his daughter to no purpose began to be convinced by putting different circumstances together that it must be her he had driven in my company for it had been explained to him that she had gone off with an english gentleman in hopes therefore of a bribe on the other side he went to le clerc confessed to him where he had taken us informed him of annettes illness and assured him that as we talked of going to geneva if he could not overtake us there was a great chance of catching us as we returned especially if we went to that house for as we must have stopped there some time they would at any rate be able to give a good account of us  le clerc did not hesitate a moment but set out with two friends and a party of the marechause who came to the inn ome hours after we had left it there they got every intelligence they wanted and quickening their diligence they soon overtook us as i have already described  my servant also told me that he did not believe a syllable of annettes death his real opinion was that she had taken the veil for that it was a very common thing for their friends to give out whenever that event took place that they were dead to prevent troublesome importunity and in the present instance it was extremely probable because could i have found out the convent to which she was devoted i should have left nothing untried to shake that vow which i was sure she never would have taken but by compulsion  and for heavens sake said the widow what is become of the child she is well madam  answered the baronet but where said the widow at a school about twenty miles off replied sir sidney you astonish me replied she how did you preserve her you shall hear said the baronet  having left respectable connections in provence i received intelligence from thence that very soon after i left france le clerc quitted that part of the kingdom but they never could hear to what place he retired about two years afterward  no longer apprehending any ill consequences from the lettre de cachet  i went again to provence but however had my journey for my pains  three other visits were made with no better success last year however i was more fortunate for i had not been many days in the town before a nun of the order of st clare called at my friends house and demanded to speak to me  she informed me that her order being one of those which are allowed to have intercourse at certain times with the world she was desired by an abbess of another convent to let me know that my child would be delivered up to me  you may believe i was charmed with this intelligence i went with her to the convent where i enquired very earnestly for annette but they confirmed every thing i had before heard nay i was even shown her grave which you may be assured i watered with my tears in short i came away bringing with me her living model who i sincerely believe was not out of my arms an hour at a time till my arrival in warwickshire  your doubts after this subsided i suppose cried the widow i cannot say they did returned the baronet the little creature at this moment talks of madame le clerc whom she used to call mamma in a great house like a church i therefore think my being shown the grave was a religious fraud invented to deter me from searching for her in vain  she is certainly irrecoverably gone and therefore dead to me no i shall never forget her but let me not forget myself providence permitted this separation perhaps to punish us for the crime of having impetuously gratified our wishes before they received the sanction of religion it is a heavy punishment but i will not incur a greater by repining  here sir sidney paused several parts of his narrative were recapitulated and a variety of reflections grew out of them on the instability of human expectations sir sidney apologized to mrs malplaquet for having so freely opened his heart to her and she sincerely assured him it had considerably augmented her esteem for him  i shall not trouble the reader with his reply or her rejoinder but only say that after a number of civil things had passed on both sides he reminded her that he wanted a mother for his child and she without affectation at length promised to undertake that task  in a word she shortly after became lady roebuck to the great satisfaction of the baronet the confusion of standfast and the universal joy of castlewick  end of the first book the younger brother book ii which is still more interesting than the former chapter i a clearing of the course preparatory to the next heat  as a variety of circumstances  many of them very unexpectedly  will shortly present themselves to the reader i think it necessary as far as i may conceive it our mutual interest to prepare him for their reception indeed it is my intention to adopt this practice frequently in the course of this history not in such a way however as to anticipate any thing nay i will not promise that these explanations shall always be literally what they seem for should i wish to cover or disguise any circumstance till the proper moment of making it known i hope he will not be angry if i put him a little upon a false scent by way of exercise to get him an appetite to the real game when at last he shall come up with it  i beg however it may be understood that these false lights are not intended unnecessarily to lead him astray i know this literary will of the wisp is often introduced but i disclaim it as an unpardonable and impotent attempt at a spurious wit which is really an affront to every intelligent reader so much indeed do i hold such sort of trifling a thing that ought on no account to be excused that i desire this work may be considered perfect only in proportion as every circumstance even the most minute and apparently insignificant tends to promote the general effect and that effect holds out a laudable and improving moral  we have heard very little of standfast since the death of major malplaquet this worthy wight which will be very little doubted laid strong siege to the widow for as i said before she became at her husbands decease very wealthy she however having nobody to please but herself gave him such a reception as soon convinced him that his hopes were like some of the projects of our late builders  fair and elegantly finished in the estimate but mere skeletons in practice  thus disappointed he pocketed his trifle as he called the three thousand pounds and decamped contenting himself with whispering that he might very easily have married the widow if he had thought proper but knowing ones were not to be taken in that women who would sip in the time of their first husbands might taste when they got a second and that perhaps had he been fool enough to be caught he might have doated too and so have gotten a lusty chaplain to help him out as somebody else did  these gross jokes were faithfully retailed by mr flush not however without a finish that if the governor  meaning standfast  had braced the drum of matrimony a certain genteel dapper cock of an humble servant of his would not have feared coming in for a trevally or so  i have never told the reader that mr standfast and mr viney were very intimate friends and perhaps he has divined why if not he will presently the fact however was so they had known each other for several years and indeed upon vineys being civilly dismissed from lord hazards house he consulted standfast whom he well knew to be a perfect machiavel in domestic politics upon the likeliest means to preserve his declining interest in that family  the stream of standfasts interest going at that time in another channel nothing came of the negotiation but the major being dead and he expelled from the presence of the widow the two friends finding themselves in the same situation and that the interest of one was the interest of both they laid their heads together and considered of the matter in every point of view at length they agreed that nothing could so perfectly answer their several wishes as to get standfast into lord hazards family take their own words  it is such a damned good scheme said standfast that i envy you for thinking on it but i am devlishly afraid it is not practicable  you are right cried viney let us tread sure go on warily i know his foibles that is one thing in our favor how is he for a first sight attack said standfast a very dove cried viney a greenhorn that is lucky said standfast we have nothing then to consider of but the introduction does he know any thing of me only by hearsay replied viney and now i recollect what he did hear was to your advantage let me see what was it oh that the major out of his great friendship had left you considerably and in particular had commanded his lady on his death bed to take you for her second husband  ridiculous cried standfast the old fellow never spoke after the accident and as to the widow my dear sir she was too peery no no nothing less than the title of my lady would content her  odso said viney i wonder at it too you used to be pretty sure of your mark when the do was to be struck ha ha ha true true cried standfast but this was so skittish she would have taken more powder and shot as well as patience than i would spare upon any such do were she the transformation of a goddess hang her let her go she has enough to say against me but if she prattles we must retaliate right or wrong  that to be sure said viney is but selfdefence but to our business lord hazard is now seeking out a tutor for his favorite charles and i own i should like to gall him there hey my friend am i not right there i feel my sisters injuries well hit faith cried standfast  they tell me it is a fine mettled boy i will bring him up well  not so fast interrupted viney in the first place did he know of our intimacy it would be an immovable bar to our design and then he is determined to receive none but an exemplary character  me again exclaimed standfast i will give him examples of pleasure that might resuscitate old anacreon that is to say behind his fathers back and lessons of morality before his face that might be heard and approved by listening angels  but still our intimacy said viney we must get over that replied standfast let me see  i have it  cannot i introduce myself to some family in town  or make my court to any relation of the wife zounds now i recollect there is a capital house in the city  ingot the wiredrawer  where they make me very welcome lord hazard occasionally banks there if i can but get recommended to preach two or three charity sermons and afterward invited to dine with the stewards the business is done i am sure mr ingot is under obligations enough to me for i so did up his elder brother by making him genteel that in consequence of two or three genteel faux pas he at last genteelly finished himself by which this remaining brother got to be head of the firm and so you see viney one good turn deserves another true true said viney  so said so done standfast left a friend to officiate for him at little hockley and repaired to town where he so well set his engines to work that in six months he not only got introduced to lord hazard but contrived so to sustain the several essays made on his disposition and abilities that he issued from that ordeal through which the reader may remember my lord was determined his sons tutor should pass so perfect as to fix himself securely in that noblemans good opinion and indeed  which i should not think it necessary to set down but by way of regularity  mr standfast was the very gentleman introduced to lady hazard in the fourth chapter of the first book in quality of tutor to her son  if the reader should wonder how it came to pass that lord hazard did not know the irregularities of standfast especially as one was curate of little hockley and the other landlord i must inform him that his lordship had never visited his estate in warwickshire but once after his second marriage but repaired to a villa about twenty miles from london which he bought soon after he came of age indeed as soon as he determined to give over his excesses little hockley was the last place upon earth he wished to think of his rents were punctually remitted and this was all he ever would hear upon the subject  neither his reformation however nor this caution altered his character in the opinion of the villagers for as the sons and daughters of little hockley were many of them of his getting and the rest very ambitious to be thought so they never dreamt that he had any virtues but remembered his vices only glorying in them and speaking of them in so familiar and shameless a manner as if every meal they tasted was the sweeter for being garnished with the bread of dishonor  i will not suppose my reader to be so inexperienced as to think that standfasts views were merely confined to his intention of becoming the tutor of charles nor on the other hand will i believe him so sagacious as to discover what they really were  we can scarcely credit that a man of this worthy clergymans consummate experience in human traffic had not a material point to carry especially now he was in partnership with viney if it was so it will certainly come in its proper place which unless i had a wish  which i really have not  to destroy the readers pleasure cannot possibly be here  having fixed mr standfast in the family of lord hazard we will now speak of mr flush that valiant thumper of parchment having received a handsome sum and a long lesson from his quondam master was transferred through viney to the original lady hazard now reduced to mrs oshocknesy and by her again transferred to her son at college  i shall also say that mrs oshocknesy was present at one or two of the latter consultations relative to the grand business nor indeed was flush absolutely left out it was on the contrary found necessary to let him partially into the matter for said he very archly if you dont let me into the maxim of the thing how the devil shall i be able to move your figures for you  a letter from flush to standfast after he had been six months at eton shall finish this chapter  i shall give it the reader in his own words to his honor the rev stephen standfast esquire governor the young one begins to be up to most things but his book and yet lord love you give him but a tippling gig and an arm full of red and white and such crackers as i and your honor could wind him about our fingers as easily as a bunch of slangs i gave my soft master the other day a trifling bit of a rap about the country ken but neddy seems all to go with the old nan howsomdever i bent one of them that is easily revulsed if he will not go by an exercise i must beat up a charge see any puss poing any gain poing as we say abroad oh revawr my shire matter  yours tell death k flush notey beney whatever gait you morris take the advice of a fool and never think any more of ploughing with the heffer       generals have been known to settle with their aid de camps a kind of characters so unintelligible to any but themselves that should information fall into the enemys hand no ill consequence could ensue one would think standfast and flush had made this same agreement in truth did i believe the reader could make kiddys letter into english i should not have inserted it as it is i shall leave it by way of aenigma which he may either stay and solve or go on to the next chapter and so leave the explanation of that and every thing else to what i may conceive the proper season for it  i would nevertheless have that as well as many other particulars in this chapter carefully attended to gangrenes begin by a small spot and the egg of a crocodile has as inoffensive an appearance as that of a goose  chapter ii in which the game begins  mr standfast no sooner sat down in lord hazards family than like a spy in an enemys camp he began to reconnoitre its situation strength and disposition to examine whether the body was well united whether there were any rotten members whether sentinels dared to sleep on their posts whether the commanding officer was most loved or feared  in short to use his own words  though i would not have the reader infer from thence that he was a cobbler in his business  he had the length of every foot in the family  not however to be outdone in courtesy there was not one among them that had not something to say in his favor my lord declared he was a man of strong intellects and sound erudition he did not think him a saint nor wish him to be one solid argument for ought he could see might as well be discussed over a glass as a lamp and as to gaiety and carelessness he dreaded nothing from them for they could harbor no ill designs he was a little surprised at hearing from standfast that he had been frequently in his life taken in but it gave him an opportunity of exercising his sagacity by remarking that those who mix most with the world know least of it  as it was said of lord anson after he had been a prey to sharpers that he had been over the world but never in it upon the whole he thought mr standfast a fair undesigning man and both a proper tutor for his son and companion for himself  lady hazard was no less prepossessed in favor of the tutor she looked upon him as an unaffected cheerful man perfectly well bred and as she saw his being in the house gave her lord particular satisfaction really felicitated herself upon this acquisition to the family  the butler liked him for though he could well distinguish the different qualities of the wine yet he never made use of his knowledge to a poor servants disadvantage in short there was not a person in the family whose good opinion he had not been anxious to procure and one would have thought with more care and industry than belonged to such a trifle for he so succeeded that he was allowed to be a true servants friend  mr standfast had certainly no iago to egg him on he knew however as well as that subtle gentleman himself that trifles light as air in cases of art are of great use and he doubted not but they would as much conduce to answer the purposes of one kind of hypocrisy as another  as to the pupil he loved standfast like a father and took instructions from him full as fast as the other could give it which between ourselves not a little embarrassed the tutor who begging lord hazards pardon was not so profound a scholar as that kind patron in his liberal warmth had represented him  standfast feeling this deficiency pressed his lordship to carry his scheme into execution of having charles taught music and painting thinking and very rightly that relieved by those avocations he should be able to make his stock of learning last as long as he might have occasion for it  having worked his materials into a proper temper mr standfast now began to think of moulding them to his different purposes but this required the nicest care and circumspection my lord plumed himself upon being no novice and lady hazards amiable heart and unconquerable duty barred all possibility of flattering the most distant hopes had there been any such conceived of staggering her virtue or even her prudence  something mr standfast was certainly hatching up and while it was in contemplation a most singular circumstance happened which that gentleman did not fail to lay up as food for his project  lord and lady hazard were one night in a side box at the playhouse where behind them sat a lady and two gentlemen one of whom the fair one often called brother and the other sir daniel at the end of the amusement while they were waiting for their carriage one of these gentlemen seeing a person go out of the opposite box exclaimed there he goes and by god i will be after him immediately upon this he darted out of the box followed by the other who warmly entreated him not to be precipitate almost at the same moment the lady shrieked out good god there will be murder and immediately fainted away  neither the good offices of lord hazard nor his lady were wanting to restore her which desirable event they at length happily achieved the lady now begged for heavens sake he would have the goodness to conduct her to her coach which entreaty lady hazard seconded with all her eloquence  upon this the ladys footman from the lobby summoned the coach to the door and my lord having very politely seen her into it returned with an intention to join lady hazard in his way he encountered one of the gentlemen he had seen in the box who accosted him with i must thank you sir for the civility you have done me sir answered lord hazard with great politeness if you mean in respect to any attention shown to the lady it was but my duty and i am already thanked i dare say you are replied the other but that will not go down with me in short you are a scoundrel and i insist upon deciding the matter immediately it can be done in this tavern  sir said lord hazard very spiritedly i do not think myself obliged to answer so unprovoked and rude an assault but as every thing in your appearance except this insult calls you gentleman i attend you sir  at this moment standfast who had been at the other theater and had by promise returned to go home with lord hazard came up and boldly enquired who it was that dared to insult that nobleman  upon which a crowd having gathered about the cry was settle it in the tavern  settle it in the tavern there they now adjourned but not before lord hazard had dispatched standfast to his lady to request that she would stay for that he should be immediately with her  when they were come to the place of explanation lord hazard was more at a loss than ever  the gentleman who had insulted him brought against him a direct accusation of carrying on a clandestine correspondence with his sister which he said was doubly dishonorable as she was at the point of marriage to a worthy young baronet  this charge was parried by a declaration that till the present evening the lord had never seen the lady but the brother treated this excuse with contempt and was for fighting it out instantly mixing his invectives with some insinuations about a masquerade the company however opposed his warmth and the clamor was so various and violent that nothing distinctly could be understood it was therefore determined as with one voice that the affair should not then be decided but as it seemed a matter of delicacy the disputants should privately exchange addresses and meet with each a friend to talk the business over in the morning this was immediately complied with and now arrived standfast with news that lady hazard had quitted the boxes and he supposed was gone home  lord hazard and standfast betook themselves to a hackney coach in which on their way the latter was made acquainted as far as my lord knew it with this mysterious business standfast said it must have originated in some mistake which he supposed would be cleared up on the morrow for added he you never saw the lady before did you my lord never in my life said lord hazard nay said standfast if you had the fellow need not have made such a piece of work about it for i am very much mistaken or she is one of the right sort and very likely the brother is only a led knight employed to bully in her cause therefore were i your lordship i would take care if i must be forced into a duel it should be with a gentleman  my lord declared that he most sincerely believed the lady was a woman of honor for said he i never saw more unaffected signs of modesty as to the brother i think with you that the whole matter will prove a mistake and the affair blow over  you know my lord cried standfast i always yield to you in matters of experience however we shall see for i hope i am to have the honor of accompanying your lordship tomorrow  why i was thinking so too said my lord but as the gentleman may unfortunately happen to call in my absence and as it would be a kind of tacit reflection on my honor if he should go away unsatisfied i will get you to stay and receive him i hope however to prevent his coming for i shall be out very early to convince him that i am as anxious to bring this business to a finish as himself as to a second you know if it should be necessary i can take our friend colonel tiltly  they now arrived at lord hazards house where they found my lady who informed them that having stayed till there was no soul in the theater but herself she prevailed on the boxkeeper to find her servants and see her to her coach but my lord said she what could possibly detain you  lord hazard who had never considered that this question would certainly be asked him was totally unprepared to answer it after some hesitation however he faultered out in great apparent confusion nay not the lady i assure you my love  i did not know but she might have had another fit said lady hazard in that case it would have been inhumanity to have left her  why if it had been so replied my lord where would have been the great crime in it  crime returned her ladyship i had no idea of any such thing charity is no crime my lord but really your looks accuse you more than i do i appeal to any body if i was a jealous wife whether a standerby would blame me if i should be suspicious at this moment  well then upon my honor madam said lord hazard i only saw the lady to her coach and was returning to you but a particular business which happened very unexpectedly prevented me this mr standfast knows to be truth  standfast was here beginning a very handsome excuse for his friend when the lady stopped him and addressing herself to my lord said my dear if you had not made this last declaration if your friend here had not seconded you if i had actually been told that you went home with the lady that she was an old acquaintance of yours and that she came into the box by your appointment i should never have mentioned the subject again  therefore i beg my lord i may not hear of it from you  this is ridiculous said his lordship you conjure up a parcel of imaginary stuff and then argue upon it as if it really existed  god forbid it ever should exist said the lady i only mention it to show if it really did what a good wife i should be  supper was now brought in and the subject of course dropped  the three persons concerned in it however did not so easily dismiss it from their thoughts as they had from their tongues they neither eat much supper nor enjoyed much rest and what appears very extraordinary standfast who one should think was least concerned ruminated on it the most  perhaps the catastrophe of this adventure may bring out what his cogitations were those of lord and lady hazard may be very easily guessed i cannot help however remarking that this night was the first they ever slept together without speaking to each other nor did my lord ever before leave his lady so early or so abruptly  if the reader wishes the matter to clear up and that a reconciliation should take place it is more than mr standfast did who very archly remarked as he came down stairs in the morning that he must be a bungling physician indeed who did not know how to irritate as well as to cure  chapter iii a continuation of the same sport  lady hazard having been told by my lords gentleman that her husband was gone out and had left word he should not return perhaps till dinner sat down to breakfast with mr standfast and her son charles which meal however was very short for the tutor appeared exceedingly anxious to introduce his pupil to some new author with whom the young gentleman seemed as evidently to wish himself acquainted they therefore retired to the library and left the lady to herself who for some minutes afterward continued in a profound reverie not knowing what to make of her husbands having gone out so unprecedentedly for as to the adventure of the preceding night she had pretty well made up her mind on it  there was not much time to reflect on that or any thing else before the door opened and a person walked into the room whom lady hazard knew immediately for the very same sir daniel whom she had seen at the playhouse she was for a moment astonished but recollecting herself she got up and was making her way toward the bell when the gentleman who for some reason or other did not seem to approve of her taking that step got the start of her and disputed the pass  no no my dear madam said he that cannot be you must suffer me to prevent you besides what would your servants say if you called them about you  say sir answered the lady with a look of ineffable disdain one of them was witness to your ruffianlike behavior last night and would want no order from me to treat you as you merit  which chastisement if you do not wish to provoke you will begone instantly  not till you have granted my pardon said he by heaven this visit which i have managed to a miracle was meant only as an atonement for my last nights offense twas madness  liquor  any thing you will  dare not sir said the lady to affront my ears with your gross insolence nay then cried he there is but a moment and by heaven i will not lose it charming creature look with pity on me what do you mean exclaimed lady hazard nay unhand me or i will raise the house never cried the ravisher this minute shall seal my happiness heavens cried the lady shall i be treated thus  is there no one near me  yes madam cried standfast who entered the room there is one near you and ever ready thus to treat the villain who shall dare to wrong such beauty and innocence so saying he flew at the ravisher as if he would have throttled him then pausing  but hold said he my regard to lady hazards character protects you in this house  tell me who you are and expect me in half an hour at the smyrna  i am called said the other sir daniel dogbolt and will not fail you may be assured as to you madam said he i sincerely regret that i have given you a moments pain what a wretch i am  last night  oh that it had been prosperous or that i could blot it from my memory  here he left the room and mr standfast ringing the bell a servant presently made his appearance who asking if he was wanted was told only to see the gentleman out to which he answered that john had opened the door and the gentleman offered him half a guinea but he would not take it very well said standfast take away the things which while the servant was doing he whispered to lady hazard to compose herself  for she was on a sofa and seemed indeed extremely flurried  when the servant was gone out of the room standfast advanced to lady hazard and said i should be extremely unhappy if zealous in your ladyships cause i have done any thing in this business contrary to your wishes  good god cried the lady how can you have such an idea mr standfast a ruffian assaulted me and you came to my assistance can such conduct demand any thing less from me than the warmest thanks  madam i beg your pardon said standfast but it has been a strange business altogether i had for one moment  perhaps for which i ought never to be forgiven  forgot the unsullied purity of lady hazard and when i heard from the gentleman that insinuation concerning last night  but it is impossible  i see it  he must be a villain i will answer with my life that if ever a heart was the mansion of innocence yours is  i thank you for your opinion sir said the lady i hope i deserve it as to last night i will not make a mystery of it now though i thought i had sufficient reason for it then after my lord left me this bold man came back to the box and seeing me alone began to enquire what was become of the lady i told him that at my desire my lord had conducted her to her coach upon which he said he would remain to thank him for his civility as well as to protect me from any insult  he behaved very properly at first but as the house thinned his conversation took quite a different turn he first said he wondered my lord did not return then said he was surely gone home with the lady and at last assured me that to his knowledge she was an old acquaintance of his at length he ventured at some rude freedoms but at that moment john came to ask me if he should draw off the coach and seeing what passed did not hesitate to treat the ruffian pretty severely for his insolence  blessings on him for it cried standfast as well as for refusing the money just now i never thought it of him i confess before but i see he is a noble fellow  but go on madam  i suffered myself said lady hazard to be conducted by my servant and the boxkeeper to my coach and came home when having cautioned john never to open his lips on the subject i took the resolution of keeping it from my husbands knowledge for fear of his resentment  nothing could be more commendable certainly said standfast insufferable impudence in a public place too a fellow you had never seen before i suppose and then to have recourse to that stale trick of accusing my lord  so worthy a character so good a husband  heaven forbid i should think him otherwise said the lady but how came this audacious man here which of the servants could show him into this apartment  oh i can account for that said standfast  can you sir said the lady that is to say answered the tutor i think i can guess you know my lord entrusted me with the business of last night upon which between ourselves he is gone out this morning well and what then said the lady a little peevishly what then cried standfast really it is so awkward a business to answer you had better not enquire about it for upon my word i am not at liberty to tell you  this is the strangest mystery said the lady  surely if you know any thing of the matter you can explain to me how this man came here  why very true returned standfast as far as it relates to that madam i can have no objection my lord upon going out this morning desired me to receive every person who should call and i suppose as i had not left the breakfast room five minutes when this pretty gentleman was shown up here    but still that is very extraordinary said the lady for no servant announced him  why then certainly he must have been previously shown into the library said standfast while charles and i were in the little study suppose i ring to know but upon second thoughts i had better not one servant already has been witness of  but however i will quiet him  i cannot think of it said the lady and whatever may be the consequence rather than my conduct should appear so equivocal i am resolved to acquaint my lord with every thing just as it has fallen out  you would not surely be so mad cried standfast he has quite enough upon his hands about it already i tremble for him at this moment  good god said the lady one would think you wanted to drive me distracted why tremble for him what has he upon his hands  i beg your pardon madam returned standfast my anxiety my warmth  oh that i could dissemble like other men this absurd frankness of mine is always leading me into scrapes  mr standfast said the lady very earnestly if you have any thing to tell me that regards my happiness  for i now begin to suspect you have  do not keep me in this dreadful suspense if on the contrary my husband has entrusted you with any thing and enjoined you not to inform me convince him of your friendship by showing you are worthy of his confidence  good heaven said standfast where is there such another woman to be found  of such nice prudence  such delicate honor what my lord entrusted me with madam he certainly left to my own discretion however as one would think it implied a wish to conceal every thing from you  and yet a breach of confidence where any thing so valuable as your peace of mind is concerned would   by no means interrupted the lady nothing could induce you to forgive yourself  but my dear madam cried standfast finding her curiosity so tardy the thing cannot remain a secret the newspapers will be full of it well sir cried the lady it will then be time enough to tell me what i now plainly see will make me wretched whenever i know it i may not live perhaps till then madam said standfast not live said lady hazard what do you mean surely you forget my appointment said standfast with the gentleman at the smyrna you will not be so mad cried she how returned standfast my honor is engaged and in your cause adieu and if i should fall do me the justice to reflect that my last moments were spent in your service  so saying he ran precipitately down stairs regardless of lady hazard who several times called after him to return she now summoned john into her presence told him to go immediately to the smyrna coffeehouse and desire in her name that mr standfast would come back and that if he saw any mischief going on to call any assistance he could to prevent it  john was scarcely out of sight when lady hazard reflected what a strange errand she had sent him on and was about to ring the bell to dispatch another servant after him when she recollected this would be only making bad worse  thus situated it is impossible to describe what she felt anger for my lord  compassion for standfast  fear for herself intruded all at once on her gentle mind and yet she knew not why  in the midst of this contention she sought for her son with a view in his conversation to alleviate her uneasiness when going into the library the first object that struck her was lord hazard who had gone there in search of standfast nothing could equal their mutual surprise out of which my lord first recovering himself said so madam i am come home you see yes said the lady and before dinner too well cried my lord are you not obliged to me my lord said lady hazard i shall never think myself obliged to you for any conduct of which i dont know the motive pshaw cried my lord you know i hate discontent and i dissimulation said the lady  they were going on in this manner when charles came into the room with a book oh madam said he are you here where is mr standfast i came to show him the prettiest thing i ever met with in my life shall i read it my lord  i am in no reading mood at present said lord hazard read it to me my love answered the lady  charles answered with strong indications of surprise at the looks of his parents i would read it to you but it is in greek however i will tell you the sense of it it is an allegorical allusion to the polity of either a kingdom or a family and given in the way of advice by a sage to a king who had quarrelled with his subjects  there was a river says the author that delighted to expand its smooth surface to the beams of the sun its banks were embossed with verdure it nourished myriads of scaly inhabitants and it glided through the meadows with a placid and majestic grandeur to the surprise and delight of every beholder an unexpected cataract from a neighboring mountain on a sudden dimmed its luster and ruffled its tranquillity till hurried by the overbearing conflux it forced itself into two distinct channels  there murmuring it bemoaned its sad and vagrant fate at last each stream as if by joint consent burst the banks which separated them and they met together in affectionate reconcilement no more to part till divided by the ocean  thus says our author after intestine broils may every kingdom or family endeared by love and loyalty unite and never separate till received into the bosom of fate  chapter iv matter of the same complexion  charles having finished his allegory asked his parents how they liked it lord hazard said he believed there were very few kingdoms or families either that were not subject to such cataracts  charles answered it must then be mismanagement in not properly guarding against them  you are right my dear said his mother but what can be done with inundations that force their way like miners in a town and do mischief in proportion as their source is concealed  perhaps my lord took this as something meant at him for looking very earnestly at his lady he said you are wonderfully sagacious madam and then turning to his son asked what he had done with mr standfast  here john entered the library saying madam i went as your ladyship ordered me but they were gone oh said the lady in great apparent confusion ta  it is  very well john  and when does her ladyship   ladyship answered john first looking at lord hazard and then at his lady  but you say they were gone returned the lady well tell frill i am going to my dressing room yes my lady said john and retired lord continued lady hazard what could i be thinking about what indeed said my lord something one would imagine not altogether so ingenuous by your evident embarrassment my embarrassment answered she recollecting herself and then gathering strength from the consciousness of her integrity no my lord there is nothing disingenuous in me as you shall very easily be convinced when you have shown me all that passes in your own heart so saying she left the room  in my heart muttered my lord why zounds  but seeing charles he restrained himself then endeavoring to give the matter a different turn said with a forced smile i suppose your mother is angry at my going out to breakfast this morning she would be prudent however not to threaten me  here mr standfast came into the room and the moment my lord saw him he exclaimed here i am sound and safe i hope my lord said standfast i dont know that answered the patron but come with me i have a great deal to tell you  the lord and the tutor now walked out of the room and charles returned to his study not however without telling mr standfast he would not allow him to play truant in that manner  the lord told his friend as soon as they were in a room by themselves that not finding colonel tiltly at home he had been to mr snaffles house alone where he was surprised to find that gentleman had been gone out about an hour it being then pretty early and as i knew continued my lord that if he came you would give him a proper answer i sat down to wait his return i had scarcely been there five minutes before his sister came in seeing a stranger as she imagined she would have retired but presently recollecting me she paid me some wellbred acknowledgments for the attention i had the pleasure of paying her last night i answered this civility and gave my visit a turn of enquiring after her health complimenting her at the same time on the little prejudice her fears had done her complexion she lamented her brother was not at home but added that she expected him every minute and begged i would take breakfast  though i knew my hotheaded gentleman would only be still more exasperated at finding me tete a tete with his sister i resolved to accept her invitation nor do i repent of my resolution for i confess to you i never met with a woman more unaffectedly captivating you know standfast i like a sincere candid openness of behavior and it was never more strongly manifested than in the sweet manner of this lovely young creature  in the course of our conversation on the adventure of yesterday evening i learnt the real cause of that strange medley of circumstances which introduced a coolness for the first time between my wife and me gave me a fresh proof of thy kind attachment  here standfast bowed  and brought me in company with the most lovely woman my eyes ever beheld  i was astonished to find myself a great deal more concerned in this business than i imagined though poor thing she little knew it but told me the matter as if to an indifferent person imagining my conduct last night demanded from her every explanation  you must know this brother of hers is rigidly tenacious of his sisters honor for he lies under very great obligations to this baronet who is shortly to be married to her and she on her side partakes so strongly of his generosity that she consents to give her hand to a man she cannot love to pay her brothers debt of gratitude  she told you all this did she my lord said sandfast  oh yes answered my lord she has none of that sordid narrowness of mind the result of vulgar sentiments and mean education she is all candor and frankness oh you may see in a moment she has maintained a high rank in society  well you have been told that the brother very abruptly left his sister and her intended husband in the box and sallied after a gentleman whom he saw coming out on the opposite side this man it seems paid some attention to this sweet girl and was insulting enough knowing their circumstances to propose a settlement this the brother resented and a duel was the consequence but no alarming issue came of it for after a mutual discharge of pistols the seconds interfered and upon a promise given by this gentleman that he would never more presume to address miss snaffle all anger subsided last week however at the masquerade if you recollect you and i paid particular attention to a lovely figure in the dress of a circassian and to confess the truth while you were gone to see after our party i made no scruple to be very free with her seeing her entirely alone and believing her to be one of the frail sisterhood she says indeed i took a number of indecent liberties and faith the fact might be so for we had been drinking a great deal of champaigne all this miss snaffle  for you have seen she was the circassian  related to her brother when he returned from seeing after their carriage  the brother immediately sought after me directed by the description of my dress all over the rooms and i dare say we should have had a tilting bout that evening had i not upon joining you yielded to your pressing entreaty to return home  not finding me they had nothing now for it but conjecture who it could be that had so publicly insulted the lady the suspicion naturally lighted on the gentleman who had before affronted her by his offer of a settlement mr snaffle therefore immediately determined upon an explanation with him whenever they should meet the first time he saw him was last night at the play where he joined him in that sudden manner you have heard of and they went together into the shakespeare here a very singular explanation took place the gentleman informed mr snaffle that he had religiously adhered to the promise made at the conclusion of their quarrel that however he was entirely devoted to the lady and meant to make her honorable proposals the moment he should by the death of a very near relation be released from the restraint which till that event happened would prevent his having so much happiness that being nevertheless unalterably attached to her he determined as far as he decently could to watch her inclinations and being that evening at the masquerade and noticing the particular conduct of a gentleman there  meaning me  had the curiosity to enquire who that gentleman was in which he so well succeeded that i was described as a reformed rake who had married after ruining a whole village  thus you see mr snaffle being told all these particulars no wonder he should accost me in the extraordinary manner he did or that i should find it necessary to make the handsomest apology for my conduct which i was on the point of doing when i considered how awkward it would be to announce myself besides it would then have been necessary to inform the lady of the quarrel which it was easy to see had been carefully concealed from her and again i did not know whether an apology to her might satisfy her brother besides to be ingenuous if i had made a concession and taken my leave it was possible i might never see her again all these considerations determined me still to conceal myself so after a thousand acknowledgments for her condescension i left a message for the brother and hastened home to consult thee  well my lord said standfast i have heard you to an end and once more i caution you not to be imposed upon in the first place it is a very curious thing that the lady this morning should relate her love her poverty and her gratitude and the lord knows what to a gentleman she never saw till last night it puts me too much in mind of one of the histories of those unfortunate poor devils who always begin with  i was a clergymans daughter  faith said my lord scarcely attending to standfast there was one thing escaped her that charmed me said she  i wish i had not gone to that masquerade or else that this lord was not married and a rake  good god cried standfast cannot you see it yet she knew you and said this on purpose she thought it would hit and so it has such a certain shot so well directed but surely my lord it was too gross too palpable too little disguised to pass on you  rather say returned my lord too ingenuous to contain the least shadow of art besides every thing around the place wears the air of sober elegance a handsome house   hired said the tutor for the purpose of gulling your lordship  i cannot conceive said lord hazard what makes you so warm in this business you know the world i acknowledge but give me leave to say i know it too mr standfast  infinitely better said the parson with an inward sneer than i do my lord i am ready to grant but still i am a bystander and as you appear to be playing pretty deep at this game there may be no harm in giving you a caution not to be bubbled  i know thy friendship and anxiety cried my lord but what is there to fear she is a woman of honor and if i was inclined to think of her there is no chance for me besides i give you my word it is not my intention ever to cause lady hazard a moments uneasiness  but surely a beautiful woman may be admired without any offense to a wifes virtue  there my lord said standfast is my hope your heart is my sheet anchor and upon that i trust with comfort for the safety of your honor  enough said my lord it shall never deceive thee nor any one thank you my lord said standfast i am completely satisfied i will not even fear it can deceive itself and now pray what sort of an apology do you mean to make to mr snaffle a full and entire one said my lord he is entitled to it and so is the lady you and i will go together tomorrow morning and i dare say we shall very easily laugh off the whole matter  this being agreed on the conversation turned on lady hazard standfast said he conceived there was some apology due to her my lord did not think so he saw in her conduct all the mysterious inquisitiveness of growing jealousy it was the first time to be sure he had ever been disingenuous with her but circumstances required it he now began to perceive there might be occurrences which would admit of treating her with a sort of laudable duplicity which indeed she ought to be thankful for  but such was the restless and unsatisfied curiosity of wives that he plainly saw she would infallibly construe it into coldness and neglect however he had seen many instances of resigned acquiescence in her duty and therefore he doubted not but this business  the truth of which he was determined to keep a secret  though it might ruffle a little yet it would not destroy their mutual tranquillity  he thought it nevertheless incumbent on him to give the matter some hue of probability the better to appease her at once to do this he told her as if casually at dinner that an affair of honor had called him out in the morning but that fortunately every thing had terminated without bloodshed  the reflection that her husband had escaped such a danger bore down in lady hazards mind all other considerations and she was in a moment perfectly at ease she chid him however for preferring a foolish punctilio of honor to her peace of mind and his own personal safety saying that his courage was too well established to need any such savage and unnecessary proof of it and she wondered a brutal custom should so prevail which far from exhibiting any trait of true honor or real spirit was generally the refuge of sharping knaves and the last resort of desperate cowards  standfast acquiesced in the justice of the remark and lord hazard told her with a smile that had he known she possessed so much spirit he would have engaged her as his second  a silent minute or rather a silent quarter of an hour here ensued which would perhaps have lasted much longer had not the arrival of some company put an end to their different cogitations the subject of which if the reader will but think a little by way of making one it is not impossible but he may be able to guess  as the conversation now took a mixed turn and the general topics of ministers puppetshews sermons plays sceptres washballs lottery tickets loaded dice lords monkies speakers parrots duchesses and drabs were alternately handled with such velocity and vociferation that the parties themselves were all talkers and no hearers  i shall therefore content myself with barely mentioning that while my lord was out of the room mr standfast asked lady hazard when he should have the honor of communicating the result of what sent him to the smyrna  the lady agreed to hear it the next morning at which standfast said that then and every other moment of his life was perfectly at the devotion of her ladyship even though it should be attended with far greater perils than those he had that day encountered  so saying he heaved a profound sigh and joined the company  what shall i say to the reader in this place for so far from relieving him from that suspense into which i have so completely thrown him it is certainly my intention to heighten it  but however there is a remedy for such as are over impatient for if the tenterhooks on which i have set them prick too hard they have nothing to do but dip a few pages forward and they will find them as easy as a cushion  chapter iv where the reader being a little relieved from one embarrassment will be thrown into another  no sooner had the complicated din of itinerant retailers opened the eyes or rather the ears of the servants  for they were yet only half awake  in that square where lord hazard resided than that nobleman left the partner of his bed to seek after standfast who was suddenly awoke by a servant from a nap into which he had fallen about half an hour before for the pious preceptor had been exercising that portion of his religious duty called watching the greater part of the night  in fact the subject which occupied his thoughts was of so complicate and nice a kind that he had been turning it in his mind with much care and attention and after looking at it in every possible situation  rejecting this expedient adopting that and at last fairly satisfying himself as to the measures to be taken  he had fallen asleep just at the very instant when phoebus awoke and walked abroad to cheer the world inspire poets and engender animalculae three employments according to some philosophers equally material  mr standfast understanding that his patron required his presence now only muttered those curses which he before had been thundering against the footman in a few minutes he joined lord hazard whom he found full of impatience and anxiety  my lord said he wanted to have five minutes conversation with him previous to their intended business that morning adding that he must heartily confess he wished for a pretext for continuing his visits at mr snaffles and that he could think of nothing but the sister  my lord said standfast i am sorry to see this it can end but one way good god that this siren should get such hold of you in a moment  why the most inexperienced of your adventures at little hockley was prudence to this  he had scarcely spoken when lady hazard came abruptly into the room addressing herself to her husband she said my lord i know not how you will receive the over anxious solicitude of a wife whose uniform study has been to administer to your wishes but i am impelled by an irresistible something to entreat that the horrid coolness you have shown me ever since that strange business at the playhouse may be fully explained may be done away that so the tranquillity which reigned in this family till that unhappy moment and pointed us out as fit and worthy objects for imitation may be restored to us  i know not what you mean said my lord  you are a charming woman i dote on you  therefore make yourself easy and trust to the truth of my affection  heaven forbid i should doubt it said the lady but be assured the best affections are too often endangered by the slightest misunderstandings i believe we have all three a great deal to confess to each other and i came to encourage you both by frankly acknowledging all i know and all i conjecture relative to the most extraordinary and most unpleasant business i ever yet experienced at the same time my lord let me say i have no idle curiosity to indulge no whim to gratify no foolish feminine fears that alarm me not even the slightest want of confidence in your lordships lavish love or firm fidelity  i honestly and sacredly believe that nothing could shake either  but as an artful train of flattering concurrent circumstances might give them strong as they are some slight inclination to pause i think it my duty to endeavor what i can to sustain them to hold them securely where they ought and where i am sure they wish invariably to fix  my lord paid his lady a very elegant and i believe a very sincere compliment on her intentions attachment affection sense of duty and right conception of that exquisite charm in a wifes conduct who is never officiously solicitous but ever on the watch to please he remarked however that the breakfast would interrupt nothing  here standfast interfering said that at breakfast charles would necessarily make one of the party which he apprehended was not lady hazards wish he therefore proposed to defer it till the evening or some other time which the lady peremptorily declared she could not consent to indeed she pressed so hard for a hearing that very morning that standfast at the instance of my lord hazard undertook to set his pupil a task in the library immediately after breakfast when it was agreed that the conversation should be resumed  perhaps mr standfast was glad of a moments pause he certainly betrayed evident symptoms of astonishment at the first part of lady hazards harrangue which added to an affected indifference and a forced sprightliness would have conveyed to an uninterrupted bystander a trait or two of suspicion that the ladys conduct was not altogether agreeable to him but we have already hinted that he never suffered long under perturbation of any kind thus whatever inward sensations might produce the above effects they certainly did not remain visible long enough to be noticed either by the lord or the lady and with the assistance of summoning his pupil to breakfast he had so rallied his spirits that he appeared the most cheerful and unconcerned of the whole company  it was far otherwise with my lord he set it down for a certainty that his lady had by some means discovered all that had past and divined all that was likely to come nevertheless he felt no reluctance to review his intentions either in one light or the other but certain nameless sensations which he felt in spite of himself gave his behavior an awkwardness which was apparent in proportion as he endeavored to hide it  charles was no sooner informed by his father that he had some particular business with mr standfast and given his task than he retired to the library when the lady after an apology much in the style of the former one acquainted her husband with all she knew relative to this strange affair not even omitting either the insult she had received the morning before the spirited kindness of standfast or the message she had sent after him to the smyrna which last business clearly accounted for her consusion in the library when john came back whom she also loaded with praises in which standfast joined declaring at the same time that the hiring of that worthy fellow was a new instance that lord hazards knowledge of the world and judgment of mankind was superior to his for that john had what he thought a forbidding countenance which his lordship however with a penetration far beyond his had construed into a sign of bluntness and plain dealing but madam said standfast i interrupt you  the lady went on saying that her husbands new and extraordinary conduct had first given her the alarm in addition to this a servant had been privy to the treatment she had received from the baronet at the theater again he who ought to have protected her was out of the way when mr standfast stepped forward in her defense in short such concealments and such obligations were very repugnant to her delicacy which she hoped his lordship in this case would conceive was not affected or overstrained my lord she added was the proper person to reward the servant and thank mr standfast who though a gentleman in years and perfectly exemplary in his manners was by no means a proper confident for her who thought it her first happiness to have no wish or thought concealed from her husband  lord hazard passed some very high compliments on the frankness kindness and great propriety of his ladys declaration and conduct he owned he thought the business of the baronet perfectly inexplicable but these and all other considerations were swallowed up in the obligations he thought himself under to standfast who took all these compliments with the same composure as he would have received his salary or any thing else which he conceived to be perfectly his own property  his lordship desired this worthy friend as he called him to relate the issue of his meeting the baronet at the smyrna but standfast remarked that the harvest of domestic tranquillity this discovery promised belonged entirely to his lordship and the amiable lady hazard that at best he was but a privileged gleaner who saw but envied not that abundant happiness which kindly let fall as much comfort as he desired and more infinitely more than he deserved  he therefore begged to come in his place besides added he totally ignorant as your lordship is of the motives of these people for stirring up all this mischief your story cannot but involve some awkwardness which my after explanation may relieve for i fancy the baronet has made me more au fait to this business than either of you  his lordship taking this as a friendly hint of the tutor to clear up any embarrassment that might arise in his narrative consented to unfold it is but truth to say that his relation was not so ingenuous as that of his lady had been for he did not mention the cause of the quarrel nor that it yet existed but on the contrary said that the whole was a mistake the brother having taken him for another person who had it seems offered an insult to the sister and that every thing was amicably made up he sunk entirely the circumstance of his having seen miss snaffle the day before he also forbore to touch on his intention of paying that lady a second visit and indeed on any one point that could give the smallest reason for conjecture that the whole was any other than a matter of a common cursory kind which in proportion as it was mysterious so it sunk to nothing the mystery being cleared away he was very much alive however to all those matters relative to sir daniel dogbolt  he hoped his friend would be able to clear them up for after all he should not consider that part of the business at an end without a full and explicit satisfaction for the insult his wife had sustained in his absence  i am heartily sorry you were absent said standfast proud as i was of chastising his insolence it was certainly your right  lord hazard acknowledged his obligations and proceeded to finish his account of this business in which upon the whole he so well succeeded that lady hazard declared she was except a little remaining curiosity perfectly satisfied  now came the tutors turn he began with saying he had a much longer tale to tell than either of them and that since he was not then bound by the painful duty which had hitherto punctiliously kept him from divulging it he thought himself obliged openly and without reserve to declare all he knew on the subject but added he i believe my lord they are too artful a set for us to place any reliance on what they tell us what i am going now to inform you i forced from the pretty baronet  if he be one  who had the unparalleled insolence to insult this lady for which  and i hope your lordship will not blame my too forward zeal i had the honor of calling him to account  standfast here received the compliments he had once more fished for and then went on not without first exclaiming heavens why my lord a perfect stranger would have been entitled to the assistance i gave much less her ladyship a mere common exercise of humanity besides the gentleman gave me very little trouble he fences pretty well but i soon disarmed him and having his life in my power i made use of this opportunity of extorting from him an account of himself and his associates he said he had long secretly admired lady hazard that he had tried many experiments to get an opportunity of disclosing his passion but found none which had the smallest appearance of feasibility till about three weeks ago at the masquerade where you may remember we were in a very large party  good god cried lady hazard i recollect it a man certainly did teaze me at the masquerade but i took it for some drunken fool and never gave the matter a second thought  he told me said standfast he first accosted your lordship drew you away from your company and introduced you to another that he might have better opportunity to entertain her ladyship his words were that he had found an impregnable fortress and therefore from that moment determined to give up the attack but accident introducing him into the same box at the playhouse his wishes revived and resolving to make use of the occasion that presented itself through mr snaffles quarrel with the gentleman in the opposite box he dropped him in the crowd and returned to lady hazard just as your lordship had gone to conduct miss snaffle to her coach he confessed that to ingratiate himself he had told her ladyship several falsities such as that you my lord had an intimacy with miss snaffle that you were then gone home with her all which we have already heard in short first making him answer many other questions i gave him his life and suffered him to leave me after he had protested in the most solemn manner that he would never dare to mention the name of this lady in future upon any account whatever  well my lord these are the facts now hear my comments on them this man is not a baronet neither is he upon the point of marrying this young lady nor are they any other than three sharpers who have in some way or other a dark plot on the conjugal peace of your worthy lady and yourself this sir daniel did draw you aside from your company and introduced you to this very miss snaffle with what design is another matter but it is very extraordinary you should be left by this baronet with his intended wife that he might the better introduce himself to lady hazard  nor am i mistaken as to the lady for i heard a chair called in her name  you cannot forget my lord that we at that time decided that she was a woman of no character i remember your saying with great earnestness standfast let us not pay lady hazard so ill a compliment as to speak to a creature of this stamp  though she is under the same roof with her  well my lord can it be after what i have said that this is a woman of honor that her brother is a man of the nicest feelings and that sir daniel dogbolt is on the point of marriage with this woman no my lord it is as i said a plot against you however thank heaven armed with a proper confidence in each other you may despise it  mr standfast has placed this matter in its true light said the lady for my part i am perfectly at ease and i am sure my lord will thank me for waving all absurd delicacy and coming to this declaration  here several suitable remarks were made mr standfast was loaded with thanks and the most perfect harmony was restored after this the lady retired to her dressing room and left the two friends together  they were no sooner alone than lord hazard began anew to compliment and thank mr standfast that gentleman assured his patron his thanks were more than he deserved and indeed he spoke truth however no one upon earth could have bell eved his conduct to be any other than cordial zeal and sincere friendship conformable to which appearances he said he would not leave his lordship till he had made him a firm promise not to see that woman any more who he must now very plainly perceive was a suborned wretch to assist in some vile plot against his domestic peace  my lord did not hesitate to make this promise for he was charmed with the angellike conduct of his lady and went so far as to say that seeing the matter now in the same light with the tutor he felt himself at ease with relation to sir daniel dogbolt as well as the rest standfast hearing this and being told that his kindness should not go unremembered went with the greatest air of satisfaction to seek his pupil  as the single articles in my account with the reader begin again to be pretty numerous i shall now for his satisfaction add them up and carry them over to speak without metaphor mr standfast please to unmask  the preceptor then had in conjunction with viney concerted this whole scheme the masquerade the playhouse the interview and every other part of it was as regularly digested as the trial of a felon before he comes to the bar at the old bailey mr viney had tutored the gentleman and mrs oshocknesy had instructed the lady  standfast however who had contrived the whole plot was totally unknown to any of the actors in it his argument with viney and mrs oshocknesy was that as they enjoyed the utmost they ever could expect from lord hazard they had no measures to keep with him especially as ever so violent a rupture could not deprive either him of his living or her of her annuity on the contrary that he standfast might in a moment lose both his salary and his expectations which were not trifles he therefore stipulated not to be seen at all but in their privy council and instructions were particularly given to the under villains to be more cautious in deceiving him than any other of the family  this master stroke could be worthy of no other than standfast to teach his tools to look upon him as their enemy secured him from all possibility of detection for he knew he might laugh at the resentment of viney even if he had any cause to suspect him of treachery his own ipfe dixit being always sufficient to overturn any thing of that kind with his patron nay notwithstanding this information the reader is almost obliged to confess that he is innocent for his conduct gives the lie direct even to what i have advanced of him it is very true that we have seen him act the part of a disinterested friend we have heard him counsel lord hazard to shun that very plot he himself had laid for him and one would think he had so far succeeded against himself  if i may be allowed the expression  that these swindlers in love seem to be turned out of employ the gentlemen to hunt other game at the hazard table or perhaps on the highway and the lady to ruin apprentices or gull libidinous elders  if the reader thinks thus of mr standfast he is not yet half acquainted with that consummate fabricator of domestic ruin a simple intrigue and the common incidental train of disquietude attending it would not have been a luxury inexorable enough for him in short mr standfast put on your mask again for we will not see your naked heart till we are prepared to pronounce by a knowledge of the species of destruction it meditates  that in the round of human conception there is not so shocking a piece of deformity as a complete hypocrite  chapter vi several letters more plot and intrigue and some of it from a very unexpected quarter  the day on which this eclaircissement took place was distinguished by the cheerfulness that sat on every countenance indeed so remarkable was the prevalent good humor that mr standfast was heartily joined by a great deal of company who dined at my lords when he ventured an opinion that hazard house had the only roof in town that could boast of a couple perfectly elegant and perfectly happy i do not pretend to assert that this declaration was truth i only say the company then present allowed it to be so  my lord would not read a single letter  for many were that day brought him  lest it should give a tinge of dissatisfaction that might check the general hilarity they were all ordered to be laid in the study and it was agreed that he and standfast should look them over the next morning  the whole day being like a smooth sea which looked the more beautiful for having been a little ruffled we will glide over it as too uniform for any striking remarks and come to the next which was a little more agitated  as soon as breakfast was over his lordship and standfast according to agreement retired to examine the letters these were seven in number and as four of them in some degree relate to this history i shall insert them together with the remarks of their examiners indeed it was once in my head to have given this whole history through that vehicle but i considered that making my personages retire to their closets before they disclosed their sentiments would have thrown a frigidity over the business besides the unavoidable necessity of relating every thing two or three times over and always partially besides i may introduce some characters who cannot write and others who will not mr standfast for instance would not have been possessed of half the cunning i have given him if any thing could have induced him to disclose his sentiments upon paper  upon reflection therefore i was determined not to follow a method however fashionable by which i must have made villains confide their vices and young ladies their wishes  which if they felt delicately they would find difficult to express at all much less in a letter  to their confidants and clerks of the roads  all such matters considered i have left these pennypost men in biography to themselves contented to jog on an old road where what the prospects want of trimming and regulation will i trust be made up in simple and natural luxuriance but to the letters under examination letter i to the right hon lord hazard my lord the letter i now send you is accompanied by one from your son who is determined to choose a guardian  being eighteen years of age  unless you intend to do him more justice  you have withdrawn your protection from him in favor of your darling charles whom the virtuous mr standfast is training in the paths of honor  i shall forbear to reflect on either him you your lady or her offspring it is enough that i know you all i only ask at present  which will determine to whom my son shall look in future as a protector  that you will make over to me that part of the estate in warwickshire which includes the mansion and the farm contiguous to it in which case neither zekiel nor i shall be further troublesome to you but contentedly make his two hundred a year and my three serve us till that happy moment when it shall please fate to unite your lordly bones to the skins of your ancestors  i am etc gertrude oshocknesy     standfast having thanked the lady for her glance at him and my lord having laughed heartily at the good natured reflection on his extraction in the latter part of the letter they passed on to the next which contained what follows letter ii to the right hon lord hazard my lord and father for so i believe you are at least you could not prove to the contrary and that is enough for me to know i shall inherit in spite of my brother charles but however as i dont want to be undutiful i shall only tell you this i am sick of eton i would rather follow a pack of hounds and so do you see i have desired mother to make you a proposial concerning warwickshire if so be you like to agree to it its very well if not i am determined to look out for a guardian being now as a body may say pretty far gone toward years of discretion so i remain  your dutiful son and servant to command rust     what could a guardian do said my lord  faith be very troublesome replied standfast these estates in tail without right of waste are of all legal niceties the best morsel for a litigious stomach as to what the lady and her son want your lordship knows best whether it is worth contending for but i think i would not be bullied out of any thing  well we will consider what is to be done said his lordship in the mean time let us to the next so saying he opened another letter which came by the post and was written by sir sidney roebuck these were the contents letter iii to the right hon lord hazard my lord i take the liberty to write to you concerning your village of little hockley which since the absence of your lordship and the death of major malplaquet has risen to such maturity in singular and enormous vice as i sincerely hope cannot be paralleled  i have been obliged to be at the pains of exerting myself very strenuously in my capacity of magistrate but smugglers marauders and other lawless characters for whom this vile place is become a remarkable asylum are difficult to deal with my first idea was in conjunction with the members for the county to beg the interference of parliament but conceiving that much delicacy was due to your lordship in this business i beg previously to consult you  if you will treat for the village or should that be incompatible with the conditions of your inheritance if you will lease it to me perhaps i may be able to bring about a reformation  i have no doubt but your lordship will rejoice in forwarding a work so dear to the interest of humanity and should be happy to receive your immediate answer as i wish to make some arrangements at castlewick agreeable to the result of this application before i attend my duty at the house when i shall have the honor to call on your lordship with a view to a further conference on this subject  i am my lord your lordships most obedient servant s w roebuck     lord hazard as i formerly mentioned received his rents regularly from his steward and therefore did not dream of the enormities carried on at little hockley he now first reflected that these seeds of vice he had himself sown and as wickedness like weeds flourishes best where there are no wholesome plants to interrupt its growth he easily perceived and felt the truth of sir sidneys relation and therefore determined to acquaint him that he was as well disposed as himself to perfect so desirable an undertaking and that he should be glad to see him for that purpose  after examining another letter or two they came to the following one letter iv to the right hon lord hazard my lord as you have thought proper to take no notice of what passed the other evening when i had the honor of calling your lordship scoundrel i suppose you acquiesce in the justice of the term  i shall therefore in future speak of you as of a wretch deserving pity and though a lord beneath the notice of a gentleman  i am etc peter snaffle     oh said my lord this is too shocking to pass i must break the fellows bones  rather get a chairman to do it said standfast did not you wait at the rascals house two hours where was he all that time no no they think you begin to smell the matter out and so are grown desperate does not all this confirm my suspicions  but still said my lord there is something cursedly unpleasant in letting such a scoundrel go on with impunity i am determined continued he to give him manuel chastisement wherever i meet him  not at all cried standfast till he has established his credentials to dispute a point of honor with your lordship well well perhaps you are right said my lord you generally see things very properly let us talk no more of the damned fellow he has set my blood in a ferment  the conversation was interrupted by a note from ingot in the city with whom  as the reader formerly heard from mr standfast  lord hazard sometimes banked the letter was concerning the transfer of some stock and other business on which he required to see his lordship at an early opportunity and my lord as he was anxious to advise with counsel what was best to be done with mrs oshocknesy and her son thought he could not take a properer time than the present  as his lordship went alone into the city he had leisure to revolve in his mind the various business of the day and in particular the subject of the letter from snaffle which he did not enter into much before mr standfast knowing that an inclination to indulge his feelings would meet with every possible opposition from that careful friend  at the same time however that he gave standfast credit for the goodness of his intentions he could not help thinking the conjectures of that gentleman rather prescient than wise careful than certain what was all this mighty business why truly a hotheaded fellow had insulted him with great acrimony and written to him with great impertinence what were standfasts ideas of this matter that a plot was laid to disturb his domestic repose in truth it appeared so by the assault on his lady and looked something like it by the tempting opportunity that had been given him of addressing a very beautiful woman well it was so perhaps in that case the proper check had been given to the first and as to the latter he could see no ruinous consequences that would ensue even were they to carry their scheme into execution he could not be drawn into a marriage and therefore an intrigue was the worst that could be apprehended this it was his business to avoid and he certainly should do so but was this any reason why he must put up with a most provoking and impudent affront no no he must beg leave to understand the etiquette of his own honor as well as mr standfast he was no school boy and therefore took the liberty to dissent from the necessity of having his actions eternally inspected and as to the affront which he neither could nor would brook a proper time should certainly be taken to resent it  lord hazard had now arrived to that very pitch where standfast wished to conduct him the tutor knew that no longer to confide in him was the only way to keep him safe from all consequences he waited with malicious joy for the moment when the patron would voluntarily exclaim oh that i had taken thy advice oh that thy salutary counsel had been followed  and i say to the reader woe be to lord hazard if ever the moment should arrive when such an exclamation shall be necessary but at present let us change the scene  in the course of his lordships business with mr ingot a lady passed through the room whom he remarked spoke nothing but french for there were two gentlemen with her one of whom told mr ingot in very broken english that the lady wished him a good morning  after they were gone ingot told my lord that there was something singular in the ladys story which had been so interwoven with a business concerning money he had been recommended to transact for her that he could not but be perfectly acquainted with it  my lord who had never any improper curiosity seemed very indifferent about hearing it saying there were family matters in it not proper to be divulged  ingot assured my lord that was not the case at all on the contrary he should tell it to every one he knew because it placed in a more glaring point of view the scandalous traffic and shameful selling and buying of consciences among the papists a sect it seems for which mr ingot had a great inveteracy than any instance that had ever come within his knowledge  my lord smiled and mr ingot continued  this lady when she was very young having unfortunately an intrigue with a stranger her father had a great aversion to she was secluded in a convent but what convent her lover never could learn after some time being persuaded by her friends that her enamorato had played her false she was prevailed on to take the veil and shut herself up as every one thought for ever  about a year and a half ago her father died in england having long repented of his daughters ill treatment and made a will leaving her his whole fortune all vested in the english funds mind the conditions to be spent in france half for her own use and half in pious donations  provided a dispensation of her vow could be obtained but in default of this to go to english charities  here was manifest the cunning of the frenchman he thought and rightly too the pious donations in france would procure interest enough to obtain the dispensation of her vow ay ay the pope shall make a bargain with any jew in dukesplace  the dispensation was obtained with this single proviso  which indeed grasped at the whole fortune  that she should live pensioner in the same convent with liberty to go out when she pleased  these terms the lady accepted and giving security for her return she was permitted to come to england in company with a person deputed by the convent to arrange her fathers affairs this she has now done and in a week or ten days will return to france  an extraordinary business indeed said lord hazard yes yes replied ingot with great archness the church of rome never fails to stretch its prerogative when interest is in the case how happy are we who live under the three estates and the protestant religion  spoken as a citizen should speak said my lord poor lady i dare say she rejoices at her escape from captivity what does she think of england  oh she knows nobody here cried ingot except one gentleman she has not enquired for a single creature how she came to know him is a mystery to me it is sir sidney roebuck i have promised to find him out for her if he be in town then i can tell you mr ingot that he is not answered my lord i received a letter from him this very morning which induces me to think it will be a fortnight first as he only talks of coming up by the meeting of parliament well well she will not see him then cried ingot  it is no great matter i suppose  here the conversation drew to an end the lord testifying great pleasure at the ladys emancipation from confinement and the citizen reprobating the folly of immuring healthy young girls who ought to increase their species and produce soldiers and sailors and thanking his stars that he did not live under the influence of an italian priest not half so good a citizen as himself a fellow who because he wore a triple crown could roast and barbecue any of his peaceable subjects whenever he pleased the better to confiscate their fortunes  chapter vii the last subject followed up  a letter from emma and other important matter  that very afternoon lord hazard wrote an answer to sir sidneys letter the receipt of which gave the baronet such satisfaction that it hastened his journey to town where in a few days he arrived for his concerns were always in so regular a state that he could at any time leave them with very short preparation and lady roebuck who was of all women living the properest wife for such a man never required much warning to follow him through all his duties for such he conceived every one of his pursuits it was a duty to discharge all trusts to answer all letters to return all visits but then he took care to undertake nothing but what he could conveniently do to receive no visits but from those he liked and to reject all unnecessary or impertinent correspondents it was also with him a duty to be merry and to make others so and he could with equal ease  ay and without any deviation from his illustrious extraction which i have already said he was pretty proud of  walk a minuet with a duchess on a birthnight or crack a facetious jest with a cobbler he might be termed an elegant oddity and to his peculiarities for they were all amiable did his lady accommodate herself  before they set out it was agreed to leave the faithful emma with little annette who had nearly reached her fourteenth year and was grown a most beautiful young creature lady roebuck loved her with an interesting and lively tenderness she had watched her growing perfections with at least maternal care for had she been twenty times her own daughter she could not have paid more attention to her education or felt more pleasure at those dawning accomplishments with which she promised to be remarkably gifted  emma said she had perused her little mind with profound attention and though she was no further than the introduction it was prefaced with a promise of such delightful matter as could not fail to charm the hearts of all readers she could discern that the subject was interesting the moral instructive and that goodness and virtue were strongly inculcated in every page  annette and emma then and the whole village of castlewick were left under the care of the good mildman who had not suffered at all in the opinion of sir sidney for having been turned into a scarecrow for the amusement of the hockleyites  sir sidney and his lady arrived in town at the period above mentioned and a card was almost instantly dispatched to lord hazard purporting that the baronet intended to pay him a visit in a day or two to talk over the business of little hockley  the peer and the baronet soon came to an eligible agreement and as leases and title deeds were obliged to be consulted in great plenty during the course of this negotiation a sort of cordiality grew between the lessor and lessee sir sidney acknowledged there was great fairness and candor in the conduct of the peer and facetiously remarked he was glad to see so good an understanding between the upper and lower house as to my lord he looked up to sir sidney as a being of a superior kind and while he penetrated his amiable and benignant views his only wonder was that every man of ample possessions did not do the same since his reward was so certain and so immense  the ladies who i have more than once remarked were to their husbands what an echo is to the voice had also commenced something more than an acquaintance which both the husbands strongly recommended indeed this intimacy had well nigh brought about a breach of the bargain between lord hazard and sir sidney for the latter had proposed to the peer to wave signing the writings and take upon himself the arrangements of little hockley however whether my lord felt the superiority of sir sidneys qualifications for such an undertaking whether he thought it ridiculous to expect a harvest of virtue where he had only planted vice whatever in short was the motive he agreed only to return to warwickshire with sir sidney and give him possession of his bargain by which means the families would pass some months in the society of each other  even this was some acquisition and sir sidney in hopes of enticing his lordship to follow his example eagerly catched at the proposal schemes of pleasure to be executed in the following spring and summer engrossed much of their conversation besides lady hazard was with child and it was thought the country would be likely to restore her strength after she should have lain in for she was in general very ill upon those occasions and had never since charles had a child  though she had borne in all four  that did not after its birth pine away and at length die  pleasures were also chalked out for charles and annette who was understood to be sir sidneys daughter by a former marriage but that her mother died abroad and the baronet did not spare to hint that an union between the prince and princess of the two rival villages might perhaps cement the general amnesty between all parties  it will be easily seen that standfast felt awkward in this society he too well knew lady roebucks prudence to suppose that she had acquainted sir sidney with any of his tricks and as there seemed no coolness on the part of the baronet these conjectures were confirmed thus supposing the business would be concluded in a short time between his patron and sir sidney he was so far perfectly at ease but when he found the ladies were to be consulted he trembled for the consequence how to act suppose he tried to prevent their meeting but that was dangerous and difficult he once thought of hinting at a distance that something had actually passed between him and the lady which if credited would account for any rancour in her but upon maturer reflection any of these would be to desert his own grand principle which was to be always prepared with expedients but never to use them except in cases of emergency it would be enough to defend himself when he should be attacked and all things considered since the lady had evidently kept the grand point a secret from sir sidney it was possible though barely so that she would not tattle to any one else yet that cursed female vanity  in short the gentlemans combat with himself continued a considerable while till at length the result was that he should make an excuse to go out of town for a month and by that means gather from lord hazards letters what was going forward besides he had another reason for taking this resolution  indeed he had several reasons  which will in due time appear to the reader  so having imparted his intention to my lord and got permission for charles to accompany him the tutor and the pupil set out for the west of england where business of a particular nature demanded their presence  thus most of the arrangements before related passed in the absence of standfast and charles whom as their excursion has something remarkable in it we will join after i have related a matter that cursorily passed between the two ladies  they were talking of annette and lady sidney who was by no means ashamed of confessing so much of the truth as saved the honor of miss le clerc mentioned the matter exactly as it happened simply with the addition of their being privately married but said lady hazard are you sure that the mother is dead sure said lady roebuck what doubt can there be of that besides at any rate she is dead to the world perhaps not said the other lady good god have you any reason for what you say cried lady roebuck lady hazard here made a very serious apology for her imprudence saying the great similarity between the story she had heard from her ladyship and one recently told her by my lord had struck her so forcibly that she had unwarily betrayed herself into those unguarded expressions  this redoubled lady roebucks anxiety and she entreated in the most earnest manner to know what all this mystery meant nay said lady hazard if it be as i conjecture it must be known for the lady is determined to see sir sidney before she leaves england who  what lady  cried her friend for heavens sake keep me no longer in suspense  lady hazard seeing she had advanced so far made no scruple of relating the whole story as ingot told it to my lord from first to last when she had finished lady roebuck asked the name of the lady which her friend confessed she did not know but said that it would be very easy to satisfy themselves by sending to mr ingot  this was scarcely agreed on before lady roebuck received a letter from her handmaid emma which the reader shall have in her own words to lady roebuck madam you would not have heard from me so soon again but for a circumstance which wears so much the air of a romance that had it not been well certified i could not have believed it  but dark and mysterious are the ways of providence puzzled with mazes and perplexed with errors as says my and mr voltaires favorite cato  a lady called here who cried over miss annette and has left a crucifix and several popish relics which i cannot say pleased me for i have hated the roman catholics ever since i read the account of the massacre of the hugunots upon the feast of st bartholomew as to the holy war some of the kings of england were concerned in that and therefore i shall not be so wanting in loyalty as to mention it else i could a tale unfold  but to return to the lady there were two french gentlemen with her one of whom in very bad broken english told me that he believed she had an important commission to execute but he did not know the purport of it i wish i had understood french i would have made her all her pilgrimage relate as faithfully as othello did his after she was gone which was not till the gentleman had kissed both my cheeks i questioned miss concerning their conversation and she informed me that the lady was that very same she used to call mamma le clerc in the convent the jewels she has left are for sir sidney and as she had not the pleasure of seeing him she did not think proper to leave a packet of papers but said she would endeavor to find him in town and there deliver it to him  lord my dear lady what can be the meaning of all this miss annette was so confused and terrified and indeed she did not understand her very well for they spoke it seems a different sort of french our young lady having polished hers and that of the stranger being a good deal provincial but as i said dear misss confusion  though very learned writers have doubted whether this admits of a genetive case and therefore as i am proud to yield to great authorities i ought to say the confusion of miss  was so great that she had not the courage to ask many questions so i entreated her to go back and speak to the french lady again who appeared greatly surprised to find that sir sidney was married and when miss annette at my desire asked if she was her mother she replied that your ladyship was now the only mother to whom she owed any duty that she hoped you would treat her kindly and that miss would repay you with gratitude  my sweet little charge is very well and comes on surprisingly i entreated her not to write on this subject till i had your advice her letter could not avoid falling into sir sidneys hands this will seem only to concern household affairs and as the poet says escape the scythe by being low   i hate a falsity but without a little laudable deceit how can we guard against the evils of life  minerva thought duplicity so necessary in the conduct of her favorite ulysses that she condescended to teach him that heroic quality herself  i beg to know my worthy lady how i am to act in this affair and be assured in respect of all the requisite feminine virtues no emma  from priors nutbrown maid to emma corbet can have a more extensive and proper sense than  your very humble and most grateful handmaid emma distich     this letter seemed to clear up the whole business and it being upon enquiry found that the name of the lady his lordship saw at mr ingots house was le clerc lady roebuck did not balance a moment in her mind as to the probability of her being the mother of annette  in this exigence she consulted lady hazard on what conduct she ought to pursue who being as we have seen no friend to duplicity though even of that laudable kind recommended by emma advised her without delay to inform sir sidney of the whole truth telling her she had wonderfully well succeeded with her lord by the same mode of experiment within the last fortnight  this brought forward the story of miss snaffle which the reader has seen so fully investigated and which not being told without the highest encomiums on mr standfasts attachment and integrity and an information that his lordship had settled an additional annuity on him lady roebuck testified the greatest surprise which lady hazard perceiving said you may well shudder at the worlds villainy i wish i could prevail with my lord to embrace sir sidneys offer that i might live always with you in retirement  lady roebuck whose shudderings had been at hearing of standfasts great influence in the family was upon the point of saying something which might have led to an investigation of his conduct not very favorable to that gentleman but finding lady hazard had given her surprise another motive she contented herself for the present with falling in with that ladys conjectures and simply remarking that indeed the expectations of villains were so inadequate to the pains they took and the risks they run that she wondered men became knaves to be infamous when by only being honest they might be happy  chapter viii the hero cleared a little from the cobwebs of the library  i make no scruple to confess that my leaving the business of miss le clerc and the possibility of standfasts detection in such a state of uncertainty as they appeared to be at the end of the last chapter is taking a liberty with the reader and what is worse with the ladies but the consideration of having so long forborne to introduce my hero who by the way would be the last to excuse me for being guilty of the smallest incivility to the fair sex has got the better of all others  for indeed the circumstances in this history are so various and follow in such quick succession that really if i do not use some expedition to bring him forward i might as well have no hero at all just so far however i have nothing to reproach myself with for though hitherto he has said very little i can assure the reader he has thought a great deal to what purpose will hereafter appear at present i shall proceed to the examination of his good and bad qualities a portion of each  for i am afraid there is nothing perfect in this world  he certainly had and having cleared away the shores and made every other proper preparation  for we may well give him fair play  fairly launch him on the ocean of life where we shall see him steming many adverse gales of fortune in which it will be difficult to determine whether most to admire his distress or his fortitude  i certainly had some apprehensions that having suffered a fourth part of this work to pass without approaching to such a necessary business the reader might perhaps be given to imagine that i called charles hazard the hero out of facetiousness and merely by inference and deduction and so use him as a painter does a layman which stands in all the attitudes bears the helmet drapery or poll parrot of the hero or heroine and yet though he play this respectable part is never known personally to the spectators  to say the truth i have often been wickedly inclined to wish that many heroes i have met with in my life had been so dealt with and it is not impossible but some of my readers may retort the courtesy for it so happens that particular people find in these said heroes particular qualities which generally being adventitious it is fifty to one if a heromaker thinks of them and in the absence of these qualities though the gentleman should be possessed of ever so long a catalogue of real and permanent virtues he sinks to a nonentity in the opinion of such critics because he does not happen to be enlivened with their favorite animating principle  i cannot give a stronger instance of what i have advanced than by producing the names of two of the greatest men in their way that ever lived  i mean alexander of macedon the great warrior and alexander of twickenham the great poet  alexander the warrior would not have given threepence for all the noisy applause and bellowing acclamations of the largest populace that ever assembled if they had not hailed him son of jupiter and alexander the poet  according to dr johnson  continually made himself wretched lest the world should fancy him to be the son of nobody yet i appeal to any one if the fighting hero had been the offspring of a beggar and the writing hero the heir of a king whether one would have cut throats or the other lisped numbers in greater perfection neither of these could conquer his favorite foible which it is admirable to remark proceeded in the warrior from hope and in the poet from fear this imaginary honor in one and blot in the other nothing could efface for vainly did alexanders mother ridicule the preposterous folly of her son saying hush hush my dear boy you dont consider you are bringing me into a scrape for if you talk so loud about being the son of jupiter you will make juno angry with me  and equally unsuccessful were the efforts of popes friends who it is said told him it was ridiculous to lament that he was the son of a tradesman when the father of eschines the socratic philosopher was but a sausagemaker  a hundred instances may be adduced perhaps a thousand to prove upon what cobweb qualities the very essence of a hero often depends but none i believe can be found stronger than those i have given let us then settle the dispute in this way let all matters relative to charles hazard which are totally dependant upon chance be considered as out of his power to alter or amend and all qualities good bad or indifferent which are the result of his serious reflections be understood as his act and deed and censured or praised accordingly  charles had been left from his infancy in the quiet and unwearied pursuit of every useful and elegant accomplishment all these advantages had been procured for him at home under a tutor who certainly had some taste and a father who had more both of whom were perfectly well satisfied with his progress his ardour had been so unremitting that perfection by the help of perseverence seemed to be within his reach i therefore left him to himself for why should i interrupt him in the midst of so laudable a career  especially when those very advantages are good recommendations to the reader  having untied him however a little from his mothers apron strings i shall now fairly trust him to the bent of his inclination  and this for several good reasons  one is that my veracity as a historian obliges me to it for standfast declared to viney before he set out  first indeed giving him some other instructions  he should try what mettle the youngster was made of  charles was at this time something more than seventeen so that he took the field young as did his namesake of sweden he was not however at all like that great man in any respect except indeed that no charles the twelfth upon earth could be a more rigid observer of his word for as the swedish charles could never be persuaded by any body the english charles placed an implicit faith in every body and as the fighting hero hated the sight of a woman the scientific hero was charmed with every woman he saw  charles  for there is no hiding it  was very amorous and very credulous his credulity however was not of that kind begot by adulation upon impudence he was too modest to be vain but when a plausible appeal was made to the softness of his manners the strength of his sensibility or the excellence of his heart his expanded soul cherished the fiction because it wore the garb of truth therefore in him credulity was a virtue and yet virtue would be in much less repute than it is  for which there is little necessity  if it met with no better reward his propensity to the softer passions were though so young of a pretty robust kind for he had already attacked and that very briskly fat betty who by force of arms or rather fists defended her virtue nor was he less solicitous with lady hazards woman before whom about a week previous to his journey his father found him on his knees which accident produced the following short lecture  my lord having pretty well shamed him said  charles i am glad to see this grace in you i never before spoke to you with the harshness of a father hitherto you have had nothing from me but the mildness of that character i am scarcely sorry for what has happened because it gives me an opportunity of speaking on a subject which i could not otherwise so well have introduced  you have heard of my excesses in my youth they have cost me reflections bitterer than i would wish my worst enemy i am not hurt at seeing you susceptible nor do i expect as you grow up to keep you entirely continent you are informed your opinions are decided ones and you have an understanding far beyond your years or i should not be so explicit you have conferred on me one great blessing which i know you will never deprive me of i mean a faithful observance of your word upon all occasions if upon consulting your heart you can truly make me the promise i am going to ask of you these are the last words you shall ever hear from me on this subject i would naturally recommend to you to think of no idle amors but perhaps that is impossible if it should be so choose some other place than your fathers house let me know nothing of it i should pity and perhaps forgive the frailties of my son but i should shudder at being his confidant  the promise i exact from you is to combat your inclinations upon all occasions but to subdue them absolutely and entirely when they tempt you to the seduction of a wife or daughter or any way tend to disturb domestic happiness  my dear father cried charles throwing himself on his knees and taking lord hazards hand i promise you your advice shall be engraven on my heart and so may i prosper as i keep or reject it  enough said lord hazard abundantly enough i know you will keep your word and therefore nothing can pass between you and i upon this subject again  foibles our hero certainly had in plenty but he had also many excellent qualities indeed they will be well exercised in the course of this work for though no temper was ever more tried or mind more worked upon yet i defy any one to detect him in the commission of either an ungenerous or a dishonorable action  this in common heroes is nothing for being made up entirely of sterling virtues without alloy what wonder if they come out of the fire of temptation pure and undeminished  but for an elegant handsome fine young fellow unsuspecting inexperienced sensible accomplished born to captivate and be captivated  for such a one neither to turn out a puppy nor a knave is an instance that does not every day attract our admiration  but i have often held  and many will agree with me  that is is as easy to do right as wrong and in my hero this truth is illustrated for know reader this young gentleman preserved his honor nay perhaps his life by a strict adherence to one ruling principle which being so young it is singularly admirable he should set down for himself it was this never to promise what was improper to perform but having made a promise never to break it  chapter ix about bundling and other amcrous matters  standfasts journey into the country was to the house of a young clergyman to whom he was patron read it ye great and confess your insignificance your dependants have their hangers on your very toadeaters have their tools nay sometimes you are their tools yourselves has not your steward his carriage his country house his hounds his partridge mews and his doxey and do not you pay for it nay he is in point of certainty so much better off than you that were you to be ruined and even through his mismanagement he could behold the wreck from the shore and get comfortably to a retreat which your bounty provided for him  this young clergyman whose name was figgins was originally a bridewell boy standfast took a great fancy to him one evening as he signalized himself on a rejoicing night the peculiar address with which he broke the windows of such as would not put out lights and threw squibs into coaches to frighten ladies and burn their clothes evinced such a proneness to mischief that standfast felt a congenial warmth and immediately determined to select this youth as a fit instrument in time for nobler daring  it was necessary however that he should add to this unluckiness and audacity a necessary portion of subtilty he therefore asked him several questions to which he received such answers as pleased him that is to say full of impudence and ambiguity and hearing him afterward tell one of his companions that he had queered raven gray his mind was so made up that he determined  to use his own phrase  upon patronizing him  the reader however must not imagine that mr standfast laid himself open to his dependant the matter was apparently brought about through the medium of a third person indeed mr viney to whom this hopeful youth was a distant relation and he was required among other things to consider mr standfast as an exemplary character  the tutor prevailed upon a bishop a friend of his  i sincerely hope the bishop did not know what he was about  to ordain this spark and this was the very friend he left in the care of little hockley  at the time charles and his tutor paid this visit to mr figgins he was in the possession of a vicarage near poole which living standfast procured him from a noble earl in some respects however owing to the young parsons own conduct for he was so civil to introduce to his lordship a near relation which circumstance ended in my lords making up for a large sum of money a suit which the young lady commenced against him for seduction though the earl was about her thirteenth lover one of this number by her advice quitted the kingdom lest he should be taken up for the forgery of a bank note which after he was gone she changed and put the money in her pocket  standfasts business with mr figgins was of a very particular nature and perhaps the reader may sometime hence join with me in that opinion  whatever it was standfast did not choose to transact it by letter it being one of his maxims never to write any thing but what all the world might read nor make either promises or declarations in the presence of a third person  in conformity to this latter part of his maxim he very frequently took his friend figgins with him either a walk or a ride begging charles to take care of the ladies till their return these ladies were first mr figginss maiden aunt a woman of exemplary character an enthusiastic admirer of drelincourt and a dram glass and who her nephew very humanely maintained upon her paying him down quarterly the sum of eight pounds secondly mrs figgins the ninth  for like major oflaherty he had them in all quarters and all alive and merry  and lastly miss figgins a young lady of beauty and accomplishments but who had not yet got a husband  though she owned twentyseven  because the men were brutes and her nature was so delicate that the least ill treatment would break her heart  charles found it no disagreeable task to entertain these ladies in the absence of his tutor nay he made a traffic of his complaisance for he wrote an impromtu for a smile and sketched their portrait for a kiss his skill in music enchanted them and they wished never to part with the young lord as he was called  as to miss figgins had any one witnessed her behavior at those unguarded moments when he sung a pathetic air  though by the bye he was of that age when the voice sounds more like that of a raven than a nightingale  he would have sworn she had at once conquered her aversion to love and matrimony to say truth her virtue was of the rampant kind which perhaps was one reason she continually talked of the great pains she took to subdue it indeed she so prompted charles in that part which if it had been the time to act he knew without a cue that the young gentleman had a kind of rebellion to quell which gave him no little disturbance in short in spite of his teeth he was obliged to take a review of the promise he had made his father and reflecting that the sister of mr figgins must certainly be a woman of honor he triumphantly carried the point and congratulated himself on this victory over his passions indeed the term sister was not included in the conditions but it was certainly implied and it would have been dishonorable had he taken advantage of the omission  the lady however having made good her landing determined to lose no opportunity of improving that advantage therefore one day while they sat at dinner she slily slipped a note into the young gentlemans coat pocket which contained these words both in form and substance  for hevven sake mete me in the arburr and let me ho let me unbuzzum myself  charles was too gallant not to attend the lady  indeed it was very much his wish to have a little conversation with her alone not doubting but when the purity of his intentions were honestly made known the young ladys quiet would be restored which at present he made no doubt he greatly disturbed having therefore attended the appointment he declared to her with the truest and most honest simplicity his repugnance to do that which he could not consider otherwise than as a shameful breach of hospitality the lady acknowledged the generosity of his sentiments and said that as she saw her fears were unnecessary they might now indulge in all those little innocent freedoms which to susceptible and delicate hearts gave such delight  in short after much simpering stammering blushing and other indications of maiden bashfulness  the largest part of which especially the blushing was most manifest in charles  she informed him that upon certain conditions he should steal to her bedchamber and sleep with her that very night these conditions were explained to be exactly what i am informed they practice very commonly and very innocently in america under the name of bundling  perhaps miss figgins had heard of adhelm who to try his virtue slept several nights with a virgin without violating his chastity and understanding charles was intended for a great man determined it should not be her fault if he had not this proof of his virtue in as great perfection as his pious predecessor if however these were her intentions there was some how or other an infraction in the treaty for charles and the lady so bundled that at the end of a fortnight she informed him in the most decent manner so delicate a creature could muster up words for the purpose that she was certainly with child  what a stroke for our hero must he begin already to feel the bitter reflections of having broken his promise how to act which way to conceal her shame he could not marry her  which at some intervals he had thoughts of  without consulting his father and the consequence of such a consultation was apparent yet he had ruined her and brought her into a situation that marriage alone could atone for in so doing he had already broken his promise and why not go farther since there was no honorable means of retreat  in this state chequered with pleasure and compunction had he passed several days when mr standfast one morning told our hero that some damned thing or other had come to his fatheris ears who required their immediate presence in town  see there said he showing him a letter he had that instant received to the rev mr standfast if you have the smallest regard for my peace of mind come post to me the moment you receive this  hazard     charles not doubting but his amor and its consequences had already reached his fathers ears without considering how the intelligence could have been conveyed told his tutor ingenuously that he was the cause of it mr standfast seemed greatly astonished at the declaration and demanded how it could possibly be the pupil exacting a solemn promise from his tutor that he would carefully preserve the most profound secresy let him into the bundling secret from first to last and concluded with vehemently entreating his advice  standfast looking very sagacious said this must be the cause of lord hazards injunction sure enough which it was a very proper thing to comply with for fear of irritating him farther as for the rest he said it was a cursed unlucky affair but fortunately the brother was under his thumb and his best endeavors might be depended on to hush matters up  if his father should mention it he advised charles to deny the whole business though he had no doubt but he should use such arguments as would induce him not to say a word about it  charles was in raptures at the kindness of his tutor who took care nevertheless to give the young gentleman a wholesome lecture declaring his great repugnance to this duplicity of conduct and protesting he only consented to it from the laudable view of preventing a difference between father and son  by this time the chaise was at the door for standfast zealous to obey his patrons mandate had ordered it previous to this conversation with his pupil the latter therefore took a hasty but tender leave of his enamorata who exacted a promise that he would write to her and if possible see her soon again  on the road standfast encouraged charles to keep up his spirits he told him for one thing that his honor was in no scrape for that the lady however she might have imposed upon his inexperience was not a vestal nor had been for a good twenty years  why she is but six and twenty said charles and eleven added to it replied the tutor as to the brat if there should be one we must see what is to be done with it i have told you all these matters added he lest you should be improperly drawn in therefore you must promise me to be upon your guard no indiscreet marriages nor any other steps without first consulting me upon these and no other terms will i undertake this business  charles eagerly promised every thing his tutor demanded of him and standfast reiterated his friendly professions they both arrived in town however with no little anxiety on their minds that of charles proceeded as the reader knows from his fear of having made his father miserable mr standfast had too hearty a contempt for every human weakness to feel the influence of any such henhearted sensation glorious mischief begat his perplexity and all his uneasiness was lest the banquet preparing for his inexorable senses should not be seasoned high enough with domestic wretchedness  chapter x consisting of comfort and consolation administered by the friendly mr standfast  it was agreed upon the arrival of charles and his tutor that the latter should go first to see how the land lay and that the young gentleman should not see his father  thereby to give their project breath  till he had paid his respects to lady hazard  mr standfast immediately sought my lord and having very opportunely found him he was informed with but little previous ceremony that his patron was undone  lost  irretrievable lost beyond all possibility of hope  good god exclaimed standfast with terror in his countenance whence can this unexpected blow have come it is no diminution of your fortune my lord  of my life of my soul of my honor returned my lord oh that i had listened to thy advice heavenly god that a man should murder his peace sell his lifes happiness and render himself despicable for the brutal villainous gratification of a single moment will you know the extent of my misery the giddy precipice on which i stood and frightful abyss into which i am plunged will you know my torment my horror my despair my hell  be calm my lord said standfast with the utmost commiseration he could convey into his countenance calm replied his lordship yes when i have destroyed myself when the wretches have added my death to the destruction of my peace of mind wretches what wretches cried standfast eagerly keep me not on this wrack of suspense lest my friendship take the alarm and i yield to my fears of that fatal evil which my boding heart has so long anticipated  hear the truth then said my lord and let all worthy men like thee detest me while i utter it i have lain with that infernal woman she has communicated to me a damned disease and i have infected my dear my innocent wife that excellent creature that pattern of her sex beyond all example who never had a blemish on her heart or understanding but when she joined her unhappy fate to a worthless wretch like me  angels of pity comfort me said standfast  ah my dear lord why did i go this cursed journey into the country if i had been on the spot i am sure i should have saved you  it would have been useless cried my lord starting from a chair into which he had thrown himself i had ceased to confide in you before you left town and was glad of a pretext to get rid of your solicitation  mr standfast now uttered a most warm and pathetic speech lamenting general depravity and deploring most affectingly his friends want of resolution so excellent indeed were his reasons his remarks so heartfelt and his manner so persuasive that my lord declared there lived not his equal  to say truth this speech had its merit and so it ought for like many other speeches which are intended to surprise instead of convince it had been some time in preparation and now the tutor entreated to know the particulars of this unfortunate business desirous perhaps of being satisfied whether his actors had performed their parts in the manner he had set down for them especially as he had such an opportunity of hearing their respective merits from a critic who would be sure to do them justice  my lord briefly told him that being informed by colonel tiltly and some others that a gentleman named snaffle was traducing him in every coffeehouse where he came and that one of his friends who vindicated him had very nearly got into a duel on his account he made it his business to seek after snaffle but found only the sham sister as before who it was plain was instructed to play upon him at length he found his man at home when matters were very handsomely explained and he was idiot enough to stay to supper the presence of the sister and the bumpers with which he was drenched produced the rest but concluded my lord that a set of people should conspire the ruin of a man so little known to them and work the destruction of his peace of mind is a species of wickedness and depravity that i cannot give either motive or name  my dear lord cried standfast impatiently i see a gleam of happiness here a celestial and benignant ray of hope what do you mean exclaimed lord hazard these people cried standfast have reaped no pecuniary advantage from their villainy how should they said his lordship no none  it is a contrivance then cried standfast of mrs oshocknesy god send she may be disappointed heaven and earth cried my lord you have certainly divined the truth it is that diabolical wretch sure enough who else could have taken such unheard of pains to make me miserable i knew i felt thou would comfort me but still is not the calamity the same my dear standfast not at all my lord answered his kind friend very confidently are you sure of what you say in relation to your lady from what i may reasonably conjecture it must be so said my lord oh god if i could but flatter myself there well well hope for the best cried standfast you forget my lord how artfully the snare was laid for you i am sure if your lordship was off your guard there is no prudence but may be surprised my advice is this if for the sake of your ladys health matters should require an explanation honestly give it her and lay the blame upon mrs oshocknesy i would stake my life upon the issue and now my lord throw off your chagrin i dare say your lady knows no uneasiness upon this subject but that which she has felt from seeing you miserable  she shall see me so no longer then said my lord by imitating thee i will grow honest and that shall teach me to be cheerful  having so far adjusted matters lord hazard felt himself wonderfully relieved as for charles all he could learn from his mother was that her lord had for several days appeared very ill and very uneasy that it certainly was caused by some disagreeable news he had heard but continued she whatever it is we must unite to comfort him i am sure from me he deserves every thing for his affection increases every day  charles convinced he was the cause of his fathers unhappiness took leave of his mother as early as he decently could to go in quest of standfast that common friend in the family for surely it is the office of a friend to make people easy  the tutor was ready to receive him and apparently anxious to put him out of pain for he seized him very cordially by the hand and told him matters were in such a swimming train that he had only to appear as if nothing had happened and he might be assured that his father would not even mention the circumstance  standfast had now restored the tranquillity of both father and son and in some measure his own for the latter part of his conversation with his patron was concerning lady roebuck but as he could not gather any reason to believe she had been tatling he fairly concluded she was afraid to attack him or else perhaps as chance had thrown him again in her way the lady had wisely adopted the proverb better late than never and so promised herself the accomplishment of what his vanity induced him to believe she wished so difficult is it for men of mr standfasts turn of mind to credit that any one can be actuated by motives purely generous and merely disinterested  the triumphant mr standfast however had never been so near detection as while he was absent that conversation between the two ladies which took a different turn as the reader has seen at the end of the seventh chapter had introduced into the mind of lady roebuck a number of alarming fears for her friend she could not give mr standfast that implicit credit which he seemed to exact of lord and lady hazard for the active part he had taken in the business of miss snaffle indeed knowing from her own experience how little pretensions he had either to gratitude principle or generosity her tongue was very reluctantly reined in whenever she heard any thing in his commendation but at length considering lady hazard was a new though a very intimate acquaintance and that the office she longed to undertake was rather a thankless one she took a little time for reflection during which interval a circumstance happened which decided her wavering resolution as however it was of sufficient consequence to require that sir sidney should be consulted the reader is of course anxious to know what it was and the result of their deliberations the latter i am very ready to say was that to arm lord and lady hazard against the machinations of mr standfast was treading on very tender ground and therefore they ought not to take any material steps in so weighty a business till their arrival in the country where sir sidney said he would begin this herculean labor this then they resolved as to the circumstance which procured this resolution it will come better hereafter to have mentioned it here would have been premature and not to have said something on the suspicions of sir sidney and his lady would have been tacitly to have accused the reader of a deficiency in penetration for it is hardly possible that any one who knew mr standfast should believe him capable of devoting himself so suddenly to the practice of real virtue when his whole life had been an artful study how to keep up the appearance of it  standfast has been seen very solicitous to get at the particulars of lord hazards unfortunate intrigue for which i have assigned the real motive and to say truth he was not pleased with the relation for in his absence  to carry on the allusion i used at that time  his piece had been mutilated by the managers and ill performed by the actors a material incident had been cut out of his projecting and another by no means condusive to the catastrophe he wished to take place introduced  these alterations were principally owing to the heroine who in real life as well as upon the stage is generally apt to take these sort of liberties and though mr standfast had not been present at the representation of his performance yet being a consummate judge of effect he saw plainly it would have had more striking success could he have been on the spot to have conducted it  to drop this allusion standfast plainly saw that mrs oshocknesy had taken the liberty to alter his plan no doubt for private ends of her own he had left orders for an anonymous letter to be sent to lady hazard on the very evening his lordship should be engaged at snaffles apprizing her of the fact this it was plain to standfast had been neglected but that something as we before observed should be substituted in its place the lady had through the means of miss snaffle conferred a favor on his lordship which she thought would serve just as well to communicate the secret to lady hazard to say truth this was a coup de grace which standfast with all his rascallity had not meditated it was a vengeance truly feminine and greatly worthy the vindictive mrs oshocknesy  how these conspirators answered their conduct to their ringleader will by and by be seen at present i shall only say that mrs oshocknesy defended herself by an argument which will at least prove her to be a proper coadjutor of the great mr standfast it was no less than that the knowledge of lady hazards pregnancy induced her to take that harmless step before mentioned without her principals privity at which he was as much incenced as was hecate against the witches who dared to prompt macbeth in his iniquity without her orders  chapter xi permanent happiness appears to be restored and the whole society set out on their journey to the country  it will now be proper to speak concerning miss le clerc whose whole history as far as mr ingot knew it sir sidney learnt much about the time the two ladies were reading emmas letter for the good citizen being as i observed lord hazards man of business they were in a manner obliged to consult him upon several points relative to the property of little hockley on the first of these visits every thing naturally came out and when the baronet and his lady met both were ripe for the discovery of what was no secret to either  the story of annette was no mystery but it has been shown in what way it was told and if miss le clerc was sir sidneys wife what then was lady roebuck this was a consideration of a most serious nature and in justice to so amiable a lady it was admitted that it ought to be set to rights  lord and lady hazard being therefore the only persons who had it in their power to make a single comment on this subject and that nobleman and his lady having by this time for many reasons become great favorites with these two friends they were without the alteration of a single circumstance informed of the real truth this led to the establishment of a most intimate and binding friendship between the two couples and the baronet and lady roebuck felicitated themselves upon the certainty as they now conceived it of that plan which they had formed of making lord hazard the reformer of his own village as preaching however cannot have half the effect of example they resolved as the reader has seen to reserve their grand attack till they should arrive at the place of action when his lordship should be assailed in such a manner as would deprive him of the means of defending himself and oblige him  especially as his lady was already gained over  to surrender at discretion  lord hazard very soon got perfectly restored to health and as there were no reasons to believe that his suspicions concerning his lady had any foundation he by degrees regained his usual ease and tranquillity  as to charles he received a quire of letters from miss figgins full of sythes and wows and flamming arts but convinced that under the guidance of standfast all he incurred was a trifling expense he rather felt proud of the business and was not a little pleased that at an age under eighteen he had given such notable proofs of his manhood he felt however very gratefully toward both his parents who he was convinced knew of his irregularity and had the kindness not to upbraid him with it and as this imaginary conduct of theirs induced him to treat them with the most dutiful and minute attention so it endeared him to their notice and regard ten times stronger than ever sir sidney was not an idle spectator of this he was charmed with charles and really began to meditate seriously that alliance which it may be recollected he mentioned formerly in jest  these projects which were intended to blossom in the spring and produce fruit in the summer laid at present dormant in their minds we will therefore pass over the hurry of the winter and bring them to the sign of the john of gaunts head an inn in their way to warwickshire  the landlord of this house who was a great favorite of sir sidney prided himself on having as distinct and ample a genealogy as any lord nay he looked upon himself as superior to many who boast that title for said he what are lords the creatures of yesterday to those in my family of three hundred years standing adding alack a day human creatures are buckets in a well one up and the other down  this landlord was not a little proud of having been a substantial yeoman of kent he had been indeed a considerable farmer but having a strong inclination to indulge himself in that hospitality in which it was not within his circumstances to cut any tolerable figure he had entertained so many poor gentlemen of high extraction till at length as the phrase is he ran out and leaving off farming left also his own country and took an inn not far from high wickham  the house bore all the insignia of its masters fancied consequence and the relics of those mighty deeds which were performed by his ancestors and in which he took so much pleasure as he sat in his chimney corner to record were distributed about wherever he could find a place for them shields and spears glittered in the kitchen instead of potlids and spits helmets and cuisses in the place of stags horns adorned the hall and mismatched pieces of tapestry covered the walls of every room  lord hazard insisted upon being introduced in form and sir sidney undertook to be gentleman usher upon the occasion my lord confessed he could boast but of very recent extraction being as one might say a junior branch of the nobility why truly answered the landlord you will pardon my jocularity my lord there is a spot of rust on your eschuteon which perhaps by hazard may be rubbed out  the archness as well as frankness of this reply pleased his lordship so much that he entered into a long conversation with the landlord that ended in an explanation of all the warlike trophies before mentioned the history of which contained a kind of summary review of the history of england we shall therefore forbear to recite any part of what passed except one remark they were examining a rosary which was said to have belonged to the unfortunate mary queen of scots my lord said that here is was a lamentable fate lamentable said the landlord shaking his head if she had not been an angel upon earth bess would not have been so ready to send her to make one in heaven  chapter xii a night scene which mr flush would have called a very varietous kind of a thing  at the inn where our travelers lay had arrived two musicians just before dark who were going to a noblemans scat in the neighborhood upon a summer excursion and where there was to be a grand concert the next day one of the gentlemen an italian had the day before been seized with a violent fever but being told that his patron had sent express for him he determined to go in spite of his indisposition especially as he knew he should be taken greater care of at the house of his benefactor than at home his companion came to acquaint him that he had received a similar summons this put the finishing stroke to the italians determination for they were both famous performers on the trumpet and seldom played asunder  at this meeting the two musicians talked about what fishing and shooting they should have and above all what delicious burgundy they should taste at his lordships nor did they fail to enjoy by anticipation certain jokes which the italian being a wag had it in contemplation to play some of his lordships retinue one in particular he concerted which was to ridicule a black servant for whom the italian had an inveterate aversion because he could not blow the french horn in tune perdio cried he i tink i see de villain cavaliero vid his vite orse and plack visage make one tammed nise oh diavolo for it should here be known that his lordship though he had constantly a troop of musicians after him and some of them men of distinguished talents would rather have been called in at the death of a fox by the dissonant belching of his favorite horn than have listened to the best chorus of handel performed by five hundred and fiftythree persons capable of realizing all that celestial rapture of which doctor burney dreamt  the english musician took his leave of the italian recommending him to take as much rest as possible before they should set off in conformity with this advice the italian betook himself to sleep and passed the night in tolerable tranquillity except that he had a slight delirium in which he fancied the above mentioned black pursued him on his white horse and that he escaped from him with great difficulty and much more such stuff evidently the effect of a distempered brain having however shook off the phantom he afterward obtained tolerable repose and felt himself pretty well recovered when his friend the english musician came to call him up  i thought it necessary to premise thus much that the reader might the better account for a disturbance that happened at the inn the house was buried in a total silence when the italian whose distemper had received no mitigation from either the journey or a shower of rain which had fallen in the afternoon all of a sudden awoke from a horrid dream in which his inveterate enemy the black appeared to him on his steed as before but with the addition of a large sabre with which he threatened to put him instantly to death  frightened at the spectre like chamont he rose and called for lights which indeed he need not have done for there was a solitary candle glimmering in the chimney corner by the help of which imperfect luminary every thing could faintly be discerned leaping from the bed the first object his eyes encountered being a figure in the tapestry of edward the black prince mounted upon a white horse and giving directions at the battle of poictiers he ran in a most frantic manner along the gallery and owing to his corpulent form  which extremely resembled a brandy keg or a ninepin made a rapid descent to the hall underneath there being in total darkness he groped about for a considerable time to no purpose in hopes of finding a door into the yard  all this time the fever being at an alarming height every thing he touched seemed to be the falling stroke of that monstrous instrument of death wielded by the figure in the tapestry at length bellowing like a bull and bounding from one table to another like a tossed pancake or a kicked football he discovered as he imagined the door a faint glimmering of light that beamed on him facilitated this welcome idea and he strove but in vain to find the lock exploring this impervious gloom which as far as his scattered recollection gave opportunity to notice appeared the seat of sorcery where all the demons of hell were assembled to torment him for as to being in an inn it never once occurred to his imagination something that felt like down and smelt intolerably bitter fell about his ears and tormented him the more in proportion as he attempted to defend himself from it and now having his eyes nose and mouth pretty well filled with this suffocating annoyance which contrary to the airdrawn dagger of macbeth was sensible only to the feeling he stamped rubbed his face raved sputtered and struggled till at last he got out of the vortex of this den of erebus to which he seemed to have been drawn by a hellish and invisible influence  lifting however his hands in an extreme of distraction  indeed exactly as st paul is drawn preaching at athens  something tumbled from above which fitted himself completely like a coat of armor without the casque or cuisses  fully persuaded the demon that pursued him had now got him in his clutches he stormed howled foamed and squeaked out as incongruous and inarticulate a recitative as ever hannibal or scipio did at the opera house  at this moment one of the waiters who had been to pay a visit to the bed chamber of the cook maid molly and who of course was the most watchful in the house entered the hall with a lighted candle  the italians singular jeopardy was occasioned by his mistaking the chimney for the door there struggling to get out he had made himself as black as a soot bag and upon his retreat fairly invested himself in the strange manner above mention with a buff jerkin which my landlord had received as a legacy from his father who affirmed and verily believed that it was the same worn by guy earl of warwick when he killed the dun cow  no sooner had the waiter seen this precious relic of his masters ancestors in the hands or rather on the back of the italian than taking him for a thief who wanted to rob the house he ran to fetch his master the italian to be even with him upon descrying the light and an opposite door at the same time ran rapidly up another pair of stairs his precipitate flight confirmed the waiter in his suspicions and facilitated his return to his master who by this time alarmed by the noise had just issued from his apartment  the landlord having heard the matter from his man swore by the glory of his forefathers he would cut him up alive and invoking the manes of edward the black prince and john of gaunt followed muttering curses all the way to the chamber of the english musician whither the italian had by accident directed his flight and to where his distracted bellowing piloted both man and master  in the mean time the italian had reached his brother professors apartment and hid himself buff jerkin and all under the clothes the englishman disturbed by the noise and still more by the italians flouncing into bed waked in an instant and before he had time to recollect what could occasion so extraordinary an intrusion saw in a confused manner by the help of the light which dimly gleamed through the passage what a strange hedious figure he had in bed with him on which he had no sooner cast his eyes than in a dreadful fright he all of a sudden leaped from the bed and got under it  the italian who began to perceive the light and concluding his companion had seen the man and horse which he had no doubt still pursued him followed him close at his heels being under the bed almost as soon as him the english musician being pressed hard by the same abominable figure half dead with the fright crawled out on the opposite side which happened to be next to the door still followed by the italian  the landlord and the waiter now came up with them and the candle being produced the appearance of this quadrumvirate was beyond the power of tongue or pen to describe the distraction of the italian the astonishment of his companion the paralytic fear of the landlord who spite of the examples of his ancestors trembled from head to foot and the consternation of the waiter composed in their different countenances such a set of unbrageous olive livid and cadaverous tints as surely no faces ever before exhibited  the english trumpeter as he encountered the landlord was overturned and now lay flat on the floor the descendant of hengist had gathered himself up into a grotesque attitude looking at the fallen musician and the waiter was pushing the candle forward under his masters arm to see what was the matter while the italian had crept to the other side of the bed and having searched for something to defend himself catched up his companions trumpet who had brought that instrument into his chamber to have it safe with this weapon he leapt upon a chest of drawers and whether he was now wrought to such a height of phrenzy as not to know what he did or whether instinct conducted the trumpet to his mouth without his knowledge certain it is that his stretched companion had scarcely demanded what was the matter and the landlord thundered out a volley of execrations ending with give me my jerkin than the italian sounded a charge and then a defiance and then a parley as fast as they could succeed each other  the moment the english musician heard the trumpet he knew his friend as well as if he had spoken to him and instantly guessed that the confusion must have been occasioned by the italians illness who had become delirious and thus alarmed the house  feeling however for the safety of his trumpet which same provident sensation impelled the landlord in relation to the earl of warwicks habiliment they both approached him where he stood trumpet in hand like another fame in a buff jerkin and were within an inch of their prey when the italian fairly made a spring over their heads darted out of the door and ran along the gallery then down stairs afterward out of the back door into the yard and lastly all over the village blowing away almost without any cessation  this was a partial last trump to the village for all but those in their graves immediately started up to see what was the matter as to the inn imagination never formed so singular a confusion the musician raved for his trumpet the landlord stormed for his buff jerkin here a waiter appeared with his clothes tumbled into the tail of his shirt which he held by way of an apron there a maid servant with a petticoat tied about her head instead of her waist here john the ostler appeared in sukeys night cap and sukey in johns wig  in short there was not one person in the house  for all agreed to put o manly firmness and meet in the hall together  even to sir sidney and lord hazard that did not cut a ludicrous figure while the village cried out some a fight others a fire and all with hasty steps ran toward our inn which thus in a few minutes was filled in addition to its own company with the major part of the village among whom were not a few females with clouts about their heads and children in their arms a sort of spectators who are sure to be foremost at every sight be it a boxing match a lord mayors show or an execution  the english musician getting upon the great table now begged to be heard and having at last obtained silence very naturally accounted for every thing that had happened finishing with a declaration that he apprehended the italian must now be so far gone that the landlords jerkin and his trumpet were certainly in danger of being spoiled  far gone cried a country fellow why i zeed un myzel at the back of master clovers barn and that is only behind thick here orchard oons do but list a tiny bit do not hear un i do exclaimed the musician i do and my dear trumpet is as sound as ever zounds i know what i will do show me to his bed chamber  at which he jumped down and so scampered up stairs that the spectators began to fear lest he should be infected with the same phrenzy as his companion a very few seconds however brought him back again with the italians own trumpet hollowing out this will do this will do here is that shall bring him back again he now hastened to the yard door and putting the trumpet to his mouth sounded a defiance which was immediately answered at a distance in his next essay he was answered somewhat nearer upon two or three repetitions the italian came down the street sounding all the way a parley till at last he was caught held fast brought into the house and the trumpet and buff jerkin restored to their respective owners as to the poor devil himself he was an object of the truest compassion his eyes darted fire he foamed at the mouth and raved like a bedlamite  at the desire of his friend the italian was conveyed to his bed which in a most emaciated condition he made shift to leave in somewhat less than five weeks  end of the first volume
