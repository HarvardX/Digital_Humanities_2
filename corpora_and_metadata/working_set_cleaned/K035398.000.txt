a defense of sir fopling flutter a comedy written by sir george etheridge  in which defense is shown that sir fopling that merry knight was rightly composed by the knight his father to answer the ends of comedy and that he has been barbarously and scurrilously attacked by the knight his brother in the   th spectator  by which it appears that the latter knight knows nothing of the nature of comedy  london printed for t warner at the black boy in paternoster row      price sixpence  the preface the following defense of the comedy of sir fopling flutter not only contains several remarks upon comedy in general remarks that are equally necessary for the writing it successfully and for the judging of it surely but every article of that defense is a just censure of a certain comedy now in rehearsal if i can depend upon the account which i have had of it from several who have read it or to whom it has been read and that the account which i have had of it is very just i am apt to believe not only from the judgment and sincerity of the persons from whom i had it but likewise from the scandalous methods that are used to give it a false and a transitory reputation  i have formerly made mention of poetical mountebanks the author of the comedy now in rehearsal has all the marks of an empiric of parnassus his play has trotted as far as edinburgh northward and as far as wales westward and has been read to more persons than will be at the representation of it or vouchsafe to read it when it is published  another certain sign that a man is an empiric is when he gives high encomiums to himself and his nostrums and pretends at the same time that those encomiums are given by others now advertisements have been sent to the newspapers to this effect that the comedy now in rehearsal is in the opinion of excellent judges the very best that ever came upon the english stage now no body could send that advertisement but the author or one of his zanys by his own contrivance or at least connivance no one could send such an advertisement or give such a judgment but a fool or a knave a knave if he did it with a design to impose on the world and a fool if he did it in the sincerity of his heart for to declare with judgment that a play is the very best that ever came upon the english stage requires vast consideration profound reflection and a long long comparison and what mortal is qualified to pass such a judgment upon a single momentary reading he who sent those advertisements then sent them with a design to impose upon the world or is an arrant ass but it is highly improbable that a fool who knows nothing of the matter should give himself the trouble to send such an advertisement or that any one else should do it but the author or the authors zanys by his subornation for whose interest could it be but theirs to endeavor to impose upon the world but now if it shall appear by the following treatise that the author of the dramatick piece in rehearsal knows nothing of the nature of true comedy then how foolishly arrogant are those insolent and impudent advertisements these very ways of proceeding sufficiently declare the authors consciousness of his own incapacity for a noble genius will scorn such infamous methods and will resolve to owe his reputation to his merit and not to tricking artifice these are some of the methods which the present managers of the stage have used to ruin the dramas and with it all other human learning which is in some measure dependant on it for since cabal and trick and the favor and interest of three or four sordid wretches have been found necessary for the obtaining success every one who is duly qualified to write for the stage has either with a just disdain refused it or has undertaken it with extreme reluctance the drama therefore is like to be lost and all the arts dependent on it therefore every one who is concerned for the honor of his country ought to do his utmost endeavor to prevent a calamity which will be so great a disgrace to it and all who are concerned for the honor of the king ought to reflect with indignation that by the malice and the basest breach of trust of persons whom his majesty has appointed to encourage literature all the  studies of humanity are like to be  in his otherwise spicious reign  a defense of sir fopling flutter a certain knight who has employed so much of his empty labor in extolling the weak performances of some living authors has scurriously and inhumanly in the   th spectator attacked one of the most entertaining comedies of the last age written by a most ingenious gentleman who perfectly understood the world the court and the town and whose reputation has now for near thirty years together survived his person and will in all probability survive it as long as comedy shall be in vogue by which proceeding this worthy knight has incurred the double censure that olivia in the pld dealer has cast upon a certain coxcomb who rather says she then not flatter will flatter the poets of the age whom none will flatter and rather then not rail will rail at the dead at whom none besides will rail  if other authors have had the misfortune to incurr the censure of illnature with unthinking deluded people for no other so much as pretended reason than because to improve a noble art they have exposed the errors of popular writers who owed their success to the infamous method of securing an ignorant or a corrupt cabal when those writers were not only living but in full prosperity and at full liberty to answer for themselves what appellation must he deserve who has basely and scurrilously attacked the reputation of a favorite of the comic muse and of the darling of the graces after death has for so many years deprived him of the means of answering for himself  what the knight falsely and impudently says of the comedy may be justly said of the criticism and of the whole   th spectator that it is a perfect contradiction to good manners and good sense he allows this comedy he says to be in nature but it is nature in its utmost corruption and degeneracy  suppose this were true i would fain know where he learnt that nature in its utmost corruption and degeneracy is not the proper subject of comedy is not this a merry person who after he has been writing what he calls comedy for twenty years together shows plainly to all the world that he knows nothing of the nature of true comedy and that he has not learnt the very first rudiments of an art which he pretends to teach i must confess the ridicule in sir fopling flutter is an imitation of corrupt and degenerate nature but not the most corrupt and the most degenerate for there is neither adultery murder nor sodomy in it but can any thing but corrupt and degenerate nature be the proper subject of ridicule and can any thing but ridicule be the proper subject of comedy has not aristotle told us in the fifth chapter of his poeticks that comedy is an imitation of the very worst of men not the worst says he in every sort of vice but the worst in the ridicule and has not horace in the fourth satyr of his first book reminded us that the old athenian comic poets made it their business to bring all sorts of villains upon the stage adulterers cheats theives murderers but then they always took care says a modern critic that those several villainies should be envelopd in the ridicule which alone says he could make them the proper subjects of comedy if this facetious knight had formerly lived at lacedemon with the same wrong turned noddle that he has now among us would he not do you think have inveighed against that people for showing their drunken slaves to their children would he not have represented it as a thing of most pernicious example what the lacedaemonians did by drunkenness the comic poet does by that and all other vices he exposes them to the view of his fellow subjects for no other reason than to render them ridiculous and contemptible  but the criticism of the knight in the foresaid spectator is as contrary to good manners as it is to good sense what aristotle and his interpreters say of tragedy that it is infallibly good when it pleases both the judges and the people is certainly as true of comedy for the judges are equally qualified to judge of both and the people may be supposed to be better judges of comedy then they are of tragedy because comedy is nothing but a picture of common life and a representation of their own humors and manners now this comedy of sir fopling flutter has not been only well received and believed by the people of england to be a most agreeable comedy for about half a century but the judges have been still more pleased with it then the people they have justly believed i speak of the judges that the characters and especially the principal characters are admirably drawn to answer the two ends of comedy pleasure and instruction and that the dialogue is the most charming that has been writ by the moderns that with purity and simplicity it has art and elegance and with force and vivacity the utmost grace and delicacy this i know very well was the opinion of the most eminent writers and of the best judges contemporary with the author and of the whole court of king charles the second a court the most polite that ever england saw  now after this comedy has passed with the whole people of england the knowing as well as the ignorant for a most entertaining and most instructive comedy for fifty years together after that long time comes a twopenny author who has given a thousand proofs through the course of his rhapsodies that he understands not a tittle of all this matter this author comes and impudently declares that this whole celebrated piece that has for half a century been admired by the whole people of great britain is a perfect contradiction to good sense to good manners and to common honesty o tempora o mores  the knight certainly wrote the forementioned spectator though it as been writ these ten years on purpose to make way for his fine gentleman and therefore he endeavors to prove that sir fopling is not that genteel comedy which the world allows it to be and then according to his usual custom whenever he pretends to criticize he does by shuffling and cutting and confounding notions impose upon his unwary reader for either sir george etheridge did design to make this a genteel comedy or he did not if he did not design it what is it to the purpose whether it is a genteel comedy or not provided that it is a good one for i hope a comedy may be a good one and yet not a genteel one the alchimist is an admirable comedy and yet it is not a genteel one we may say the same of the fox and the silent woman and of a great many more but if sir george did design to make it a genteel one he was obliged to adapt it to that notion of gentility which he knew very well that the world at that time had and we see he succeeded accordingly for it has passed for a very genteel comedy for fifty years together could it be expected that the admirable author should accommodate himself to the wrong headed notions of a would be critic who was to appear fifty years after the first acting of his play a gritick who writes criticism as men commit treason or murder by the instigation of the devil himself whenever the old gentleman owes the knight a shame  to prove that this comedy is not a genteel one he endeavors to prove that one of the principal characters is not a fine gentleman i appeal to every impartial man if when he says that a man or a woman are genteel he means any thing more than that they are agreeble in their air graceful in in their motions and polite in their conversation but when he endeavors to prove that dorimont is not a fine gentleman he says no more to the purpose then he said before when he affirmed that the comedy is not a genteel comedy for either the author designed in dorimont a fine gentleman or he did not if he did not the character is never the less excellent on that account because dorimnot is an admirable picture of a courtier in the court of king charles the second but if dorimont was designed for a fine gentleman by the author he was obliged to accommodate himself to that notion of a fine gentleman which the court and the town both had at the time of the writing of this comedy it is reasonable to believe that he did so and we see that he succeeded accordingly for dorimont not only passed for a fine gentleman with the court of king charles the second but he has passed for such with all the world for fifty years together and what indeed can any one mean when he speaks of a fine gentleman but one who is qualified in conversation to please the best company of either sex  but the knight will be satisfied with no notion of a fine gentleman but his own a fine gentleman says he is one who is honest in his actions and refined in his language if this be a just description of a fine gentleman i will make bold to draw two consequences from it the first is that a pedant is often a fine gentleman for i have known several of them who have been honest in their actions and refined in their language the second is that i know a certain knight who though he should be allowed to be a gentleman born yet is not a fine gentleman i shall only add that i would advise for the future all the fine gentlemen who travel to london from tipperary to allow us englishmen to know what we mean when we speak our native language  to give a true character of this charming comedy it must be acknowledged that there is no great mastership in the design of it sir george had but little of the artful and just designs of ben johnson but as tragedy instructs chiefly by its design comedy instructs by its characters which nor only ought to be drawn truly in nature but to be the resembling pictures of our contemporaries both in court and town tragedy answers to historypainting but comedy to drawing of portraits  how little do they know of the nature of true comedy who believe that its proper business is to set us patterns for lmitation for all such patterns are serious things and laughter is the life and the very soul of comedy it is its proper business to expose persons to our view whose views we may shun and whose follies we may despise and by showing us what is done upon the comic stage to show us what ought never to be done upon the stage of the world  all the characters in sir foppling flutter and especially the principal characters are admirably drawn both to please and to instruct first they are drawn to please because they are drawn in the truth of nature but to be drawn in the truth of nature they must be drawn with those qualities that are proper to each respective season of life  this is the chief precept given for the forming the characters by the two great masters of the rules which nature herself dictated and which have  in every age for the standards of writing successfully and of judging surely unless it were with poetasters and their foolish admirers the words of horace in his art of poetry are these v      tu quid ego and populo mecum desideret audi si sessoris eges aulaea manentis and usque sessuri donec cantor vos plaudite dicat aetatis cujusque notandi sunt tibi mores mobilibusque decor naturis dandus and annis and thus my lord roscommon has translated it  now hear what every auditor expects if you intend that he should stay to hear the epilogue and see the curtain fall mark how our tempers alter with our tears then give the beauty proper to each age and by this rule form all your characters and now see the character that horace gives of a person who is in the bloom of his years  de art poetica v     imberbis tandem juvenis custode remoto gaudet equis canibusque and aprici gramine campi cereus in vitium flecti monitoribus asper utilium tardus provisor prodigus aeris sublimis cupidusque and amata relinquere pernix and thus the foresaid noble poet translates it  a youth that first casts off his tutors yoke loves horses hounds and sports and exercise prone to all vice impatient of reproof proud careless fond inconstant and profuse now horace to show the importance of this precept as soon as he has done with the characters of the four parts of life returns to it repeats it and enforces it  ibid v      ne forte seniles mandentur juveni parts pueroque viriles semper in adjunctis aevoque morabimur aptis that a poet may never be guilty of such an absurdity says he as to give the character of an old man to a young man or of a boy to a middle aged man let him take care to adhere to those qualities which are necessarily or probably annexed to each respective season of life  if a dramatick poet does not observe this rule he misses that which gives the beauty and the decorum which alone can make his characters please  as horace is but an epitomizer of aristotle in giving rules for the characters that philosopher gives us more at large the character of a person in his early bloom in the   th chapter of the second book of his rhetoric  young men says he have strong appetites and are ready to undertake any thing in order to satisfy them and of all those appetites which have a relation to the body they are most powerfully swayed by venereal ones in which they are very changeable and are quickly cloyed for their desires are rather acute than lasting like the hunger and thirst of the sick they are prone to anger and easily provoked vehement in their anger and ready to obey the dictates of it for by reason of the concern which they have for their honor they cannot bear the being undervalud but resent an affront heinously and as they are desirous of honor they are more ambitious of victory for youth is desirous of excelling and victory is a sort of excellency thus far aristotle  and here it may not be amiss to show that this rule is founded in reason and in nature in order to which let us see what dacier remarks upon that verse of horace which we cited above  mobilibusque decor naturis dandus and annis behold says he a very fine and very significant verse which tells us if we render it word for word that we ought to give to moveable natures and years their proper beauty by moveable natures  says dacier horace means age which still runs on like a river and which as it runs gives different inclinations to men and those different inclinations make what he calls decor the beauty proper to the age for every part of mans life has its proper beauties like every season of the year he that gives to manly age the beauties of youth or to youth the beauties of manly age does like a painter who should paint the autumn with the ornaments of summer or the summer with the ornaments of autumn  a comic poet who gives to a young man the qualities that belong to a middle aged man or to an old man can answer neither of the ends of his art he cannot please because he writes out of nature of which all poetry is an imitation and without which no poem can possibly please and as he cannot please he cannot instruct because by showing such a young man as is not to be seen in the world he shows a monster and not a man sets before us a particular character instead of an allegorical and universal one as all his characters and especially his principal characters ought to be and therefore can give no general instruction having no moral no fable and therefore no comedy  now if any one is pleased to compare the character of dorimont to which the knight has taken so much absurd exception with the two forementioned descriptions he will find in his character all the chief distinguishing strokes of them for such is the force of nature and so admirable a talent had she given sir george for comedy that though to my certain knowledge he understood neither greek nor latin yet one would swear that in drawing his dorimant he copied the foresaid draughts and especially that of aristotle dorimont is a young courtier haughty vain and prone to anger amorous false and inconstant he debauches loveit and betrays her loves belinda and as soon as he enjoys her is false to her  but  dly the characters in sir fopling are admirably contrived to please and more particularly the principal ones because we find in those characters a true resemblance of the persons both in court and town who lived at the time when that comedy was writ for rapin tells us with a great deal of judgment that comedy is as it ought to be when an audience is apt to imagine that instead of being in the pit and boxes they are in some assembly of the neighborhood or in some family meeting and that we see nothing done in it but what is done in the world for it is says he not worth one farthing if we do not discover our selves in it and do not find in it both our own manners and those of the persons with whom we live and converse  the reason of this rule is manifest for as it is the business of a comic poet to cure his spectators of vice and folly by the apprehension of being laughed at it is plain that his business must be with the reigning follies and vices the violent passions which are the subjects of tragedy are the same in every age and appear with the same face but those vices and follies which are the subjects of comedy are seen to vary continually some of those that belonged to our ancestors have no relation to us and can no more come under the cognizance of our present comic poets than the sweating and sneezing sickness can come under the practice of our contemporary physicians what vices and follies may infect those who are to come after us we know not it is the present the reigning vices and follies that must be the subjects of our present comedy the comic poet therefore must take characters from such persons as are his contemporaries and are infected with the foresaid follies and vices  agreeable to this is the advice which boileau in his art of poetry gives to the comic poets  etudiez la cour and connoissez la ville lune and lautre est tousoers en modeles fertile cest par la que moliere illustrant ses evrits peutetre de son art eut remporte la prix etc now i remember very well that upon the first acting this comedy it was generally believed to be an agreeable representation of the persons of condition of both sexes both in court and town and that all the world was charmed with dorimont and that it was unanimously agreed that he had in him several of the qualities of wilmot earl of rochester as his wit his spirit his amorous temper the charms that he had for the fair sex his falsehood and his inconstancy the agreeable manner of his chiding his servants which the late bishop of salisbury takes notice of in his life and lastly his repeating on every occasion the verses of waller for whom that noble lord had a very particular esteem witness his lmitation of the tenth satire of the first book of horace  waller by nature for the bays designed with spirit force and fancy unconfind in panegyric is above mankind now as several of the qualities in dorimonts character were taken from that earl of rochester so they who were acquainted with the late sir fleetwood shepherd know very well that not a little of that gentlemans character is to be found in medley  but the characters in this comedy are very well formed to instruct as well as to please especially those of dorimont and of loveit and they instruct by the same qualities to which the knight has taken so much whimsical exception as dorimont instructs by his insulting and his perfidiousness and loveit by the violence of her resentment and her anguish for loveit has yough beauty quality wit and spirit and it was depending upon these that she reposed so dangerous a trust in dorimont which is a just caution to the fair sex never to be so conceited of the power of their charms or their other extraordinaryqualitiesas to believe they can engage a man to be true to them to whom they grant the best favor without the only sure engagement without which they can never be certain that they shall not be hated and despised by that very person whom they have done every thing to oblige  to conclude with one general observation that comedy may be qualified in a powerful manner both to instruct and to please the very constitution of its subject ought always to be ridiculous comedy says rapin is an image of common life and its end is to expose upon the stage the defects of particular persons in order to cure the defects of the public and to correct and amend the people by the fear of being laughed at that therefore says he which is most essential to comedy is certainly the ridicule  every poem is qualified to instruct and to please most powerfully by that very quality which makes the fort and the characteristick of it and which distinguishes it from all other kinds of poems as tragedy is qualified to instruct and to please by terror and compassion which two passions ought always to be predominant in it and to distinguish it from all other poems epick poetry pleases and instructs chiefly by admiration which reigns throughout it and distinguishes it from poems of every other kind thus comedy instructs and pleases most powerfully by the ridicule because that is the quality which distinguishes it from every other poem the subject therefore of every comedy ought to be ridiculous by its constitution the ridicule ought to be of the very nature and essence of it where there is none of that there can be no comedy it ought to reign both in the incidents and in the characters and especially in the principal characters which ought to be ridiculous in themselves or so contrived as to show and expose the ridicule of others in all the masterpieces of ben johnson the principal character has the ridicule in himself as morose in the silent woman volpone in the fox and subtle and face in the alchimist and the very ground and foundation of all these comedies is ridiculous it is the very same thing in the masterpieces of moliere the mis antrope the impostor the avare and the femmes secuanter nay the reader will find that in most of his other pieces the principal characters are ridiculous as letoardy les precieuses ridicules le cocu imaginaire le fascheux and monsieur de pousceaugnac le bourgeois gentilhomme lecole de maris lecole des femmes lamour medicis le medicin malgre luy la marriage force george dandin les fourberies de scapin le malade imaginaire the reader will not only find upon reflection that in all these pieces the principal characters are ridiculous but that in most of them there is the ridicule of comedy in the very titles  it is by the ridicule that there is in the character of sir fopling which is one of the principal ones of this comedy and from which it takes its name that he is so very well qualified to please and to instruct what true engglishman is there but must be pleased to see this ridiculous knight made the jest and the scorn of all the other characters for showing by his foolish aping foreign customs and manners that he prefers another country to his own and of what important instruction must it be to all our youth who travel to show them that if they so far forget the love of their country as to declare by their espousing foreign customs and manners that they prefer france or italy to great britain at their return they must justly expect to be the jest and the scorn of their own countrymen  thus i hope i have convinced the reader that this comical knight sir fopling has been justly formed by the knight his father to instruct and please whatever may be the opinion to the contrary of the knight his brother  whenever the fine gentleman of the latter comes upon the stage i shall be glad to see that it has all the shining qualities which recommend sir fopling that his characters are always drawn in nature and that he never gives to a young man the qualities of a middleaged man or an old one that they are the just images of our contemporaries and of what we every day see in the world that instead of setting us patterns for our imitation which is not the proper business of comedy he makes those follies and vices ridiculous which we ought to shun and despise that the subject of his comedy is comical by its constitution and that the ridicule is particularly in the grand incidents and in the principal characters for a true comic poet is a philosopher who like old democritus always instructs us laughing  finis
