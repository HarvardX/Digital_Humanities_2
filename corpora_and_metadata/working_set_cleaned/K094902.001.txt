it may defend or command both  the principal building and from which it has its name is the great white square tower in the middle it is a regular strong lofty structure and the oldest within the walls being built by william the conqueror in the year  0    there are besides several other considerable buildings that have been added to this grand fortress at diverse times since of which i shall speak hereafter the whole is encompassed with a strong wall and that surrounded with a broad deep ditch supplied with water out of the thames  the entrances into the tower are over two bridges one at the west end for carts coaches footpassengers etc the other over a drawbridge from the wharf on the south side facing the thames for footpassengers only it has besides a passage from the river called traitorsbridge because formerly all persons committed to the tower for treason were brought through it in boats  the government of this important place being of high honor as well as of great trust is generally committed to a peer of the realm who is ftiled constable of the tower he has a deputy governor and many other officers under him  chap ii of the lions and other wild beasts in the tower when you have passed the two soldiers called the spurguard who stand without the first gate you will see the figure of a lion against the keepers house right before you and another over the door on your right hand where you are to enter to see the curiosities  here each person pays threepence for admittance  the wild creatures that are there shown are all kept in strong dens so that you need not be under any fear of danger from them  dont venture too near and you may view them very safely  the dens are made in the form the pictures represent in which are two rooms the lower has strong thick bars of wood the upper iron in one of which the keeper secures the creature whilst the other is cleaned etc and there are some spare dens in which are no wild beasts at present  you first see a fine maiden lioness which was a present from the consul of algiers she is about fourteen years old her name is jenny  second another lioness from africa whose name is phillis  third a he lion named marco consort to phillis he has majesty in his countenance that strikes an awe in the beholders a graceful mane of thick long shaggd hair ornaments his strong neck and shoulders he has a huge head and a prodigious wide mouth with frightful teeth this lion eyes are red fiery and sunk deep into his head his nose is very large with wide nostrils both his sight and smelling are very sharp his bigsinewd legs and thighs are strong like bars of iron and his claws like hooks five of which he has upon each foot before and four on those behind sheathed like a cats with which lie strikes and catches his prey like that animal  his roaring voice is so terrible that it not only strikes mankind with fear but all creatures with such surprise that they dare not stir he may therefore with these properties he justly styled the king of beasts  marco and phillis are both from the same country as jenny and were likewise a present from the consul of algiers each of them is about nine years old  this royal pair have bred several times in the tower they have a young prince of two years old named nero now to be seen there besides three young ones which were brought forth on the   th day of june    0 whom we shall pay our court to before we go  lioness   the lioness is lesser than the lion and has no mane her body being smoother and sleeker the color of them both are the same which is a dun inclining to a pale yellow with a darkish cast on the surface  the fourth animal is a he leopard from the east indies about seven years old this is a very beautiful leopard creature of a yellow color finely marked with black spots it is much smaller than any of the lions or tigers that are here nor does it seem so fierce his name is will  now you pass to another yard where you see  the fifth which is a she panther called jenny the hair of this creature is short and mossy and of a bright yellow beautifully marked with round black spots like the leopards but not quite so full it is in size shape and color so much like the leopard that when asunder their difference is not easily distinguished and when together only by nicely observing their spots therefore we need not give its figure  the person who shows these creatures tells us that the panther is produced from the coupling of the lion and leopard others say it is the he panther and lioness which beget the leopard but the most probable opinion is that the leopard is the male and the panther the female of one and the same species  the panther is said to be of a fierce nature than the leopard more greedy of blood very swift and catches her prey by leaping upon it suddenly  sixth and seventh are a he and she tiger from the south sea they are kept together in one den and have had several litters of whelps they have been in the tower about ten years their names are will and phillis and they have a son whose name is dick who was bred in the tower and is now about six years old he had a brother whelpd with him who lived but a little while dick is a beautiful marked creature and finely shaped but stoops a little in his shoulders occasioned by the fall of a table upon his back when he was at nurse  the two old ones will and phillis are marked with round spots like the leopard whereas those two tigers found in the east indies are streaked all down their sides etc instead of spots  the tiger is shaped very much like the lioness only somewhat lesser and has a shorter neck but is bigger than either leopard or panther its color and spots resemble the leopards but they have not near so many nor are they so bright and beautiful  the tiger is of a very wild and fierce nature exceeding ravenous and of a prodigious swiftness he spares neither man nor beast but if he can satisfy his hunger with the flesh of beasts he will not attack mankind it is said that this creature is seldom taken but in defense of its young these two in the tower sport and play very wantonly together the female is now big with young  the eighth animal is a racoon chained in the yard where it has a wooden hutch or box like a foxs to run into when it is minded it is about the size of the fox has a thick fur on his back sides etc of a dark grizly color with a thick bushy tail it feeds on flesh fish or roots like the fox and seems to partake much of racoon the nature of that crafty creature  the next are two vultures in separate woonden cages the first has been in the tower twenty years the second about six they are both of a color which is like that of the dove and their size is equal likewise which is bigger than the eagle their beaks are large and crooked at the end their necks for vulture the most part bare of feathers the craw of the vulture hangs down like a bag before the stomach or breast under the throat it has a space of about an hand breadth clothed rather with hairs like to those of a calf than feathers and the inside of the wings are covered with a soft fleece of down which is peculiar to the vulture alone among birds of prey  it is said that vultures have an excellent sense of smelling above all other birds so that they can perceive the savor of dead carcasses from afar and that from their devouring of dead bodies they were called living tombs they are said to follow armies because in their marches a great many men horses etc fall here and there by the way job has the like description of the eagle  and where the slain are there is she chap xxxix  0  the ancients have delivered that the vulture is content only with dead carcasses abstaining from the ravin and slaughter of living animals but some moderns affirm that it preys upon living birds fawns hares kids lambs etc  eagle   the last are two eagles in separate cages they have been in the tower about thirty years they are of a dark brown color almost black unless on the top of their heads pinnions of their wings etc which are of a bright reddish brown and are therefore called the brown eagles  for another threepence you see the following  first young prince nero of two years old whom we just mentioned son of marco and phillis bred in the tower he has a fine shocked mane and is really a beautiful creature and exceedingly well educated for upon my expressing a desire of visiting his lodging at a word speaking he marched down with great condescension from his upper into his lower apartment and gave me the opportunity of entering his den where having satisfied my curiosity in viewing his dining room kitchen and bedchamber his manner of living particular ceremony in eating drinking etc at my departure from thence he would fain have took me by the hand but our acquaintance being but slender i declined accepting so great a mark of his friendship till i knew him better  upon the keepers putting into his den a piece of lights he seemingly took very little notice of it but couched down on his belly with his forefeet out like a cat that is going to leap at a mouse and in an instant gave a sudden spring from the farthest side of the den and seized it with amazing fierceness  my young readers will excuse my not giving them the picture of prince nero because he is so like his papa whose royal visage you may see in page    that it would appear almost the same  second a lioness thirteen years old bred likewise in the tower from a former pair that are now dead this is the fiercest beast in the tower her name is nanny  third the young he tiger named dick son of will and phillis described in page        fourth a porcupine in an iron cage this is one of the strangest animals in the world its back sides and tail are guarded with strong quills each a foot and half long all pointed porcupine as sharp as needles and spotted with black and white these the creature draws up all together that they look like so many halfpikes and stand so distinct that the skin of the beast may be seen between each and then suddenly strikes them all back with great force as if they went with a strong spring turning her self about at the same time every way  snake to all which tribe it is an utter enemy  whatever its antipathy may be to the snake kind to man it seems a very inconsiderable enemy it is neither very swift nor fierce and though it is so well armed it is rather for its own defense than offense to any other animal  its flesh in those countries where it is found is esteemed by the natives as good foot this in the tower is fed with bread roots and fruit it was brought from the east indies  fifth in the same room is a large old ape which at command does several diverting tricks  sixth an uncommon large beautiful bird called warwoven or king of the vawous it was brought to the tower in september the ape last and was a present from his grace the duke of mountagu it is somewhat lesser than the eagle these kind of birds are found in some parts of the east indies  lastly you are shown the three young lions which were helpd on the   th day of june    0 at five weeks old and likewise at ten i had them in my lap they were then warwoven very innocent and might as safely be handled as ladies lapdogs they were indeed somewhat bigger and not quite so finely shaped excepting their color they were not much unlike young lambs  their hair was soft like fine wool their color nearly the same as the old lions they are kept in a neat clean room and for some time fed with warm three young lions milk and are brought to the eating of flesh by degrees one is a male whose name is pompey the other two are females one named priscilla the other nell  chap iv histories and observations on the lions in the tower etc lions tigers panthers and leopards are fed with sheeps heads and plucks twice a day of which a lion eats four or five in a day but leopards panthers and tigers are much fonder of raw dogsflesh they are always separated when they eat or they would quarrel the wild lions of africa are said to prey chiefly upon wild boars which sometimes prove so hard to conquer that both have been found dead together in their gore they drink as often as they drink as often as they please usually several times in a day each having a stone trought in his den  the lion being an animal of a hot and thirsty nature was by the ancients represented as an emblem or symbol of sultry weather  the tower has been a place for keeping of wild beasts in above five hundred years  on sunday the  th of august   0  a lioness named elizabeth brought forth a young lion in the tower which young one died the next day this was the first lion whelpd in that place and probably in england  the   th of february following the same lioness brought forth another young lion which by command of king james was taken from the dam as soon as whelpd and nursed by hand but this also died in about sixteen days  the greatest age any lions have been known to live in the tower is about twenty years  the lion in the day times seems to be a very sluggish heavy animal that hates to be roused and is no sooner up but if suffered will immediately slap down again perhaps in the night they may be otherwise it being more natural to them to seek their prey in the holy psalmist has the like observation thou make darnkness and it is night wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth the young lions roar after their prey and seek their meat from god the su arises they gather them selves together and lay them down in their dens psalm civ  the lioness goes with young exactly four months none were ever known to have more than three at a litter they are whelpd with their eyes open and are taken from the dam immediately or they would perish  they are very tender and require a great deal of care in nursing it being exceedingly difficult to bring up a young lion and so it is tigers etc they often die in breeding their teeth sometimes in strong convulsions the same is observed by the people of barbary to happen to the young wild lions of that country or they would be much more numerous than they are in those parts  young lions are kept about twelve months in a warm room before they are put into dens but before they come to that age are chained and are always separated when they eat their victuals their savage nature comes on gradually as they grow up and they are three years a coming to their full growth  it has been the common opinion that the lion is afraid of fire their keepers deny that they are so one of them who now attends the wild beasts in the tower going one night in the last hard winter to the den of the old lion with a lighted candle held his hand near the bars to see if the creature was come down into the lower apartment when suddenly he put out his paw and wounded the man so dangerously in the back of his hand that he very narrowly escaped losing it and this he brings as an instance to show that they are not afraid of fire  the lion often sleeps and snores with his eyes open and likewise with them shut  king james the first being minded to make trial of the nature and courage of the lion and some other wild beasts went to the tower attended by several of the nobility where he ordered a lion and lioness to be turned out of their dens and a cock to be cast to them which they presently killed and sucked its blood  next a lamb was ordered to be put to them which the lions out of their generosity never offered to touch although it went close up to them  then two mastiffs were let loose upon a single lion which they presently seized and turned upon his back and though the lion was superior to them in strength yet they were his match in courage  some time after a lion was turned out of his den to a bear which had killed a child but the lion would not attack the bear  they tried several other single lions and at length two together but all fled from him and wanted rather to get into their dens  a stonehorse was put into the yard with the first lion and the bear the horse after a little while fell to grazing between them which they never offered to touch afterward six dogs were let in who flew upon the horse most in sight at their first entrance and would soon have worried him to death had not three stout fellows entered in who rescued the horse and brought away the dogs while the lion and bear stood staring upon them at this sight were present king james the first the queen prince and diverse of the nobility  and though the bear which killed the child escaped at this time he was afterward by command of the king baited to death with dogs upon a stage  there was a spaniel dog for some offense cast into the lions den but the lion did not attempt to hurt him and this dog continued in the den with the lion several years and there died  the end of the first book book ii chap i introduction from the lions tower you pass on over the bridge right before you when presently you will come to the warders who are upon duty at their ward or gate  they are easily known by their peculiar dress upon their heads they wear slta crowned caps of black velvet with a band of ribbons of diverse colors their coats are scarlet laced with gold round their skirts sleeves and up their sides and round their wastes a broad laced belt with the kings badge of silver gilt with gold upon their breasts and backs representing the thistle rose and crown and g r in capitals  there are forty warders belonging to the tower ten of whom are upon duty at a time these gentlemen have authority to examine all persons coming into the tower and one of them will attend such as are going to see the curiosities to show and explain them without whose assistance it would be difficult to find them out or to understand them rightly for this service when you dismiss the warder it is customary to give him a gratuity according to your own generosity  the chief curiosities after you have seen the lions etc  which costs sixpence each are the spanish armada price twopence each the small armoury price threepence each the train of artillery price twopence each the horse armoury price twopence each the crown and the rest of his majestys regalia price one shilling each note if any person goes singly he pays eighteenpence to see the regalia and to see any of the others he pays double of the common prices no person is obliged to see all but only so many of them as he pleases  lastly the royal mint where all the gold silver and copper coins and medals are struck to see this there is no price demanded but what you please to give the workmen this curiosity cannot at all times be shown the workmen are not at work or the favor is not granted at least to see some part of it and c  chap ii of the invincible spanish armada of philip ii king of spain it may not be improper to inform my young readers that in the year      philip ii king of spain having prepared a powerful navy which consisted of one hundred and thirty ships with which he designed to invade and conquer england thought himself so sure of victory that his fleet was christened by the pope the invincible armada which signifies a strength that could not be overcome  the great queen elizabeth hearing of this vast armament instead of being dismayed like a valiant princess ordered a strong fleet to be fitted out with all possible expedition and gave the command of it to sir francis drake and other great and valiant commanders and notwithstanding the enemy was greatly superior in number and strength of ships the english engaged the spanish fleet upon our own coasts and after nine or ten days fight gained a most glorious victory taking spanish armada burning and sinking eighty of their ships in which were killed thirteen thousand five hundred of their men and above two thousand were taken prisoners  at this ever memorable victory were taken various instruments of war with which the spaniards intended to have tortured the poor english had they been so unfortunate as to have been overcome by that haughty and cruel nation  and they are here treasured up as a noble trophy of old english valor and are a constant lesson from generation to generation to britains sons of what their forefathers did to defend their country against spanish bondage and stir them up to emulation  chap iii of the arms etc taken from the spaniards in queen elizabeths time      and other curiosities you are first shown a number of pikes each six yards long with velvet holdings about their middle the steel points were gilt with gold upon some of which the gilding is still visible the spanish dons were so sure of conquest that they spared no cost in equipping themselves because they intended the english should pay for all  over head hangs a large number of spanish pistols and targets which were the only firearems they had then in use and which were discharged with a match one of these lies in a window below for the curious to examine  next you see a parcel of spanish lances of a prodigious size with which those polite people designed after they had conquered the english to have bled them with to prevent their falling into fevers queen elizabeth being always tender of her subjects thought those instruments would make too large an orifice therefore ordered them to be disarmed of such dangerous tools which was quickly performed by her gallant captains  near to the last are a great many frightful weapons resembling billhooks but a great deal larger  next a parcel of spanish poleaxes with three or four tangs at one end at the other a sharp point  then you are shown a small train of artillery consisting of about ten pretty little cannon in carriages all ranged inn beautiful order they were a present from the city of london to king charles the first when he was a child for him to learn the art of war by  two of the danes clubs each six foot long desperate rate weapons these we are told are of great antiquity and that they have been in the tower ever since it was built the people whose custody they are now in call them the womens weapons because they say in those times above eight hundred years ago the women conspired against the danes and destroyed thirty thousand by cutting their throats etc for which reason they tell you the women have ever since had the wall of the man the upper end of the table and the first cut  next a cruel instrument called a spanish cravat with which those people designed to torture the english in this their necks hands and feet were to be confined in such a barbarous manner that the poor sufferers must have undergone the most exquisite tortures till either they were starved to death or expired through pain of their great torment  near to the last stands a shield made of the skin of a rhinoceros which was a present from the great mogul to king henry the seventh  three ancient spanish spados or swords of different sizes  some of the first chainshot said to be invented by admiral drake for tearing of rigging etc  here is likewise shown an ill shaped old axe the same with which anne of bullen was beheaded by order of king henry the eighth she was mother to queen elizabeth and with the same axe the earl of essex was beheaded in queen elizabeths time
