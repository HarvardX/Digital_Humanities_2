works on government     a defence of the constitutions of government of the united states of america chapter first marchamont nedham the right constitution of a commonwealth examined the english nation for their improvements in the theory of government has at least more merit with the human race than any other among the moderns the late most beautiful and liberal speculations of many writers in various parts of europe are manifestly derived from english sources americans too ought for ever to acknowledge their obligations to english writers or rather have as good a right to indulge a pride in the recollection of them as the inhabitants of the three kingdoms the original plantation of our country was occasioned her continual growth has been promoted and her present liberties have been established by these generous theories there have been three periods in the history of england in which the principles of government have been anxiously studied   and very valuable productions published which at this day if they are not wholly forgotten in their native country are perhaps more frequently read abroad than at home the first of these periods was that of the reformation as early as the writings of machiavel himself who is called the great restorer of the true politics the shorte treatise of politicke power and of the true obedience which subjects owe to kyngs and other civile governors with an exhortation to all true natural englishemen compyled by john poynet d d was printed in      and contains all the essential principles of liberty which were afterwards dilated on by sidney and locke this writer is clearly for a mixed government in three equiponderant branches as appears by these words— in some countreyes they were content to be governed and have the laws executed by one king or judge in some places by many of the best sorte in some places by the people of the lowest sorte and in some places also by the king nobilitie and the people all together and these diverse kyndes of states or policies had their distincte names as where one ruled a monarchie where many of the best aristocratie and where the multitude democratie and where all together that is a king the nobilitie and commons a mixte state and which men by long continuance have judged to be the best sort of all for where that mixte state was exercised there did the commonwealthe longest continue the second period was the interregnum and indeed the whole interval between    0 and    0 in the course of those twenty years not only ponnet and others were reprinted but harrington milton the vindiciæ contra tyrannos and a multitude of others came upon the stage the third period was the revolution in      which produced sidney locke hoadley trenchard gordon plato redivivus who is also clear for three equipollent branches in the mixture and others without number the discourses of sidney were indeed written before but the same causes produced his writings and the revolution americans should make collections of all these speculations to be preserved as the most precious relics of antiquity both for curiosity and use there is one indispensable rule to be observed in the perusal of all of them and that is to consider the period   in which they were written the circumstances of the times and the personal character as well as the political situation of the writer such a precaution as this deserves particular attention in examining a work printed first in the mercurius politicus a periodical paper published in defence of the commonwealth and reprinted in      by marchamont nedham under the title of the excellency of a free state or the right constitution of a commonwealth  the nation had not only a numerous nobility and clergy at that time disgusted and a vast body of the other gentlemen as well as of the common people desirous of the restoration of the exiled royal family but many writers explicitly espoused the cause of simple monarchy and absolute power among whom was hobbes a man however unhappy in his temper or detestable for his principles equal in genius and learning to any of his contemporaries others were employed in ridiculing the doctrine that laws and not men should govern it was contended that to say that laws do or can govern is to amuse ourselves with a form of speech as when we say time or age or death does such a thing that the government is not in the law but in the person whose will gives a being to that law that the perfection of monarchy consists in governing by a nobility weighty enough to keep the people under yet not tall enough in any particular person to measure with the prince and by a moderate army kept up under the notion of guards and garrisons which may be sufficient to strangle all seditions in the cradle by councils not such as are coördinate with the prince but purely of advice and despatch with power only to persuade not limit the princes will in such a situation writers on the side of liberty thought themselves obliged to consider what was then practicable not abstractedly what was the best they felt the   necessity of leaving the monarchical and aristocratical orders out of their schemes of government because all the friends of those orders were their enemies and of addressing themselves wholly to the democratical party because they alone were their friends at least there appears no other hypothesis on which to account for the crude conceptions of milton and nedham the latter in his preface discovers his apprehensions and feelings too clearly to be mistaken in these words—i believe none will be offended with this following discourse but those that are enemies to public welfare let such be offended still it is not for their sake that i publish this ensuing treatise but for your sakes that have been noble patriots fellow soldiers and sufferers for the liberties and freedoms of your country as m turgots idea of a commonwealth in which all authority is to be collected into one centre and that centre the nation is supposed to be precisely the project of marchamont nedham and probably derived from his book and as the excellency of a free state is a valuable morsel of antiquity well known in america where it has many partisans it may be worth while to examine it especially as it contains every semblance of argument which can possibly be urged in favor of the system as it is not only the popular idea of a republic both in france and england but is generally intended by the words republic commonwealth and popular state when used by english writers even those of the most sense taste and learning marchamont nedham lays it down as a fundamental principle and an undeniable rule that the people that is such as shall be successively chosen to represent the people are the best keepers of their own liberties and that for many reasons first because they never think of usurping over other mens rights but mind which way to preserve their own our first attention should be turned to the proposition itself—the people are the best keepers of their own liberties but who are the people such as shall be successively chosen to represent them here is a confusion both of words and ideas which though it may pass with the generality of readers in a fugitive pamphlet or with a majority of auditors in a popular harangue ought for that very reason to be as carefully avoided in politics as it is in philosophy or mathematics if by the people is meant the whole   body of a great nation it should never be forgotten that they can never act consult or reason together because they cannot march five hundred miles nor spare the time nor find a space to meet and therefore the proposition that they are the best keepers of their own liberties is not true they are the worst conceivable they are no keepers at all they can neither act judge think or will as a body politic or corporation if by the people is meant all the inhabitants of a single city they are not in a general assembly at all times the best keepers of their own liberties nor perhaps at any time unless you separate from them the executive and judicial power and temper their authority in legislation with the maturer counsels of the one and the few if it is meant by the people as our author explains himself a representative assembly such as shall be successively chosen to represent the people still they are not the best keepers of the peoples liberties or their own if you give them all the power legislative executive and judicial they would invade the liberties of the people at least the majority of them would invade the liberties of the minority sooner and oftener than an absolute monarchy such as that of france spain or russia or than a wellchecked aristocracy like venice bern or holland an excellent writer has said somewhat incautiously that a people will never oppress themselves or invade their own rights this compliment if applied to human nature or to mankind or to any nation or people in being or in memory is more than has been merited if it should be admitted that a people will not unanimously agree to oppress themselves it is as much as is ever and more than is always true all kinds of experience show that great numbers of individuals do oppress great numbers of other individuals that parties often if not always oppress other parties and majorities almost universally minorities all that this observation can mean then consistently with any color of fact is that the people will never unanimously agree to oppress themselves but if one party agrees to oppress another or the majority the minority the people still oppress themselves for one part of them oppress another the people never think of usurping over other mens rights what can this mean does it mean that the people never unanimously think of usurping over other mens rights this would be trifling for there would by the supposition be no   other mens rights to usurp but if the people never jointly nor severally think of usurping the rights of others what occasion can there be for any government at all are there no robberies burglaries murders adulteries thefts nor cheats is not every crime a usurpation over other mens rights is not a great part i will not say the greatest part of men detected every day in some disposition or other stronger or weaker more or less to usurp over other mens rights there are some few indeed whose whole lives and conversations show that in every thought word and action they conscientiously respect the rights of others there is a larger body still who in the general tenor of their thoughts and actions discover similar principles and feelings yet frequently err if we should extend our candor so far as to own that the majority of men are generally under the dominion of benevolence and good intentions yet it must be confessed that a vast majority frequently transgress and what is more directly to the point not only a majority but almost all confine their benevolence to their families relations personal friends parish village city county province and that very few indeed extend it impartially to the whole community now grant but this truth and the question is decided if a majority are capable of preferring their own private interest or that of their families counties and party to that of the nation collectively some provision must be made in the constitution in favor of justice to compel all to respect the common right the public good the universal law in preference to all private and partial considerations the proposition of our author then should be reversed and it should have been said that they mind so much their own that they never think enough of others suppose a nation rich and poor high and low ten millions in number all assembled together not more than one or two millions will have lands houses or any personal property if we take into the account the women and children or even if we leave them out of the question a great majority of every nation is wholly destitute of property except a small quantity of clothes and a few trifles of other movables would mr nedham be responsible that if all were to be decided by a vote of the majority the eight or nine millions who have no property would not think of usurping over the rights of the one or two millions who have property is surely   a right of mankind as really as liberty perhaps at first prejudice habit shame or fear principle or religion would restrain the poor from attacking the rich and the idle from usurping on the industrious but the time would not be long before courage and enterprise would come and pretexts be invented by degrees to countenance the majority in dividing all the property among them or at least in sharing it equally with its present possessors debts would be abolished first taxes laid heavy on the rich and not at all on the others and at last a downright equal division of every thing be demanded and voted what would be the consequence of this the idle the vicious the intemperate would rush into the utmost extravagance of debauchery sell and spend all their share and then demand a new division of those who purchased from them the moment the idea is admitted into society that property is not as sacred as the laws of god and that there is not a force of law and public justice to protect it anarchy and tyranny commence if thou shalt not covet and thou shalt not steal were not commandments of heaven they must be made inviolable precepts in every society before it can be civilized or made free if the first part of the proposition namely that the people never think of usurping over other mens rights cannot be admitted is the second namely they mind which way to preserve their own better founded there is in every nation and people under heaven a large proportion of persons who take no rational and prudent precautions to preserve what they have much less to acquire more indolence is the natural character of man to such a degree that nothing but the necessities of hunger thirst and other wants equally pressing can stimulate him to action until education is introduced in civilized societies and the strongest motives of ambition to excel in arts trades and professions are established in the minds of all men until this emulation is introduced the lazy savage holds property in too little estimation to give himself trouble for the preservation or acquisition of it in societies the most cultivated and polished vanity fashion and folly prevail over every thought of ways to preserve their own they seem rather to study what means of luxury dissipation and extravagance they can invent to get rid of it the case is far otherwise among kings and grandees says  0 our author as all nations in the world have felt to some purpose that is in other words kings and grandees think of usurping over other mens rights but do not mind which way to preserve their own it is very easy to flatter the democratical portion of society by making such distinctions between them and the monarchical and aristocratical but flattery is as base an artifice and as pernicious a vice when offered to the people as when given to the others there is no reason to believe the one much honester or wiser than the other they are all of the same clay their minds and bodies are alike the two latter have more knowledge and sagacity derived from education and more advantages for acquiring wisdom and virtue as to usurping others rights they are all three equally guilty when unlimited in power no wise man will trust either with an opportunity and every judicious legislator will set all three to watch and control each other we may appeal to every page of history we have hitherto turned over for proofs irrefragable that the people when they have been unchecked have been as unjust tyrannical brutal barbarous and cruel as any king or senate possessed of uncontrollable power the majority has eternally and without one exception usurped over the rights of the minority they naturally move says nedham within the circle of domination as in their proper centre when writers on legislation have recourse to poetry their images may be beautiful but they prove nothing this however has neither the merit of a brilliant figure nor of a convincing argument the populace the rabble the canaille move as naturally in the circle of domination whenever they dare as the nobles or a king nay although it may give pain truth and experience force us to add that even the middling people when uncontrolled have moved in the same circle and have not only tyrannized over all above and all below but the majority among themselves has tyrannized over the minority and count it no less security than wisdom and policy to brave it over the people declamatory flourishes although they may furnish a mob with watchwords afford no reasonable conviction to the understanding what is meant by braving it in the history of holland you will see the people braving it over the de witts and in that    of florence siena bologna pistoia and the rest over many others cæsar crassus and another made a contract with each other that nothing should be done without the concurrence of all three societatem iniere ne quid ageretur in republica quod displicuisset ulli e tribus nedham could not have selected a less fortunate example for his purpose since there never was a more arrant creature of the people than cæsar no not even catiline wat tyler massaniello or shays the people created cæsar on the ruins of the senate and on purpose to usurp over the rights of others but this example among innumerable others is very apposite to our purpose it happens universally when the people in a body or by a single representative assembly attempt to exercise all the powers of government they always create three or four idols who make a bargain with each other first to do nothing which shall displease any one these hold this agreement until one thinks himself able to disembarrass himself of the other two then they quarrel and the strongest becomes single tyrant but why is the name of pompey omitted who was the third of this triumvirate because it would have been too unpopular it would have too easily confuted his argument and have turned it against himself to have said that this association was between pompey cæsar and crassus against cato the senate the constitution and liberty which was the fact can you find a people who will never be divided in opinion who will be always unanimous the people of rome were divided as all other people ever have been and will be into a variety of parties and factions pompey crassus and cæsar at the head of different parties were jealous of each other their divisions strengthened the senate and its friends and furnished means and opportunities of defeating many of their ambitious designs cæsar perceived it and paid his court both to pompey and crassus in order to hinder them from joining the senate against him he separately represented the advantage which their enemies derived from their misunderstandings and the ease with which if united they might concert among themselves all affairs of the republic gratify every friend and disappoint every    enemy the other example of augustus lepidus and antony is equally unfortunate both are demonstrations that the people did think of usurping others rights and that they did not mind any way to preserve their own the senate was now annihilated many of them murdered augustus lepidus and antony were popular demagogues who agreed together to fleece the flock between them until the most cunning of the three destroyed the other two fleeced the sheep alone and transmitted the shears to a line of tyrants how can this writer say then that while the government remained untouched in the peoples hands every particular man lived safe the direct contrary is true every man lived safe only while the senate remained as a check and balance to the people the moment that control was destroyed no man was safe while the government remained untouched in the various orders the consuls senate and people mutually balancing each other it might be said with some truth that no man could be undone unless a true and satisfactory reason was rendered to the world for his destruction but as soon as the senate was destroyed and the government came untouched into the peoples hands no man lived safe but the triumvirs and their tools any man might be and multitudes of the best men were undone without rendering any reason to the world for their destruction but the will the fear or the revenge of some tyrant these popular leaders in our authors own language saved and destroyed depressed and advanced whom they pleased with a wet finger the second argument to prove that the people in their successive single assemblies are the best keepers of their own liberties is— because it is ever the peoples care to see that authority be so constituted that it shall be rather a burden than benefit to those that undertake it and be qualified with such slender advantages of profit or pleasure that men shall reap little by the enjoyment the happy consequence whereof is this that none but honest generous and public spirits will then desire to be in authority and that only for the common good hence it was that in the infancy of the roman liberty there was no canvassing of voices    but single and plainhearted men were called entreated and in a manner forced with importunity to the helm of government in regard of that great trouble and pains that followed the employment thus cincinnatus was fetched out of the field from his plough and placed much against his will in the sublime dignity of dictator so the noble camillus and fabius and curius were with much ado drawn from the recreation of gardening to the trouble of governing and the consulyear being over they returned with much gladness again to their private employment the first question which would arise in the mind of an intelligent and attentive reader would be whether this were burlesque and a republic travesty but as the principle of this second reason is very pleasing to a large body of narrow spirits in every society and as it has been adopted by some respectable authorities without sufficient consideration it may be proper to give it a serious investigation the people have in some countries and seasons made their services irksome and it is popular with some to make authority a burden but what has been the consequence to the people their service has been deserted and they have been betrayed those very persons who have flattered the meanness of the stingy by offering to serve them gratis and by purchasing their suffrages have carried the liberties and properties of their constituents to market and sold them for very handsome private profit to the monarchical and aristocratical portions of society and so long as the rule of making their service a burthen is persisted in so long will the people be served with the same kind of address and fidelity by hypocritical pretences to disinterested benevolence and patriotism until their confidence is gained their affections secured and their enthusiasm excited and by knavish bargain and sale of their cause and interest afterwards but although there is always among the people a party who are justly chargeable with meanness and avarice envy and ingratitude and this party has sometimes been a majority who have literally made their service burdensome yet this is not the general character of the people a more universal fault is too much affection confidence and gratitude not to such as really serve them whether with or against their inclinations but to those who flatter their inclinations and gain their hearts honest and    generous spirits will disdain to deceive the people and if the public service is wilfully rendered burdensome they will really be averse to be in it but hypocrites enough will be found who will pretend to be also loth to serve and feign a reluctant consent for the public good while they mean to plunder in every way they can conceal there are conjunctures when it is the duty of a good citizen to hazard and sacrifice all for his country but in ordinary times it is equally the duty and interest of the community not to suffer it every wise and free people like the romans will establish the maxim to suffer no generous action for the public to go unrewarded can our author be supposed to be sincere in recommending it as a principle of policy to any nation to render her service in the army navy or in council a burden an unpleasant employment to all her citizens would he depend upon finding human spirits enough to fill public offices who would be sufficiently elevated in patriotism and general benevolence to sacrifice their ease health time parents wives children and every comfort convenience and elegance of life for the public good is there any religion or morality that requires this which permits the many to live in affluence and ease while it obliges a few to live in misery for their sakes the people are fond of calling public men their servants and some are not able to conceive them to be servants without making them slaves and treating them as planters treat their negroes but good masters have a care how you use your power you may be tyrants as well as public officers it seems according to our author himself that honesty and generosity of spirit and the passion for the public good were not motives strong enough to induce his heroes to desire to be in public life they must be called entreated and forced by single and plainhearted men he means the same no doubt with those described by the other expressions honest generous and public spirits cincinnatus camillus fabius and curius were men as simple and as generous as any and these all by his own account had a strong aversion to the public service either these great characters must be supposed to have practised the nolo episcopari to have held up a fictitious aversion for what they really desired or we must allow their reluctance to have been sincere if counterfeit these examples do not deserve our imitation if sincere they will    never be followed by men enough to carry on the business of the world the glory of these roman characters cannot be obscured nor ought the admiration of their sublime virtues to be diminished but such examples are as rare among statesmen as homers and miltons are among poets a free people of common sense will not depend upon finding a sufficient number of such characters at any one time still less a succession of them for any long duration for the support of their liberties to make a law that armies should be led senates counselled negotiations conducted by none but such characters would be to decree that the business of the world should come to a full stand and it must have stood as still in those periods of the roman history as at this hour for such characters were nearly as scarce then as they are now the parallels of lysander pericles themistocles and cæsar are much easier to find in history than those of camillus fabius and curius if the latter were with much difficulty drawn from their gardens to government and returned with pleasure at the end of the consular year to their rural amusements the former are as ardent to continue in the public service and if the public will not legally reward them they plunder the public to reward themselves the father of themistocles had more aversion to public life than cincinnatus and to moderate the propensity of his son who ardently aspired to the highest offices of the state pointed to the old galleys rolling in the docks there says he see the old statesmen worn out in the service of their country thus always neglected when no longer of use yet the sons ardor was not abated though he was not one of those honest spirits that aimed only at the public good pericles too though his fortune was small and the honest emoluments of his office very moderate discovered no such aversion to the service on the contrary he entered into an emulation in prodigality with cimon who was rich in order equally to dazzle the eyes of the multitude to make himself the soul of the republic and master of the affections of the populace to enable them to attend the public assemblies and theatrical representations for his purposes he lavished his donations yet he was so far from being honest and generous and    aiming solely at the public good that he availed himself of the riches of the state to supply his extravagance of expense and made it an invariable maxim to sacrifice every thing to his own ambition when the public finances were exhausted to avoid accounting for the public money he involved his country in a war with sparta but we must not rely upon these general observations alone let us descend to a particular consideration of our authors examples in every one of which he is very unfortunate the retirement of cincinnatus to the country was not his choice but his necessity cæso his son had offended the people by an outrageous opposition to their honest struggles for liberty and had been fined for a crime the father rather than let his bondsmen suffer paid the forfeiture of his recognizance reduced himself to poverty and the necessity of retiring to his spade or plough  did the people entreat and force him back to rome no it was the senate in opposition to the people who dreaded his high aristocratical principles his powerful connections and personal resentments nor did he discover the least reluctance to the service ordained him by the senate but accepted it without hesitation all this appears in livy clearly contradictory to every sentiment of our author at another time when disputes ran so high between the tribunes and the senate that seditions were apprehended the senators exerted themselves in the centuries for the election of cincinnatus to the great alarm and terror of the people† cincinnatus in short although his moral character and private life were irreproachable among the plebeians appears to have owed his appointments to office not to them but the senate and not for popular qualities but for aristocratical ones and the determined opposition of himself and his whole family to the people he appears to have been forced into service by no party but to have been as willing as he was an able instrument of the senate    in order to see the inaptitude of this example in another point of view let the question be asked what would have been the fortune of cincinnatus if nedhams right constitution had then been the government of rome the answer must be that he would have lost his election most probably even into the representative assembly most certainly he would never have been consul dictator or commander of armies because he was unpopular this example then is no argument in favor of our author but a strong one against him if we recollect the character and actions of curius we shall find them equally conclusive in favor of balanced government and against our authors plan manius curius dentatus in the year of rome     obtained as consul a double triumph for forcing the samnites to sue for peace this nation having their country laid waste sent their principal men as ambassadors to offer presents to curius for his credit with the senate in order to their obtaining favorable terms of peace they found him sitting on a stool before the fire in his little house in the country and eating his dinner out of a wooden dish they opened their deputation and offered him the gold and silver he answered them politely but refused the presents he then added somewhat which at this day does not appear so very polished i think it glorious to command the owners of gold not to possess it myself and which passion do you think is the worst the love of gold or this pride and ambition his whole estate was seven acres of land and he said once in assembly that a man who was not contented with seven acres of land was a pernicious citizen as we pass it may be proper to remark the difference of times and circumstances how few in america could escape the censure of pernicious citizens if curiuss rule were established is there one of our yeomen contented with seven acres how many are discontented with seventy times seven examples then drawn from times of extreme poverty and a state of a very narrow territory should be applied to our circumstances with great discretion as long as the aristocracy lasted a few of those rigid characters appeared from time to time in the roman senate cato was one to the last and went expressly to visit    the house of curius in the country of the sabines was never weary of viewing it contemplating the virtues of its ancient owner and desiring warmly to imitate them but though declamatory writers might call the conduct of curius exactissima romanæ frugalitatis norma it was not the general character even of the senators at that time avarice raged like a fiery furnace in the minds of creditors most of whom were patricians and equal avarice and injustice in the minds of plebeians who instead of aiming at moderating the laws against debtors would be content with nothing short of a total abolition of debts only two years after this namely in     so tenacious were the patricians and senators of all the rigor of their power over debtors that veturius the son of a consul who had been reduced by poverty to borrow money at an exorbitant interest was delivered up to his creditor and that infamous usurer c plotius exacted from him all the services of a slave and the senate would grant no relief and when he attempted to subject his slave to a brutal passion which the laws did not tolerate and scourged him with rods because he would not submit all the punishment which the consuls and senate would impose on plotius was imprisonment this anecdote proves that the indifference to wealth was far from being general either among patricians or plebeians and that it was confined to a few patrician families whose tenaciousness of the maxims and manners of their ancestors proudly transmitted it from age to age in     curius was consul a second time when the plague and a war with pyrrhus had lasted so long as to threaten the final ruin of the nation and obliged the centuries to choose a severe character not because he was beloved but because his virtues and abilities alone could save the state the austere character of the consul was accompanied by correspondent austerities in this time of calamity in the censors who degraded several knights and senators and among the rest rufinus who had been twice consul and once dictator for extravagance and luxury pyrrhus was defeated and curius again triumphed and because a continuance of the war with pyrrhus was expected he was again elected consul in     in   0 he was censor after all he was so little beloved that an accusation was brought against him for having converted the public spoils to his own use    and he was not acquitted till he had sworn that no part of them had entered his house but a wooden bowl which he used in sacrifice all these sublime virtues and magnanimous actions of curius make nothing in favor of nedham he was a patrician a senator and a consul he had been taught by aristocratical ancestors formed in an aristocratical school and was full of aristocratical pride he does not appear to have been a popular man either among the senators in general  or the plebeians rufinus his rival with his plate and luxury appears by his being appointed dictator to have been more beloved notwithstanding that the censors on the prevalence of curiuss party in a time of distress were able to disgrace him it was in     that the senate received an embassy from ptolemy philadelphus king of egypt and sent four of the principal men in rome q fabius gurges c fabius pistor numer fabius pistor and q ogulnius ambassadors to egypt to return the compliment q fabius who was at the head of the embassy was prince of the senate and on his return reported their commission to the senate said that the king had received them in the most obliging and honorable manner that he had sent them magnificent presents on their arrival which they had desired him to excuse them from accepting that at a feast before they took leave the king had ordered crowns of gold to be given them which they placed upon his statues the next day that on the day of their departure the king had given them presents far more magnificent than the former reproaching them in a most obliging manner for not having accepted them these they had accepted with most profound respect not to offend the king but that on their arrival in rome they had deposited them in the public treasury that ptolemy had received the alliance of the roman people with joy the senate were much pleased and gave thanks to the ambassadors for having rendered the manners of the romans venerable to foreigners by their sincere disinterestedness but decreed that the rich presents deposited in the treasury should be restored to them and the people expressed  0 their satisfaction in this decree these presents were undoubtedly immensely rich but where was the peoples care to make the service a burden thanks of the senate are no burdens immense presents in gold and silver voted out of the treasury into the hands of the ambassadors were no slender advantages of profit or pleasure at a time when the nation was extremely poor and no individual in it very rich but moreover three of these ambassadors were fabii of one of those few simple frugal aristocratical families who neither made advantage of the law in favor of creditors to make great profits out of the people by exorbitant usury on one hand nor gave largesses to the people to bribe their affection on the other so that although they were respected and esteemed by all they were not hated nor much beloved by any and such is the fate of men of such simple manners at this day in all countries our authors great mistake lies in his quoting examples from a balanced government as proofs in favor of a government without a balance the senate and people were at this time checks on each others avarice the people were the electors into office but none till very lately could be chosen but patricians none of the senators who enriched themselves by plundering the public of lands or goods or by extravagant usury from the people could expect their votes to be consuls or other magistrates and there was no commerce or other means of enriching themselves all therefore who were ambitious of serving in magistracies were obliged to be poor to this constant check and balance between the senate and people the production and the continuance of these frugal and simple patrician characters and families appear to be owing if our author meant another affair of     it is still less to his purpose or rather still more conclusively against him it was so far from being true in the year     the most simple and frugal period of roman history that none but honest generous and public spirits desired to be in authority and that only for the common good and that there was no canvassing for voices that the most illustrious romans offered themselves as candidates for the consulship and it was only the distress and imminent danger of the city from the etrurians and samnites and a universal alarm that induced the citizens to cast their eyes on fabius who did not stand when he saw the suffrages run for him he arose and spoke why should he be solicited an old    man exhausted with labors and satiated with rewards to take the command that neither the strength of his body or mind were the same he dreaded the caprice of fortune some divinity might think his success too great too constant too much for any mortal he had succeeded to the glory of his ancestors and he saw himself with joy succeeded by others that great honors were not wanting at rome to valor nor valor to honors it was extreme age not the slender advantages of honors that occasioned fabiuss disinclination as it did that of cincinnatus on another occasion this refusal however only augmented the desire of having him fabius then required the law to be read which forbade the reëlection of a consul before ten years the tribunes proposed that it should be dispensed with as all such laws in favor of rotations ever are when the people wish it fabius asked why laws were made if they were to be broken or dispensed with by those who made them and declared that the laws governed no longer but were governed by men† the centuries however persevered and fabius was chosen may the gods make your choice successful says the old hero dispose of me as you will but grant me one favor decius for my colleague a person worthy of his father and of you and one who will live in perfect harmony with me there is no such stinginess of honors on the part of the people nor any such reluctance to the service for want of them as our author pretends it was old age and respect to the law only and one would think the sentiments and language of fabius sufficiently aristocratical his glory and the glory of his ancestors and posterity seem to be uppermost in his thoughts and that disinterest was not so prevalent in general appears this very year for a great number of citizens were cited by the ædiles to take their trials for possessing more land than the law permitted all this rigor was necessary to check the avidity of the citizens but do you suppose americans would make or submit    to a law to limit to a small number or to any number the acres of land which a man might possess fabius fought conquered and returned to rome to preside in the election of the new consuls and there appear circumstances which show that the great zeal for him was chiefly aristocratical the first centuries all aristocratics continued him appius claudius of consular dignity and surely not one of our authors honest generous and public spirits nor one of his single and plainhearted men but a warm interested and ambitious man offered himself a candidate and employed all his credit and that of all the nobility to be chosen consul with fabius less as he said for his private interest than for the honor of the whole body of the patricians whom he was determined to reëstablish in the possession of both consulships fabius declined as the year before but all the nobility surrounded his seat and entreated him to be sure but to do what why to rescue the consulship from the dregs and filth of the people to restore the dignity of consul and the order of patricians to their ancient aristocratical splendor fabius appears indeed to have been urged into the office of consul but by whom by the patricians and to keep out a plebeian the senate and people were checking each other struggling together for a point which the patricians could carry in no way but by violating the laws and forcing old fabius into power the tribunes had once given way from the danger of the times but this year they were not so disposed the patricians were still eager to repeat the irregularity but fabius although he declared he should be glad to assist them in obtaining two patrician consuls yet he would not violate the law so far as to nominate himself and no other patrician had interest enough to keep out l volumnius the plebeian who was chosen with appius claudius thus facts and events which were evidently created by a struggle between two orders in a balanced government are adduced as proofs in favor of a government with only one order and without a balance such severe frugality such perfect disinterestedness in public characters appear only or at least most frequently in aristocratical governments whenever the constitution becomes democratical such austerities disappear entirely or at least lose their influence and the suffrages of the people and if an unmixed    and unchecked people ever choose such men it is only in times of distress and danger when they think no others can save them as soon as the danger is over they neglect these and choose others more plausible and indulgent there is so much pleasure in the contemplation of these characters that we ought by no means to forget camillus this great character was never a popular one to the senate and the patricians he owed his great employments and seems to have been selected for the purpose of opposing the people the popular leaders had no aversion for themselves or their families to public honors and offices with all their burdens in     p licinius calvus the first of the plebeian order who had ever been elected military tribune was about to be reëlected when he arose and said romans you behold only the shadow of licinius my strength hearing memory are all gone and the energy of my mind is no more suffer me to present my son to you and he held him by the hand the living image of him whom you honored first of all the plebeians with the office of military tribune i devote him educated in my principles to the commonwealth and shall be much obliged to you if you will grant him the honor in my stead accordingly the son was elected the military tribunes acted with great ardor and bravery but were defeated and rome was in a panic very artfully augmented by the patricians to give a pretext for taking the command out of plebeian hands camillus was created dictator by the senate and carried on the war with such prudence ability and success that he saw the richest city of italy that of veii was upon the point of falling into his hands with immense spoils he now felt himself embarrassed if he divided the spoils with a sparing hand among the soldiery he would draw upon himself their indignation and that of the plebeians in general if he distributed them too generously he should offend the senate for with all the boasted love of poverty of those times the senate and people the patricians and plebeians as bodies were perpetually wrangling about spoils booty and conquered lands which further shows that the real moderation was confined to a very few individuals or families camillus to spare himself reproach and envy dictator as he was wrote to the senate that by the favor of the gods his own exertions and the patience of the soldiers veii would soon be    in his hands and therefore he desired their directions what to do with the spoils the senate were of two opinions licinius was for giving notice to all the citizens that they might go and share in the plunder appius claudius would have it all brought into the public treasury or appropriated to the payment of the soldiers which would ease the people of taxes licinius replied that if that money should be brought to the treasury it would be the cause of eternal complaints murmurs and seditions the latter advice prevailed and the plunder was indiscriminate for the city of veii after a ten years siege in which many commanders had been employed was at last taken by camillus by stratagem and the opulence of it appeared so great that the dictator was terrified at his own good fortune and that of his country he prayed the gods if it must be qualified with any disgrace that it might fall upon him not the commonwealth this piety and patriotism however did not always govern camillus his triumph betrayed an extravagance of vanity more than bordering on profaneness he had the arrogance and presumption to harness four white horses in his chariot a color peculiar to jupiter and the sun an ambition more than roman more than human here the people were very angry with camillus for having too little reverence for religion the next moment they were still more incensed against him for having too much for he reminded them of the vow he had made to consecrate a tenth part of the spoils to apollo the people in short did not love camillus and the senate adored him because he opposed the multitude on all occasions without any reserve and appeared the most ardent and active in resisting their caprices it was easier to conquer enemies than to please citizens this mighty aristocratic grew so unpopular that one of the tribunes accused him before the people of applying part of the spoils of veii to his own use and finding upon consulting his friends that he had no chance of acquittal he went into voluntary banishment at ardea but he prayed to the gods to make his ungrateful country regret his absence he was tried in his absence and condemned in a fine had nedhams constitution existed at rome would camillus have taken veii or been made dictator or employed at all    certainly not characters much more plausible would have run him down or have obliged him to imitate all their indulgences in all these examples of cincinnatus curius fabius and camillus c our author quotes examples of virtues which grew up only in a few aristocratical families were cultivated by the emulation between the two orders in the state and by their struggles to check and balance each other to prove the excellence of a state where there is but one order no emulation and no balance this is like the conduct of a poet who should enumerate the cheerful rays and refulgent glories of the sun in a description of the beauties of midnight whether succession is or is not the grand preservative against corruption the united states of america have adopted this authors idea in this reason  so far as to make the governor and senate as well as the house of representatives annually elective they have therefore a clear claim to his congratulations they are that happy nation they ought to rejoice in the wisdom and justice of their trustees for certain limits and bounds are fixed to the powers in being by a declared succession of the supreme authority annually in the hands of the people it is still however problematical whether this succession will be the grand preservative against corruption or the grand inlet to it the elections of governors and senators are so guarded that there is room to hope but if we recollect the experience of past ages and other nations there are grounds to fear the experiment is made and will have fair play if corruption breaks in a remedy must be provided and what that remedy must be is well enough known to every man who thinks our authors examples are taken from the romans after the abolition of monarchy while the government was an aristocracy in the hands of a senate balanced only by the tribunes it is most certainly true that a standing authority in the hands of one the few or the many has an impetuous propensity to corruption and it is to control this tendency that three orders equal    and independent of each other are contended for in the legislature while power was in the hands of a senate according to our author the people were ever in danger of losing their liberty it would be nearer the truth to say that the people had no liberty or a very imperfect and uncertain liberty none at all before the institution of the tribunes and but an imperfect share afterwards because the tribunes were an unequal balance to the senate and so on the other side were the consuls sometimes in danger from kingly aspirers but whose fault was that the senate had a sufficient abhorrence of such conspiracies it was the people who encouraged the ambition of particular persons to aspire and who became their partisans mælius would have been made a king by the people if they had not been checked by the senate and so would manlius to be convinced of this it is necessary only to recollect the story spurius mælius a rich citizen of the equestrian order in the year before christ     and of rome the three hundred and fifteenth a time of scarcity and famine aspired to the consulship he bought a large quantity of corn in etruria and distributed it among the people becoming by his liberality the darling of the populace they attended his train wherever he went and promised him the consulship sensible however that the senators with the whole quinctian family at their head would oppose him he must use force and as ambition is insatiable and cannot be contented with what is attainable he conceived that to obtain the sovereignty would cost him no more trouble than the consulship the election came on and as he had not concerted all his measures t quinctius capitolinus and agrippa menenius lanatus were chosen by the influence of the senate l minucius was continued præfectus annonæ or superintendent of provisions his office obliged him to do in public the same that mælius affected to do in private so that the same kind of people frequented the houses of both from them he learned the transactions at mæliuss and informed the senate that arms were carried into his house where he held assemblies made harangues and was taking measures to make himself king and that the tribunes corrupted by money had divided among them the measures necessary to secure the success of the enterprise quinctius capitolinus proposed a dictator and quinctius cincinnatus for the quinctian family were omnipotent was appointed the    earnest entreaties and warm remonstrances of the whole senate prevailed on him to accept the trust after having long refused it not from any reluctance to public service but on account of his great age which made him believe himself incapable of it imploring the gods not to suffer his age to be a detriment to the public he consented to be nominated and immediately appointed ahala master of the horse appeared suddenly in the forum with his lictors rods and axes ascended the tribunal with all the ensigns of the sovereign authority and sent his master of horse to summon mælius before him mælius endeavored in his first surprise to escape a lictor seized him mælius complained that he was to be sacrificed to the intrigues of the senate for the good he had done the people the people grew tumultuous his partisans encouraged each other and took him by force from the lictor mælius threw himself into the crowd servius followed him run him through with his sword and returned covered with his blood to give an account to the dictator of what he had done you have done well said cincinnatus continue to defend your country with the same courage as you have now delivered it—macte virtute esto liberata republica the people being in great commotion the dictator calls an assembly and pronounces mælius justly killed with all our admiration for the moderation and modesty the simplicity and sublimity of his character it must be confessed that there is in the harangue of cincinnatus more of the aristocratical jealousy of kings and oligarchies and even more of contempt of the people than of a soul devoted to equal liberty or possessed of understanding to comprehend it it is the speech of a simple aristocratic possessed of a great soul it was a city in which such was its aristocratical jealousy of monarchy and oligarchy brutus had punished his son collatinus tarquinius in mere hatred of his name had been obliged to abdicate the consulship and banish himself spurius cassius had been put to death for intending to be king and the decemvirs had been punished with confiscation exile and death for their oligarchy in such a city of aristocratics mælius had conceived a hope of being a king et quis homo says cincinnatus and who was mælius quanquam nullam nobilitatem nullos honores nulla merita cuiquam ad dominationem pandere viam sed tamen claudios cassios consulatibus decemviratibus suis majorumque honoribus    splendore familiarum sustulisse animos quo nefas fuerit mælius therefore was not only a traitor but a monster his estate must be confiscated his house pulled down and the spot called æquimelium as a monument of the crime and the punishment† and his corn distributed to the populace very cheap in order to appease them this whole story is a demonstration of the oppression of the people under the aristocracy of the extreme jealousy of that aristocracy of kings of an oligarchy and of popular power of the constant secret wishes of the people to set up a king to defend them against the nobles and of their readiness to fall in with the views of any rich man who flattered them and set him up as a monarch but it is a most unfortunate instance for nedham it was not the people who defended the    republic against the design of mælius but the senate who defended it against both mælius and the people had rome been then governed by marchamont nedhams right constitution of a commonwealth mælius would infallibly have been made a king and have transmitted his crown to his heirs the necessity of an independent senate as a check upon the people is most apparent in this instance if the people had been unchecked or if they had only had the right of choosing a house of representatives unchecked they would in either case have crowned mælius at the critical moment when the gauls had approached the capitol with such silence as not to awaken the sentinels or even the dogs m manlius who had been consul three years before was awakened by the cry of the geese which by the sanctity of their consecration to juno had escaped with their lives in an extreme scarcity of provisions he hastened to the wall and beat down one of the enemy who had already laid hold of the battlement and whose fall from the precipice carried down several others who followed him with stones and darts the romans precipitated all the rest to the bottom of the rock manlius the next day received in a public assembly his praises and rewards officers and soldiers to testify their gratitude gave him their rations for one day both in corn and wine half a pound of corn and a quarter of a pint of wine ingens caritatis argumentum cum se quisque victu suo fraudans detractum corpori atque usibus necessariis ad honorem unius viri conferret says livy and in the year of rome     the commonwealth gave to manlius a house upon the capitol as a monument of his valor and his countrys gratitude in the year of rome   0 fiftyfive years after the execution of mælius and five years after the defence of the capitol from the attack of brennus manlius is suspected of ambition those who had hitherto excited or been excited by the people to faction had been plebeians manlius was a patrician of one of the most illustrious families he had been consul and acquired immortal glory by his military exploits and by saving the capitol he was in short the rival of camillus who had obtained two signal victories over the gauls and from the new birth of the city had been always in office either as dictator or military tribune and even when he was only tribune his colleagues considered  0 him as their superior and held it an honor to receive his orders as their chief in short by his own reputation the support of the quinctian family and the enthusiastic attachment to him he had inspired into the nation he was in fact and effect to all intents and purposes king in rome without the name but under the various titles of consul dictator or military tribune he treats said manlius even those created with powers equal to his own not as his colleagues but officers and substitutes to execute his orders the aristocratical livy and all the other aristocrats of rome accuse manlius of envy they say he could not bear such glory in a man whom he believed no worthier than himself he despised all the rest of the nobility the virtues services and honors of camillus alone excited his haughtiness and selfsufficiency and tortured his jealousy and pride he was enraged to see him always at the head of affairs and commanding armies it is certain that this practice of continuing camillus always at the head was inconsistent with the spirit of the constitution by which a rotation was established and the consuls who had the command of armies could remain in office but one year but this is the nature of an aristocratical assembly as well as of a democratical one some eminent spirit assisted by three or four families connected with him gains an ascendency and excites an enthusiasm and then the spirit and letter too of the constitution is made to give way to him in the case before us when camillus could not be consul he must be military tribune and when he could not be military tribune he must be dictator manlius is charged with envy and with vain speeches camillus could not have recovered rome from the gauls if i had not saved the capitol and citadel this was literally true but aristocratical historians must brand the character of manlius in order to depress the people and extol and adore that of camillus in order to elevate the senate and the nobles but there is no solid reason to believe that manlius envied camillus more than that camillus and the quinctian family were both envious and jealous of manlius the house upon the capitol was what the quinctian family could not bear the truth is an aristocratical despotism then ruled in rome and oppressed the people to a cruel decree and one is tempted to say that manlius was a better man than camillus or cincinnatus    though not so secret designing and profound a politician let the torrent of aristocratical history and philosophy roll as it will there were two parties one of the nobles and another of the people manlius from superior humanity and equity embraced the weaker camillus and the quinctii from family pride like that of lycurgus domineered over the stronger party of which they were in full possession manlius threw himself into the scale of the people he entered into close intimacy and strict union with the tribunes he spoke contemptuously of the senate and flattered the multitude jam aurâ non consilio ferri famæque magnæ malle quam bonæ esse says the aristocrat livy but let us examine his actions not receive implicitly the epithets of partial historians the roman laws allowed exorbitant interest for the loan of money an insolvent debtor by the decree of the judge was put into the hands of his creditor as his slave and might be scourged pinched or put to death at discretion the most execrable aristocratical law that ever existed among men a law so diabolical that an attempt to get rid of it at almost any rate was a virtue the city had been burnt and every man obliged to rebuild his house not only the poorest citizen but persons in middle life had been obliged to contract debts manlius seeing the rigor with which debts were exacted felt more commiseration than his peers for the people seeing a centurion who had distinguished himself by a great number of gallant actions in the field adjudged as a slave to his creditor his indignation as well as his compassion were aroused he inveighed against the pride of the patricians cruelty of the usurers deplored the misery of the people and expatiated on the merit of his brave companion in war surely no public oration was ever better founded he paid the centurions debt and set him at liberty with much ostentation to be sure and strong expressions of vanity but this was allowable by the custom and manners of the age the centurion too displayed his own merit and services as well as his gratitude to his deliverer manlius went further he caused the principal part of his own patrimony to be sold in order romans said he that i may not suffer any of you whilst i have any thing left to be adjudged to your creditors and made slaves this no doubt made him very popular but in the warmth of his democratical zeal he had been transported upon some occasion    to say in his own house that the senators had concealed or appropriated to their own use the gold intended for the ransom of the city from the gauls alluding probably to the fact for that gold had been deposited under the pedestal of jupiters statue manlius perhaps thought that this gold would be better employed to pay the debts of the people the senate recalled the dictator who repaired to the forum attended by all the senators ascended his tribunal and ordered his lictor to cite manlius before him manlius advanced with the people on one side was the senate with their clients and camillus at their head and on the other the people headed by manlius and each party ready for battle at the word of command and such a war will sooner or later be kindled in every state where the two parties of poor and rich patricians and plebeians nobles and commons senate and people call them by what names you will have not a third power in an independent executive to intervene moderate and balance them the artful dictator interrogated manlius only on the story of the gold manlius was embarrassed for the superstition of the people would have approved of the apparent piety of the senate in dedicating that treasure to jupiter though it was probably only policy to hide it he evaded the question and descanted on the artifice of the senate in making a war the pretext for creating a dictator while their real design was to employ that terrible authority against him and the people the dictator ordered him to prison the people were deeply affected but the authority was thought to be legal and the romans had prescribed bounds to themselves through which they dared not break the authority of the dictator and senate held them in such respect that neither the tribunes nor the people ventured to raise their eyes or open their mouths they put on mourning however and let their hair and beards grow and surrounded the prison with continual crowds manifesting every sign of grief and affliction they publicly said that the dictators triumph was over the people not the volsci and that all that was wanting was to have manlius dragged before his chariot every thing discovered symptoms of an immediate revolt here comes in a trait of aristocratical cunning ad captandum vulgus much more gross than any that had been practised by manlius to soften the people the senate became generous all    at once ordered a colony of two thousand citizens to be sent out assigning each of them two acres and a half of land though this was a largess it was confined to too small a number and was too moderate to take off all manliuss friends the artifice was perceived and when the abdication of the dictatorship of cossus had removed the fears of the people and set their tongues at liberty it had small effect in appeasing the people who reproached one another with ingratitude to their defenders for whom they expressed great zeal at first but always abandoned in time of danger witness cassius and mælius the people passed whole nights round the prison and threatened to break down the gates the senate set manlius at liberty to prevent the people from doing it the next year     dissensions were renewed with more acrimony than ever manlius whose spirit was not accustomed to humiliation was exasperated at his imprisonment cossus not having dared to proceed with the decision of cincinnatus against mælius and even the senate having been compelled to give way to the discontent of the people he was animated to attempt a reformation of the constitution how long said he to the people will you be ignorant of your own strength of which nature has not thought fit that beasts themselves should be ignorant count your number and that of your adversaries show them war and you will have peace let them see that you are prepared and they will immediately grant what you ask determine to be bold in undertaking or resolve to suffer the utmost injuries how long will you fix your eyes upon me must i repeat the fate of cassius and mælius i hope the gods will avert such a misfortune from me but those gods will not descend from heaven to defend me you must remove the danger from me shall your resistance to the senate always end in submission to the yoke that disposition is not natural to you it is the habit of suffering them to ride you which they have made their right and inheritance why are you so courageous against your enemies abroad and so soft and timorous in defence of your liberty at home yet you have hitherto always obtained what you demanded it is now time to undertake greater things you will find less difficulty in giving the senators a master than it has cost you to defend yourselves against them while they have had the power and the will to lord it over you dictators    and consuls must be abolished if you would have the people raise their heads unite with me prevent debtors from suffering the rigors of those odious laws i declare myself the patron and protector of the people if you are for exalting your chief by any more splendid title or illustrious dignity you will only augment his power for your support and to obtain your desires ego me patronum profiteor plebis vos si quo insigni magis imperii honorisve nomine vestrum appellabitis ducem eo utemini potentiore ad obtinenda ea quæ vultis this is a manifest intention of introducing a balance of three branches in this oration are all the principles of the english constitution the authority and power of the people to demolish one form of government and erect another according to their own judgment or will is clearly asserted the necessity of abolishing the dictators and consuls and giving to one chief magistrate the power to control the senate and protect the people is pointed out the senate is not proposed to be abolished nor the assemblies of the people nor their tribunes but the abolition of cruel debtors laws and redress of all the peoples grievances is to be the consequence the aristocracy was at that time a cruel tyranny the people felt it manlius acknowledged it both saw the necessity of newmodelling the constitution and introducing the three branches of romulus and lycurgus with better and clearer limitations and both were desirous of attempting it if in reading history the glosses and reflections of historians are taken implicitly a mistaken judgment will often be formed rome was an aristocracy and livy an aristocratical writer the constitution of government the principles prejudices and manners of the times should never be a moment out of sight if we believe the romans manlius was actuated only by envy and ambition but if we consider his actions and the form of government at the time we should be very apt to pronounce him both a greater and a better man than camillus to speak candidly there was a rivalry between the manlian and the quinctian families and the struggle was which should be the first family and who the first man and such a struggle exists not only in every empire monarchy republic but in every city town and village in the world but a philosopher might find as good reason to say that manlius was sacrificed to the envy    jealousy and ambition of camillus and the quinctii as that his popular endeavors for the plebeians sprung from envy of camillus and ambition to be the first man both were heads of parties and had all the passions incident to such a situation but if a judgment must be pronounced which was the best man and citizen there are very strong arguments in favor of manlius the name of king was abhorred by the romans but who and what had made it so brutus and his brother aristocrats at the expulsion of tarquin by appointing religious execrations to be pronounced in the name of the whole state and for all succeeding ages against such as should dare to aspire to the throne in this way any word or any thing may be made unpopular at any time and in any nation the senate were now able to set up the popular cry that manlius aspired to the throne this revived all the religious horror which their established execrations had made an habitual part of their natures and turned an ignorant superstitious populace against the best friend and the only friend they had in the republic the senate first talked of assassination and another ahala but to be very gentle they ordered the magistrates to take care that the commonwealth sustained no prejudice from the pernicious designs of manlius this was worse than private assassination it was an assassination by the senate it was judgment sentence and execution without trial the timid staring people were intimidated and even the tribunes caught the panic and offered to take the odium off the senate and cite manlius before the tribunal of the people themselves and accuse him in form it is impossible not to suspect nay fully to believe that these tribunes were bribed secretly by the senators they not only abandoned him with whom they had coöperated but they betrayed the people their constituents in the most infamous manner they said that in the present disposition manlius could not be openly attacked without interesting the people in his defence that violent measures would excite a civil war that it was necessary to separate the interests of manlius from those of the people they themselves would cite him before the tribunal of the people and accuse him in form nothing said the tribunes is less agreeable to the people than a king as soon as the multitude sees that your aim is not against them that from protectors they are become judges that their tribunes are the accusers and that a patrician is accused for having    aspired at the tyranny no interest will be so dear to them as that of their liberty their liberty the liberty of plebeians at that time what a prostitution of sacred terms yet gross as was this artifice it laid fast hold of those blind prejudices which patricians and aristocrats had inspired and duped effectually a stupid populace manlius was cited by the tribunes before the people in a mourning habit he appeared without a single senator relation or friend or even his own brothers to express concern for his fate and no wonder a senator and a person of consular dignity was never known to have been so universally abandoned but nothing can be more false than the reflections of historians upon this occasion so much did the love of liberty and the fear of being enslaved prevail in the hearts of the romans over all the ties of blood and nature it was not love of liberty but absolute fear which seized the people the senate had already condemned him by their vote and given their consuls dictatorial power against manlius and his friends the tribunes themselves were corrupted with bribes or fear and no man dared expose himself to aristocratical vengeance unprotected by the tribunes to prove that it was fear and not patriotism that restrained his relations and friends we need only recollect another instance when appius claudius the decemvir was imprisoned for treason much more clear than that of manlius and for conduct as wicked brutal and cruel as manliuss appears virtuous generous and humane the whole claudian family even c claudius his professed enemy appeared as suppliants before the judges imploring mercy for their relation his friends were not afraid why because claudius was an enemy and hater of the people and therefore popular with most of the patricians his crimes were aristocratical crimes therefore not only almost venial but almost virtues manliuss offence was love of the people and democratical misdemeanors are the most unpardonable of all that can be committed or conceived in a government where the demon of aristocracy domineers livy himself betrays a consciousness of the insufficiency of the evidence to prove manliuss guilt he says he can discover no proof nor any other charge of any crime of treason regni crimen except some assemblies of people seditious speeches generosity to debtors and the false insinuation of the concealment of the gold    but here we see what the people are when they meet in one assembly with the senators they dare not vote against the opinion or will of the nobles and patricians the aristocratical part of mankind ever did and ever will overawe the people and carry what votes they please in general when they meet together with the democratical part either in a collective or representative assembly thus it happened here superstition decided while in sight of the capitol their religious reverence for the abode of jupiter saved and inhabited by manlius was a counterbalance to their fears and veneration for the senators descended from the gods the people could not condemn him in sight of the capitol the tribunes knowing what was in them adjourned to another place the next day the capitol out of sight and the senators present condemned their deliverer and he died a sacrifice to the rancorous envy of his peers in the senate the consulate and patrician order who could not bear the sight of so splendid a distinction and elevation above themselves in any one of their order as manliuss house upon the capitol and his title of capitolinus homines prope quadringentos produxisse dicitur quibus sine fœnore expensas pecunias tulisset quorum bona venire quos duci addictos prohibuisset ad hæc decora quoque belli non commemorasse tantùm sed protulisse etiam conspicienda spolia hostium cæsorum ad triginta dona imperatorum ad quadraginta in quibus insignes duas murales coronas civicas octo ad hæc servatos ex hostibus cives produxisse inter quos c servilium magistrum equitum absentem nominatum et quum ea quoque quæ bello gesta essent pro fastigio rerum oratione etiam magnificâ facta dictis æquando memorasset nudasse pectus insigne cicatricibus bello acceptis et identidem capitolium spectans jovem deosque alios devocasse ad auxilium fortunarum suarum precatusque esse ut quam mentem sibi capitolinam arcem protegenti ad salutem populi romani dedissent eam populo romano in suo discrimine darent et orasse singulos universosque ut capitolium atque arcem intuentes ut ad deos immortales versi de se judicarent by removing the assembly from the campus martius where the people were assembled in centuries centuriatim to the grove petelinum lucum from whence the capitol could not be seen obstinatis animis triste judicium with gloomy obstinacy the fatal sentence was passed and the tribunes cast him down    from the tarpeian rock such was the catastrophe says livy of a man who if he had not lived in a free city would have merited fame he should have said if he had not lived in a simple aristocracy and alarmed the envy of his fellow aristocrats by superior merit services and rewards especially that most conspicuous mark his house upon the capitol and his new title  or agnomen capitolinus which mortal envy could not bear he was no sooner dead than the people repented and regretted him a sudden plague that broke out was considered as a judgment from heaven upon the nation for having polluted the capitol with the blood of its deliverer the history of manlius is an unanswerable argument against a simple aristocracy it is a proof that no mans liberty or life is safe in such a government the more virtue and merit he has the more in danger the more certain his destruction  it is a good argument against a standing sovereign and supreme authority in an hereditary aristocracy so far nedham quotes it pertinently and applies it justly but when the same example is cited to prove that the people in one supreme assembly successively chosen are the best keepers of their liberty so far from proving the proposition it proves the contrary because camillus the quinctii and manlius will all be chosen into that one assembly by the people the same emulation and rivalry the same jealousy and envy the same struggles of families and individuals for the first place will arise between them one of them will have the rich and great for his followers another the poor hence will arise two or three or more parties which will never cease to struggle till war and bloodshed decide which is the strongest whilst the struggle continues the laws are trampled on and the rights of the citizens invaded by all parties in turn and when it is decided the leader of the victorious army is emperor and despot nedham had forgotten the example of cassius which would have been equally apposite to prove a simple aristocracy a bad government and equally improper to prove that the people in    their supreme assemblies successively chosen are the best keepers of their liberty it is also equally proper to prove the contrary and to show that such a simple democracy is as dangerous as a simple aristocracy these examples all show that the natural principles of the english constitution were constantly at work among the roman people that nature herself was constantly calling out for two masters to control the senate one in a king or single person possessed of the executive power and the other in an equal representation of the people possessed of a negative on all the laws and especially on the disposal of the public money as these examples are great illustrations of our argument and illustrious proofs of the superior excellence of the american constitutions we will examine the story of cassius before we come to that of the decemvirs the first notice that is taken of cassius is in the year     when he was consul gained considerable advantages over the sabines and received the honor of a triumph in     he was chosen by lartius the first dictator general of the horse and commanded a division of the army with success against the latins in the year     disputes ran so high between patricians and plebeians that no candidate appeared for the consulship and several refused the vessel was in such a storm that nobody would accept the helm the people who remained in the city at last nominated posthumus cominius and spurius cassius who were believed equally agreeable to plebeians and patricians the first thing they did was to propose the affair of the debts to the senate a violent opposition ensued headed by appius who constantly insisted that all the favor shown the populace only made them the more insolent and that nothing but inflexible severity could reduce them to their duty the younger senators all blindly adopted this opinion nothing passed in several tumultuous assemblies but altercations and mutual reproaches the ancient senators were all inclined to peace agrippa who had observed a sagacious medium neither flattering the pride of the great nor favoring the license of the people being one of the new senators whom brutus had chosen after the expulsion of tarquin supported the opinion that the good of the state required the reëstablishment of concord among the citizens sent by the senate to treat with the people retired to the sacred mountain he spoke his celebrated fable of the  0 belly and the members the people at this conference insisted that as by the creation of dictators with unlimited authority the law which admitted appeals to the people from the decrees of any magistrate whatever was eluded and in a manner made void tribunes should be created a new species of magistrates whose sole duty should be the conservation of their rights the affair of coriolanus happened in this interval between the first consulate of sp cassius in     and the second in     in which probably he had acted in favor of the people in establishing the tribunate and in defending them against coriolanus appius claudius and the other oligarchic senators this year     he marched against the volsci and hernici who made peace and the consul obtained the honor of a triumph cassius after his triumph represented to the senate that the people merited some reward for the services they had rendered the commonwealth for defending the public liberty and subjecting new countries to the roman power that the lands acquired by their arms belonged to the public though some patricians had appropriated them to themselves that an equitable distribution of these lands would enable the poor plebeians to bring up children for the benefit of the commonwealth and that such a division alone could establish that equality which ought to subsist between the citizens of the same state he associated in this privilege the latins settled at rome who had obtained the freedom of the city tum primum lex agraria promulgata est this law which had at least a great appearance of equity would have relieved the misery of the people and no doubt rendered cassius popular the romans never granted peace to their enemies until they had taken some of their territory from them part of such conquests were sold to defray the expense of the war another portion was distributed among the poor plebeians some cantons were farmed out for the public rapacious patricians solely intent upon enriching themselves took possession of some and these lands unjustly usurped by the rich cassius was for having distributed anew in favor of the plebeians     the aristocratical pride avarice and ambition were all incensed and the senators greatly alarmed the people discovered symptoms that they had begun to think themselves of the same species with their rulers and one patrician of consular dignity dared to encourage them in such presumptuous and aspiring thoughts some device or other must be invented to dupe the people and ruin their leader virginius the consul soon hit upon an expedient rabuleius the tribune asked him in assembly what he thought of this law he answered he would willingly consent that the lands should be distributed among the roman people provided the latins had no share divide et impera this distinction without the least appearance of equity was addressed simply to the popular hatred between the romans and latins and the bait was greedily swallowed the people were highly pleased with the consul and began to despise cassius and to suspect him of ambition to be king he continued his friendly intentions towards the people and proposed in senate to reimburse as it was but just out of the public treasury the money which the poor citizens had paid for the corn of which gelo king of syracuse had made the commonwealth a present during the scarcity but even this was now represented by the senate and suspected by the people to be only soliciting popular favor and although the people felt every hour the necessity of a king to protect them against the tyranny of the senate yet they had been gulled by patrician artifice into an oath against kings and although they felt the want of such a magistrate they had not sense enough to see it the agrarian law was opposed in the senate by appius and sempronius and evaded by the appointment of ten commissioners to survey the lands the next year cassius was cited before the people and accused by the quæstors of having taken secret measures for opening a way to the sovereignty of having provided arms and received money from the latins and hernici and of having made a very great party among the most robust of their youth who were continually seen in his train the people heard the quæstors but gave no attention to cassiuss answer and defence no consideration for his children his relations and friends who appeared in great numbers to support him no remembrance of his great actions by which he had raised himself to the first dignities nor three consulships and    two triumphs which had rendered him very illustrious could delay his condemnation so unpardonable a crime with the romans was the slightest suspicion of aspiring at regal power  so ignorant so unjust so ungrateful and so stupid were that very body of plebeians who were continually suffering the cruel tyranny of patricians and continually soliciting protectors against it without regarding any moderation or proportion the blind tools of the hatred and vengeance of their enemies they condemned cassius to die and the quæstors instantly carried him to the tarpeian rock which fronted the forum and threw him down in the presence of the whole people his house was demolished and his estate sold to purchase a statue to ceres and the faction of the great grew more powerful and haughty and rose in their contempt for the plebeians who lost courage in proportion and soon reproached themselves with injustice as well as imprudence in the condemnation of the zealous defender of their interests they found themselves cheated in all things the consuls neither executed the senates decree for distributing the lands nor were the ten commissioners elected they complained with great truth that the senate did not act with sincerity and accused the tribunes of the last year of betraying their interests the tribunes of this year warmly demanded the execution of the decree to elude which a new war was invented the patricians preserved their aristocratical tyranny for many centuries by keeping up continually some quarrel with foreigners and by frequently creating dictators the patricians in the assemblies by centuries had an immense advantage over the plebeians the consuls were here chosen by the patricians as cassius and manlius were murdered by assemblies in centuries in   0 cæso fabius one of cassiuss accusers was chosen consul though very unpopular in     the other of cassiuss accusers was chosen consul in these contests the steadiness of the patricians is as remarkable    as the inconstancy of the plebeians the sagacity of the former as obvious as the stupidity of the latter and the cruelty of the former as conspicuous as the ingratitude of the latter prejudice passion and superstition appear to have altogether governed the plebeians without the least appearance of their being rational creatures or moral agents such was their total ignorance of arts and letters all the little advantages of education which then existed being monopolized by the patricians the aristocracy appears in precisely the same character in all these anecdotes as we before saw it in venice poland bern and elsewhere the same indispensable necessity appears in all of them in order to preserve even the appearance of equity and liberty to give the patricians a master in the first executive magistrate and another master in a house of commons i say master for each of the three branches must be in its turn both master and servant governing and being governed by turns to understand how the people were duped upon these occasions and particularly how manlius was condemned to death we must recollect that the tribunes cited him before the people not in their curiæ but centuries the centuries were formed on an artful idea to make power accompany wealth the people were divided into classes according to the proportion of the fortunes each class was divided into centuries but the number of centuries in the different classes was so unequal that those of the first or richest class made a majority of the whole and when the centuries of this class were unanimous they decided the question by this institution the rich were masters of the legislature state of the classes and centuries class  roman valuation  sterling  no of centuries     £ s     —  00000         —       —   000        —       —  0000        —       —   000   0    —       —   000      0 —       —     —          total     from           sub               majority of the first class        so that by citing manlius before the people by centuries the senate were sure of a vote for his destruction and the people had not sense to see it or spirit to alter it nedham thus far appears to reason fairly and conclusively when he adduces the examples of mælius and manlius and he might have added cassius to prove that the people are ever in danger of losing their liberty and indeed he might have advanced that they never have any liberty where they are governed by one senate but these examples do not prove what he alleges them to prove namely—that the people in their supreme assemblies successively chosen are the best keepers of their liberty because such an assembly is subject to every danger of a standing hereditary senate and more the first vote divides it into two parties and the majority is omnipotent and the minority defenceless he should have adduced these examples to prove the necessity of separating the executive legislative and judicial and of dividing the legislature into three branches making the executive one of them and independent of the other two this is the only scientific government the only plan which takes into consideration all the principles in nature and provides for all cases that occur he is equally right and equally wrong in the application of his other examples the people says he were sometimes in danger of a surprise by a grandee cabinet or junto as that upstart tyranny of the decemviri where ten men made a shift to enslave the senate as well as the people it is no wonder that cassius mælius and manlius were sacrificed to the passions of the senate for until the year of rome  00 the romans had no certain laws so that the consuls and senators acting as judges were absolute arbiters of the fate of the citizens terentillus a tribune had proposed an ordinance that laws should be instituted as rules of right both in public and private affairs the senate had eluded and postponed by various artifices the law of terentillus until this year  00 when the tribunes solicited the execution of it with great spirit and the senate weary of contention or apprehensive of greater danger at length decreed that ambassadors should be sent to athens and to the greek cities in italy to collect such laws as they should find most conformable to the constitution of the roman commonwealth and that at their return the consuls should    deliberate with the senate upon the choice of legislators of the power to be confided to them and the time they were to continue in office sp posthumius servius sulpicius and a manlius three persons of consular dignity were appointed deputies three galleys were prepared by the public of a magnificence that might do honor to the roman people in the year  0  the ambassadors were returned and appius claudius whose ancestors had always been haughty aristocratics was chosen consul with t genucius for his colleague the senate assembled and resolved that decemviri should be elected out of the principal senators whose authority should continue a year that they should govern the commonwealth with all the power which the consuls then had and as the kings had formerly exercised and without any appeal from their judgments that all other magistracies and even the tribuneship should be abolished this decree was received by the people with loud acclamations an assembly by centuries was immediately held and the new magistrates created and the old ones all abdicated their offices thus the constitution was wholly changed and all authority transferred to one centre the decemvirs it was soon exercised like all other authorities in one centre we see here the effect of two powers without a third the people from hatred to the consuls and the senate from hatred to the tribunes unite at once in a total abolition of the constitution the constitution of the decemvirs was precisely nedhams idea it was annually eligible it was the peoples government in their successive assemblies but we find that an annual power without any limits was a great temptation the decemvirs were all senators of consular dignity and therefore in the opinion of the people themselves the most eminent for talents and virtues yet their virtues were not sufficient to secure an honest use of their unbounded power they took many precautions to preserve their own moderation as well as to avoid exciting jealousy in their fellowcitizens only one had the rods and axes the others had nothing to distinguish them but a single officer called accensus who walked before each of them their president continued only one day and they succeeded each other daily till the end of the year it is much to our purpose to enlarge upon this example because instead of being an argument for nedhams inconcinnate    system it is full proof against it the course of passions and events in this case were precisely the same as will take place in every simple government of the people by a succession of their representatives in a single assembly and whether that assembly consists of ten members or five hundred it will make no difference in the morning the decemviri all went to their tribunal where they took cognizance of all causes and affairs public and private justice was administered with all possible equity and everybody departed with perfect satisfaction nothing could be so charming as the regard they professed for the interests of the people and the protection which the meanest found against the oppression of the great it was now generally affirmed that there was no occasion for tribunes consuls prætors or any other magistrates the wisdom equity moderation and humanity of the new government was admired and extolled what peace what tranquillity what happiness were enjoyed by the public and by individuals what a consolation what glory to the decemvirs appius claudius especially engrossed the whole glory of the administration in the minds of the people he acquired so decided an ascendency over his colleagues and so irresistible an influence with the people that the whole authority seemed centred in him he had the art to distinguish himself peculiarly in whatever he transacted in concert with his colleagues his mildness and affability his kind condescension to the meanest and weakest of the citizens and his polite attention in saluting them all by their names gained him all hearts let it be remembered he had till this year been the open enemy of the plebeians as his temper was naturally violent and cruel his hatred to the people had arisen to ferocity on a sudden he was become another man humane popular obliging wholly devoted to please the multitude and acquire their affections everybody delighted in the government of the decemvirs and a perfect union prevailed among themselves they completed their body of laws and caused it to be engraved on ten tables they were ratified by the senate confirmed by the people in the comitia centuriata engraven on pillars of brass and placed in the forum the year was upon the point of expiring and as the consuls and senators found themselves delivered by the new government from the persecutions of the tribunes and the people from what    they equally hated the authority of the consuls both parties agreed in the propriety of choosing ten successors it was pretended that some further laws might be still wanting that a year was too short to complete so great a work and that to carry the whole into full effect the independent authority of the same magistracy would be necessary that which must happen upon all annual elections of such a government in one centre happened in this case the city was in a greater and more universal ferment than had ever been known senators the most distinguished by age and merit demanded the office no doubt to prevent factious and turbulent spirits from obtaining it appius who secretly intended to have himself continued seeing those great persons who had passed through all dignities so eager in pursuit of this was alarmed the people charmed with his past conduct while decemvir openly clamored to continue him in preference to all others he affected at first a reluctance and even a repugnance at the thought of accepting a second time an employment so laborious and so capable of exciting jealousy and envy against him to get rid of his colleagues and to stimulate them to refuse the office he declared upon all occasions that as they had discharged their duty with fidelity by their assiduity and anxious care for a whole year it was but just to allow them repose and appoint them successors the more aversion he discovered the more he was solicited the desires and wishes of the whole city the unanimous and earnest solicitations of the multitude were at length with pain and reluctance complied with he exceeded all his competitors in artifice he embraced one took another by the hand and walked publicly in the forum in company with the duilii and icilii the two families who were the principals of the people and the pillars of the tribunate his colleagues who had been hitherto his dupes knowing these popular condescensions to be contrary to his character which was naturally arrogant began to open their eyes but not daring to oppose him openly they opposed their own address to his management as he was the youngest among them they chose him president whose office it was to nominate the candidates to offices relying upon his modesty not to name himself a thing without example except among the tribunes but modesty and decency were found in him but feeble barriers against ambition he not only caused himself to be elected but excluded all his    colleagues of the last year and filled up the nine other places with his own tools three of whom were plebeians the senate and whole patrician body were astonished at this as it was thought by them contrary to his own glory and that of his ancestors as well as to his haughty character this popular trait entirely gained him the multitude it would be tedious to relate the manner in which they continued their power from year to year with the most hardened impudence on their part the most silly acquiescence of the people and the fears of the senate and patricians their tyranny and cruelty became at length intolerable and the blood of virginia on a fathers dagger was alone sufficient to arouse a stupid people from their lethargy is it not absurd in nedham to adduce this example in support of the government of the people by their successive representatives annually chosen were not the decemvirs the peoples representatives and were not their elections annual and would not the same consequences have happened if the number had been one hundred or five hundred or a thousand instead of ten o but the people of rome should not have continued them in power from year to year how will you hinder the people from continuing them in power if the people have the choice they may continue the same men and we certainly know they will no bonds can restrain them without the liberty of choice the deputies would not be the peoples representatives if the people make a law that the same man shall never serve two years the people can and will repeal that law if the people impose upon themselves an oath they will soon say and believe they can dispense with that oath in short the people will have the men whom they love best for the moment and the men whom they love best will make any law to gratify their present humor nay more the people ought to be represented by the men who have their hearts and confidence for these alone can ever know their wants and desires but these men ought to have some check to restrain them and the people too when those desires are for forbidden fruit—for injustice cruelty and the ruin of the minority and that the desires of the majority of the people are often for injustice and inhumanity against the minority is demonstrated by every page of the history of the whole world we come next to the examples of continuing power in particular persons the romans were swallowed up by continuing    power too long in the hands of the triumvirates of emperors or generals the first of these were cæsar pompey and crassus but who continued the power of cæsar if the people continued it the argument arising from the example is against a civil government of the people or by their successive representative assemblies was it the senate was it the standing permanent power in the constitution that conferred this continuance of power on cæsar by no means it is again necessary to recollect the story that we may not be imposed on no military station existed in italy lest some general might overawe the republic italy however was understood to extend only from tarentum to the arnus and the rubicon cisalpine gaul was not reputed to be in italy and might be held by a military officer and an army cæsar from a deliberate and sagacious ambition procured from the people an unprecedented prolongation of his appointments for five years but the distribution of the provinces was still the prerogative of the senate by the sempronian law cæsar had ever been at variance with a majority of the senate in the office of prætor he had been suspended by them in his present office of consul he had set them at open defiance he had no hopes of obtaining from them the prolongation of his power and the command of a province he knew that the very proposal of giving him the command of cisalpine gaul for a number of years would have shocked them in order to carry his point he must set aside the authority of the senate and destroy the only check the only appearance of a balance remaining in the constitution a tool of his the tribune vatinius moved the people to set aside the law of sempronius and by their own unlimited power name cæsar as proconsul of cisalpine gaul and illyricum for five years with an army of several legions the senate were alarmed and in vain opposed the people voted it the senate saw that all was lost and cato cried you have placed a king with his guards in your citadel cæsar boasted that he had prevailed both in obtaining the consulate and the command not by the concession of the senate but in direct opposition to their will he was well aware of their malice he said though he had a consummate command of his temper and the profoundest dissimulation while in pursuit of his point his exuberant vanity braved the world when he had carried it he now openly insulted the senate and no longer  0 concealed his connection with pompey and crassus whom he had overreached to concur in his appointment thus one of the clearest and strongest examples in history to show the necessity of a balance between an independent senate and an independent people is adduced by nedham in favor of his indigested plan which has no balance at all the other example of augustus antony and lepidus is not worth considering particularly for the trial between them was but a struggle of arms by military policy alone without any mixture of civil or political debates or negotiations the fourth reason is because a succession of supreme powers destroys faction which is defined to be an adhering to an interest distinct from the true interest of the state in this particular one may venture to differ altogether from our author and deny the fact that a succession of sovereign authority in one assembly by popular elections destroys faction we may affirm the contrary that a standing authority in an absolute monarch or an hereditary aristocracy is less friendly to the monster than a simple popular government and that it is only in a mixed government of three independent orders of the one the few and the many and three separate powers the legislative executive and judicial that all sorts of factions those of the poor and the rich those of the gentlemen and common people those of the one the few and the many can at all times be quelled the reason given by our author is enough to prove this those who are factious must have time to improve their sleights and projects in disguising their designs drawing in instruments and worming out their opposites in order to judge of this let us put two suppositions   either the succession must be by periodical elections simply or   by periodical elections in rotation and in either case the means and opportunities of improving address and systems concealing or feigning designs making friends and escaping enemies are greater in a succession of popular elections than in a standing aristocracy or simple monarchy and infinitely greater than in a mixed government when the monster faction is watched and guarded by cerberus with his three heads and a sop is thrown to him to corrupt or appease him one mouth alone will devour it and the other two will give the alarm but to return to our first case a succession in one assembly by    simple annual elections elections are the best possible schools of political art and address one may appeal to any man who has equal experience in elections and in courts whether address and art and even real political knowledge is not to be acquired more easily and in a shorter time in the former than in the latter a king of france once asked his most able and honest ambassador dossat where he had learned that wonderful dexterity with which he penetrated into the bosoms of men of all nations and characters unravelled every plait in the human soul and every intricacy of affairs and events the cardinal answered sire i learned it all in my youth at the election of a parish officer it is a common observation in england that their greatest statesmen and their favorite chatham among the rest were formed by attendance on elections the human heart is nowhere so open and so close by turns every argument is there exhausted every passion prejudice imagination superstition and caprice is easily and surely learned among these scenes one would suspect that shakspeare had been an electioneering agent when these elections are in a single city like rome there will be always two sets of candidates if one set succeeds one year the other will endeavor to succeed the next this will make the whole year a scene of faction and intrigue and every citizen except perhaps a very few who will not meddle on either side a partisan or factious man if the elections are in a large country like england for example or one of the united states of america where various cities towns boroughs and corporations are to be represented each scene of election will have two or more candidates and two or more parties each of which will study its sleights and projects disguise its designs draw in tools and worm out enemies we must remember that every party and every individual is now struggling for a share in the executive and judicial power as well as legislative for a share in the distribution of all honors offices rewards and profits every flattery and menace every passion and prejudice of every voter will be applied to every trick and bribe that can be bestowed and will be accepted will be used and what is horrible to think of that candidate or that agent who has fewest scruples who will propagate lies and slanders with most confidence and secrecy who will wheedle flatter and cajole who will debauch the people by treats feasts and diversions with the least hesitation and bribe with the most    impudent front which can consist with hypocritical concealment will draw in tools and worm out enemies the fastest unsullied honor sterling integrity real virtue will stand a very unequal chance when vice folly impudence and knavery have carried an election one year they will acquire in the course of it fresh influence and power to succeed the next in the course of the year the delegate in an assembly that disposes of all commissions contracts and pensions has many opportunities to reward his friends among his own constituents and to punish his enemies the son or other relation of one friend has a commission given him in the army another in the navy a third a benefice in the church a fourth in the customs a fifth in the excise shares in loans and contracts are distributed among his friends by which they are enabled to increase their own and his dependents and partisans or in other words to draw in more instruments and parties and worm out their opposites all this is so easy to comprehend so obvious to sight and so certainly known in universal experience that it is astonishing that our author should have ventured to assert that such a government kills the cankerworm faction but to consider the subject in one other point of view let us introduce the idea of a rotation by which is here meant not merely vacating a seat which the electors may fill again with the same subject but a fundamental law that no man shall serve in the sovereign assembly more than one year or two or three years or one in three or three in six c for example suppose england or any one of the united states governed by one sovereign assembly annually elected with a fundamental law that no member should serve more than three years in six what would be the consequence in the first place it is obvious that this is a violation of the rights of mankind it is an abridgment of the rights both of electors and candidates there is no right clearer and few of more importance than that the people should be at liberty to choose the ablest and best men and that men of the greatest merit should exercise the most important employments yet upon the present supposition the people voluntarily resign this right and shackle their own choice this year the people choose those members who are the ablest wealthiest best qualified and have most of their confidence and affection in the course of the three years they increase their    number of friends and consequently their influence and power by their administration yet at the end of three years they must all return to private life and be succeeded by another set who have less wisdom wealth and virtue and less of the confidence and affection of the people will either they or the people bear this will they not repeal the fundamental law and be applauded by the nation at least by their own friends and constituents who are the majority for so doing but supposing so unnatural and improbable a thing as that they should yet respect the law what will be the consequence they will in effect nominate their successors and govern still their friends are the majority their successors will be all taken from their party and the mortified minority will see themselves the dupes those men who have the most weight influence or power whether by merit wealth or birth will govern whether they stay at home or go to parliament such a rotation then will only increase and multiply factions our authors examples must be again examined what made the roman kings factious but a continuation of power in their persons and families if it is admitted that they were factious as tarquin no doubt was it is certain that the nobles about them were much more so and their factious actions were chiefly occasioned by the eternal jealousy and envy rivalry and ambition of the great families that were nearest to them but the effect was produced by their powers being undefined unlimited by law and unchecked by constitutional power not by its prolongation the power of the king and the power of the senate were continued and neither was checked for the people had not a power adequate to the purpose of checking either much less both both grew factious but the senate most so and drove away the king that they might have the exclusive power of being factious and without the least regard to the liberty of the people after the romans became a commonwealth was it not for the same reason that the senate fell into such heats and fits among themselves it may be truly answered that it was not the continuation of power in the senate but the powers being unlimited that made it factious a power without a check is a faction the senate itself was a faction from the first moment after the expulsion of the kings but if the    senate had been annually chosen by the people and held the same unlimited power their factions heats and fits would have been much earlier and more violent did not appius claudius and his junto by the same means lord it over the senate it was again the illimitation of his power that enabled him to lord it it was granted only for one year and who continued it the people and who can hinder the people when they have no check from continuing power who ought to hinder them but if appiuss unchecked power had grown up from step to step by a series of popular elections he would not have lorded it less he might have possessed virginia and have murdered her father with impunity continuation of power in the same persons and families will as certainly take place in a simple democracy or a democracy by representation as in an hereditary aristocracy or monarchy this evil if it be one will not be avoided nor remedied but increased and aggravated by our authors plan of government the continuation will be certain but it will be accomplished by corruption which is worse than a continuation by birth and if corruption cannot effect the continuation sedition and rebellion will be recurred to for a degraded disappointed rich and illustrious family would at any time annihilate heaven and earth if it could rather than fail of carrying its point it is our authors peculiar misfortune that all his examples prove his system to be wrong whence was it that sylla and marius caused so many proscriptions cruelties and combustions in rome but by an extraordinary continuation of power in themselves continuation of power in marius c enabled him to commit cruelties to be sure but who continued him in power was it the senate or the people by the enthusiasm of the people for marius he had surrounded himself with assassins who considered the patricians nobles and senate as enemies to their cause and enabled him and his faction to become masters of the commonwealth the better sort of people the really honest and virtuous republicans were discouraged and deterred from frequenting the public assemblies he had recourse to violence in the elections of tribunes that he might carry the choice of a prostituted tool of his own apuleius against the senate and nobles and because their candidate nonius was chosen though now vested with a sacred character mariuss creatures murdered    him no man had courage to propose an inquiry into the cause of his death apuleius to gratify his party proposed new laws to distribute lands to the poor citizens and to the veteran soldiers to purchase more lands for the same purpose to remit the price of corn already distributed from the public granaries and to distribute still more gratis at the public expense to the people in vain did the quæstor and the senate represent that there would be an end of industry order and government apuleius to extend the power of the popular assemblies and remove every check from his own and mariuss designs brought forward new laws—  that the acts of the tribes should have the force of laws   that it should be treason to interrupt a tribune   that the senate should be compelled to take an oath to confirm every act of the tribes in five days the power of the senate was thus entirely suppressed their branch of the legislature was reduced to a mere form and even the form they were not at liberty to refuse marius though he was at the bottom of this measure at first by the most abandoned hypocrisy declared himself in senate against taking the oath in order to ruin metellus and all the other honest men and as soon as he had accomplished this he took the oath and compelled the rest to do the same it was by flattery bribery artifice and violence that marius and apuleius prevailed with the people to continue their power in opposition to all that the senate could do to prevent it what would have been the consequence then if there had been no senate would not the majority of the people in the tribes have continued their power against all that could have been done by the minority would not still more of the public lands money and grain have been lavished upon proper instruments among the majority and the minority have been compelled to pay the expense our author affects to say that the senate and people continued the powers of pompey and cæsar but cæsar himself knew it was the people and not the senate and if the senate continued pompey it was because cæsar and the people laid them under the necessity of doing it in their own defence would cæsar have had less command in gallia if the people or their successive assemblies had been possessed of all power it is most obvious that a majority of the people in that case would have continued cæsar as long as he desired    and have given him as much power as he wished so that every step of our authors progress demonstrates his system to be false it is idle to say that a continuation of power increases influence and spreads corruption unless you point out a way to prevent such a continuance of power to give all power to the peoples successive single representative assemblies is to make the continuance of power with all its increasing influence and corruption certain and inevitable you may as wisely preach to the winds as gravely exhort a triumphant majority to lay down their power it is undoubtedly honorable in any man who has acquired a great influence unbounded confidence and unlimited power to resign it voluntarily and odious to take advantage of such an opportunity to destroy a free government but it would be madness in a legislator to frame his policy upon a supposition that such magnanimity would often appear it is his business to contrive his plan in such a manner that such unlimited influence confidence and power shall never be obtained by any man the laws alone can be trusted with unlimited confidence those laws which alone can secure equity between all and every one which are the bond of that dignity which we enjoy in the commonwealth the foundation of liberty and the fountain of equity the mind the soul the counsel and judgment of the city whose ministers are the magistrates whose interpreters the judges whose servants are all men who mean to be free† those laws which are right reason derived from the divinity commanding honesty and forbidding iniquity which are silent magistrates where the magistrates are only speaking laws which as they are founded on eternal morals are emanations of the divine mind‡ if the life of liberty and the only remedy against selfinterest    lies in succession of powers and persons the united states of america have taken the most effectual measures to secure that life and that remedy in establishing annual elections of their governors senators and representatives this will probably be allowed to be as perfect an establishment of a succession of powers and persons as human laws can make but in what manner annual elections of governors and senators will operate remains to be ascertained it should always be remembered that this is not the first experiment that was ever made in the world of elections to great offices of state how they have hitherto operated in every great nation and what has been their end is very well known mankind have universally discovered that chance was preferable to a corrupt choice and have trusted providence rather than themselves first magistrates and senators had better be made hereditary at once than that the people should be universally debauched and bribed go to loggerheads and fly to arms regularly every year thank heaven americans understand calling conventions and if the time should come as it is very possible it may when hereditary descent shall become a less evil than annual fraud and violence such a convention may still prevent the first magistrate from becoming absolute as well as hereditary but if this argument of our author is considered as he intended it as a proof that a succession of powers and persons in one assembly is the most perfect commonwealth it is totally fallacious though we allow benevolence and generous affections to exist in the human breast yet every moral theorist will admit the selfish passions in the generality of men to be the strongest there are few who love the public better than themselves though all may have some affection for the public we are not indeed commanded to love our neighbor better than ourselves selfinterest private avidity ambition and avarice will exist in every state of society and under every form of government a succession of powers and persons by frequent elections will not lessen these passions in any case in a governor senator or representative nor will the apprehension of an approaching election restrain them from indulgence if they have the power the only remedy is to take away the power by controlling the selfish avidity of the governor by the senate and house of the senate by the governor and house and of the    house by the governor and senate of all possible forms of government a sovereignty in one assembly successively chosen by the people is perhaps the best calculated to facilitate the gratification of selflove and the pursuit of the private interest of a few individuals a few eminent conspicuous characters will be continued in their seats in the sovereign assembly from one election to another whatever changes are made in the seats around them by superior art address and opulence by more splendid birth reputations and connections they will be able to intrigue with the people and their leaders out of doors until they worm out most of their opposers and introduce their friends to this end they will bestow all offices contracts privileges in commerce and other emoluments on the latter and their connections and throw every vexation and disappointment in the way of the former until they establish such a system of hopes and fears throughout the state as shall enable them to carry a majority in every fresh election of the house the judges will be appointed by them and their party and of consequence will be obsequious enough to their inclinations the whole judicial authority as well as the executive will be employed perverted and prostituted to the purposes of electioneering no justice will be attainable nor will innocence or virtue be safe in the judicial courts but for the friends of the prevailing leaders legal prosecutions will be instituted and carried on against opposers to their vexation and ruin and as they have the public purse at command as well as the executive and judicial power the public money will be expended in the same way no favors will be attainable but by those who will court the ruling demagogues in the house by voting for their friends and instruments and pensions and pecuniary rewards and gratifications as well as honors and offices of every kind will be voted to friends and partisans the leading minds and most influential characters among the clergy will be courted and the views of the youth in this department will be turned upon those men and the road to promotion and employment in the church will be obstructed against such as will not worship the general idol capital characters among the physicians will not be forgotten and the means of acquiring reputation and practice in the healing art will be to get the state trumpeters on the side of youth the bar too will be made so subservient that a young gentleman will have no chance to    obtain a character or clients but by falling in with the views of the judges and their creators even the theatres and actors and actresses must become politicians and convert the public pleasures into engines of popularity for the governing members of the house the press that great barrier and bulwark of the rights of mankind when it is protected in its freedom by law can now no longer be free if the authors writers and printers will not accept of the hire that will be offered them they must submit to the ruin that will be denounced against them the presses with much secrecy and concealment will be made the vehicles of calumny against the minority and of panegyric and empirical applauses of the leaders of the majority and no remedy can possibly be obtained in one word the whole system of affairs and every conceivable motive of hope and fear will be employed to promote the private interests of a few and their obsequious majority and there is no remedy but in arms accordingly we find in all the italian republics the minority always were driven to arms in despair the attaining of particular ends requires length of time designs must lie long in fermentation to gain the opportunity to bring matters to perfection it is true but less time will be necessary in this case in general than even in a simple hereditary monarchy or aristocracy an aristocracy like the roman senate between the abolition of royalty and the institution of the tribunate is of itself a faction a private partial interest yet it was less so than an assembly annually chosen by the people and vested with all authority would be for such an assembly runs faster and easier into an oligarchy than an hereditary aristocratical assembly the leading members having as has been before shown in detail the appointment of judges and the nomination to all lucrative and honorable offices they have thus the power to bend the whole executive and judicial authority to their own private interest and by these means to increase their own reputations wealth and influence and those of their party at every new election whereas in a simple hereditary aristocracy it is the interest of the members in general to preserve an equality among themselves as long as they can and as they are smaller in number and have more knowledge they can more easily unite for that purpose and there is no opportunity for any one to increase  0 his power by any annual elections an aspiring aristocrat therefore must take more time and use more address to augment his influence yet we find in experience that even hereditary aristocracies have never been able to prevent oligarchies rising up among them but by the most rigorous severe and tyrannical regulations such as the institution of inquisitions c it may sound oddly to say that the majority is a faction but it is nevertheless literally just if the majority are partial in their own favor if they refuse or deny a perfect equality to every member of the minority they are a faction and as a popular assembly collective or representative cannot act or will but by a vote the first step they take if they are not unanimous occasions a division into majority and minority that is into two parties and the moment the former is unjust it is a faction the roman decemvirs themselves were set up by the people not by the senate much longer time would have been required for an oligarchy to have grown up among the patricians and in the senate if the people had not interposed and demanded a body of laws that is a constitution the senate opposed the requisition as long as they could but at last appointed the decemvirs much against their own inclinations and merely in compliance with the urgent clamors of the people nedham thinks that as the first founders of the roman liberty did well in driving out their kings so on the other side they did very ill in settling a standing authority within themselves it is really very injudicious and very ridiculous to call those roman nobles who expelled their kings founders of the roman liberty nothing was farther from their heads or their hearts than national liberty it was merely a struggle for power between a king and a body of haughty envious nobles the interests of the people and of liberty had no share in it the romans might do well in driving out their king he might be a bad and incorrigible character and in such a case any people may do well in expelling or deposing a king but they did not well in demolishing the single executive magistracy they should have then demanded a body of laws a definite constitution and an integral share in the legislature for the people with a precise delineation of the powers of the first magistrate and senate in this case they would have been entitled to the praise of founders of roman    liberty but as it was they only substituted one system of tyranny for another and the new one was worse than the old they certainly did very ill in settling a standing sovereign supreme authority within themselves thus far our author is perfectly in the right and the reason he gives for this opinion is very well founded it is the same that was given thousands of years before him by plato socrates and others and has been constantly given by all succeeding writers in favor of mixed governments and against simple ones because lying open to the temptations of honor and profit or in other words having their ambition and vanity avarice and lust hatred and resentment malice and revenge in short their selflove and all their passions which are sails too big for any human bulk unrestrained by any controlling power they were at once transported by them and made use of their public power not for the good of the commonwealth but for the gratification of their private passions whereby they put the commonwealth into frequent flames of discontent and sedition thus far is very well but when our author goes on to say which might all have been prevented could they have settled the state free indeed by placing an orderly succession of supreme authority in the hands of the people he can be followed by no one who knows what is in man and in society because that supreme authority falls out of the whole body into a majority at the first vote to expect selfdenial from men when they have a majority in their favor and consequently power to gratify themselves is to disbelieve all history and universal experience it is to disbelieve revelation and the word of god which informs us the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked there have been examples of selfdenial and will be again but such exalted virtue never yet existed in any large body of men and lasted long and our authors argument requires it to be proved not only that individuals but that nations and majorities of nations are capable not only of a single act or a few acts of disinterested justice and exalted selfdenial but of a course of such heroic virtue for ages and generations and not only that they are capable of this but that it is probable they will practise it there is no man so blind as not to see that to talk of founding a government upon a supposition that nations and great bodies of men left to themselves    will practise a course of selfdenial is either to babble like a newborn infant or to deceive like an unprincipled impostor nedham has himself acknowledged in several parts of this work the depravity of men in very strong terms in this fifth reason he avers temptations of honor and profit to be sails too big for any human bulk why then does he build a system on a foundation which he owns to be so unstable if his mind had been at liberty to follow his own ideas and principles he must have seen that a succession of supreme authority in the hands of the people by their house of representatives is at first an aristocracy as despotical as a roman senate and becomes an oligarchy even sooner than that assembly fell into the decemvirate there is this infallible disadvantage in such a government even in comparison with an hereditary aristocracy that it lets in vice profligacy and corruption like a torrent with tyranny whereas the latter often guards the morals of the people with the utmost severity even the despotism of aristocracy preserves the morals of the people it is pretended by some that a sovereignty in a single assembly annually elected is the only one in which there is any responsibility for the exercise of power in the mixed government we contend for the ministers at least of the executive power are responsible for every instance of the exercise of it and if they dispose of a single commission by corruption they are responsible to a house of representatives who may by impeachment make them responsible before a senate where they may be accused tried condemned and punished by independent judges but in a single sovereign assembly each member at the end of his year is only responsible to his constituents and the majority of members who have been of one party and carried all before them are to be responsible only to their constituents not to the constituents of the minority who have been overborne injured and plundered and who are these constituents to whom the majority are accountable those very persons to gratify whom they have prostituted the honors rewards wealth and justice of the state these instead of punishing will applaud instead of discarding will reëlect with still greater eclat and a more numerous majority for the losing cause will be deserted by numbers and this will be done in hopes of having still more injustice done still more honors and profits divided    among themselves to the exclusion and mortification of the minority it is then astonishing that such a simple government should be preferred to a mixed one by any rational creature on the score of responsibility there is in short no possible way of defending the minority in such a government from the tyranny of the majority but by giving the former a negative on the latter—the most absurd institution that ever took place among men as the major may bear all possible relations of proportion to the minor part it may be fiftyone against fortynine in an assembly of a hundred or it may be ninetynine against one only it becomes therefore necessary to give the negative to the minority in all cases though it be ever so small every member must possess it or he can never be secure that himself and his constituents shall not be sacrificed by all the rest this is the true ground and original of the liberum veto in poland but the consequence has been ruin to that noble but illconstituted republic one fool or one knave one member of the diet which is a single sovereign assembly bribed by an intriguing ambassador of some foreign power has prevented measures the most essential to the defence safety and existence of the nation hence humiliations and partitions this also is the reason on which is founded the law of the united netherlands that all the seven provinces must be unanimous in the assembly of the statesgeneral and all the cities and other voting bodies in the assemblies of the separate states having no sufficient checks in their uncouth constitution nor any mediating power possessed of the whole executive they have been driven to demand unanimity instead of a balance and this must be done in every government of a single assembly or the majority will instantly oppress the minority but what kind of government would that be in the united states of america or any one of them that should require unanimity or allow of the liberum veto it is sufficient to ask the question for every man will answer it alike no controversy will be maintained with our author that a free state is more excellent than simple monarchy or simple aristocracy but the question is what is a free state it is plain our author means a single assembly of representatives of the people periodically elected and vested with the supreme power this is denied to be a free state it is at first a government of    grandees and will soon degenerate into a government of a junto or oligarchy of a few of the most eminent of them or into an absolute monarchy of one of them the government of these grandees while they are numerous as well as when they become few will be so oppressive to the people that the people from hatred or fear of the gentlemen will set up one of them to rule the rest and make him absolute will it be asked how this can be proved it is proved as has been often already said by the constitution of human nature by the experience of the world and the concurrent testimony of all history the passions and desires of the majority of the representatives in an assembly being in their nature insatiable and unlimited by any thing within their own breasts and having nothing to control them without will crave more and more indulgence and as they have the power they will have the gratification and nedhams government will have no security for continuing free but the presumption of selfdenial and selfgovernment in the members of the assembly virtues and qualities that never existed in great bodies of men by the acknowledgment of all the greatest judges of human nature as well as by his own when he says that temptations of honor and profit are sails too big for any human bulk it would be as reasonable to say that all government is altogether unnecessary because it is the duty of all men to deny themselves and obey the laws of nature and the laws of god however clear the duty we know it will not be performed and therefore it is our duty to enter into associations and compel one another to do some of it it is agreed that the people are the best keepers of their own liberties and the only keepers who can be always trusted and therefore the peoples fair full and honest consent to every law by their representatives must be made an essential part of the constitution but it is denied that they are the best keepers or any keepers at all of their own liberties when they hold collectively or by representation the executive and judicial power or the whole and uncontrolled legislative on the contrary the experience of all ages has proved that they instantly give away their liberties into the hand of grandees or kings idols of their own creation the management of the executive and judicial powers together always corrupts them and throws the whole power into the hands of the most profligate and abandoned among themselves    the honest men are generally nearly equally divided in sentiment and therefore the vicious and unprincipled by joining one party carry the majority and the vicious and unprincipled always follow the most profligate leader him who bribes the highest and sets all decency and shame at defiance it becomes more profitable and reputable too except with a very few to be a party man than a publicspirited one it is agreed that the end of all government is the good and ease of the people in a secure enjoyment of their rights without oppression but it must be remembered that the rich are people as well as the poor that they have rights as well as others that they have as clear and as sacred a right to their large property as others have to theirs which is smaller that oppression to them is as possible and as wicked as to others that stealing robbing cheating are the same crimes and sins whether committed against them or others the rich therefore ought to have an effectual barrier in the constitution against being robbed plundered and murdered as well as the poor and this can never be without an independent senate the poor should have a bulwark against the same dangers and oppressions and this can never be without a house of representatives of the people but neither the rich nor the poor can be defended by their respective guardians in the constitution without an executive power vested with a negative equal to either to hold the balance even between them and decide when they cannot agree if it is asked when will this negative be used it may be answered perhaps never the known existence of it will prevent all occasion to exercise it but if it has not a being the want of it will be felt every day if it has not been used in england for a long time past it by no means follows that there have not been occasions when it might have been employed with propriety but one thing is very certain that there have been many occasions since the revolution when the constitution would have been overturned if the negative had not been an indubitable prerogative of the crown it is agreed that the people are most sensible of their own burdens and being once put into a capacity and freedom of acting are the most likely to provide remedies for their own relief for this reason they are an essential branch of the legislature and have a negative on all laws an absolute control over every grant of money and an unlimited right to accuse their enemies before    an impartial tribunal thus far they are most sensible of their burdens and are most likely to provide remedies but it is affirmed that they are not only incapable of managing the executive power but would be instantly corrupted by it in such numbers as would destroy the integrity of all elections it is denied that the legislative power can be wholly intrusted in their hands with a moments safety the poor and the vicious would instantly rob the rich and virtuous spend their plunder in debauchery or confer it upon some idol who would become the despot or to speak more intelligibly if not more accurately some of the rich by debauching the vicious to their corrupt interest would plunder the virtuous and become more rich until they acquired all the property or a balance of property and of power in their own hands and domineered as despots in an oligarchy it is agreed that the people know where the shoe wrings what grievances are most heavy and therefore they should always hold an independent and essential part in the legislature and be always able to prevent the shoe from wringing more and the grievances from being made more heavy they should have a full hearing of all their arguments and a full share of all consultations for easing the foot where it is in pain and for lessening the weight of grievances or annihilating them but it is denied that they have right or that they should have power to take from one man his property to make another easy and that they only know what fences they stand in need of to shelter them from the injurious assaults of those powers that are above them meaning by the powers above them senators and magistrates though properly speaking there are no powers above them but the law which is above all men governors and senators kings and nobles as well as commons the americans have agreed with this writer in the sentiment that it is but reason that the people should see that none be interested in the supreme authority but persons of their own election and such as must in a short time return again into the same condition with themselves this hazardous experiment they have tried and if elections are soberly made it may answer very well but if parties factions drunkenness bribes armies and delirium come in as they always have done sooner or later to embroil and decide every thing the people must again have recourse to conventions and find a remedy neither philosophy    nor policy has yet discovered any other cure than by prolonging the duration of the first magistrate and senators the evil may be lessened and postponed by elections for longer periods of years till they become for life and if this is not found an adequate remedy there will remain no other but to make them hereditary the delicacy or the dread of unpopularity that should induce any man to conceal this important truth from the full view and contemplation of the people would be a weakness if not a vice as to reaping the same benefit or burden by the laws enacted that befalls the rest of the people this will be secured whether the first magistrate and senate be elective or hereditary so long as the people are an integral branch of the legislature can be bound by no laws to which they have not consented and can be subjected to no tax which they have not agreed to lay it is agreed that the issue of such a constitution whether the governor and senate be hereditary or elective must be this that no load be laid upon any but what is common to all and that always by common consent not to serve the lusts of any but only to supply the necessities of their country the next paragraph is a figurative flourish calculated to amuse a populace without informing their understandings poetry and mystics will answer no good end in discussing questions of this nature the simplest style the most mathematical precision of words and ideas is best adapted to discover truth and to convey it to others in reasoning on this subject there is here a confusion that is more than accidental—it is artful the author purposely states the question and makes the comparison only between simple forms of government and carefully keeps out of sight the idea of a judicious mixture of them all he seems to suppose that the supreme power must be wholly in the hands of a simple monarch or of a single senate or of the people and studiously avoids considering the sovereignty lodged in a composition of all three when a supreme power long continues in the hands of any person or persons they by greatness of place being seated above the middle region of the people sit secure from all winds and weathers and from those storms of violence that nip and terrify the inferior part of the world if this is popular poetry it is not philosophical reasoning it may be made a question whether it is true in fact that persons in the    higher ranks of life are more exempted from dangers and evils that threaten the commonwealth than those in the middle or lower rank but if it were true the united states of america have established their governments upon a principle to guard against it and by a successive revolution of authority they come to be degraded of their earthly godheads and return into the same condition with other mortals and therefore they must needs be the more sensible and tender of what is laid upon them our author is not explicit if he meant that a fundamental law should be made that no man should be chosen more than one year he has nowhere said so he knew the nation would not have borne it cromwell and his creatures would all have detested it nor would the members of the long parliament or their constituents have approved it the idea would have been universally unpopular no people in the world will bear to be deprived at the end of one year of the service of their best men and be obliged to confer their suffrages from year to year on the next best until the rotation brings them to the worst the men of greatest interest and influence moreover will govern and if they cannot be chosen themselves they will generally influence the choice of others so decidedly that they may be said to have the appointment if it is true that the strongest obligation that can be laid upon a man in public matters is to see that he engage in nothing but what must either offensively or beneficially reflect upon himself it is equally true at least in a mixed government as in a simple democracy it is indeed more clearly and universally true because in the first the representatives of the people being the special guardians of equality equity and liberty for the people will not consent to unequal laws but in the second where the great and rich will have the greatest influence in the public councils they will continually make unequal laws in their own favor unless the poorer majority unite which they rarely do set up an opposition to them and run them down by making unequal laws against them in every society where property exists there will ever be a struggle between rich and poor mixed in one assembly equal laws can never be expected they will either be made by numbers to plunder the few who are rich or by influence to fleece the many who are poor both rich and poor then must be made independent that equal justice    may be done and equal liberty enjoyed by all to expect that in a single sovereign assembly no load shall be laid upon any but what is common to all nor to gratify the passions of any but only to supply the necessities of their country is altogether chimerical such an assembly under an awkward unwieldy form becomes at once a simple monarchy in effect some one overgrown genius fortune or reputation becomes a despot who rules the state at his pleasure while the deluded nation or rather a deluded majority thinks itself free and in every resolve law and act of government you see the interest fame and power of that single individual attended to more than the general good it is agreed that if any be never so good a patriot whether his power be prolonged or not he will find it hard to keep self from creeping in upon him and prompting him to some extravagances for his own private benefit but it is asserted that power will be prolonged in the hands of the same patriot the same rich able powerful and welldescended citizen c as much as if he had a seat for life or a hereditary seat in a senate and what is more destructive his power and influence is constantly increasing so that self is more certainly and rapidly growing upon him whereas in the other case it is defined limited and never materially varies if in the first case he be shortly to return to a condition common with the rest of his brethren it is only for a moment or a day or a week in order to be reëlected with fresh eclat redoubled popularity increased reputation influence and power selfinterest therefore binds him to propagate a false report and opinion that he does nothing but what is just and equal while in fact he is every day doing what is unjust and unequal while he is applying all the offices of the state great and small the revenues of the public and even the judicial power to the augmentation of his own wealth and honors and those of his friends and to the punishment depression and destruction of his enemies with the acclamations and hosannas of the majority of the people this without controversy must needs be the most noble the most just and the most excellent way of government in free states provided our author meant only a mixed state in which the people have an essential share and the command of the public purse with the judgment of causes and accusations as  0 jurors while their power is tempered and controlled by the aristocratical part of the community in another house and the executive in a distinct branch but as it is plain his meaning was to jumble all these powers in one centre a single assembly of representatives it must be pronounced the most ignoble unjust and detestable form of government worse than even a welldigested simple monarchy or aristocracy the greatest excellency of it is that it cannot last but hastens rapidly to a revolution for a further illustration of this subject let a supposition be made that in the year      when this book was printed the system of it had been reduced to practice a fair full and just representation of the people of england appears in the house of commons in westminster hall—my lordgeneral cromwell is returned for westminster or london ireton lambert c for other principal cities or counties monk sir harry vane c for others and even hugh peters for some borough—all eyes profoundly bow to my lordgeneral as the first member of the house the other principal characters are but his primary planets and the multitude but secondary altogether making a great majority in the interest of his highness if the majority is clear and able to excite a strong current of popular rumors ardor and enthusiasm in their favor their power will increase with every annual election until cromwell governs the nation more absolutely than any simple monarch in europe if there are in the house any members so daring as to differ in opinion they will lose their seats and more submissive characters be returned in their places but if the great men in the house should fall into pretty equal divisions then would begin a warfare of envy rancor hatred and abuse of each other until they divided the nation into two parties and both must take the field suppose for a further illustration the monarchical and aristocratical branches in england suspended and all authority lodged in the present house of commons—suppose that in addition to all the great national questions of legislation were added the promotion of all offices in the church the law the army navy excise customs and all questions of foreign alliance let all the foreign ambassadors as well as candidates for offices solicit there the contemplation must be amusing but there is not a member of the house could seriously wish it after thinking a    moment on the consequence the objects are smaller and the present temptations less in our american houses but the impropriety would be equally obvious though perhaps not so instantaneously destructive our author proceeds to prove his doctrine by examples out of roman history what more noble patriots were there ever in the world than the roman senators were whilst they were kept under by their kings and felt the same burdens of their fury as did the rest of the people if by the patriots are meant men who were brave and active in war to defend the commonwealth against its enemies the roman senators and patricians were under the kings as good patriots as the plebeians were and no better whether they were ever kept under by their kings or whether their kings were kept under by them i submit to livy and dionysius the whole line of their kings romulus numa tullus ancus lucius tarquinius servius tullius were meritorious princes yet the patricians and senators maintained a continual series of cabals against them constantly conspiring to set up one and pull down another romulus was put to death by the patricians tullus hostilius was murdered by the patricians lucius tarquinius was assassinated by the patricians and servius tullius too was murdered by the patricians to make way for tarquin some of these excellent princes were destroyed for being too friendly to the people and others for not being servile enough to the senate if it is patriotism to persecute to death every prince who had an equitable desire of doing justice and easing the burdens of the plebeians to intrigue in continual factions to set up one king and butcher another to consider friendship and humanity and equity to the plebeians as treason against the state and the highest crime that could be committed either by a king or patrician then the roman senators under the kings were noble patriots but the utmost degrees of jealousy envy arrogance ambition rancor rage and cruelty that ever constituted the aristocratical or oligarchical character in sparta venice poland or wherever unbalanced aristocratics have existed and been most enormous existed in the roman patricians under their kings what can our author mean by the senate and peoples feeling the burdens of the fury of their kings surely he had read the roman history did he mean to represent it the whole    line of roman kings until we come to tarquin the proud were mild moderate princes and their greatest fault in the eyes of the senators was an endeavor now and then to protect the people against the tyranny of the senate their greatest fault in the judgment of truth was too much complaisance to the senate by making the constitution more aristocratical witness the assemblies by centuries instituted by servius tullius but nedham should have considered what would have been the fruits in rome from the time of romulus of annual elections of senators to be vested with supreme power with all the authority of the king senate and people all those persons whose names we now read as kings and all those who are mentioned as senators would have caballed with the people as well as one another their passions would not have been extinguished the same jealousy and envy ambition and avarice revenge and cruelty would have been displayed in assemblies of the people sometimes one junto would have been popular sometimes another one set of principles would have prevailed one year and another the next now one law then another at this time one rule of property at that another riots tumults and battles would have been fought continually the law would have been a perfect proteus but as this confusion could not last long either a simple monarchy or an aristocracy must have arisen these might not have lasted long and all the revolutions described by plato and aristotle as growing out of one another and that we see in the greek roman and italian republics did grow out of one another must have taken place until the people weary of changes would have settled under a single tyranny and standing army unless they had been wise enough to establish a wellordered government of three branches it is easy to misrepresent and confound things in order to make them answer a purpose but it was not because the authority was permanent or standing or hereditary that the behavior of the senate was worse after the expulsion of the kings than it had been under them for the dignity of patricians and the authority of senators was equally standing permanent and hereditary under the kings from the institution of romulus to the expulsion of tarquin as it was afterwards from the expulsion of tarquin to the institution of tribunes and indeed to the subversion of the commonwealth it was not its permanency but its omnipotence    its being unlimited unbalanced uncontrolled that occasioned the abuse and this is precisely what we contend for that power is always abused when unlimited and unbalanced whether it be permanent or temporary a distinction that makes little difference in effect the temporary has often been the worst of the two because it has often been sooner abused and more grossly in order to obtain its revival at the stated period it is agreed that patricians nobles senators the aristocratical part of the community call it by what name you please are noble patriots when they are kept under they are really then the best men and the best citizens but there is no possibility of keeping them under but by giving them a master in a monarchy and two masters in a free government one of the masters i mean is the executive power in the first magistrate and the other is the people in their house of representatives under these two masters they are in general the best men citizens magistrates generals or other officers they are the guardians ornaments and glory of the community nedham talks of senate and peoples feeling the burdens of the fury of the kings but as we cannot accuse this writer of ignorance this must have been either artifice or inadvertence there is not in the whole roman history so happy a period as this under their kings the whole line were excellent characters and fathers of their people notwithstanding the continual cabals of the nobles against them the nation was formed their morality their religion the maxims of their government were all established under these kings the nation was defended against innumerable and warlike nations of enemies in short rome was never so well governed or so happy as soon as the monarchy was abolished and an ambitious republic of haughty aspiring aristocratics was erected they were seized with the ambition of conquest and became a torment to themselves and the world our author confesses that being freed from the kingly yoke and having secured all power within the hands of themselves and their posterity they fell into the same absurdities that had been before committed by their kings so that this new yoke became more intolerable than the former it would be more conformable to the truth of history to say that they continued to behave exactly as they had done but having no kings to murder they had only people to destroy the sovereign power    was in them under the kings and the cause of their greatest animosity against their kings next to the ambitious desire of getting into their places was their too frequent patronage of the people the only change made by the revolution was to take off a little awe which the name of king inspired the office with all its dignities authorities and powers was in fact continued under the title of consul it was made annually elective it is true and became accordingly a mere tool of the senate wholly destitute of any power or will to protect plebeians a disposition which the hereditary kings always discovered more or less and thereby became odious to the senate for there is no sin or crime so heinous in the judgment of patricians as for any one of their own rank to court plebeians or become their patron protector or friend it is very true that the new yoke was more intolerable than the old nor could the people find any remedy until they procured that necessary office of the tribunes this was some remedy but a very feeble and ineffectual one nor if the people had instituted an annual assembly of five hundred representatives would that have been an effectual remedy without a plenary executive power in the consul the senate and assembly would have been soon at war and the leader of the victorious army master of the state if the tribunes by being invested with a temporary authority by the peoples election remained the more sensible of their condition the american governors and senators vested as they are with a temporary authority by the peoples election will remain sensible of their condition too if they do not become too sensible of it and discover that flattery and bribery and partiality are better calculated to procure renovations of their authority than honesty liberty and equality happy indeed shall we all be what more excellent patriot could there be than manlius till he became corrupted by time and power is it a clear case that manlius was corrupted to me he appears the best patriot in roman history the most humane the most equitable the greatest friend of liberty and the most desirous of a constitution truly free the real friend of the people and the enemy of tyranny in every shape as well as the greatest hero and warrior of his age a much greater character than camillus our authors expression implies that there was no greater patriot    until he saw the necessity of newmodelling the constitution and was concerting measures upon the true principle of liberty the authority of the people to place checks upon the senate but manlius is an unfortunate instance for our author it was not time and power that inspired him with his designs the jealousy and envy of the senate had removed him from power he was neither consul dictator nor general aristocratical envy had set up camillus and continued him in power both as consul and dictator on purpose to rival and mortify manlius it was discontinuance of power then that corrupted him if he was corrupted and this generally happens disappointed candidates for popular elections are as often corrupted by their fall from power as hereditary aristocratics by their continuance in it who more noble courteous and well affected to the common good than was appius claudius at first but afterwards having obtained a continuation of the government in his own hands he soon lost his primitive innocency and integrity and devoted himself to all the practices of an absolute tyrant this is very true but it was not barely continuation of power it was absolute power that did the mischief if the power had been properly limited in degree it might have been continued without limitation of time without corrupting him though it might be better to limit it both in degree and in time and it must never be forgotten that it was the people not the senate that continued him in power the senate acted an arbitrary and reprehensible part when they thought to continue lucius quinctius in the consulship longer than the time limited by law by violating the law they became tyrants and their act was void that gallant man acted only the part of a good citizen in refusing to set a precedent so prejudicial to the roman constitution his magnanimity merits praise but perhaps he was the only senator who would have refused and we cannot safely reckon upon such selfdenial in forming any constitution of government but it may be depended on that when the whole power is in one assembly whether of patricians or plebeians or any mixture of both a favorite will be continued in power whenever the majority wishes it and every conceivable fundamental law or even oath against it will be dispensed with a seventh reason why a people qualified with a due and    orderly succession of their supreme assemblies are the best keepers of their own liberties is because as in other forms those persons only have access to government who are apt to serve the lust and will of the prince or else are parties or compliers with some popular faction so in this form of government by the people the door of dignity stands open to all without exception that ascend thither by the steps of worth and virtue the consideration whereof hath this noble effect in free states that it edges mens spirits with an active emulation and raiseth them to a lofty pitch of design and action this is a mass of popular assertions either hazarded at random or if aimed at a point very little guarded by the love of truth it is no more true that in other forms those persons only have access to government who are apt to serve the lust and will of a prince or a faction than it is that in our authors form those only would obtain elections who will serve the lusts and wills of the most idle vicious and abandoned of the people at the expense of the labor wealth and reputation of the most industrious virtuous and pious the door of dignity in such a government is so far from standing open to all of worth and virtue that if the executive and judicial powers are managed in it virtue and worth will soon be excluded in an absolute monarchy the road to preferment may lie open to all in an aristocracy the way of promotion may be open to all and all offices in the executive department as in the army navy courts of justice foreign embassies revenues c may be filled from any class of the people in a mixed government consisting of three branches all offices ever will be open for when the popular branch is destined expressly to defend the rights of the people it is not probable they will ever consent to a law that shall exclude any class of their constituents in this kind of government indeed the chance for merit to prevail is greater than in any other the executive having the appointment to all offices and the ministers of that executive being responsible for every exercise of their power they are more cautious they are responsible to their master for the recommendation they give and to the nation and its representatives for the appointments that are made whereas a single representative assembly is accountable to nobody if it is admitted that each member is accountable to his constituents for the vote he gives what is the penalty    no other than not to vote for him at the next election and what punishment is that his constituents know or care nothing about any offices or officers but such as lie within the limits of their parish and let him vote right or wrong about all others he has equally their thanks and future votes what can the people of the cities countries boroughs and corporations in england know of the characters of all the generals admirals ambassadors judges and bishops whom they never saw nor perhaps heard of but was there never a sully colbert malesherbes turgot or necker called to power in france nor a burleigh nor a pitt in england was there never a camillus appointed by a senate nor a de ruyter van tromp or de witt by an aristocratical body when a writer is not careful to confine himself to truth but allows himself a latitude of affirmation and denial merely addressed to an ignorant populace there is no end of ingenuity in invention in this case his object was to run down an exiled king and a depressed nobility and it must be confessed he is not very delicate in his means there are in truth examples innumerable of excellent generals admirals judges ambassadors bishops and of all other officers and magistrates appointed by monarchs absolute as well as limited and by hereditary senates excellent appointments have been also made by popular assemblies but candor must allow that very weak injudicious and unfortunate choices have been sometimes made by such assemblies too but the best appointments for a course of time have invariably been made in mixed governments the active emulation in free states is readily allowed but it is not less active less general or less lofty in design or action in mixed governments than in simple ones even simple democracies or those which approach nearest to that description and the instances alleged from the roman history are full proofs of this during the vassalage of the romans under kings we read not of any notable exploits but find them confined within a narrow compass oppressed at home and ever and anon ready to be swallowed up by their enemies it is really impossible to guess where this author learnt his history the reigns of the kings are a complete confutation of his assertions the vassalage was to the nobles if to anybody under the kings the    kings were friends and fathers of the people in general if the people were oppressed at home it was by the patricians but they appear to have been much less oppressed than they were under the aristocracy which succeeded the abolition of monarchy as our author himself confesses but when the state was made free indeed and the people admitted into a share and interest in the government as well as the great ones then it was that their power began to exceed the bounds of italy and aspire towards that prodigious empire was rome ever a free state according to our authors idea of a free state were the people ever governed by a succession of sovereign power in their assemblies was not the senate the real sovereign through all the changes from romulus to julius cæsar when the tribunes were instituted the people obtained a check upon the senate but not a balance the utmost that can with truth be said is that it was a mixed government composed of three powers the monarchical in the kings or consuls the aristocratical in the senate and the democratical in the people and their tribunes with the principal share and real sovereignty in the senate the mixture was unequal and the balance inadequate but it was this mixture with all its imperfections that edged mens spirits with an active emulation and raised them to a lofty pitch of design and action it was in consequence of this composition that their thoughts and power began to exceed the bounds of italy and aspire towards that prodigious empire in such a mixture where the people have a share and the road to preferment lies plain to every man no public work is done nor any conquest made but every man thinks he does and conquers for himself in some degree but this sentiment is as vivid and active surely where the people have an equal share with the senate as where they have only an imperfect check by their tribunes when our author advances that it was not alliance nor friendship nor faction nor riches that could advance men he affirms more than can be proved from any period of the roman or any other history if he had contented himself with saying that these were not exclusive or principal causes of advancement it would have been as great a panegyric as any nation at any period has deserved knowledge valor and virtue were often preferred above them all and if we add generally it is as    much as the truth will bear our author talks of a preference of virtuous poverty but there was no moment in the roman or any other history when poverty however virtuous was preferred for its own sake there have been times and countries when poverty was not an insuperable objection to the employment of a man in the highest stations but an absolute love of poverty and a preference of a man for that attribute alone never existed out of the imaginations of enthusiastic writers in the roman story some few of their brave patriots and conquerors were men of small fortune and of so rare a temper of spirit that they little cared to improve them or enrich themselves by their public employment some indeed were buried at the public charge and perhaps this race is not quite extinct but the examples are so rare that he who shall build his frame of government upon a presumption that characters of this stamp will arise in succession in sufficient numbers to preserve the honor and liberty and promote the prosperity of his people will find himself mistaken the time will come said a roman senator when horatii and valerii will not be found to forego their private fortunes for the sake of plebeian liberty his prediction was fulfilled and a similar prophecy will be accomplished in every nation under heaven the instances too of this kind in the roman history are all of patricians and senators we do not find one example of a popular tribune who was so in love with poverty cincinnatus was a patrician a senator of a splendid family and no mean fortune until his son cæso was prosecuted and obliged to fly from his bail the father had too noble and sublime a spirit to let the bail be ruined and sold his fortune to pay the forfeiture when this was done he had only four or six acres left but who was it that made him dictator not the people nor the tribunes but the senate that very standing power against which our authors whole book is written by no means by a successive sovereignty of the peoples representatives which our author all along contends for had the appointment of a dictator at that time lain with the people most probably a richer man would have had the preference he behaved with so much magnanimity integrity and wisdom that he subdued the enemy and quitted his authority with all willingness and returned to painful private life this example is a good argument for a mixed government and for a senate as an  0 essential part of it but no argument for a successive sovereignty in the peoples representatives gracchus marius sylla and cæsar whose elevation to power was by the people in opposition to the senate did not exhibit such moderation and contentment our authors other examples of lucius tarquin and atilius regulus by no means prove such disinterested and magnanimous virtue to be ordinary in that state nor does lucius paulus æmilius lucius tarquin or lucius tarquinius collatinus was not only a patrician and a senator but of the royal family and therefore by no means an example to show what the conduct of a general or other officer or magistrate will be who shall be appointed by a majority of the peoples successive annual representatives he was the husband of lucretia whose blood had expelled the king it was in an assembly of the centuries where the senate were all powerful that he was appointed consul with brutus valerius was the favorite of the plebeians collatia had been given by the king to ancus tarquin because he had no estate and from thence the family were called collatini at the siege of ardea the frolic commenced between collatinus and the other young tarquins over wine which ended in the visit to their wives which proved at first so honorable to the domestic virtues of lucretia and afterwards so fatal to her life it occasioned also the expulsion of kings and institution of consuls brutus and collatinus were created consuls but by whom by the people it is true but it was in their assembly by centuries so that it was the senate and patricians who decided the vote if the people in their tribes or by their successive representatives had made the election collatinus would not have been chosen but valerius who expected it and had most contributed next to brutus to the revolution and by the way we may observe here that an aversion to public honors and offices by no means appears in the behavior of the virtuous and popular valerius his desire of the office of consul was so ardent that his disappointment and chagrin induced him in a sullen illhumor to withdraw from the senate and the forum and renounce public affairs which so alarmed the people that they dreaded his reconciliation and coalition with the exiled family he soon removed this jealousy by taking the oath by which brutus wanted to bind the senate against    kings and kingly government all the art of the patricians with brutus at their head was now exerted to intoxicate the people with superstition sacrifices and ceremonies were introduced and the consuls approaching the altar swore for themselves their children and all posterity never to recall tarquin or his sons or any of his family that the romans should never more be governed by kings that those who should attempt to restore monarchy should be devoted to the infernal gods and condemned to the most cruel torments and an abhorrence of royalty became the predominant character of the romans to such a degree that they could never bear the name of king even when under the emperors they admitted much more than the thing in an unlimited despotism but is the cause of liberty are the rights of mankind to stand for ever on no better a foundation than a blind superstition and a popular prejudice against a word a mere name it was really no more in this case for even brutus himself intended that the consuls should have all the power of the kings and it was only against a family and a name that he declared war if nations and peoples cannot be brought to a more rational way of thinking and to judge of things instead of being intoxicated with prejudice and superstition against words it cannot be expected that truth virtue or liberty will have much chance in the establishment of governments the monarchical and aristocratical portions of society will for ever understand better how to operate upon the superstition the prejudices passions fancies and senses of the people than the democratical and therefore will forever worm out liberty if she has no other resource tarquin by his ambassadors solicited at least the restoration of his property brutus opposed it collatinus the other consul advocated the demand of his royal banished cousin the senate was divided the question was referred to the people assembled by centuries the two consuls zealously supported their different opinions collatinus prevailed by one vote tarquins ambassadors rejoice and intrigue a conspiracy was formed in which a great part of the young nobility was concerned two of the vitellii sons of collatinuss sister and brothers of brutuss wife two of the aquilii sons of another sister of collatinus as well as two of brutuss sons were engaged in it when the conspiracy was discovered brutus alone    was inexorable collatinus endeavored to save his nephews collatinus as the husband of lucretia appears to have been actuated by resentment against the person of tarquin but not to have been very hearty in the expulsion of the family or the abolition of monarchy his warmly contending for the restitution of tarquins effects and his aversion to the condemnation of the conspirators completed his ruin with brutus he assembled the people and was very sorry that the roman people did not think their liberties safe while they saw the name and blood of tarquin not only safe in rome but vested with sovereign power and a dangerous obstacle to liberty collatinus was amazed at such a speech and prepared to defend himself from this attack but finding his fatherinlaw spurius lucretius join brutus and other principal men in persuading him and fearing that he should be forced into banishment with the confiscation of his estate he abdicated the consulship and retired to lavinium but he carried all his effects with him and twenty talents or £     sterling to which brutus added five talents more a most enormous sum if we consider the universal poverty of that age and the high value of money is it possible to find in this character and conduct of collatinus such disinterested and magnanimous virtue as our author speaks of is this an example to prove that disinterested virtue was frequent in that state he must have been dead to every manly feeling if he had not resented the rape and death of his wife he did not retire but to avoid banishment nor was he contented without his whole estate and a splendid addition to it so that there is scarcely a character or anecdote in history less to our authors purpose in any point of view there is an extravagance in many popular writers in favor of republican governments which injures much oftener than it serves the cause of liberty such is that of our author when he cites the example of regulus let us first remember however that regulus was a patrician and a senator and that he was appointed to his command and continued in it by the senate and therefore instead of being an example in honor of a simple or a representative democracy it operates in favor of an aristocracy or at most in favor of a mixed government in which an aristocracy has one full third part regulus had been in a course of victory which the senate would not interrupt and    therefore continued him in the command of the army he wrote to the senate to complain of it the glory of it to himself the advantage to the public was not reward enough for him he demanded a successor and what was his reason a thief had stolen his tools of husbandry used in manuring his tenant was dead and his presence was absolutely necessary to prevent his wife and children from starving is it possible to read this without laughter and indignation laughter at the folly of that government which made so poor a provision for its generals and indignation at the sordid avarice of that senate and people who could require a threat of resignation from the conqueror of carthage to induce them to provide for his wife and children the senate decreed that his field should be cultivated at the public expense that his working tools should be replaced and his wife and children provided for then indeed reguluss aversion to the service was removed to such sordid condescensions to the prejudices and the meanness of the stingy and envious parts of the community are such exalted souls as that of regulus obliged sometimes to submit but the eternal panegyrics of republican writers as they call themselves will never reconcile mankind to any thing so ridiculous and contemptible the laborer is worthy of his hire he who labors for the public should live by the public as much as he who preaches the gospel should live by the gospel and these maxims of equity are approved by all the generous part of mankind and the people whose heads are turned with contracted notions of a contrary nature will forever be the dupes of the designing for where you will find a single regulus you will find ten thousand cæsars the example of paulus æmilius is equally hostile to our authors system and equally friendly to that which we contend for the first consul of that name the conqueror of illyricum in     although he returned to rome in triumph yet at the expiration of his office he was cited before the people in their tribes and accused of having converted part of the spoils to his own use æmilius had great difficulty to escape the condemnation which his colleague suffered this great patrician and consul commanded and was killed at the battle of cannæ his son of the same name whose sister æmilius was married to the great scipio distinguished himself by avoiding those intrigues solicitations caresses and other artifices practised by most candidates    even at this time     his pains were employed to make himself esteemed by valor justice and ardor in his duty in which he surpassed all the young men of his age he carried the ædileship against ten competitors every one of whom was so distinguished by birth and merit as afterwards to obtain the consulship by his wife papiria he had two sons whom he procured to be adopted into the most illustrious houses in rome the eldest by fabius maximus five times consul and dictator the younger by a son of scipio africanus his two daughters he married one to a son of cato the censor and the other to tubero in     he gained a complete victory over the lusitanians in which he killed them eighteen thousand men and took their camp with thirteen hundred prisoners in the offices of ædile and of augur he excelled all his contemporaries in the knowledge and practice of his duty and military discipline he carried to greater perfection than had ever been known nevertheless when he stood for any office even in these virtuous times there was always an opposition and he could not obtain the consulship till after he had suffered several repulses why because his virtue was too severe not for the senate but the people and because he would not flatter and bribe the people before the end of the year of his first consulate he fought the ligurians and gained a complete victory over them killing more than fifteen thousand men and making near three thousand prisoners and returned to rome in triumph yet with all this merit when he stood candidate some years after for the consulate the people rejected him upon this he retired to educate his children he was frugal in every thing of private luxury but magnificent in expenses of public duty grammarians rhetoricians philosophers sculptors painters equerries hunters were procured for the instruction of his children while he was thus employed in private life in     fourteen years after his first consulship the affairs of the republic were ignorantly conducted and the macedonians with perseus at their head gained great advantages against them people were not satisfied with the conduct of the consuls of late years and began to say that the roman name was not supported the cry was that the command of armies must no longer be given to faction and favor the singular merit of æmilius his splendid services the confidence which the troops had in his capacity and the urgent necessity    of the times for his wisdom and firmness turned all eyes upon him all his relations and the senators in general urged him to stand candidate he had already experienced so much ingratitude injustice and caprice that he shunned the present ardor and chose to continue in private life that very people who had so often ill used him and rejected him now crowded before his door and insisted on his going to the forum and his presence there was universally considered as a sure presage of victory and he was unanimously elected consul and appointed commander in macedonia he conquered perseus and his macedonian phalanx and in the battle he formed fabiuses and scipios to be the glory and triumph of his country after him he plundered the immense wealth of macedonia and epirus he plundered seventy cities and demolished their walls the spoils were sold and each soldier had two hundred denarii and each of the horse four the soldiers and common people it seems had little of that disinterestedness for which æmilius was remarkable they were so offended at their general for giving so little of the booty to them and reserving so much to the public treasury that they raised a great cry and opposition against his triumph and galba the soldiers and their friends among the plebeians were determined to teach the great men the consuls generals c to be less publicspirited—to defraud the treasury of its wealth and bestow it upon them they accordingly opposed the triumph of this great and disinterested general and the first tribes absolutely rejected it who upon this occasion saved the honor justice and dignity of the republic not the plebeians but the senators the senators were highly enraged at this infamous injustice and ingratitude and this daring effort of popular licentiousness and avarice and were obliged to make a noise and excite a tumult servilius too who had been consul and had killed threeandtwenty enemies who had challenged him in single combat made a long speech in which he showed the baseness of their conduct in so striking a light that he made the people ashamed of themselves and at length they consented to the triumph but to all appearance more from a desire to see the show of perseus laden with chains led through the city before the chariot of the victor than from any honest and publicspirited design to reward merit the sum which he caused to be carried into the public treasury    on the day of the triumph was one million three hundred thousand pounds sterling and caused the taxes of the roman people to be abolished at his death after the sale of part of his slaves movables and some farms to pay his wifes dower the remainder of his fortune was but nine thousand three hundred and seventyfive pounds sterling as he was descended from one of the most noble and ancient houses of rome illustrious by the highest dignities the smallness of his fortune reflects honor on his ancestors as well as on himself the love of simplicity was still supported in some of the great families by extreme care not to ally themselves with luxurious ones and æmilius chose tubero of the family of ælii whose first piece of plate was a silver cup of five pounds weight given him by his fatherinlaw these few families stemmed the torrent of popular avarice and extravagance let us now consider what would have been the fate of æmilius if rome had been governed at this time by nedhams succession of the peoples representatives unchecked by a senate it is plain he must have given into the common practice of flattering caressing soothing bribing and cajoling the people or never have been consul never commanded armies never triumphed an example more destructive of our authors system can scarcely be found and yet he has the inadvertence at least to adduce it in support of his right constitution of a commonwealth it has been necessary to quote these anecdotes at some length that we may not be deceived by a specious show which is destitute of substance truth and fact to support it but how come all these examples to be patricians and senators and not one instance to be found of a plebeian commander who did not make a different use of his power there is a strange confusion or perversion in what follows rome never thrived until it was settled in a freedom of the people rome never was settled in a freedom of the people meaning in a free state according to our authors definition of it a succession of the supreme authority in the peoples representatives such an idea never existed in the roman commonwealth not even when or before the people made cæsar a perpetual dictator rome never greatly prospered until the people obtained a small mixture of authority a slight check upon the    senate by their tribunes this therefore is proof in favor of the mixture and against the system of our author freedom was preserved and that interest best advanced when all places of honor and trust were exposed to men of merit without distinction true but this never happened till the mixture took place this happiness could never be obtained until the people were instated in a capacity of preferring whom they thought worthy by a freedom of electing men successively into their supreme offices and assemblies what is meant here by supreme offices there were none in rome but the dictators and they were appointed by the senate at least until marius annihilated the senate by making the tribes omnipotent consuls could not be called supreme officers in any sense what is meant by supreme assemblies there were none but the senate the roman people never had the power of electing a representative assembly so long as this custom continued and merit took place the people made shift to keep and increase their liberties this custom never took place and strictly speaking the roman people never enjoyed liberty the senate was sovereign till the people set up a perpetual dictator when this custom lay neglected and the stream of preferment began to run along with the favor and pleasure of particular powerful men then vice and compliance making way for advancement the people could keep their liberties no longer but both their liberties and themselves were made the price of every mans ambition and luxury but when was this precisely when the people began and in proportion as they approached to an equality of power with the senate and to that state of things which our author contends for so that the whole force of his reasoning and examples when they come to be analyzed conclude against him the eighth reason why the people in their assemblies are the best keepers of their liberty is because it is they only that are concerned in the point of liberty it is agreed that the people in their assemblies tempered by another coequal assembly and an executive coequal with either are the best keepers of their liberties but it is denied that in one assembly collective or representative they are the best keepers it may be reasonably questioned whether they are not the worst because they are as    sure to throw away their liberties as a monarch or a senate untempered are to take them with this additional evil that they throw away their morals at the same time whereas monarchs and senates sometimes by severity preserve them in some degree in a simple democracy the first citizen and the better sort of citizens are part of the people and are equally concerned with any others in the point of liberty but is it clear that in other forms of government the main interest and concernment both of kings and grandees lies either in keeping the people in utter ignorance what liberty is or else in allowing and pleasing them only with the name and shadow of liberty instead of the substance it is very true that knowledge is very apt to make people uneasy under an arbitrary and oppressive government but a simple monarch or a sovereign senate which is not arbitrary and oppressive though absolute if such cases can exist would be interested to promote the knowledge of the nation it must however be admitted that simple governments will rarely if ever favor the dispersion of knowledge among the middle and lower ranks of people but this is equally true of simple democracy the people themselves if uncontrolled will never long tolerate a freedom of inquiry debate or writing their idols must not be reflected on nor their schemes and actions scanned upon pain of popular vengeance which is not less terrible than that of despots or sovereign senators in free states the people being sensible of their past condition in former times under the power of great ones and comparing it with the possibilities and enjoyments of the present become immediately instructed that their main interest and concernment consists in liberty and are taught by common sense that the only way to secure it from the reach of great ones is to place it in the peoples hands adorned with all the prerogatives and rights of supremacy it is very true that the main interest and concernment of the people is liberty if their liberties are well secured they may be happy if they will and they generally perhaps always are so the way to secure liberty is to place it in the peoples hands that is to give them a power at all times to defend it in the legislature and in the courts of justice but to give the people uncontrolled all the prerogatives and rights of supremacy meaning the whole executive and judicial power or even the whole undivided legislative is not the way to preserve    liberty in such a government it is often as great a crime to oppose or decry a popular demagogue or any of his principal friends as in a simple monarchy to oppose a king or in a simple aristocracy the senators the people will not bear a contemptuous look or disrespectful word nay if the style of your homage flattery and adoration is not as hyperbolical as the popular enthusiasm dictates it is construed into disaffection the popular cry of envy jealousy suspicious temper vanity arrogance pride ambition impatience of a superior is set up against a man and the rage and fury of an ungoverned rabble stimulated underhand by the demagogic despots breaks out into every kind of insult obloquy and outrage often ending in murders and massacres like those of the de witts more horrible than any that the annals of despotism can produce it is indeed true that the interest of freedom is a virgin that every one seeks to deflour and like a virgin it must be kept or else so great is the lust of mankind after dominion there follows a rape upon the first opportunity from this it follows that liberty in the legislature is more secure in the peoples than in any other hands because they are most concerned in it provided you keep the executive power out of their hands entirely and give the property and liberty of the rich a security in a senate against the encroachments of the poor in a popular assembly without this the rich will never enjoy any liberty property reputation or life in security the rich have as clear a right to their liberty and property as the poor it is essential to liberty that the rights of the rich be secured if they are not they will soon be robbed and become poor and in their turn rob their robbers and thus neither the liberty or property of any will be regarded the careful attention to liberty makes the people both jealous and zealous keeping a constant guard against the attempts and encroachments of any powerful or crafty underminers but this is true only while they are made a distinct body from the executive power and the most conspicuous citizens mingle all together and a scramble instantly commences for the loaves and fishes abolition of debts shutting up courts of justice divisions of property c is it not an insult to common sense for a people with the same breath to cry liberty an abolition of debts and division of goods if debts are once abolished and goods  0 are divided there will be the same reason for a fresh abolition and division every month and every day and thus the idle vicious and abandoned will live in constant riot on the spoils of the industrious virtuous and deserving powerful and crafty underminers have nowhere such rare sport as in a simple democracy or single popular assembly nowhere not in the completest despotisms does human nature show itself so completely depraved so nearly approaching an equal mixture of brutality and devilism as in the last stages of such a democracy and in the beginning of that despotism that always succeeds it a people having once tasted the sweets of freedom are so affected with it that if they discover or do but suspect the least design to encroach upon it they count it a crime never to be forgiven strange perversion of truth and fact this is so far from the truth that our author himself is not able to produce a single instance of it as a proof or illustration instead of adducing an example of it from a simple democracy he is obliged to have recourse to an example that operates strongly against him because taken from an aristocracy in the roman state one gave up his children another his brother to death to revenge an attempt against common liberty was brutus a man of the people was brutus for a government of the people in their sovereign assemblies was not brutus a patrician did he not think patricians a different order of beings from plebeians did he not erect a simple aristocracy did he not sacrifice his sons to preserve that aristocracy is it not equally probable that he would have sacrificed them to preserve his aristocracy from any attempt to set up such a government as our author contends for or even against any attempt to have given the plebeians a share in the government nay against any attempt to erect the office of tribunes at that time divers sacrificed their lives to preserve it to preserve what the standing government of grandees against which our authors whole book is written some sacrificed their best friends to vindicate it upon bare suspicion as in the case of mælius and manlius to vindicate what liberty popular liberty plebeian liberty precisely the contrary these characters were murdered for daring to be friends to popular liberty for daring to    think of limiting the power of the grandees by introducing a share of popular authority and a mixed constitution and the people themselves were so far from the zeal jealousy and love of liberty that our author ascribes to them that they suffered their own authority to be prostituted before their eyes to the destruction of the only friends they had and to the establishment of their enemies and a form of government by grandees under which they had no liberty and in which they had no share our author then cites examples of revenge in greece the year      was a late age in the history of philosophy as well as morality and religion for any writer to preach revenge as a duty and a virtue reason and philanthropy as well as religion pronounce it a weakness and a vice in all possible cases examples enough of it however may be found in all revolutions but monarchies and aristocracies have practised it and therefore the virtue of revenge is not peculiar to our authors plan in corcyra itself the people were massacred by the grandees as often as they massacred the grandees and of all kinds of spirits that we read of out of hell this is the last that an enlightened friend of liberty would philosophically inculcate let legal liberty vindicate itself by legal punishments and moral measures but mobs and massacres are the disgrace of her sacred cause still more than that of humanity florence too and cosmus are quoted and the alternatives of treachery revenge and cruelty all arising as they did in greece from the want of a proper division of authority and an equal balance let any one read the history of the first cosimo his wisdom virtues and unbounded popularity and then consider what would have been the consequence if florence at that period had been governed by our authors plan of successive single assemblies chosen by the people annually it is plain that the people would have chosen such and such only for representatives as cosimo and his friends would have recommended at least a vast majority of them would have been his followers and he would have been absolute it was the aristocracy and the forms of the old constitution that alone served as a check upon him the speech of uzzano must convince one that the people were more ready to make him absolute than ever the romans were to make cæsar a perpetual dictator he confesses    that cosimo was followed by the whole body of the plebeians and by one half of the nobles that if cosimo was not made master of the commonwealth rinaldo would be whom he dreaded much more in truth the government at this time was in reality become monarchical and that illdigested aristocracy which they called a popular state existed only in form and the persecution of cosimo only served to explain the secret will it be denied that a nation has a right to choose a government for themselves the question was really no more than this whether rinaldo or cosimo should be master the nation declared for cosimo reversed that banishment into which he had been very unjustly sent by rinaldo demanded his return and voted him the father of his country this alone is full proof that if the people had been the keepers of their own liberties in their successive assemblies they would have given them all to cosimo whereas had there been an equal mixture of monarchy aristocracy and democracy in that constitution the nobles and commons would have united against cosimo the moment he attempted to overleap the boundaries of his legal authority uzzano confesses that unless charity liberality and beneficence were crimes cosimo was guilty of no offence and that there was as much to apprehend from his own party as from the other in the point of liberty all the subsequent attempts of rinaldo to put cosimo to death and to banish him were unqualified tyranny he saved his life it is true by a bribe but what kind of patrons of liberty were these who would betray it for a bribe his recall and return from banishment seem to have been the general voice of the nation expressed according to the forms and spirit of the present constitution without any appearance of such treachery as our author suggests whether nedham knew the real history of florence is very problematical all his examples from it are so unfortunate as to be conclusive against his project of a government the real essence of the government in florence had been for the greatest part of fifty years a monarchy in the hands of uzzano and maso according to machiavels own account its form an aristocracy and its name a popular state nothing of the essence was changed by the restoration of cosimo the form and name only underwent an alteration    holstein too is introduced merely to make a story for the amusement of a drunken mob here is a health to the remembrance of our liberty said the boorish poor silly generation seventy years after they were made a duchy many hogsheads of ale and porter i doubt not were drank in england in consequence of this holstein story and that was all the effect it could have towards supporting our authors argument how deep soever the impression may be that is made by the love of freedom in the minds of the people it will not follow that they alone are the best keepers of their own liberties being more tender and more concerned in their security than any powerful pretenders whatsoever are not the senators whether they be hereditary or elective under the influence of powerful motives to be tender and concerned for the security of liberty every senator who consults his reason knows that his own liberty and that of his posterity must depend upon the constitution which preserves it to others what greater refuge can a nation have than in a council in which the national maxims and the spirit and genius of the state are preserved by a living tradition what stronger motive to virtue and to the preservation of liberty can the human mind perceive next to those of rewards and punishments in a future life than the recollection of a long line of ancestors who have sat within the walls of the senate and guided the councils led the armies commanded the fleets and fought the battles of the people by which the nation has been sustained in its infant years defended from dangers and carried through calamities to wealth grandeur prosperity and glory what institution more useful can possibly exist than a living repertory of all the history knowledge interests and wisdom of the commonwealth and a living representative of all the great characters whose prudence wisdom and valor are registered in the history and recorded in the archives of the country if the people have the periodical choice of these we may hope they will generally select those among the most conspicuous for fortune family and wealth who are most signalized for virtue and wisdom which is more advantageous than to be confined to the eldest son however defective to the exclusion of younger sons though excellent and to one family though decayed and depraved to another more deserving as in hereditary senates    but that a senate guarded from ambition should be objected to by a friend of liberty and republican government is very extraordinary let the people have a full share and a decisive negative and with this impregnable barrier against the ambition of the senate on one side and the executive power with an equal negative on the other such a council will be found the patron and guardian of liberty on many occasions when the giddy thoughtless multitude and even their representatives would neglect forget or even despise and insult it instances of all which are not difficult to find the ninth reason is because the people are less luxurious than kings or grandees that may well be denied kings nobles and people are all alike in this respect and in general know no other bounds of indulgence than the capacity of enjoyment and the power to gratify it the problem ought to be to find a form of government best calculated to prevent the bad effects and corruption of luxury when in the ordinary course of things it must be expected to come in kings and nobles if they are confessed to enjoy or indulge in luxury more than the commons it is merely because they have more means and opportunities not because they have stronger appetites passions and fancies or in other words a stronger propensity to luxury than the plebeians if it should be conceded that the passions and appetites strengthen by indulgence it must be confessed too that they have more motives to restrain them but in regard to mere animal gratification it may well be denied that they indulge or enjoy more than the common people on an average eating and drinking surely is practised with as much satisfaction by the footman as his lord and as much pleasure may be tasted in gin brandy ale and porter as in burgundy or tokay in beef and pudding as in ortolans and jellies if we consider nations together we shall find that intemperance and excess are more indulged in the lowest ranks than in the highest the luxury of dress beyond the defence from the weather is a mere matter of politics and etiquette throughout all the ranks of life and in the higher ranks rises only in proportion as it rises in the middle and the lowest the same is true of furniture and equipage after the ordinary conveniences and accommodations of life those who claim or aspire to the highest ranks of life will eternally go to a    certain degree above those below them in these particulars if their incomes will allow it consideration is attainable by appearance and ever will be and it may be depended on that rich men in general will not suffer others to be considered more than themselves or as much if they can prevent it by their riches the poor and the middle ranks then have it in their power to diminish luxury as much as the great and rich have let the middle and lower ranks lessen their style of living and they may depend upon it the higher ranks will lessen theirs it is commonly said every thing is regis ad exemplum that the lower ranks imitate the higher and it is true but it is equally true that the higher imitate the lower the higher ranks will never exceed their inferiors but in a certain proportion but the distinction they are absolutely obliged to keep up or fall into contempt and ridicule it may gratify vulgar malignity and popular envy to declaim eternally against the rich and the great the noble and the high but generally and philosophically speaking the manners and characters of a nation are all alike the lowest and the middling people in general grow vicious vain and luxurious exactly in proportion as to appearance the higher sort are obliged to raise theirs in proportion as the stories below ascend a free people are the most addicted to luxury of any that equality which they enjoy and in which they glory inspires them with sentiments which hurry them into luxury a citizen perceives his fellowcitizen whom he holds his equal have a better coat or hat a better house or horse than himself and sees his neighbors are struck with it talk of it and respect him for it he cannot bear it he must and will be upon a level with him such an emulation as this takes place in every neighborhood in every family among artisans husbandmen laborers as much as between dukes and marquises and more—these are all nearly equal in dress and are now distinguished by other marks declamations oratory poetry sermons against luxury riches and commerce will never have much effect the most rigorous sumptuary laws will have little more discordia et avaritia atque ambitio et cetera secundis rebus oriri sueta mala post carthaginis excidium maxumè aucta sunt ex quo tempore majorum mores non paulatim ut antea sed torrentis modo præcipitati    in the late war the americans found an unusual quantity of money flow in upon them and without the least degree of prudence foresight consideration or measure rushed headlong into a greater degree of luxury than ought to have crept in for a hundred years the romans charged the ruin of their commonwealth to luxury they might have charged it to the want of a balance in their constitution in a country like america where the means and opportunities for luxury are so easy and so plenty it would be madness not to expect it be prepared for it and provide against the dangers of it in the constitution the balance in a tripleheaded legislature is the best and the only remedy if we will not adopt that we must suffer the punishment of our temerity the supereminence of a threefold balance above all the imperfect balances that were attempted in the ancient republics of greece and italy and the modern ones of switzerland and holland whether aristocratical or mixed lies in this that as it is capable of governing a great nation and large territory whereas the others can only exist in small ones so it is capable of preserving liberty among great degrees of wealth luxury dissipation and even profligacy of manners whereas the others require the utmost frugality simplicity and moderation to make human life tolerable under them where luxury takes place there is a natural tendency to tyranny there is a natural tendency to tyranny every where in the simplest manners as well as the most luxurious which nothing but force can stop and why should this tendency be taken from human nature where it grows as in its native soil and attributed to luxury the nature of luxury lies altogether in excess it is a universal deprivation of manners without reason without moderation it is the canine appetite of a corrupt will and phantasy which nothing can satisfy but in every action in every imagination it flies beyond the bounds of honesty just and good into all extremity this is declamation and rant that it is not easy to comprehend there are all possible degrees of luxury which appear in society with every degree of virtue from the first dawnings of civilization to the last stage of improvement and refinement and civility humanity and benevolence increase commonly as fast as    ambition of conquest the pride of war cruelty and bloody rage diminish luxury to certain degrees of excess is an evil but it is not at all times and in all circumstances an absolute evil it should be restrained by morality and by law by prohibitions and discouragements but the evil does not lie here only it lies in human nature and that must be restrained by a mixed form of government which is the best in the world to manage luxury our authors government would never make or if it made it never would execute laws to restrain luxury that form of government says our author must needs be the most excellent and the peoples liberty most secured where governors are least exposed to the baits and snares of luxury that is to say that form of government is the best and the peoples liberty most secure where the people are poorest this will never recommend a government to mankind but what has poverty or riches to do with the form of government if mankind must be voluntarily poor in order to be free it is too late in the age of the world to preach liberty whatever nedham might think mankind in general had rather be rich under a simple monarchy than poor under a democracy but if that is the best form of government where governors are least exposed to the baits and snares of luxury the government our author contends for is the worst of all possible forms there is there can be no form in which the governors are so much exposed to the baits and snares of luxury as in a simple democracy in proportion as a government is democratical in a degree beyond a proportional prevalence of monarchy and aristocracy the wealth means and opportunities being the same does luxury prevail its progress is instantaneous there can be no subordination one citizen cannot bear that another should live better than himself a universal emulation in luxury instantly commences and the governors that is those who aspire at elections are obliged to take the lead in this silly contention they must not be behind the foremost in dress equipage furniture entertainments games races spectacles they must feast and gratify the luxury of electors to obtain their votes and the whole executive authority must be prostituted and the legislative too to encourage luxury the athenians made it death for any one to propose the appropriation of money devoted to the support of the theatre to any the most necessary purposes of the state in    monarchies and aristocracies much may be done both by precept and example by laws and manners to diminish luxury and restrain its growth in a mixed government more still may be done for this salutary end but in a simple democracy nothing every man will do as he pleases no sumptuary law will be obeyed every prohibition or impost will be eluded no man will dare to propose a law by which the pleasures or the liberty of the citizen shall be restrained a more unfortunate argument for a simple democracy could not have been thought of it is however a very good one in favor of a mixed government our author is nowhere so weak as in this reason or under this head he attempts to prove his point by reason and examples but is equally unfortunate in both first by reason the people says he must needs be less luxurious than kings or the great ones because they are bounded within a more lowly pitch of desire and imagination give them but panem et circenses bread sport and ease and they are abundantly satisfied it is to be feared that this is too good a character for any people living or that have lived the disposition to luxury is the same though the habit is not both in plebeians patricians and kings when we say their desires are bounded we admit the desires to exist imagination is as quick in one as in the other it is demanding a great deal to demand bread and sports and ease no one can tell how far these terms may extend if by bread is meant a subsistence a maintenance in food and clothing it will mount up very high if by sports be meant cockfighting horseracing theatrical representations and all the species of cards dice and gambling no mortal philosopher can fathom the depth of this article and if with bread and sport they are to have ease too and by ease be meant idleness an exemption from care and labor all three together will amount to as much as ever was demanded for nobles or kings and more than ought ever to be granted to either but let us grant all this for a moment we should be disappointed the promised abundant satisfaction would not be found the bread must soon be of the finest wheat poultry and gibier must be added to beef and mutton the entertainments would not be elegant enough after a time more expense must be added in short contentment is not in human nature there is no passion appetite or affection for contentment to amuse    and flatter the people with compliments of qualities that never existed in them is not the duty nor the right of a philosopher or legislator he must form a true idea and judgment of mankind and adapt his institutions to facts not compliments the people have less means and opportunities for luxury than those pompous standing powers whether in the hands of one or many but if the sovereignty were exercised wholly by one popular assembly they would then have the means and opportunities in their hands as much as the king has in a monarchy or the senate in an aristocracy or oligarchy and much more than either king or nobles have in the tripartite composition we contend for because in this the king and nobles have really no means or opportunities of luxury but what are freely given them by the people whose representatives hold the purse accordingly in the simple democracy or representative democracy which our author contends for it would be found that the great leaders in the assembly would soon be as luxurious as ever kings or hereditary nobles were and they would make partisans by admitting associates in a luxury which they would support at the expense of the minority and every particle of the executive power would be prostituted new lucrative offices daily created and larger appointments annexed to support it nay the power of judging would be prostituted to determine causes in favor of friends and against enemies and the plunder devoted to the luxury the people would be found as much inclined to vice and vanity as kings or grandees and would run on to still greater excess and riot for kings and nobles are always restrained in some degree by fear of the people and their censures whereas the people themselves in the case we put are not restrained by fear or shame having all honor and applause at their disposal as well as force it does not appear then that they are less luxurious on the contrary they are more luxurious and necessarily become so in a simple democracy our author triumphantly concludes it is clear the people that is their successive representatives all authority in one centre and that centre the nation must be the best governors because the current of succession keeps them the less corrupt and presumptuous he must have forgot that these successive representatives  00 have all the executive power and will use it at once for the express purpose of corruption among their constituents to obtain votes at the next election every commission will be given and new offices created and fresh fees salaries perquisites and emoluments added on purpose to corrupt more voters he must have forgot that the judicial power is in the hands of these representatives by his own suppositions and that false accusations of crimes will be sustained to ruin enemies disputes in civil causes will be decided in favor of friends in short the whole criminal law and the whole civil law concerning lands houses goods and money will be made subservient to the covetousness pride ambition and ostentation of the dominant party and their chiefs the current of succession instead of keeping them less corrupt and presumptuous is the very thing that annually makes them more corrupt and shameless instead of being more free from luxurious courses they are more irresistibly drawn into them instead of being free from oppressive and injurious practices their parties at elections will force them into them and all these things they must do to hold up the port and splendor of their tyranny and if any of them hesitate at any imprudence that his party demands he alone will be rejected and another found whose conscience and whose shame are sufficiently subdued unfortunate in his arguments from reason to show that the people qualified with the supreme authority are less devoted to luxury than the grandee or kingly powers our author is still more unhappy in those drawn from example the first example is athens while athens remained free in the peoples hands it was adorned with such governors as gave themselves up to a serious abstemious and severe course of life sobriety abstinence and severity were never remarkable characteristics of democracy or the democratical branch or mixture in any constitution they have oftener been the attributes of aristocracy and oligarchy athens in particular was never conspicuous for these qualities but on the contrary from the first to the last moment of her democratical constitution levity gayety inconstancy dissipation intemperance debauchery and a dissolution of manners were the prevailing character of the whole nation at what period will it be pretended that they were adorned with  0  these serious abstemious and severe governors and what were their names was pisistratus so serious when he drove his chariot into the agora wounded by himself and duped the people to give him his guard or when he dressed the girl like minerva was hipparchus or hippias cleisthenes or isagoras so abstemious was there so much abstinence and severity of public virtue in applying first to sparta and then to persia against their country as the leaders alternately did miltiades indeed was serious abstemious and severe but xanthippus who was more popular and who conducted a capital accusation against him and got him fined fifty talents was not themistocles was he the severe character a great statesman and soldier to be sure but very ambitious and not very honest pericles sacrificed all things to his ambition cleon and alcibiades were the very reverse of sobriety moderation and modesty miltiades aristides socrates and phocion are all the characters in the athenian story who had this kind of merit and to show how little the athenians themselves deserved this praise or esteemed it in others the first was condemned by the people in an immense fine the second to banishment and the third and fourth to death aristides had themistocles a more popular man constantly to oppose him he was indeed made financier of all greece but what other arbitration had athens and aristides himself though a professed imitator of lycurgus and a favorer of aristocracy was obliged to overturn the constitution by giving way to the furious ambition of the people and by letting every citizen into the competition for the archonship being at the height they began to decline that is almost in the instant when they had expelled the pisistratidæ and acquired a democratical ascendency though checked by the areopagus and many other institutions of solon they declined the good conduct of the democracy began and ended with aristides  0  permitting some men to greaten themselves by continuing long in power and authority they soon lost their pure principles of severity and liberty in truth nobody yet had such principles but miltiades and aristides as soon as the people got unlimited power they did as the people always do give it to their flatterers like themistocles and continued it in him to what purpose is it to talk of the rules of a free state when you are sure those rules will be violated the people unbalanced never will observe them the thirty were appointed by lysander after the conquest of athens by sparta yet it was not the continuance but the illimitation of their power that corrupted them these indeed behaved like all other unchecked assemblies the majority destroyed theramenes and the few virtuous members who happened to be among them and were a reproach to them and then ruled with a rod of iron nothing was heard of but murders and imprisonments riches were a crime that never failed to be punished with confiscation and death more people were put to death in eight months of peace than had been slain by the enemy in a war of thirty years in short every body of men every unchecked assembly in athens had invariably behaved in this manner the four hundred formerly chosen now the thirty and afterwards the ten such universal tenacious and uniform conspiracies against liberty justice and the public good such a neverfailing passion for tyranny possessing republicans born in the air of liberty nurtured in her bosom accustomed to that equality on which it is founded and principled by their education from their earliest infancy in an abhorrence of all servitude have astonished the generality of historians there must be in power say they some violent impulse to actuate so many persons in this manner who had no doubt sentiments of virtue and honor and make them forget all laws of nature and religion but there is really no room for all this surprise it is the form of government that naturally and necessarily produces the effect the astonishment really is and ought only to be that there is one sensible man left in the world who can still entertain an esteem or any other sentiment than abhorrence for a government in a single assembly such also was the condition of athens when pisistratus usurped the tyranny but who was it that continued the power  0  of pisistratus and his sons the people and if this example shows like all others that the people are always disposed to continue and increase the power of their favorites against all maxims and rules of freedom this also is an argument for placing balances in the constitution even against the power of the people from athens our author comes to rome under tarquin it was dissolved in debauchery upon the change of government their manners were somewhat mended this difference does not appear on the contrary the roman manners were under the kings as pure as under the aristocracy that followed the senate being a standing power soon grew corrupt and first let in luxury then tyranny till the people being interested in the government established a good discipline and freedom both together which was upheld with all severity till the ten grandees came in play when an author writes from imagination only he may say what he pleases but it would be trifling to adduce proofs in detail of what every one knows the whole history of rome shows that corruption began with the people sooner than in the senate that it increased faster that it produced the characters he calls grandees—as the gracchi marius sylla and cæsar and that the senate was for centuries the check that preserved any degree of virtue moderation or modesty our authors conclusion is that grandee and kingly powers are ever more luxurious than the popular are or can be that luxury ever brings on tyranny as the bane of liberty and therefore that the rights of the people in a due and orderly succession of their supreme assemblies are more secure in their own hands than any others but if the fact is otherwise and the people are equally luxurious in a simple democracy as in a simple aristocracy or monarchy but more especially if it be true as it undoubtedly is that they are more so then the contrary conclusion will follow that their rights are more secure when their own power is tempered by a separate executive and an aristocratical senate the truth relating to this subject is very obvious and lies in a narrow compass the disposition to luxury is so strong in all men and in all nations that it can be restrained where it  0  has the means of gratification only by education discipline or law education and discipline soon lose their force when unsupported by law simple democracies therefore have occasion for the strictest laws to preserve the force of education discipline and severity of manners this is the reason why examples of the most rigorous the most tyrannical sumptuary laws are found in governments the most popular but such sumptuary laws are found always ineffectual they are always hated by the people and violated continually and those who approve them neither dare repeal them nor attempt to carry them into execution in a simple aristocracy the disposition to luxury shows itself in the utmost extravagance as in poland but it is confined to the gentlemen the common people are forbidden it and such sumptuary laws are executed severely enough in simple monarchies sumptuary laws are made under the guise of prohibitions or imposts and luxury is generally no otherwise restrained than by the ability to gratify it but as the difference of ranks is established by laws and customs universally known there is no temptation for people in the lower ranks to imitate the splendor of those in the higher but in the mixed government we contend for the distinction of ranks is also generally known or ought to be it has therefore all the advantage against general luxury which arises from subordination and it has the further advantage of being able to execute prudent and reasonable sumptuary laws whenever the circumstances of affairs require them it is therefore safe to affirm that luxury is less dangerous in such a mixed government than any other has less tendency to prevail and is much more easily restrained to such persons and objects as will be least detrimental to the public good the tenth reason is because under this government the people are ever endued with a more magnanimous active and noble temper of spirit than under the grandeur of any standing power and this arises from that apprehension which every particular man hath of his own immediate share in the public interest as well as of that security which he possesses in the enjoyment of his private fortune free from the reach of any arbitrary power this is a good argument in favor of a government in which the people have an essential part of the sovereign power but  0  none at all for one in which they exercise the whole when they have a part balanced by a senate and a distinct executive power it is true they have more magnanimity activity and spirit they have a regard to their own immediate share in the public interest they have an apprehension of that security they possess in the enjoyment of their private fortunes free from the reach of any arbitrary power whenever success betides the public and the commonwealth conquers thrives in dominion wealth or honor the citizen reckons all his own if he sees honors offices rewards distributed to valiant virtuous or learned men he esteems them his own as long as the door is left open to succeed in the same dignities and enjoyments if he can attain to the same measure of desert men aspire to great actions when rewards depend on merit and merit is more certain of reward in a mixed government than in any simple one rewards depend on the will and pleasure of particular persons in standing powers of monarchy or aristocracy but they depend equally on the will and pleasure of the principes populi the reigning demagogues in simple democracies and for obvious reasons are oftener distributed in an arbitrary manner in a mixed government the ministers of the executive power are always responsible and gross corruption in the distribution of offices is always subject to inquiry and to punishment but in simple governments the reigning characters are accountable to nobody in a simple democracy each leader thinks himself accountable only to his party and obliged to bestow honors rewards and offices not upon merit and for the good of the whole state but merely to increase his votes and partisans in future elections but it is by no means just politic or true to say that offices c are always conferred in free states meaning single assemblies according to merit without any consideration of birth or fortune birth and fortune are as much considered in simple democracies as in monarchies and ought to be considered in some degree in all states merit it is true ought to be preferred to both but merit being equal birth will generally determine the question in all popular governments and fortune which is a worse criterion oftener still but what apprehension of their share in the public interest or of their security in the enjoyment of their private fortune can the minor party have in a simple democracy when they  0  see that successes conquests wealth and honor only tend to increase the power of their antagonists and to lessen their own when all honors offices and rewards are bestowed to lessen their importance and increase that of their opponents when every door is shut against them to succeed to dignities and enjoyments be their merit what it will when they see that neither birth fortune nor merit can avail them and that their adversaries whom they will call their enemies succeed continually without either birth fortune or merit this is surely the course in a simple democracy even more than in a simple aristocracy or monarchy abilities no doubt will be sought and purchased into the service of fortune and family in the predominant party but left to perish in opposition a mixed government is the only one where merit can be expected to have fair play there it has three resources one in each branch of the legislature and a fourth in the courts of justice whereas in all simple governments it has but one our author proceeds again to roman history and repeats examples he had used before with equal ill success the examples prove the contrary of what he cites them to prove the romans under their kings remained inconsiderable in reputation and could never enlarge the dominion very far beyond the walls of their city afterwards under the standing power of the senate they began to thrive a little better and for a little time but when the people began to know claim and possess their liberties in being governed by a succession of their supreme officers and assemblies then it was and never till then that they laid the foundation and built the structure of that wondrous empire that overshadowed the whole world in support of all this no doubt will be cited the splendid authority of sallust nam regibus boni quam mali suspectiores sunt semperque his aliena virtus formidolosa est sed civitas incredibile memoratu est adepta libertate quantum brevi creverit tanta cupido gloriæ incesserat jam primum juventus simul laboris ac belli patiens erat in castris per usum militiam discebat magisque in decoris armis et militaribus equis quam in scortis atque conviviis lubidinem habebat the condition and happiness of rome under their kings till the time of tarquin have been before related it has been shown that the introduction of laws and formation of the manners of a barbarous rabble assembled from all nations  0  engaged the attention both of the kings and the senate during this period their wars have been enumerated and it has been shown that the nation was not in a condition to struggle with hostile neighbors nor to contend among themselves it has been shown that in proportion as they became easy and safe the nobles began to envy the kings and to form continual conspiracies against their authority thrones and lives until it became a question only whether monarchy or aristocracy should be abolished in this manner kings were necessitated either to give up all their authority into the hands of a haughty and aspiring senate or assert a more decisive and arbitrary power than the constitution allowed them in the contest the nobles prevailed and in the wars with tarquin and his successors and their allies soldiers and officers were formed who became capable and desirous of conquest and glory sallust himself confesses this in the former chapter post ubi regium imperium quod initio conservandæ libertatis atque augendæ reipublicæ fuerat in superbiam dominationemque convertit immutato more annua imperia binosque imperatores sibi fecere in addition to this it should be remembered that sallust was an aristocratical historian and attached to the sovereignty in the senate or at least desirous of appearing so in his history and an enemy to the government of a single person of which the republic was at that time in the near prospect and the utmost danger the question in the mind of this writer was not between an aristocracy and a mixed sovereignty but between aristocracy and simple monarchy or the empire of one yet all that can be inferred from the fact as stated by our author and by sallust is that aristocracy at first is better calculated for conquest than simple monarchy it by no means follows that aristocracy is more friendly to liberty or commerce the two blessings now most esteemed by mankind than even simple monarchy but the most exceptionable sentiment of all is this—when the people began to possess their liberties in being governed by a succession of their supreme officers and assemblies then they laid the foundation of empire and built the structure by this one would think that the romans were governed by a single representative assembly periodically chosen which is our authors idea of a perfect commonwealth whereas nothing can be further from the truth there is scarcely any  0  constitution farther removed from a simple democracy or a representative democracy than the roman as has been before observed from romulus to cæsar aristocracy was the predominant feature of the sovereignty the mixture of monarchical power in the kings and consuls and the mixture of democratical power in the tribunes and popular assemblies though unequal to the aristocratical ingredient were checks to it and strong stimulants to exertions though not complete balances but the periods of greatest liberty virtue glory and prosperity were those in which the mixture of all three was nearest equality our authors argument and example are clear and strong in favor of the triple combination and decisive against the democracy he contends for in those days the world abounded with free states more than any other form as all over italy gallia spain and africa it may be questioned whether there was then in the world one free state according to our authors definition of it all that were called free states in those days were either aristocracies oligarchies or mixtures of monarchy and aristocracy of aristocracy and democracy or of monarchy aristocracy and democracy but not one do we read of which was governed by a democracy simple or by representation the achaian league and others like it were confederated cities each city being independent and itself a mixed government carthage is the next example and an excellent one it is to prove that a mixed government in which the people have a share gives them magnanimity courage and activity but it proves nothing to our authors purpose the suffetes the senate and the people the monarchical aristocratical and democratical powers nicely balanced as aristotle says were the constitution of carthage and secured its liberty and prosperity but when the balance was weakened and began to incline to a dominatio plebis the precise form of government our author contends for they hastened to ruin the next example quoted by our author is the swiss another example which proves nothing for him and much against him all the cantons of any extent numbers or wealth are aristocratical or mixed the little spots that are called democratical are more or less mixtures the hollanders his last example had no democratical mixture in their constitution are entirely aristocratical and preserved from tyranny  0  and destruction partly by a stadtholder partly by the people in mobs but more especially by the number of independent cities and sovereignties associated together and the great multitude of persons concerned in the government and composing the sovereignty four or five thousand and finally by the unanimity that is required in all transactions thus every one of these examples ancient and modern is a clear demonstration against our authors system instead of being an argument for it there is not even a color in his favor in the democratical cantons of switzerland narrow spots or barren mountains where the people live on milk nor in st marino or ragusa no precedents surely for england or american states where the people are numerous and rich the territory capacious and commerce extensive freedom produces magnanimity and courage but there is no freedom nor justice in a simple democracy for any but the majority the ruling party no doubt will be active and bold but the ruled will be discouraged browbeaten and insulted without a possibility of redress but by civil war it is a mixed government then well balanced that makes all the nation of a noble temper our author confesses we feel a loss of courage and magnanimity follow the loss of freedom and it is very true this loss is nowhere so keenly felt as when we are enslaved by those whom the constitution makes our equals this is the case of the minority always in a simple democracy the eleventh reason is because no determinations being carried but by consent of the people therefore they must needs remain secure out of the reach of tyranny and free from the arbitrary disposition of any commanding power no determinations are carried it is true in a simple or representative democracy but by consent of the majority of the people or their representatives if our author had required unanimity in every vote resolve and law in that case no determination could be carried but by consent of the people but no good government was ever yet founded upon the principle of unanimity and it need not be attempted to be proved that none such ever can exist if the majority then must govern and consequently often near half and almost always a party must be governed against their consent it is the majority only who will remain secure out of the reach of tyranny and free from the   0 arbitrary disposition of any commanding power the minority on the contrary will be constantly within the reach of tyranny and under the arbitrary disposition of the commanding power of the majority nor do the minority under such a government know what laws they are to obey or what penalties they are to undergo in case of transgression nor have they any share or interest in making of laws with the penalties annexed nor do they become the more inexcusable if they offend nor ought they the more willingly to submit to punishment when they suffer for any offence for the minority have no laws but what the majority please to give any more than when government is managed in the hands of a particular person or continued in the hands of a certain number of great men nor do the minority know how to walk by those laws of the majority or how to understand them because the sense is oftentimes left at uncertainty and it will be reckoned a great mystery of state in such a form of government that no laws shall be of any sense or force but as the great ones among the majority please to expound them so as the people of the minority will be left as it were without law because they bear no other construction and meaning but what suits with the interests and fancies of particular men in the majority not with right reason or the public liberty to be convinced of this we should recollect that the majority have the appointment of the judges who will be generally the great leaders in the house or their friends and partisans and even great exertions will be made to pack juries but without packing the probability is that a majority at least of the juries will be of the ruling party in the nation and its sovereign assembly we may go farther and say that as the passions and interests of the majority have no check they will frequently make ex post facto laws laws with a retrospect to take in cases which at the time were not foreseen for the mortification of the minority and the support and encouragement of their adversaries the judges will not be less reputed the oracles of the law under such a government than under kings or standing senates and the power of creating judges will not indeed be usurped but will be legally and constitutionally in the hands of the majority or rather of their leader or leaders who will ever have a care to create such as will make the law speak in favor of     them upon any occasion these principes populi may say with as much arrogance and as much truth as it was ever said by charles or james as long as we have the power of making what judges and bishops we please we are sure to have no law nor gospel but what shall please us the example of henry vii and henry viii those of james and charles are no doubt pertinent to prove that the usurpation of a prerogative of expounding the laws after their own pleasure made them rather snares than instruments of relief like a grand catchpole to pill poll and geld the purses of the people to deprive many gallant men of their lives and fortunes but if we had the history of any simple democracy or democracy by simple representation such as our author contends for we should find that such a prerogative was usurped by the majority and their chiefs and applied to as bad purposes but the truth is no such government that we know of ever existed the universal sense of mankind has deemed it so destructive or impracticable that no nation has ventured on it the italian republics of the middle age approach the nearest to it their history is an answer but if we consider those passions in human nature which cause despots oligarchies and standing senates to make such an abuse of power we must see that the same passions will ever exist in the majority and their leaders in a democracy and produce the same fatal effects it is really astonishing that the institution of lycurgus should be adduced as a precedent in favor of our authors project of the right constitution of a commonwealth there is scarcely a form of government in the world more essentially different from it in all its parts it is very true that the provision made by that legislator for an equality of laws rights duties and burdens among all the citizens however imperfect it was however inferior to the provision in the english and american constitutions was the principal commendation of his plan but instead of giving all power to the people or their representatives he gave the real sovereignty to his standing senate our author himself is so sensible of this that he allows the lacedæmonian commonwealth to be cut out after the grandee fashion confirming the supremacy within the walls of the senate the senate was in some measure restrained by laws walking in the same even pace of subjection with the people having very few offices of     dignity or profit allowed which might make them swell with state and ambition but were prescribed also the same rules of frugality plainness and moderation as were the common people by which means immoderate lusts and desires being prevented in the great ones they were the less inclined to pride and oppression and no great profit or pleasure being to be gotten by authority very few desired it and such as were in it sat free from envy by which means they avoided that odium and emulation which uses to rage betwixt the great ones and the people in that form of government but how was this done by collecting all authority into one centre no but by prohibiting travel and communication with strangers which no people on earth are now barbarous and stupid enough to bear by prohibiting commerce which no people who have sense and feeling will now renounce and by prohibiting money which all people now desire and which makes the essential instrument for guiding the world but all this would not have succeeded if his constitution had been only one popular assembly this was effected by reciprocal checks and a real balance approaching nearly to an absolute control of the senate by a marriage between the king and people the king so far from being a cipher had great authority he was the standing and hereditary head of the commonwealth and this alone must give him a dominion over the hearts and understandings both of senate and people that must have amounted to a great authority our author is generally so sensible of the influence gained over high and low by standing authority that it is wonderful he should forget it in this case he was besides always commanderinchief of the armies and generally led in person and this in all governments gives a general an influence bordering on royal supremacy but besides there were two assemblies of the people one for the city and one for the country and those popular representatives the ephori but the indissoluble bond that united the king and people for ever was the oath taken by the kings and ephori every month the former never to violate the privileges of the people and the latter forever to be loyal to the kings the descendants of hercules this was not equivalent to an absolute negative in the king and the people both upon the laws of the senate but it amounted to one complete negative upon the senate because     the kings and people were both sworn to oppose all encroachments of the senate and if these had made unequal laws and scrambled for more power the people would have instantly taken arms under the command of their ephori and their kings against the senate this balance this mixture was the real cause of that equality which was preserved in sparta but if all authority had been in the popular assemblies without kings or senate the right constitution of a commonwealth which our author is an advocate for that equality could not have existed twenty years a majority would necessarily have risen up to carry all before them and to depress the minority more and more until the first man among the majority would have been king his principal supporters nobles and the rest not only plebeians but slaves the question between us and our author is not whether the people shall be excluded from all interest in government or not in this point we are perfectly agreed namely—that there can be no constitutional liberty no free state no right constitution of a commonwealth where the people are excluded from the government where indeed the people have not an independent equal share with the two other orders of the state and an absolute control over all laws and grants of money we agree therefore in his next example the commonwealth of venice where the people being excluded from all interest in government the power of making and executing of laws and bearing offices with all other immunities lies only in the hands of a standing senate and their kindred which they call the patrician or noble order their duke is indeed restrained but far from being made just such another officer as were the lacedæmonian kings he is reduced in dignity and authority much below them differing from the rest of the senate only in a corner of his cap besides a little outward ceremony and splendor the senators themselves have indeed liberty at random arbitrarily to ramble and do what they please with the people who excepting the city itself are so extremely oppressed in all their territories living by no law but the arbitrary dictates of the senate that it seems rather a junta than a commonwealth and the subjects take so little content in it that seeing more to be enjoyed under the turk they that are his borderers take all opportunities to revolt and submit rather to the mercy of a     pagan tyranny which disposition if you consider together with the little courage in their subjects by reason they press them so hard and how that they are forced for this cause to rely upon foreign mercenaries in all warlike expeditions you might wonder how this state hath held up so long but that we know the interest of christendom being concerned in her security she hath been chiefly supported by the supplies and arms of others all this is readily allowed we concur also most sincerely in our authors conclusion in part namely—that since kings and all standing powers are so inclinable to act according to their own wills and interests in making expounding and executing of laws to the prejudice of the peoples liberty and security no laws whatsoever should be made but by the peoples consent as the only means to prevent arbitrariness but we must carry the conclusion farther namely—that since all men are so inclinable to act according to their own wills and interests in making expounding and executing laws to the prejudice of the peoples liberty and security the sovereign authority the legislative executive and judicial power can never be safely lodged in one assembly though chosen annually by the people because the majority and their leaders the principes populi will as certainly oppress the minority and make expound and execute laws for their own wealth power grandeur and glory to the prejudice of the liberty and security of the minority as hereditary kings or standing senates the conclusion therefore that the people in a succession of their supreme single assemblies are the best keepers of their liberties must be wholly reprobated the twelfth reason is because this form is most suitable to the nature and reason of mankind if socrates and plato cicero and seneca hutcheson and butler are to be credited reason is rightfully supreme in man and therefore it would be most suitable to the reason of mankind to have no civil or political government at all the moral government of god and his vicegerent conscience ought to be sufficient to restrain men to obedience to justice and benevolence at all times and in all places we must therefore descend from the dignity of our nature when we think of civil government at all but the nature of mankind is one thing and the reason of mankind another and the first has the same relation     to the last as the whole to a part the passions and appetites are parts of human nature as well as reason and the moral sense in the institution of government it must be remembered that although reason ought always to govern individuals it certainly never did since the fall and never will till the millennium and human nature must be taken as it is as it has been and will be if as cicero says man is a noble creature born with affections to rule rather than obey there being in every man a natural desire of principality it is yet certain that every man ought to obey as well as to rule ἄϱχειν ϰαι ἄϱχεσθαι and that every man cannot rule alone each man must be content with his share of empire and if the nature and reason of mankind the nobleness of his qualities and affections and his natural desires prove his right to a share in the government they cannot surely prove more than the constitutions of the united states have allowed—an annual election of the whole legislative and executive the governor senate and house if we admit them to prove more they would prove that every man has every year a right to be governor senator and representative which being impossible is absurd even in our authors right constitution every man would have an equal right to be representative chosen or not the reason why one man is content to submit to the government of another as assigned by our author namely—not because he conceives himself to have less right than another to govern but either because he finds himself less able or else because he judgeth it will be more convenient for himself and the community if he submits to anothers government is a proof of this because the moment it is allowed that some are more able than others and that the community are judges who the most able are you take away the right to rule derived from the nobleness of each mans individual nature from his affections to rule rather than obey or from his natural appetite or desire of principality and give the right of conferring the power to rule to the community as a share in the appointment of deputies is all that our author can with any color infer from this noble nature of man his nature will be gratified and his dignity supported as well if you divide his deputies into three orders—of governor for the executive and an integral share in the legislative of senators for another independent part of the legislative and     of representatives for a third—and if you introduce a judicious balance between them as if you huddle them into one assembly where they will soon disgrace their own nature and that of their constituents by ambition avarice jealousy envy faction division sedition and rebellion nay if it should be found that annual elections of governors and senators cannot be supported without introducing venality and convulsions as is very possible the people will consult the dignity of their nature better by appointing a standing executive and senate than by insisting on elections or at least by prolonging the duration of those high trusts and making elections less frequent it is indeed a most excellent maxim that the original and fountain of all just power and government is in the people and if ever this maxim was fully demonstrated and exemplified among men it was in the late american revolution where thirteen governments were taken down from the foundation and new ones elected wholly by the people as an architect would pull down an old building and erect a new one there will be no dispute then with cicero when he says a mind well instructed by the light of nature will pay obedience willingly to none but such as command direct or govern for its good or benefit nor will our authors inferences from these passages from that oracle of human wisdom be denied   that by the light of nature people are taught to be their own carvers and contrivers in the framing of that government under which they mean to live   that none are to preside in government or sit at the helm but such as shall be judged fit and chosen by the people   that the people are the only proper judges of the convenience or inconvenience of a government when it is erected and of the behavior of governors after they are chosen but then it is insisted that rational and regular means shall be used that the whole people may be their own carvers that they may judge and choose who shall preside and that they may determine on the convenience or inconvenience of government and the behavior of governors but then it is insisted that the town of berwick upon tweed shall not carve judge choose and determine for the whole kingdom of great britain nor the county of berkshire for the massachusetts much less that a lawless tyrannical rabble shall do all this for the state or even for the county of berkshire     it may be and is admitted that a free government is most natural and only suitable to the reason of mankind but it by no means follows that the other forms as of a standing power in the hands of a particular person as a king or of a set number of great ones as in a senate much less that a mixture of the three simple forms are beside the dictates of nature and mere artificial devices of great men squared out only to serve the ends and interests of avarice pride and ambition of a few to a vassalizing of the community if the original and fountain of all power and government is in the people as undoubtedly it is the people have as clear a right to erect a simple monarchy aristocracy or democracy or an equal mixture or any other mixture of all three if they judge it for their liberty happiness and prosperity as they have to erect a democracy and infinitely greater and better men than marchamont nedham and the wisest nations that ever lived have preferred such mixtures and even with such standing powers as ingredients in their compositions but even those nations who choose to reserve in their own hands the periodical choice of the first magistrate senate and assembly at certain stated periods have as clear a right to appoint a first magistrate for life as for years and for perpetuity in his descendants as for life when i say for perpetuity or for life it is always meant to imply that the same people have at all times a right to interpose and to depose for maladministration—to appoint anew no appointment of a king or senate or any standing power can be in the nature of things for a longer period than quam diu se bene gesserit the whole nation being judge an appointment for life or perpetuity can be no more than an appointment until further order but further order can only be given by the nation and until the nation shall have given the order an estate for life or in fee is held in the office it must be a great occasion which can induce a nation to take such a subject into consideration and make a change until a change is made an hereditary limited monarch is the representative of the whole nation for the management of the executive power as much as a house of representatives is as one branch of the legislature and as guardian of the public purse and a house of lords too or a standing senate represents the nation for other purposes namely as a watch set upon both the representative and the executive     power the people are the fountain and original of the power of kings and lords governors and senates as well as the house of commons or assembly of representatives and if the people are sufficiently enlightened to see all the dangers that surround them they will always be represented by a distinct personage to manage the whole executive power a distinct senate to be guardians of property against levellers for the purposes of plunder to be a repository of the national tradition of public maxims customs and manners and to be controllers in turn both of kings and their ministers on one side and the representatives of the people on the other when either discover a disposition to do wrong and a distinct house of representatives to be the guardians of the public purse and to protect the people in their turn against both kings and nobles a science certainly comprehends all the principles in nature which belong to the subject the principles in nature which relate to government cannot all be known without a knowledge of the history of mankind the english constitution is the only one which has considered and provided for all cases that are known to have generally indeed to have always happened in the progress of every nation it is therefore the only scientifical government to say then that standing powers have been erected as mere artificial devices of great men to serve the ends of avarice pride and ambition of a few to the vassalizing of the community is to declaim and abuse standing powers have been instituted to avoid greater evils—corruption sedition war and bloodshed in elections it is the peoples business therefore to find out some method of avoiding them without standing powers the americans flatter themselves they have hit upon it and no doubt they have for a time perhaps a long one but this remains to be proved by experience our author proceeds a consent and free election of the people which is the most natural way and form of governing hath no real effect in the other forms but is either supplanted by craft and custom or swallowed up by a pernicious pretence of right in one or many to govern only by virtue of a hereditary succession if the people are so unenlightened and so corrupt that they cannot manage one third part of a legislature and their own purses by their representatives how much worse would it be if     they had the whole and all the executive and judicial powers to manage but the assertion is not true the consent and free election of the people have a great and decided effect in the english constitution and would have had much more if it had been more equal but if the present inequalities cannot be altered nor a vote obtained to alter them in the house of commons nor any general application of the people to have them altered what would be the effect of the whole executive and judicial powers were they in the hands of the house the leading members would employ both these resources not only to prevent the representation from being rendered more equal but to make it still more unequal our author alluding to the times of charles and james had some color for representing the power of the commons as of little effect but he saw that an attempt or suspicion of one to grasp all power into the hands of the crown had proved the destruction both of king and lords this surely was a real and great effect if nations will entangle their constitutions with spiritual lords and elective lords and with decayed boroughs how can it be avoided but would not the nation send bishops and elective lords into a single house as their deputies and would not the utmost artifices of bigotry superstition and enthusiasm be set at work among the people as well as bribery and corruption at elections if the people cannot be sufficiently enlightened by education and the press to despise and resent as insults and impositions on human nature all pretences of right drawn from uninterrupted successions or divine missions they will be duped by them in one assembly more than in three our author has no right to call his project the peoples form any more than montesquieu blackstone and de lolme have to call their admired system by that endearing appellation both are the peoples form if the people adopt choose and prefer them and neither is if they do not the people have liberty to make use of that reason and understanding god hath given them in choosing governors and providing for their safety in government where they annually choose all nay they have it even where the king and senate are hereditary so long as they have the choice of an essential branch no law can be made no money raised not one step can be taken without their concurrence   0 nay there is no one act can be done by the ministers of the executive but the people by their representatives can inquire into and prosecute to judgment and to punishment if it is wrong our author will not consider the case of a mixed government all governments must be simple with him the people must exercise all power or none he had his reasons for this artifice at that time which do not exist at this his reasons however were not sufficient and if the nation had been dealt with more candidly openly and boldly by him and milton and others a better settlement might have been obtained but it is plain that milton nedham and even harrington wrote in shackles but had nedham and milton understood the science of government as well as harrington charles had never been restored our author instead of considering the project of two assemblies as harrington did flies from the idea and will allow no mixtures in the other forms of a standing power all authority being entailed to certain persons and families in a course of inheritance men are always deprived of the use of their reason about choice of governors in mixed governments even such as sparta athens rome carthage imperfect as those mixtures were our author very well knew that although some authority was entailed all was not in america none at all is entailed or held for more than a term of years their course therefore is not destructive to the reason common interest and majesty of that noble creature called man and has avoided that most irrational and brutish principle fit only to be hissed out of the world which has transformed men into beasts and mortified mankind with misery through all generations this violent declamation however does not remove the danger of venality faction sedition and civil war in the choice of governors and senators principles more brutish and irrational more fit to be hissed out of the world than hereditary kings and senates—evils indeed if you will but the least of the two hereditary senators it is certain have not been the advocates abettors or erectors in general of absolute monarchies no such government ever was or will be erected or supported but against their wills it is the people who wearied and irritated with     the solicitations bribes intrigues and tyranny of the nobles and their eternal squabbles with kings have always set up monarchy and fortified it with an army our author proceeds to search for examples all over the world and fixes first upon monarchy absolute hereditary monarchy but as americans have no thoughts of introducing this form of government it is none of their concern to vindicate the honor of such kings or kingdoms two quarters of the globe asia and africa are governed wholly by despotisms there are in europe near two hundred simple monarchs and in the course of the two last centuries allowing twenty years to each reign two thousand absolute princes if these have been generally of such a character as our author describes what are we to think of the pride and dignity of that rational noble animal man who has submitted so quietly to their tyranny mr hume thinks more favorably of them and he has the judgment of the species in his favor the species not having yet attended to the balance and tried its virtues have almost universally determined monarchy preferable to aristocracies or mixtures of monarchy and aristocracy because they find the people have more liberty under the first than under the two last they may possibly one day try the experiment of mixtures and balances when they do a greater improvement in society will take place than ever yet has happened nations too have tried the experiment of elective monarchies in bohemia poland hungary sweden c instances which our author adduces but after long miseries wars and carnage they have always determined chance to be better than choice and hereditary princes preferable to elective ones these elections it is true have been made by nobles and by very inadequate methods of collecting the votes of the people and when elected there has been no good balance between them and the nobles nor between the nobles and the people the americans have hoped that these circumstances might be arranged so as to justify one more experiment of elective executives as well as senates and representatives they have not adopted our authors idea that if any kingly form be tolerable it must be that which is by election chosen by the peoples     representatives they were well aware that present greatness would give their governors an opportunity to practise such sleights that in a short time the government that they received only for their own lives will become entailed upon their families whereby the peoples election will be made of no effect further than for fashion to mock the poor people and adorn the triumphs of an aspiring tyranny a hereditary first magistrate at once would perhaps be preferable to elections by legislative representatives it is impossible to say until it is fairly tried whether it would not be better than annual elections by the people or whether elections for more years or for life would not be better still our author concludes by a very curious definition of the people to take off all misconstructions when we mention the people observe all along that we do not mean the confused promiscuous body of the people nor any part of the people who have forfeited their rights by delinquency neutrality or apostacy c in relation to the divided state of any nation for they are not to be reckoned within the lists of the people this wise precaution to exclude all royalists prelatists and malignants according to the style of those times was very sagacious and all majorities will ever be equally penetrating in such a right constitution of a commonwealth as our author contends for the minority will seldom be accounted people the thirteenth reason is because in free states there are fewer opportunities of oppression and tyranny than in the other forms this is very true and most cordially admitted but then the question occurs what is a free state in the aristocracy of venice and poland there are opportunities of oppression and tyranny and although our authors right constitution of a commonwealth has never been tried the unanimous determination of all nations having been against it and almost the universal voice of individuals yet the instantaneous effects of it upon human nature are so obvious that it is easy to foresee it would afford more opportunities for tyranny and oppression and would multiply such opportunities more than aristocracy or even monarchy because the leaders of the majority in the     house would be supported and stimulated by their parties continually to tyrannize and oppress the minority the reason given by our author in support of his position is directly against it it is ever the care of free commonwealths to preserve not an equality which were irrational and odious but an equability of condition among all the members equality it seems was not his favorite this would not do in england to be sure any more than america what his distinction is between equality and equability is not known he defines it that no man be permitted to grow overgreat in power but how much is overgreat this is reduced to no standard nor any rank above the ordinary standard what is this excellencies honorables gentlemen yeomen and laborers are really as distinct ranks and confer as different degrees of consideration respect and influence among a people who have no other distinctions as dukes marquises earls and barons in nations that have adopted these titles and the higher are as eagerly coveted by the lower but at last the secret comes out—to assume the state and title of nobility the house of lords had been voted useless and it was our authors system to keep it down without considering that the thing would still exist call it by what name you will preserving the equability secures the peoples liberty from the reach of their own officers in camp or council but no people ever yet were provident enough to preserve either equality or equability their eternal fault is too much gratitude to those who study their humors flatter their passions and become their favorites they never know any bounds in their praises honors or rewards to those who possess their confidence and have excited their enthusiasm the reputation of their idol becomes as complete a tyranny as can be erected among men it is a crime that is not to be borne to speak a word to betray a look in opposition to him nay not to pronounce their most inflamed hyperboles in his praise with as ardent a tone as theirs is envy disaffection ambition down with him the tarpeian rock as soon as manlius dares to think a little higher of his own services and a little lower of camillus than the fashion aristocracies are anxious and eager to prevent any one of the nobility from overtopping the rest monarchies are jealous of any very great near the throne but an unmixed unbalanced people are     never satisfied till they make their idol a tyrant an equal mixture of monarchy aristocracy and democracy is the only free government which has been able to manage the greatest heroes and statesmen the greatest individuals and families or combination of them so as to keep them always obedient to the laws a marlborough a pulteney or a pitt are here harmless beings but in rome a marlborough would have been worse than marius sylla or cæsar in athens worse than themistocles pericles or alcibiades because with all their ambition he had more avarice and less sense not allowing any rank above the common standard secures the people from the pressures and ambition of such petty tyrants as would usurp and claim a prerogative power and greatness above others by birth and inheritance these expressions have all the keenness and bitterness of party rancor and although they were at that time no doubt music to his friends and death to his enemies they are so difficult to avoid in such times that on the one hand candid philosophy will extenuate their ferocity but on the other political wisdom will forever be on its guard against their seductions these that is a nobility are a sort of men not to be endured in any well ordered commonwealth if these words are true no well ordered commonwealth ever existed for we read of none without a nobility no not one that i can recollect without a hereditary nobility—sparta athens rome venice bern holland even geneva and san marino c where shall we look for one without it would be an improvement in the affairs of society probably if the hereditary legal descent could be avoided and this experiment the americans have tried but in this case a nobility must and will exist though without the name as really as in countries where it is hereditary for the people by their elections will continue the government generally in the same families from generation to generation descent from certain parents and inheritance of certain houses lands and other visible objects will eternally have such an influence over the affections and imaginations of the people as no arts or institutions of policy will control time will come if it is now or ever was otherwise that these circumstances will have more influence over great numbers of minds than any consideration of virtues or talents and whatever     influences numbers is of great moment in popular governments and in all elections they always bear a natural and implacable hate towards the people this is too strong and universal the romans observed certain families as the valerii c who were constant friends and lovers of the people as well as others the claudii c who as constantly hated them it has been before admitted that such a body naturally encroaches both ways on the people on one side and on the king on the other the people hate and envy them as much and endeavor equally to encroach but the same sentiments passions and enterprises take place between the democratical body and the aristocratical where the last is not hereditary but annually elective our authors next argument is still more grossly erroneous if any great man arrive to so much power and confidence as to think of usurping these are the first that will set him on mingle interests with him and become the prime instruments in heaving them up into the seat of tyranny it is true that some few individuals of a nobility may join such a man in his conspiracy in hopes of enjoying high stations and great emoluments under him but such an usurpation was never set on foot by a body of nobility it has ever been the people who have set up single despots in opposition to the body of the nobility and it is the people who have furnished the men and money to support the standing army by which he is defended if any one example of the contrary is to be found it has escaped a diligent inquiry it is very unnecessary to produce examples to show that states have lost their liberties by permitting one or a few to be over great every monarchy oligarchy and aristocracy is an instance and a proof of it the very notion of a free peoples losing their liberties implies the setting up one or a few with too much power this will be readily admitted but it is contended that the people in a simple democracy collectively or by representation are necessarily the most addicted to setting up individuals with too much power to say that it is their duty not to do it that their happiness forbids it that their interest is against it that their liberty will be ruined by it is to exhort and to preach to be sure the clergy exhort and preach in favor of     religion and morality and against profaneness and vice but there are numbers—multitudes we find—who will not regard them and laws checks power are the only security against these the thirty tyrants of athens pisistratus hiero of syracuse dionysius and agathocles of sicily are very oddly introduced here when every despotism empire monarchy oligarchy and aristocracy that ever had a being is as much to the purpose mælius and manlius are cited very improperly the decemviri sylla cæsar are no more to the purpose than all tyrannies or absolute governments—all of which are proofs of the peoples indiscretion and constant disposition to set up idols as much as they are of the danger of permitting individuals to be too powerful florence and cosmus milan and switzerland and holland and the family of orange are all proofs against our author there is not a stronger instance to be found than the house of orange which has been supported by the people i mean the plebeians against the aristocracy and who in their course have sacrificed to their deified protectors barnevelt grotius and de witts patriots that one need not scruple to compare to aristides phocion and camillus and horrid as the sacrifice has been one need not scruple to say that all the liberty there has been in holland for the common people has been preserved by this alliance between the house of orange and them against the encroaching disposition of the aristocracy as much as the liberties of sparta were preserved by the oath of the kings and ephori it would nevertheless be an infinite improvement if the power of the prince and common people were defined limited and made constitutional and legal the authors principle is excellent and eternal to keep any man though he have deserved never so well by success or service from being too great or popular it is indeed a notable means and so esteemed by all free states to keep and preserve a commonwealth from the rapes of usurpation but the question between us still is how it is to be done in a simple aristocracy it is impossible with all their pride jealousy and envy some one and some few of the nobles obtain more influence than the rest and would soon obtain all power if ballots and rotations and innumerable intricate contrivances were not used to prevent it in a simple democracy no ballots or rotations     can prevent it one single tyrant will rule the whole commonwealth at his pleasure respecting forms and appearances a little at first but presently throwing off all restraint how can you prevent a man in such a government from being too popular there can be nothing to prevent him from making himself as popular as his abilities fortune or birth will enable him to be nothing to prevent him from employing the whole executive and judicial power nothing to prevent him from applying the public purse to the augmentation of his own popularity and power in short nothing but the mixture we contend for can prevent it the king and lords are interested to prevent any commoner from being too popular and powerful the king and commons are interested to keep any lord from being too popular and powerful and the lords and commons are interested to prevent the king from being too popular and powerful and they always have the means there is not a stronger argument against our authors form nor in favor of the triple composition the fourteenth and last reason is because in this form all powers are accountable for misdemeanors in government in regard of the nimble returns and periods of the peoples election by which means he that erewhile was a governor being reduced to the condition of a subject lies open to the force of the laws and may with ease be brought to punishment for his offence in a free government whose legislature consists of three independent branches one of which has the whole executive this is true every member of the two houses is as amenable to the laws as his poorest fellowcitizen the king can do nothing but by ministers who are accountable for every act they do or advise and this responsibility is efficacious to protect the laws from being trampled on by any person or persons however exalted in office reputation or popularity but in our authors right constitution no member can be responsible to any but his constituents and by means of the influence of the executive power and the offices it bestows by means of perversions of the judicial power and even of the public treasure which his party will assist him in applying to his purpose he will be able to procure a pardon among his constituents in a single city or borough and a reëlection nay he will be able to procure applause and rewards for that very criminal conduct which deserved punishment     there is no form of government not even an absolute monarchy where a minister will find it so easy to elude inquiry recollect the instance in poland he that was once a governor will generally continue always a governor because he will apply all the executive and judicial authority and even the public money as well as his personal and family influence to increase that party in the legislature that is the single assembly upon whose support he depends by a governor here is no doubt intended a person appointed by the assembly to manage the executive power such a governor will generally be continued but if he is not he will be succeeded by another of the same party who will screen and support him while he again takes his station in the house and supports or rules his successor but if opposition prevails in the house and nation and the minority becomes the majority they will be so weak as not to dare to look back and punish and if they do this will again render them unpopular and restore the reins to their antagonist in this way after a few vibrations of the pendulum they must have recourse to arms to decide the contest these consequences are so obvious and indisputable that it is amazing toread the triumphant assertions which follow such a course as this cuts the very throat of tyranny and doth not only root it up when at full growth but crusheth the cockatrice in the egg destroys in the seed in the principle and in the very possibilities of its being forever after the safety of the people is indeed the sovereign and supreme law and if laws are dispensed by uncontrollable unaccountable persons in power they will never be interpreted but in their own sense nor executed but after their own wills and pleasure but it is unaccountable that our author did not see that it is precisely in his right constitution of a commonwealth that we are to expect such uncontrollable and unaccountable persons at least as certainly as in a simple monarchy or aristocracy the only establishment then in which we may depend upon the responsibility of men in power and upon their being actually called to account and punished when they deserve it is the tripartite balance the political trinity in unity trinity of legislative and unity of executive power which in politics is no mystery this alone is the impregnable bulwark of the peoples safety because without it no certain benefit can be obtained by the     ordinary laws this alone is the bank against inundations of arbitrary power and tyranny our author asserts very truly that all standing powers meaning unlimited unbalanced standing powers as hereditary simple monarchies and aristocracies have and ever do assume unto themselves an arbitrary exercise of their own dictates at pleasure and make it their only interest to settle themselves in an unaccountable state of dominion so that though they commit all the injustice in the world their custom hath been still to persuade men partly by strong pretence of argument and partly by force that they may do what they list and that they are not bound to give an account of their actions to any but to god himself this is perfectly true and very important but our author did not consider that the leading men in a single popular assembly will make it their interest to settle themselves in a state of dominion that they will persuade men by strong pretence of argument by force by the temptations of offices civil military fiscal and ecclesiastical and by the allurements and terrors of judgments in the executive courts of justice to connive at them while they do what they list and to believe them gods vicegerents our author forgets that he who makes bishops and judges may have what gospel and law he pleases and he who makes admirals and generals may command their fleets and armies he forgets that one overgrown sagamore in the house with his circle of subordinate chieftains each with his clan at his heels will make bishops judges admirals generals governors of provinces c in as great number and with as much facility as an absolute monarch this inadvertence in our author is the more remarkable for what follows this doctrine of tyranny hath taken the deeper root in mens minds because the greatest part that is the greatest part of mankind was ever inclined to adore the golden idol of tyranny in every form by which means the rabble of mankind being prejudicated in this particular and having placed their corrupt humor or interest in base fawning and the favor of the present great ones therefore if any resolute spirit happen to broach and maintain true principles of freedom or do at any time arise to so much courage as to perform a noble act of justice in calling tyrants to an account presently he draws all the enmity and fury of the world about him   0 it is really astonishing that any man could write these words and not see that they totally overthrow the whole system of government that he calls the right constitution of a commonwealth the greatest part of men was ever inclined to adore the golden idol yet his constitution places the golden idol in the midst of the people without any check or restraint that they may fall down and worship as soon as they will he places all power in the hands of that very rabble of mankind who have prejudicated in favor of tyranny he places great ones in the midst of these who have placed their corrupt humor and interest in base fawning and the favor of those present great ones human nature is not honored by this account of it nor has it justice done it without supposing the majority so bad if we suppose one third or one quarter of this character and another third or quarter indifferent neutral lukewarm or even enough in love with private life and their own industry to stay at home at elections this is enough to demonstrate the tyranny and ruin to which such a simple democracy would rush but our authors device for extricating himself out of this difficulty is more curious still although the greatest part of men always incline to worship the golden calf tyranny yet in commonwealths it is and ought to be otherwise the greeks and romans were wont to heap all the honors they could invent by public rewards consecration of statues and crowns of laurel upon such worthy patriots as had the courage to call tyrants to account here he can only mean the stories of harmodius and aristogiton brutus and cassius so that all the security which freedom is to have is that as soon as a great one arises in his assembly and the majority begin to fawn some harmodius or cassius will arise to assassinate him but we know that the murder of hipparchus only inflamed hippias and that of cæsar entailed the empire in his family and the murder of alexander by lorenzo completed the despotism of the medici the ill success of liberty in those instances ought to be a warning against such attempts in future rather than precedents on which to build all the hopes of the cause of liberty the right of a nation to kill a tyrant in cases of necessity can no more be doubted than that to hang a robber or kill a flea but killing one tyrant only makes way for a worse unless the people have sense spirit and honesty enough to establish     and support a constitution guarded at all points against tyranny against the tyranny of the one the few and the many let it be the study therefore of lawgivers and philosophers to enlighten the peoples understandings and improve their morals by good and general education to enable them to comprehend the scheme of government and to know upon what points their liberties depend to dissipate those vulgar prejudices and popular superstitions that oppose themselves to good government and to teach them that obedience to the laws is as indispensable in them as in lords and kings our author contends that the honors decreed to tyrannicides by the greeks and romans were bestowed out of a noble sense of commonweal interest knowing that the life of liberty consists in a strict hand and zeal against tyrants and tyranny but he should have recollected that in rome these honors were decreed to senators for supporting the standing authority of a hereditary senate against single men who aspired to popular favor but never in any instance in support of such a government as he contends for in greece too there is no instance of any honors decreed for destroying tyrants in defence of any such government the government of athens was as different as possible from that of a single assembly of successive representatives of the people it is agreed that persons in power cannot be kept from all occasions of tyranny better than by leaving them liable to account but it is denied that persons in power can ever be brought to account unless by assassination which is no account at all in a government by a single sovereign assembly and it is asserted that this happiness was never seen yet under the sun by any law or custom established save only in those states where all men are brought to taste of subjection as well as rule ἄϱχειν ϰαι ἄϱχεσθαι by a government of three branches reciprocally dependent on each other in switzerland the people are free indeed because all officers and governors in the cantons are questionable by the people in their successive assemblies what does he mean in the aristocratical assemblies the people have no assemblies and officers are called to account only in standing councils in the democratical cantons there is nothing to account for but milk and cheese but why should england be forgotten where all officers are questionable and     often have been questioned by the people in their successive assemblies and where the judicature in parliament is digested with infinitely more prudence than in any canton in switzerland or any other republic in the world it is agreed that freedom is to be preserved no other way in a commonwealth but by keeping officers and governors in an accountable state but it is insisted that all standing powers in the english constitution as the lords and ministers who conduct the prerogative of the crown may at any time be called to account without the least difficulty or involving the nation in blood and misery but it is denied that powerful men in our authors right constitution can be called to account without the utmost difficulty and danger of involving the nation in blood and misery and therefore it is concluded that the english constitution is infinitely preferable to any succession of the single supreme assemblies of the representatives of the people     chapter second marchamont nedham objections answered our author having established his building upon fourteen solid pillars as he seems to think proceeds to answer objections the first objection is that such a government would set on levelling and confusion by levelling he understands levelling all men in point of estates making all things common to all destroying propriety introducing a community of enjoyments among men this he allows to be an odious thing a scandal fastened by the cunning of the common enemy upon this kind of government which they hate above all others we are not then put to the trouble of examining the whimsies of plato or xenophon about a community of goods wives and children nor those of sir thomas more about a community of property only he asserts that his project is so far from introducing a community that it is the only preservative of propriety in every particular it is agreed that it would not introduce levelling nor a community of goods unless the poor should be more numerous than the rich and rise for a division but even this would produce but a temporary level the new acquisitions would soon be spent and the inequality become as great as ever and there must be a perpetual succession of divisions and squanderings until property became too precarious to be sought and universal idleness and famine would end it but the pennniless though more numerous would probably never unite and the principals of the majority would make use of the most artful among them in stripping by degrees the minority and accumulating for themselves so that instead of levelling and community of goods the inequalities both of power and property would be constantly increasing until they became as great as in poland between the gentlemen and peasants     but it is denied that this would be a preservative of property on the contrary property must become insecure the ruling party disposing of all offices and annexing what salaries and fees they will laying on all taxes and distributing them according to their ideas of justice and equality appropriating the public money to what uses they will and deciding all causes in the courts of justice by their own judgments in all these ways themselves and their partisans will be found continually growing in wealth and their antagonists the minor party growing poorer these last can have no security of property at all this will not be prevented nor alleviated by those handsome words of our author it is not in reason to be imagined that so choice a body as the representatives of a nation should agree to destroy one another in their several rights and interests a majority would be found to agree to destroy the rights and interests of the minority and a mans property is equally insecure whether it is plundered by an arbitrary lawless minority or by a domineering decemvirate triumvirate or single despot all determinations being carried by common consent every mans particular interest must needs be fairly provided for against the arbitrary disposition of others if common consent means unanimous consent there might be some plausibility in this but as unanimity is impossible and common consent means the vote of the majority it is selfevident that the few are at the mercy of the many and the government of the latter being unbalanced by any equal force interest passion or power is as real a tyranny as the sovereignty of a hereditary senate or thirty tyrants or a single despot our author himself confesses this in so many words when he says that whatever placeth every mans right under the will of another is no less than tyranny seating itself in an unlimited uncontrollable prerogative over others without their consent and is the very bane of property are not the property liberty and life of every man in the minority under the will of the majority and may not the majority seat themselves in an unlimited uncontrollable prerogative over the minority without their consent our author then runs all over the world in search of examples and affirms that a free state or successive government of the people c expressions which he always explains to mean his     right constitution of a commonwealth or supreme representative assembly the same with m turgots all authority collected into one centre the nation is the only preservative of property as appears by instances all the world over this is a species of sophistry grossly calculated to deceive the most ignorant of the people that is unworthy of so great and good a cause as that of liberty and republican government this assertion is so wide from the truth that there was not in the world nor had been one example of such a government excepting the long parliament for the italian republics which resembled it the most were still better constituted we know what became of the long parliament oliver soon found they were selfseekers and turned them out of the house the reader is next led on through a series of examples in a very curious strain of popular rant to show that monarchies and all standing powers have been levellers under monarchs subjects had nothing that they could call their own neither lives nor fortunes nor wives nor any thing else that the monarch pleased to command because the poor people knew no remedy against the levelling will of an unbounded sovereignty in france it is asserted the people have nothing of propriety but all depends upon the royal pleasure as it did of late here in england the truth now almost breaks out and he almost confesses that he sees it it is very observable that in kingdoms where the people have enjoyed any thing of liberty and propriety they have been such kingdoms only where the frame of government hath been so well tempered as that the best share of it hath been retained in the peoples hands if he had said an equal share instead of the best share this sentence would have been perfect but he spoils it in the next breath by adding and by how much the greater influence the people have had therein so much the more sure and certain they have been in the enjoyment of their propriety this is by no means true on the contrary wherever the people have had any share in the executive or more than one third part of the legislative they have always abused it and rendered property insecure the arragonians are quoted as firm in their liberties and     properties so long as they held their hold over their kings in their supreme assemblies and no sooner had philip ii deprived them of their share in the government but themselves and their properties became a prey to the will and pleasure of their kings it is astonishing that arragon should be quoted as an example of a government of the people in their supreme successive assemblies if it is to be called a republic it was such another as poland it was what is sometimes called a mixed monarchy and sometimes a limited monarchy but as no judgment of a government can be formed by the name that is given it we may safely pronounce it an aristocracy much pains were taken to balance it but so awkwardly and unskilfully that its whole history is a scene of turbulence anarchy and civil war the king was among the twelve rich men little more than primus inter pares like the king among his twelve archons in phæacia although the royal dignity was hereditary and arragon was never an elective kingdom yet the confirmation of the states to the title of the next heir was held necessary and it was highly resented if he assumed the royal title or did any public act before he had taken an oath to preserve the privileges of the states when any dispute arose concerning the succession the states took upon them to decide it one awkward attempt to balance the influence of the king was the institution of a chief justice to whom appeals might be made from the king this judicial authority was empowered to control the king if he acted illegally and this high officer was accountable only to the states for whatever he did in the execution of his office this was a very powerful check another attempt to form a balance against the royal authority has been celebrated as one of the most sublime and sentimental institutions of liberty if it had been an institution of the body of the people it would have been the most manly and noble assertion of the rights and natural and moral equality of mankind to be found in history and would have merited immortal praise but in fact and effect it was no more than a brilliant expression of that aristocratical pride which we have seen to be so common in all the nations of the earth at the     inauguration of the monarch the chief justice was seated in his robes on an elevated tribunal with his head covered the king appeared before him bareheaded fell down upon his knees and swore to govern according to law and to maintain the privileges of the states proclamation was then made in the name of the assembly of the states we who are as good as you are have accepted you for king and lord upon condition that you observe our laws and protect our liberties but who were these noble assertors of rights not the people and whose liberties were asserted not those of the people but of a few gentlemen the men of property who in general had acquired their estates by their swords were called rich men† or barons for whatever titles were afterwards introduced by the grants of kings the right to seats and votes in the states arose not from the rank or dignities of dukes marquises or counts but was attached to the quality of landholders rich men or barons there were not more than twelve old families who were the original barons or ricos hombres of arragon in a course of time they were distinguished into the greater and lesser nobility the former were such as were raised by the kings to superior titles the latter were those who retained only their ancient character of landholders the clergy were represented in the states by the prelates and the great cities by deputies but the farmers the mechanics the merchants in one word the common people were according to the doctrine of aristotle not admitted to the rank or rights of citizens they had no seat in the states nor any vote in the choice of those who had the third estate as it was called or the representatives of cities was very unskilfully composed in some cities the mayor of course represented the city in others the king appointed the representative in others it was either by some grant of the king or some senseless custom of the city a hereditary right in a single family and the best appointments of all were made by the aristocratical regencies of the cities in such an assembly of the states laws were made for the government of the nation but it was a single assembly and neither estate had a negative if two estates agreed it was a law and indeed the most important questions even donations     of money were decided by a majority and the chief justice was the only balance against the oppression of any subject or even of the king and the only guardian of the laws to see them carried into execution the rich men and the clergy as well as the king were such standing powers as always excite our authors invectives and the third estate was as distant as possible from being an adequate and equitable representative of the people annually elected the clergy became generally humble servants of the king and the deputies of cities were often corrupted so that the contest was chiefly between the crown and the nobles in progress of time by gaining over more and more the prelates and deputies of the cities to the interest of the crown it became an overmatch for the nobility and made itself absolute this example therefore is as ill chosen as all the others and instead of supporting our authors argument is decisive against it france is the next example where as long as the peoples interest bore sway in their supreme assemblies they could call their lives and fortunes their own and no longer for all that have succeeded since louis xi followed his levelling pattern so far that in a short time they destroyed the peoples property and became the greatest levellers in christendom it would take up too much time to give in this place a sketch of the history of france to show in detail how inapplicable this example is to the purpose of our author those who have leisure and curiosity may consult boulainvilliers the abbé de mably and monsieur moreau and many most beautiful reflections may be found in lord bolingbrokes dissertation on parties it is sufficient here to say that the statesgeneral were composed of nobles clergy and a third estate all meeting in one assembly that the third estate consisted of representatives of cities not chosen by the people but appointed at least by the aristocratical regencies that in some places the mayor in others some particular family held it as a hereditary right but nothing can be conceived more unlike our authors idea of the peoples successive sovereign assemblies than these statesgeneral the constitution in those times was an unskilful attempt to reconcile an illcompounded aristocracy with simple monarchy but the statesgeneral conducted themselves like all other single assemblies till they were laid aside     england comes next where as long as the peoples interest was preserved by frequent and successive parliaments so long we were in some measure secure of our properties but as kings began to worm the people out of their share in government by discontinuing of parliaments so they carried on their levelling design to the destroying of our properties and the oracles of law and gospel at last spoke it out with a good levelling grace that all was the kings and that we had nothing we might call our own  there is at least wit and burlesque humor in thus ascribing levelism to monarchy and while it is considered only as rodomontade there is no objection to it nor is there any thing to say against confounding levelism with insecurity of property for though the ideas are distinct the things must always exist together from monarchy he proceeds to other standing powers which have all produced arrant levellers in athens as long as the people kept free indeed in an enjoyment of their successive assemblies so long they were secure in their properties but athens never was free according to our authors plan of successive assemblies athens never had assemblies of representatives the collective assemblies of the people were made sovereigns in all cases whatsoever by solon but they never practised it till aristides began and pericles completed the plan and as soon as it existed it began to render property liberty and life insecure yet the ordinary administration was never conducted in these assemblies the senate and the areopagus and the ten other courts conducted them yet with all these checks ask demosthenes and phocion and miltiades and aristides how the sovereign people behaved after kings were laid aside they erected another form of standing power in a single person called a governor archon for life who was accountable for misdemeanors but yet a trial being made of nine of them the people saw so little security by them that they pitched upon another standing form of decimal government and being oppressed by them too they were cashiered the like miseries they tasted under the standing power of thirty which were a sort of levellers more rank than all the rest who put to death banished pilld and polld whom they   0 pleased without cause or exception so that the poor people having been tormented under all the forms of standing power were in the end forced as their last remedy to take sanctuary under the form of a free state in their successive assemblies it is droll enough thus to turn the strain of popular banter upon the royalists by charging kings perpetual archons annual archons the ten archons the thirty tyrants c as levellers it was the levelling spirit of the nobles to be sure that abolished kings and single archons and set up ten but the poor people had no hand in it but as passive instruments as to the peoples taking sanctuary under the form of a free state in their successive assemblies they never did it they never set up any such government they did assume the sovereignty it is true but pericles led them to it only that he might govern them and he and successive unprincipled wretches after him did govern till the commonwealth was ruined but there was as much levelling at least indeed much more under themistocles pericles and alcibiades as under kings or archons our authors conscience was always uppermost he always betrays something which shows that he knew very well what the truth was he judges very rightly here and though it may be objected says he that afterwards they fell into many divisions and miseries even in that form yet whoever observes the story shall find it was not the fault of the government but of themselves in swerving from the rules of a free state by permitting the continuance of power in particular hands who having an opportunity thereby to create parties of their own among the people did for their own ends inveigle engage and entangle them in popular tumults and divisions this was the true reason of their miscarriages and if ever any government of the people did miscarry it was upon that account it is plain from this passage that our author was well read and judged very well upon these subjects he knew how it was but he has not candidly told us what he knew that they fell into divisions and miseries he owns but denies that it was the fault of the government—it was the fault of themselves is it not the fault of themselves under all governments despotisms monarchies aristocracies oligarchies as well as democracies was it not the fault of themselves under their kings their perpetual     archons their archons for life their ten archons as well as under the pisistratidæ that they were tormented with divisions and miseries the law of nature would be sufficient for the government of men if they would consult their reason and obey their consciences it is not the fault of the law of nature but of themselves that it is not obeyed it is not the fault of the law of nature that men are obliged to have recourse to civil government at all but of themselves it is not the fault of the ten commandments but of themselves that jews or christians are ever known to steal murder covet or blaspheme but the legislator who should say the law of nature is enough if you do not obey it it will be your own fault therefore no other government is necessary would be thought to trifle we certainly know from the known constitution of the human mind and heart and from uniform experience that the law of nature the decalogue and all the civil laws will be violated if mens passions are not restrained and therefore to presume that an unmixed democratical government will preserve the laws is as mad as to presume that a king or senate will do it if a king or senate do not observe the laws we may say it is not the fault of the government but of themselves what then we know that themselves will commit the fault and so will a simple democracy and therefore it is in all these cases the fault of the government as well as of themselves the government should be so constituted that themselves cannot commit the fault swerving from rules is no more the fault of standing kings and senates than it is of standing or successive popular assemblies of the three the last have the strongest disposition to swerve and always do swerve the soonest when unbalanced but the fault of permitting the continuance of power in particular hands is incurable in the people when they have the power the people think you a fool when you advise them to reject the man you acknowledge to be the ablest wisest and best and whom you and they know they love best and appoint another who is but second in their confidence they ever did and ever will continue him nay and augment his power for their love of him like all their other passions never stands still it constantly grows until it exceeds all bounds these continual reelections this continuance of power in particular men gives them an opportunity to create parties of their own among the people and for their own     ends to inveigle engage and entangle them in popular tumults and divisions let me now ask marchamont nedham or any advocate for his system do you believe that the people unbalanced ever will avoid to confer a continuance of power on their favorites do you believe they ever did in any age or country the answer must be in the negative do you believe it possible from the constitution of human nature that they ever will any more than that they will universally obey the law of nature and the ten commandments the answer must be in the negative why then is the world any longer amused with a speculative phantom that all enlightened men know never did and never can exist my hand is impatient of the pen and longs to throw it down while i am laboring through a series of popular sophisms which disgraces a work that abounds with sense and learning with excellent principles maxims and rules of government miserably perverted to answer a present purpose to run down one party and support another  but as this book is known in america and ought to be perused by englishmen in whatever part of the globe as a valuable monument of the early period in which the true principles of liberty began to be adopted and avowed in the nation i shall pursue the subject to the end lacedæmon is next introduced as an instance of levelism after they had tried the government of one king then of two afterwards came in the ephori as supervisors of their kings after they had tried themselves through all the forms of a standing power and found them all to be levellers of the peoples interest and property then necessity taught them to seek shelter in a free state under which they lived happily till by the error of the athenians they were drawn into parties by powerful persons and so made the instruments of division among themselves for the bringing of new levellers into play such as were machanidas and nabis the ephori were supervisors of the senate rather than of kings they swore both for themselves and the people to support     the kings forever against the enterprises of the senate but when did the lacedæmonians take shelter in a free state never according to our authors definition of a free state until the ephori murdered the king instead of supporting him according to their oath and until the people set up machanidas and nabis and it is always thus the first thing a people broke loose from all restraints of their power do is to look out for a chief whom they instantly make a despot in substance and very soon in form the government of sparta was as different from a free state during the six or seven centuries that lycurguss institution lasted as the english constitution is and much more the people had not half the weight in it standing powers both of king and senate stood like mount atlas while the republic existed and when the free state succeeded it was the tyranny of machanidas and nabis not better than that of nero it is droll enough to call the spartans levellers to be sure they who supported a haughty aristocracy at home and in every other city of greece where they could negotiate when the institution of lycurgus was worn out and the people began to gain in power they used it as the athenians and all others have done when unbalanced they set up idols continued and increased their power were drawn into parties and divisions and made themselves instruments of division until despotism became inevitable rome in her turn comes round after the standing form of kings was extinct and a new one established the people found as little safety and property as ever here the fact is truly stated and the expressions are very just for the standing senate and the decemviri proved as great levellers as kings it is burlesque again to call the senate and decemviri levellers they were the very antithesis but if by levellers he means arbitrary men it is very true so that they were forced to settle the government of the people by a due and orderly succession of their supreme assemblies i wonder when to quote athens sparta and rome as examples of a government of one sovereign representative assembly is dishonest nothing can be further from the purpose the standing power of the senate existed from romulus to     cæsar as our author very well knew and the people never obtained even an effectual check so far from settling the government of the people by a due and orderly succession of their supreme assemblies if they ever recovered their property in having somewhat they might call their own they owed the blessing to the senates wisdom and equity for the people were so far from being sovereign in their successive assemblies that they had not an equal share of power with the senate allowing for all the assistance they derived from the tribunes but as soon as they began to arrogate a superior power or even an equal share they began to run into the error of lacedæmonians athenians and all other people that ever lived swerving from the rules of a free state or in other words trampling on the laws lengthening of power in particular hands they were drawn and divided into parties to serve the lusts of such powerful men as by craft became their leaders so that by this means through their own default they were deprived of their liberty long before the days of imperial tyranny thus cinna sylla marius and the rest of that succeeding gang down to cæsar used the peoples favor to obtain a continuation of power in their own hands and then having saddled the people with a new standing form of their own they immediately rooted up the peoples liberty and property by arbitrary sentences of death proscriptions fines and confiscations which strain of levelling more intolerable than the former was maintained by the same arts of devilish policy down to cæsar who striking in a favorite of the people and making use of their affections to lengthen power in his own hands at length by this error of the people gained opportunity to introduce a new levelling form of standing power in himself to an utter and irrecoverable ruin of the roman liberty and property thus it is that our author accumulates examples from history which are demonstrations against his own system and in favor of the english and american constitutions a good englishman or a good american with the most diligent search could not find facts more precisely in vindication of those balances to the power of the people a senate and an executive first magistrate nothing else can ever prevent the people from running into the same error and departing from the rules of a free state and even the fundamental laws     florence is again introduced to the same purpose and with the same success so is pisa so is mantua and its sons passerino and gonzaga we have already seen enough of these italian republics to convince us that every page in their history is against our authors system his conclusion is exactly the reverse of what it should be it should be that a commonwealth by the people in their successive assemblies hath never in any age been a preservation of liberty or property or any remedy against usurpations of standing powers but had in all ages been in his own sense levellers of all things to the will of a standing despot the second objection is that such a form in the peoples hands would cause confusion in government this objection seems to have been started by his own party who were afraid of the influence of royalists and the answer to it distinguishes two states of a commonwealth one while it is new after a revolution when great numbers are disaffected these he treats with great severity and allows the danger of confusion from their intrigues he therefore excludes them from voting or being chosen and justifies it by greek and roman examples the other is a quiet state when all the people may he thinks be admitted to choose and be chosen without confusion but as this whole objection and answer to it relate to the time and circumstances in which he wrote it is unnecessary to enlarge upon it it is nevertheless amusing or provoking to observe with what facility he asserts the right of the majority to make slaves of the minority such as have commenced war to serve the lusts of tyrants against the peoples interest should not be received any longer a part of the people but may be handled as slaves when subdued if their subduers please so to use them because by their treasons against the majesty of the people they have made forfeiture of all their rights and privileges the majesty of the people is a very venerable sublime and affecting idea but in human theory every government despotism monarchy aristocracy and every mixture is created by the people continued by their sovereign will and represents their majesty their august body resistance therefore to a despotism or simple monarchy or aristocracy or a mixed government     is as really treason against the majesty of the people as when attempted against a simple or representative democracy since the right of the people to confide their authority and majesty to one man or a few men can no more be doubted than to a larger number in the divine theory upon which most of the governments of europe still rest it is not only treason but impiety and blasphemy to resist any government whatever if the sovereignty of a nation is a divine right there is an end of all the rights of mankind at once and resistance to the sovereignty wherever placed is rebellion against god it is worth while to observe also a contradiction to what our author had advanced in the former part of his work the old commonwealth of greece he says here were wont to heap up all honors they could vent upon such as did or suffered any thing for the maintenance of their liberty under a former head he represented it as a commendable custom of commonwealths to make their service a burden the third objection is that the management of state affairs requires judgment and experience which is not to be expected from new members coming into those assemblies upon every election the answer to this objection is of great importance because it in effect though not in words gives up his whole argument in favor of a single sovereign assembly he distinguishes between acta imperii and arcana imperii acts of state and secrets of state by acts of state he means the laws and ordinances of the legislative power things that have most influence upon a commonwealth as to its ill or well being and the only remedies for such bad customs inconveniences and encroachments as afflict and grieve it matters of grievance being matters of common sense and such as are obvious to the people who best know where the shoe pinches them there is no need of any great skill or judgment in passing or applying a law for remedy but as to secrets of state or the executive part of government during the intervals of their supreme assemblies—these things being of a nature remote from ordinary apprehensions and such as necessarily require prudence time and experience to fit men for management much in reason may be said and must be granted for the continuation of such trusts in the same hands as relate to matter of council or administration of justice     more or less according to their good or ill behavior a prudential continuation of these may without question and ought to be allowed upon discretion because if they do amiss they are easily accountable to the peoples assemblies here our authors plan begins to develop itself hitherto we had heard nothing but of successive sovereign assemblies of the peoples representatives now indeed we learn that this assembly is to appoint judges generals and admirals and a standing committee perhaps for the treasury the admiralty the customs excise and foreign affairs whether these judges and committees and commanders are to be members of the sovereign assembly or whether their appointments are to vacate their seats is not ascertained but in either case it is obvious they will be the friends and confidants of the prevailing party in the house they will be persons on whose friendship the major party in the assembly can rely to promote their views by advancing their friends among their constituents in order to procure a new election or in other words a standing power a thing which our author dreads so much in the representative assembly and thus the whole executive and judicial power and all the public treasure is at once applied to corrupt the legislature and its electors and what is it to be accountable to the peoples assemblies it is to be afraid to offend the strongest party in the house by bestowing an office or deciding a cause civil or criminal against their inclinations jamess boast comes in very pertinently here the leaders in the house having the appointment the impeachment censure condemnation reward and pay of all the bishops judges and commanders in their power they will have what law gospel war peace and negotiation they please corruption is let in in such a torrent as the virtue of no people that ever lived or will live is able to resist even for a few years the gangrene spreads immediately through the whole body our author proceeds to his ordinary routine of examples athens upheld constant returns and periods of succession in their supreme assemblies for remedy of grievances and they had a standing council called the areopagus to whom all the secrets of state were committed together with the administration of government during the intervals of those assemblies at whose return they were accountable and warily continued or excluded as the people found cause     but our author nowhere recollects the checks to the popular government of athens which however was never at any one moment so popular as his project he nowhere recollects that there were ten slaves to one citizen that the education of the citizens therefore was superior to that which is possible in any nation that has not slaves he nowhere recollects that the whole of religion was saved in the hands of the nobly born which gave a few families such an influence as no part of christendom now affords an example of not even in catholic countries he nowhere recollects that the whole people were divided into ranks and all magistrates taken out of the higher ranks he nowhere recollects the senate of one hundred and afterwards of five hundred appointed by lot which formed the council of state which had the constant charge of political affairs and particularly the preparation of business for the assembly of the people he nowhere pays a sufficient attention to the court of areopagus and its important powers and the persons of whom it was composed all the archons out of office were members for life he nowhere recollects that a single representative assembly being necessarily few are more liable to corruption than even a collective assembly who are many he nowhere recollects that solons institution was at last ruined by allowing to the fourth class of citizens an equal vote in the assembly of the people a terrible warning against all such projects of government these important checks which gave such vast weight to the aristocratical part of the community in the government of athens have no equivalent in our authors plan in sparta and rome says our author they had the like but it is really shocking to read these affirmations so entirely without foundation the governments of sparta and rome were governments as different and as opposite to our authors right form as can be imagined and the moment they obtained the least resemblance of it all authority was seen in one centre in nabis and cæsar florence too was after the same mode and holland and switzerland in holland the people never had the election of any regular assemblies and they never speak but by petition or in bodies unknown to any written constitution i mean mobs a more unlucky example could not have been thought of their regencies too are for life in general and fill up their own vacancies in all the aristocratical cantons of switzerland the same     how far some of the smallest democratical cantons in any particular resemble our authors notions may be seen in the former volume no sufficient justification of them will be found there but if a parallel could in states so small and poor be found it would be no precedent for nations large opulent and powerful full of great objects of ambition and constantly exposed to the hostile envy and resentment of great and dangerous neighbors the fourth objection is that such a government brings great damage to the public by their frequent discontents divisions and tumults in answer to this he considers several cases—  when any citizens arrogate privileges to themselves or their families beyond the ordinary standard of the people then discontents divisions and tumults arise in rome the senate retaining the power of the old government in the hands of themselves and their families upon the expulsion of the tarquins occasioned the subsequent discontents and tumults had brutus made them free when he declared them so or had the senate followed the advice and example of publicola all occasion of discontent had been taken away   when the people felt themselves not fairly dealt withal by their leaders and generals in syracuse dionysius being made general under pretence of defending the peoples liberties and then using his power to other purposes became the firebrand of the state and put the people all into flames for his expulsion in sparta the people were peaceable until they found themselves overreached and their credulity abused for converting liberty into tyranny under machanidas and nabis in old rome under the peoples government it was a sad sight to see the people swarming in tumults their shops shut up all trade given over and the city forsaken as also in athens the occasion was the same for though the people naturally love ease and peace yet finding themselves outwitted by slights and abused by feats of the senate they grew out of all patience when any one of their senators or of themselves arrived to any height of power by insinuating into the peoples favor upon specious and popular pretences and then made a forfeiture of those pretences as sylla and marius they were the causes of those tumults and slaughters among the romans the infamy whereof has been cast most injuriously upon the peoples government by the profane pens   0 of court pensioners cæsar too was the cause of all those civil broils and tragedies among the people an impartial writer would have brought every one of these examples in proof of the direct contrary for they all show that in proportion as the people gained an authority uncontrolled or more than a balance for the senate they grew more discontented divided and tumultuous the more inclined to stir up factious leaders as pericles alcibiades cleon the gracchi marius sylla and catiline and cæsar the people were certainly peaceable under the kings though the archons and nobles were not the people were peaceable under the grecian archons and roman senate so peaceable as to bear extreme oppression but their turbulence began with their aspiring at power and increased as it grew and grew intolerable the moment they obtained the exercise of that authority which our author contends they ought always to exercise these examples therefore all show the necessity of a balance to the peoples exercise of power in a mixed government   the people are tumultuous when sensible of oppression although naturally of a peaceable temper minding nothing but a free enjoyment but if circumvented misled or squeezed by such as they have trusted they swell like the sea overrun the bounds of justice and honesty ruining all before them but unhappily they very often mistake and swell against the most honest and faithful men and insist upon being misled by the most artful and knavish a great majority of the people and those as honest as any are too fond of ease and peace to trouble themselves with public affairs which leaves an opportunity to the profligate and dissolute to have more influence than they ought to set up such idols as will flatter and seduce them by gifts by offices and by partiality in judgments which shows that although they are very competent to the choice of one branch of the legislative they are altogether incapable of well managing the executive power it is really unaccountable but by that party spirit which destroys the understanding as well as the heart that our author should conclude there is not one precedent of tumults or sedition which can be cited out of all stories where the people were in fault it was even their fault to be drawn in or provoked it was their fault to set up idols whose craft or injustice and whose fair pretences     had designs upon the public liberty they ought to know that such pretenders will always arise and that they never are to be trusted uncontrolled but he seems to be aware that all this would not be quite satisfactory in order to extenuate the evil he admits for argument sake that the people were tumultuous in their own nature and he ought to have admitted from regard to truth that without laws government and force to restrain them they really are so tumults when they happen are more easily to be borne than those inconveniences that arise from the tyranny of monarchs and great ones it is a great question whether anarchy or tyranny be the greater evil no man who reads the third book of thucydides or platos description of a democratical city or who considers the nature of mankind will hesitate to say that anarchy while it lasts is a greater evil than simple monarchy even exercised by tyrants but as anarchy can never last long and tyranny may be perpetual no man who loves his country and is willing to submit to a present evil for a future public good would hesitate to prefer anarchy provided there was any hope that the fair order of liberty and a free constitution would arise out of it a chance of this would be preferred by a patriot to the certainty in the other case some men too would prefer anarchy conscious of more address with the people than with a monarch but if anarchy and tyranny were to be alike permanent and durable the generality of mankind would and ought to prefer tyranny at least monarchy upon the principle that a thousand tyrants are worse than one but our author extenuates the evils of tumults—   the injury of them never extends further than some few persons and those for the most part guilty enough as the thirty grandees in athens the ten in rome c such tumults however have often proceeded to greater lengths and have had innocent and excellent men for their objects examples enough have been cited from greece and italy as well as holland   tumults are not lasting an eloquent oration of a grave man as menenius agrippa virginius or cato may pacify them true sometimes but much oftener the grave man will fall a sacrifice to their fury       tumults usually turn to the good of the public the great are kept in awe the spirits of the people kept warm with high thoughts of liberty this has some weight in monarchies and aristocracies where they may be quelled but in simple democracy where they cannot they would be fatal   in rome they obtained the law of the twelve tables procured the tribunes and supreme assemblies and frequent confirmation of them the supreme assemblies they obtained are very unluckily quoted because these having no control destroyed the commonwealth all this is far otherwise under the standing power of the great ones they in their counsels projects and designs are fast and tenacious as this is an acknowledgment that the people are not fast and tenacious that is steady it should seem an argument in favor of a standing senate at least of some senate appointed from the persons of most experience best education most respectable families and considerable property who may be supposed thoroughly to understand the constitution to have the largest views and be fast and tenacious of the maxims customs and laws of the nation to temper the unsteadiness of the people and even of their representatives the evils under these forms are more remediless and universal not at all in mixed governments they are on the contrary more easily remedied for the house of commons is the grand inquest of the nation those tumults and quarrels that arise among them never end but in further oppression of the people quarrels among them have commonly given more weight to the people and must always end in relieving the people where the people have a full share upon the whole tumults arise in all governments but they are certainly most remediless and certainly fatal in a simple democracy cheats and tricks of great men will as certainly take place in simple democracy as in simple aristocracy or monarchy and will be less easily resisted or remedied and therefore our author has not vindicated his project from the objection of its danger from tumults a mixed government of all others is best calculated to prevent to manage and to remedy tumults by doing justice to all men on all occasions to     the minority as well as majority and by forcing all men majority as well as minority to be contented with it the fifth objection is that little security is to be had for the more wealthy and powerful sort of men in regard of that liberty which the people assume to accuse or calumniate whom they please in answer to this our author acknowledges that calumniation by which he means ambitious slandering of men by whisperings reports or false accusations has been more or less in all forms of government but affirms that it was never allowed or approved in his form of government that it has been most in use under standing powers of great ones who make it their grand engine to remove or ruin all who stand in their way and have always instruments ready at hand that it is marked out by aristotle inter flagitia dominationis but the true and impartial answer is this that all simple governments are addicted to this vice and make use of it as an instrument to destroy their adversaries in our authors right constitution it would be as prevalent as in any monarchy or aristocracy and in each of the simple governments it is equally impossible to prevent palliate or remedy the evil in a simple democracy it must be the worst of all upon the whole because the whole nation must necessarily be slanderers the majority calumniate of course for the same reason that unlimited monarchs and senates do namely—to support their power and annoy their enemies and the minority are necessitated to slander in their turn in selfdefence the liberty of accusation however in every form of government must in some degree be admitted without it neither will nor pleasure nor law can govern in a simple democracy it would be unlimited every body belonging to the majority would be informer and accuser and always sure of supporting his accusation the minority therefore in a simple democracy are subjected to spies informers accusations and slanders without end and without redress in a mixed government like the english and american informers from private motives are justly odious from public motives respected every crime however high may be prosecuted and punished the grand inquest of the nation becomes accuser against those in high places the grand inquest of the counties for ordinary offences no crime can be concealed no     fictitious crime can be pretended or alleged calumny itself is punishable as an offence against the public and the injured individual may obtain satisfaction it is in such a government alone that calumny is or can be managed upon principles of public safety and private justice neither of which can ever be generally regarded in any simple government and most certainly least of all in our authors right constitution or authority in one centre for the proof of these observations any history would serve but it will be sufficient to attend to those anecdotes quoted by our author in rome the ten grandees and all that succeeded them in that domineering humor over the people ever kept a retinue well stocked with calumniators and informers such as we call knights of the post to snap those that in any wise appeared for the peoples liberties this was their constant trade as it was afterwards also of their emperors but while the people kept their power entire in the supreme assemblies we read not of its being brought into any constant practice this continued chicanery in holding out to the people of england an idea that the romans were ever governed by his right constitution is really unpardonable nothing can be more unfair but to pass this over are the examples of cassius mælius manlius coriolanus the gracchi so soon forgot the scipios indeed he recollects these calumnies were promoted by the senate in some instances it is true but by the people too in all at least the people were made the dupes and tools which is sufficient to make the examples strong proofs against our author the same profligacy of a party spirit appears in his example of athens by their lofty and unwary carriage they stirred up the peoples fear and jealousy so far as to question and send divers of them into banishment as alcibiades themistocles and others why are aristides miltiades socrates and phocion forgotten these would have been too grossly against him and warnings too terrible against his paltry system whereas if the rules of a free state had been punctually observed by preserving a discreet revolution of powers and an equability or moderate state of particular persons there had     been no occasion of encroachment on one part or of fear on the other that is to say if the rules of a free state had been observed in a city where no such rule of a free state existed and an equability and moderation maintained of which there is no example in history and which is totally impracticable then there would have been no encroachment or fear or in other words if all men had been wise and virtuous and there had been no need of government at all then there would have been no democratical tyranny and he might add monarchical or aristocratical it is burlesque to talk of a rule of a free state which never was and every man of common sense knows never can be a rule of a free state our conclusion must be directly contrary to that of our author namely—the calumniation under his right constitution must be more frequent intolerable and remediless than under any form of tyranny whether monarchical or aristocratical the english constitution furnishes rules means and judicatures in their grand and petit juries and in impeachments of the commons before the lords so equitable and admirable that it is very unaccountable that any man should think of preferring to it a simple democracy of a single representative assembly where it is so obvious that every mans reputation liberty property and life must be in constant danger of accusations by and before an omnipotent party the liberty of accusation by the people before their supreme assemblies cannot mean that the whole people should join in such accusation this is impossible every man then must have liberty to accuse whom he will the house will consider who is the accuser and who the accused and members in the house will consider how their parties are likely to be affected by the sentence more than truth or justice an accuser who is useful to the majority will rarely be punished let his accusation be ever so false or malicious one of the minority will never be heard though his complaint be ever so true the liberty of accusation is indeed a thing so essentially necessary for the preservation of a commonwealth that there is no possibility of having persons kept accountable without it and by consequence no security of life and estate liberty and property maxime interest reipublicæ libertatis ut libere possis civem aliquem accusare it most highly concerns the freedom of     a commonwealth that the people have liberty of accusing any persons whatsoever thus far we agree as well as in the opinion that a great evil in governments simply monarchical or aristocratical is the want of such liberty but simple democracy has in it as great an evil in this respect for the minority have too little liberty of accusation in proportion as the majority have too much it is therefore in a mixed government only where an equal liberty can be preserved to all without being too great in any it is agreed further to be a means and the only means of extinguishing jealousies and emulations discontents and fury in the people when they can bring to account their oppressors and the instances of the decemviri and coriolanus are properly enough produced the story from florence too of one who occasioned such calamities for want of this liberty of accusation by which he might have been taken down and the case of soderini who drove the people to call in the spaniard to suppress him for want of such a power to these examples there is no objection nor to the doctrine they convey namely—that the liberty of accusation prevents the people very often from running in rage and despair to internal violence or foreign alliance and in both cases to arms but the conclusion upon the whole must be that this objection stands in full force against our authors plan and wholly unanswered there is no security for the most wealthy and powerful sort of men among the minority they will be constantly exposed to ruin by false accusations the sixth objection is that people by nature are factious inconstant and ungrateful in answer to the charge of faction he repeats his positions under the fourth reason and his examples of pompey and cæsar guelph and ghibelline in italy the families of orleans and burgundy in france the guises york and lancaster c we must refer to our observations on the fourth reason inconstancy he allows to be a characteristic of the people who are debauched and in a corrupted state of a commonwealth when degenerated from its true principles as in athens rome florence but yet in rome you may see as pregnant instances of that peoples constancy as of any sort of men whatsoever for they continued constant irreconcilable enemies to all tyranny in     general and kingly power in particular in like manner when they had once gotten their successive assemblies they remained firm and stiff to uphold them in making their elections too they could never be persuaded to choose a known infamous vicious or unworthy fellow so that they seldom or never erred in the choice of their tribunes and other officers but it has ever been otherwise under kings and all standing powers here he must mean simple monarchies and aristocracies because he distinguishes the case from rome which was a mixed government standing powers usually ran into all the extremes of inconstancy upon every new project petty humor and occasion shifted principles every moon cashiered all oaths protestations promises and engagements and blotted out the memory of them with a wet finger he instances in charles i if we speak impartially upon this head we must say that all men are alike that simple governments are equally inconstant so far as they partake of the same human nature kings have been as inconstant as any men so have simple senates simple democracies have never been tried but if we reason from their nature we shall conclude that they are more inconstant than either because the result depending on the majority of votes the difficulty and impossibility of assembling equal numbers at all times increases the chances of change and inconstancy the ignorance of multitudes who compose a part of the people is another cause so that if a difference must be allowed it must be confessed that simple democracy is the least constant but a mixed government produces and necessitates constancy in all its parts the king must be constant to preserve his prerogatives the senate must be constant to preserve their share and the house theirs neither can go beyond its line without being called back by the other the legislative must be constant to preserve its rights and the executive for the same end the judicial too must be constant to the laws which alone can screen it from the resentment and encroachment of one or other of the three branches in the legislature it is to this universal vigilance and constancy which such a constitution renders necessary and unavoidable that the laws owe their perpetual superiority and are able to make kings nobles and commoners ministers of state and religion and judges too bow with reverence to its decisions to this constancy therefore is due that delightful     tranquillity of mind arising from a sense of perfect security in the protection of known laws for the enjoyment of life liberty honor reputation and property ingratitude has been much charged upon this form in athens and rome unhandsome returns were made to some worthy persons that had done high services—alcibiades themistocles phocion miltiades camillus coriolanus and both the scipios the cause of whose misfortunes is described by plutarch and livy to be their own lofty and unwary carriage which stirred up the peoples fear and jealousy the scipios were most to be pitied because the nobles not the people disobliged them as for camillus and coriolanus they deserved whatever befell them because they maligned and hated the people all this is tolerably just our author proceeds— this humor however is highly commended by some as a sign of a commonwealths being in pure and perfect health when the people are thus active zealous and jealous in the behalf of their liberties that will permit no such growth of power as may endanger it yet he adds with great truth that the people have been so far from ingratitude that they have always been excessive in their rewards and honors to such men as deserved any way of the public whilst they conformed themselves to rules and kept in a posture suitable to liberty witness their consecration of statues incense sacrifices and crowns of laurel enrolling such men in the number of their deities the crime of ingratitude cannot in any peculiar manner be fastened upon the people this is very just the people are no more ungrateful than kings or senates nor more jealous and the instances from republics of apparent ingratitude are not fair proofs they commonly have arisen from party and the ill treatment of deserving men has been the work of intrigues of the aristocratical and monarchical parts of these communities oftener than of the people themselves the jealousy and envy of commanders and leading senators and patricians have plotted with the people fomented their prejudices inflamed their passions and misrepresented by false reports until such points have been carried there is another thing too to be considered the real merit of public men is rarely fully known and impartially considered empiricism is practised to an astonishing degree by some even     in the purest times aristides and themistocles cæsar and cato are not upon an equal footing but when men arise who to real services add the arts of political empiricism conform to the errors of the people comply with their prejudices gain their hearts and excite their enthusiasm then their gratitude is a contagion it is a whirlwind it is infinitely worse to the public than their ingratitude or than the ingratitude of kings or nobles our author produces as instances of the ingratitude of princes alexander hated antipater and parmenio and put the latter to death vespasian cashiered the meritorious antonies the king of portugal alphonsus albuquerque ferdinand of arragon consalvus the great henry vii stanley of the house of derby who put the crown upon his head sylla his instruments augustus cicero and he might have added many thousands of others after all justice and sound policy ought to be the rule and measure of rewards and punishments not any vague sensation of gratitude or jealousy every simple government and every unbalanced mixture must produce frequent instances not only of ingratitude but of injustice and bad policy in the article of rewards and punishments but in a mixed government effectually balanced it is rarely possible that real service merit and virtue should go unrewarded if the king is disposed to be ungrateful the lords and commons will not suffer it if the commons are ungrateful the king and lords will do justice if the lords are faulty the king and commons will set all right the chances of ingratitude therefore in such a government are much less and the assurance of a just recompense of reward is much greater while the danger of royal favoritism and popular extravagance are wholly avoided as there is nothing of more essential importance to the preservation of liberty the promotion of prosperity and the exaltation of the dignity and grandeur of a state than a just generous and steady rule of policy in rewards and punishments it must with all humble submission be presumed that a mixed government has an infinite advantage of all others in this respect but of all imaginable governments that of one assembly is the worst for every man of the minority will be sure of ingratitude and injustice let his service be what it will nay he will be in danger of punishment for his merit and every man of the majority will be safe against   0 punishment for many misdemeanors and sure of excessive rewards for every trifling service we may fairly conclude upon the whole that none of these six objections stand against a free government of three branches but every one of them in full force against a single sovereign assembly the next chapter is entitled the original of all just power is in the people this book is valuable as it is so ancient a monument of liberty and political knowledge in england many of its principles were at that time extremely rare in the world excepting in england they have been since enlarged on with great success by sidney locke hoadley montesquieu rousseau raynal de mably price priestley beccaria and many others of various nations and are now becoming universal it is unnecessary to abridge this chapter because although it contains the hints on which succeeding writers have enlarged their discourses are more ample and more satisfactory     chapter third marchamont nedham errors of government and rules of policy the first error in ancient christian policy which hath indeed been a main foundation of tyranny is that corrupt division of a state into ecclesiastical and civil our author enlarges upon this error and his speculations are worth reading but as this is not likely to be the error of america i shall leave it to be read when such danger approaches the second error is very frequent under all forms of government it is this—that care hath not been taken upon all occasions of alteration to prevent the passage of tyranny out of one form into another in all the nations of the world the interest of absolute monarchy and its inconveniences have been visible and fatal under the other forms and given undeniable proof of this maxim by experience in all times that the interest of monarchy may reside in the hands of many as well as of a single person the interest of absolute monarchy he defines to be— an unlimited uncontrollable unaccountable station of power and authority in the hands of a particular person who governs only according to the dictates of his own will and pleasure and though it hath often been disguised by sophisters in policy so as it hath lost its own name by shifting forms yet the thing in itself hath been discovered under the artificial covers of every form in the various revolutions of government in athens when they had laid aside their king the kingly power was retained still in all the after turns of government for their decimal governors and their thirty tyrants were but a multiplied monarchy the people being in a worse condition than before for their kings had supervisors and senatic assemblies that did restrain and correct them but the new governors having none ran into all the heats and fits and wild extravagancies of an     unbounded prerogative necessity and extremity opening the peoples eyes they at length saw all the inconveniences of kingship wrapt up in new forms and rather increased than diminished so that as the only remedy they dislodged the power out of those hands putting it into their own and placing it in a constant orderly revolution of persons elective by the community and now one would have thought there was no shelter for a monarchal interest under a popular form too but alas they found the contrary for the people not keeping a strict watch over themselves according to the rules of a free state but being won by specious pretences and deluded by created necessities to intrust the management of affairs into some particular hands such an occasion was given thereby to those men to frame parties of their own that by this means they in a short time became able to do what they list without the peoples consent and in the end not only discontinued but utterly extirpated their successive assemblies i have given this at length in our authors own words because it is an exact compendium of the whole history of athens and shows that he had read it attentively and understood it perfectly well and because it is a complete refutation of his own system his right constitution of a commonwealth absolute monarchy unlimited power in a particular person who governed by his own will run through all the history and changes in athens according to his own account even when the people had placed the supreme power in an orderly revolution of persons elective by themselves why because the people did not keep a watch over themselves did any other people keep a strict watch over themselves will any people ever keep a strict watch over themselves no surely is not this then a sufficient reason for instituting a senate to keep a strict watch over them is not this a sufficient reason for separating the whole executive power from them which they know will and must corrupt them throw them off their guard and render it impossible to keep a strict watch over themselves they did not observe the rules of a free state did any people that ever attempted to exercise unlimited power observe the rules of a free state is it possible they should any more than obey without sin the law of nature and natures god when we find one of these sorts of obedience     we may expect the other if this writer had been one of the enthusiasts of that day and told the people they must pray to god for his omnipotent grace to be poured out upon them to distinguish them from all the rest of mankind as his favorite people more even than the jews were that they might be enabled to observe the rules of a free state though all history and experience even that of the hebrews themselves and the constitution of human nature proved it impossible without a miracle or if he had told them that they were a chosen people different from all other men numbers would have believed him and been disappointed for it is impious presumption to suppose that providence will thus distinguish any nation but it would have been more sensible than thus to acknowledge in effect as he does repeatedly the impracticability of his scheme and still insist upon it the people were won by specious pretences and deluded by created necessities to intrust the management of affairs into some particular hands and will not the people always be won by specious pretences when they are unchecked is any people more sagacious or sensible than the athenians those ten thousand citizens who had four hundred thousand slaves to maintain them at leisure to study will not a few capital characters in a single assembly always have the power to excite a war and thus create a necessity of commanders has not a general a party of course are not all his officers and men at his devotion so long as to acquire habits of it when a general saves a nation from destruction as the people think and brings home triumph peace glory and prosperity to his country is there not an affection veneration gratitude admiration and adoration of him that no people can resist it is want of patriotism not to adore him it is enmity to liberty it is treason his judgment which is his will becomes the only law reason will allay a hurricane as soon and if the executive and judicial power are in the people they at once give him both in substance at first and not long afterwards in form the representatives lose all authority before him if they disoblige him they are left out by their constituents at the next election and one of his idolaters is chosen in rome also the case was the same under every alteration and all occasioned by the crafty contrivances of grandizing     parties and the peoples own facility and negligence in suffering themselves to be deluded for with the tarquins as it is observed by livy and others only the name king was expelled but not the thing the power and interest of kingship was still retained in the senate and engrossed by the consuls for besides the rape of lucretia among the other faults objected against tarquin this was most considerable that he had acted all things after his own head and discontinued consultations with the senate which was the very height of arbitrary power but yet as soon as the senate was in the saddle they forgot what was charged by themselves upon tarquin and ran into the same error by establishing an arbitrary hereditary unaccountable power in themselves and their posterity not admitting the people whose interest and liberty they had pleaded into any share in consultation or government as they ought to have done by a present erecting of their successive assemblies so that you see the same kingly interest which was in one before resided then in the hands of many nor is it my observation only but pointed out by livy in his second book and in many other places cum a patribus non consulem sed carnificem c when the senators strove to create not consuls but executioners and tormentors to vex and tear the people c and in another place of the same book consules immoderatâ infinitaque potestate omnes metus legum c the consuls having an immoderate and unlimited power turned the terror of laws and punishments only upon the people themselves in the mean while being accountable to none but themselves and their confederates in the senate then the consular government being cashiered came on the decemviri cum consulari imperio ac regio sine provocatione saith my author being invested with a consular and kingly power without appeal to any other and in his third book he saith decem regum species erat it was a form of ten kings the miseries of the people being increased ten times more than they were under kings and consuls for remedy therefore the ten were cashiered also and consuls being restored it was thought fit for the bridling of their power to revive also the dictatorship which was a temporary kingship used only now and then upon occasion of necessity and also those deputies of the people called tribunes which one would have thought had been sufficient bars against monarchic interest     especially being assisted by the peoples successive assemblies but yet for all this the people were cheated through their own neglect and bestowing too much confidence and trust upon such as they thought their friends for when they swerved from the rules of a free state by lengthening the dictatorship in any hand then monarchic interest stept in there as it did under sylla cæsar and others long before it returned to a declared monarchal form and when they lengthened commands in their armies then it crept in there as it did under the aforenamed persons as well as marius cinna and others also and even pompey himself not forgetting the pranks of the two triumvirates who all made a shift under every form being sometimes called consuls sometimes dictators and sometimes tribunes of the people to outact all the flagitious enormities of an absolute monarchy this valuable passage so remarkable as an abridgment of the roman history as containing the essence of the whole that relates to the constitution as a profound judgment of what passes in all societies has been transcribed in the authors own words and it may be truly said it contains a full confutation of his own system and a complete proof of the necessity of the composition of three branches it is strictly true that there is a strong and continual effort in every society of men arising from the constitution of their minds towards a kingly power it is as true in a simple democracy or a democracy by representation as it is in simple aristocracy oligarchy or monarchy and in all possible combinations and mixtures of them this tendency can never be eradicated it can only be watched and controlled and the whole art of government consists in combining the powers of society in such a manner that it shall not prevail over the laws the excellence of the spartan and roman constitutions lay in this that they were mixtures which did restrain it in some measure for a long period but never perfectly why because the mixture was not equal the balance of three branches is alone adequate to this end and one great reason is because it gives way to human nature so far as to determine who is the first man such is the constitution of mens minds that this question if undecided will forever disorder the state it is a question that must be decided whatever blood or wounds it may occasion in every species of gregarious animals as well as men this point in the triple division of     power is always determined and this alone is a powerful argument in favor of such a form our authors right constitution is the worst of all possible forms in this respect there are more pretenders the choice of means is multiplied the worst men have too much influence in the decision more indeed than the best and the whole executive and judicial powers and the public treasure too will be prostituted to the decision of this point in the state of nature when savage brutal man ranged the forests with all his fellowcreatures this mighty contest was decided with nails and teeth fists stones and clubs in single combats between all that dared to pretend amidst all the refinements of humanity and all the improvements of civil life the same nature remains and war with more serious and dreadful preparations and rencounters of greater numbers must prevail until the decision takes place the people says our author were cheated through their own neglect and bestowing too much confidence and trust upon such as they thought their friends and could he quote an instance from all history of a people who have not been cheated who have not been negligent who have not bestowed too much confidence and trust upon such as they thought their friends who have not swerved from the rules of a free state by lengthening power in hands that hold it can he give a plausible reason to hope that such a people will ever appear on the contrary is it not demonstrable that such a people is impossible without a miracle and a renovation of the species why then should the people be bribed to betray themselves putting the executive power into their hands is bribing them to their own destruction putting it into the hands of their representatives is the same thing with this difference for the worse that it gives more opportunity to conceal the knavery giving the executive power to the senate is nearly the same for it will be in that case used in bribes to elevate certain senatorial families all projects of government formed upon a supposition of continual vigilance sagacity and virtue firmness of the people when possessed of the exercise of supreme power are cheats and delusions the people are the fountain of power they must in their constitution appoint different orders to watch one     another and give them the alarm in time of danger when a first magistrate possessed of the executive can appeal to the people in time of danger when a senate can appeal to the people and when a house of commons can appeal to the people when it is the interest of each in its turn to appeal to the people when selfpreservation causes such appeal then and then only can the people hope to be warned of every danger and be put constantly on their guard kept constantly vigilant penetrating virtuous and steady when their attention too is fixed only upon the preservation of the laws and they cannot be diverted like apes by throwing the nuts of the executive power among them to divide them when they have any thing to do with the executive power they think of nothing else but scrambling for offices and neglect altogether the legislature and the laws which are their proper department all the flagitious enormities of absolute monarchy will be practised by the democratical despot triumvirs decemvirs who get possession of the confidence of the majority florence testifies the same truth even when it seemed most free it was ever the business of one upstart or other either in the senate or among the people to make way to their own ambitious ends and hoist themselves into a kingly posture through the peoples favor as savonarola soderini and the medici whose family fixed itself in a dukedom nor can it be forgotten how much of monarchy of late crept into the united provinces the conclusion is that since the interest of monarchy that is arbitrary power or the government of men may reside in a consul as well as in a king in a dictator as well as in a consul in the hands of many as well as of a single person and that its custom hath been to lurk under every form in the various turns of government therefore it concerns every people in a state of freedom to keep close to the rules of a free state for the turning out of monarchy whether simple or compound both name and thing in one or many so they ought ever to have a reverend and noble respect of such founders of free states and commonwealths as shall block up the way against monarchic tyranny by declaring for the liberty of the people as it consists in a due and orderly succession of authority in their supreme assemblies that is for himself oliver cromwell and     their party for no other such founders of commonwealths had then ever existed the true conclusion from all the reasoning and all the examples under this second head of error in policy ought to have been that arbitrary power or the interest of monarchy or the government of men cannot be prevented nor the government of laws supported but by mixing the powers of the one the few and the many in equal proportions in the legislature by separating the executive from the legislative power and the judicial department from both the third error in policy is keeping the people ignorant of those ways and means that are essentially necessary for the preservation of their liberty for implicit faith and blind obedience hath hitherto passed current and been equally pressed and practised by grandees both spiritual and temporal upon the people under this head our author merits all the approbation and praise that can be bestowed upon him the instruction of the people in every kind of knowledge that can be of use to them in the practice of their moral duties as men citizens and christians and of their political and civil duties as members of society and freemen ought to be the care of the public and of all who have any share in the conduct of its affairs in a manner that never yet has been practised in any age or nation the education here intended is not merely that of the children of the rich and noble but of every rank and class of people down to the lowest and the poorest it is not too much to say that schools for the education of all should be placed at convenient distances and maintained at the public expense the revenues of the state would be applied infinitely better more charitably wisely usefully and therefore politically in this way than even in maintaining the poor this would be the best way of preventing the existence of the poor if nations should ever be wise instead of erecting thousands of useless offices or engaging in unmeaning wars they will make a fundamental maxim of this that no human being shall grow up in ignorance in proportion as this is done tyranny will disappear kings and nobles will be made to feel their equitable equality with commoners and commoners will see their interest and duty to respect the guardians of the laws for guardians they must have as long as human nature endures there is no room to doubt     that the schools academies aud universities the stage the press the bar pulpit and parliament might all be improved to better purpose than they have been in any country for this great purpose the emanations of error folly and vice which proceed from all these sources might be lessened and those of wisdom virtue and truth might be increased more of decency and dignity might be added to the human character in high and low life manners would assist the laws and the laws reform manners and imposture superstition knavery and tyranny be made ashamed to show their heads before the wisdom and integrity decency and delicacy of a venerable public opinion but it is in vain that our author endeavors to throw the blame of impressing implicit faith and blind obedience upon grandees spiritual and temporal for the grandees he contends for both spiritual and temporal i mean the first man and other principal members of his successive representative assemblies will have as much occasion to keep the people in ignorance and more opportunity to conceal truth and propagate falsehood than those whom he calls standing powers all intelligence and information will be directed to them they may conceal what they will and they will conceal every thing they can from their adversaries the minority and even much from their own followers it is a mixed government alone that can bear that truth and knowledge should be communicated freely to the people and in a mixed government alone can the people compel all men to communicate such information as ought to be laid before them the majority in a single assembly can conceal much from the minority indeed almost what they will but the crown or its ministers can conceal nothing from a house of representatives which they ought to know it is very true that a people who have declared themselves a free state should know what freedom is and have it represented in all its lively and lovely features that they may grow zealous and jealous over it they should also be made acquainted and thoroughly instructed in the means and rules of its preservation against the adulterous wiles and rapes of any projecting sophisters that may arise how different from this alas is the deplorable state of mankind ce nest quen angleterre où lon pourroit faire ou avoir des livres sur les constitutions said one of the most enlightened ambassadors in   0 europe and it is but a very few years since a french gentleman answered a foreigner who inquired for the best book upon the constitution of france monsieur cest lalmanach royal  the fourth error in policy hath been the regulation of affairs by reason of state not by the strict rule of honest it is unnecessary to follow our author through greece and italy the old testament and the new through france spain and england for instances of this raggione di stato this kingcraft and priestcraft it is well enough known but it may be practised with more facility in a simple democracy than in any other government the leaders of a majority have only to allege reason of state to justify themselves to their partisans for every species of tyranny and oppression over the minority until they become strong enough to allege the same reason of state to justify their tyranny over their own party fifth error permitting of the legislative and executive powers of a state to rest in one and the same hands and persons by the legislative power we understand the power of making altering or repealing laws which in all wellordered governments hath ever been lodged in a succession of the supreme councils or assemblies of a nation by the executive power we mean that power which is derived from the other and by their authority transferred into the hands of one person called a prince or into the hands of many called states for the administration of government in the execution of those laws in the keeping of these two powers distinct flowing in distinct channels so that they may never meet in one save upon some short extraordinary occasion consists the safety of a state the reason is evident because if the lawmakers who ever have the supreme power should be also the constant administrators and dispensers of law and justice then by consequence the people would be left without remedy in case of injustice since no appeal can lie under heaven against such as have the supremacy which if once admitted were inconsistent with the very intent and natural import of true policy which ever supposeth that men in power may be unrighteous and therefore presuming the worst points always in all determinations at the     enormities and remedies of government on the behalf of the people for the clearing of this it is worthy your observation that in all kingdoms and states whatsoever where they have had any thing of freedom among them the legislative and executive powers have been managed in distinct hands that is to say the lawmakers have set down laws as rules of government and then put power into the hands of others not their own to govern by those rules by which means the people were happy having no governors but such as were liable to give an account of government to the supreme council of lawmakers and on the other side it is no less worthy of a very serious observation that kings and standing states never became absolute over the people till they brought both the making and execution of laws into their own hands and as this usurpation of theirs took place by degrees so unlimited arbitrary power crept up into the throne there to domineer over the world and defy the liberties of the people let us pause here with astonishment a person who had read the former part of the book with attention would think these words a complete refutation of his whole right constitution of a commonwealth the whole drift of the book before this was to prove that all authority should be collected into one centre that the whole legislative and judicial power as well as the executive was to be vested in successive supreme sovereign assemblies of the peoples representatives and our endeavor has been to show that this would naturally be applied to corruption in election to promote division faction sedition and rebellion all this is now very frankly admitted and the safety of the state depends upon placing the power of making laws of executing them and administering justice in different hands but how is this to be done the executive power our author tells us is derived from the legislative and by their authority transferred into the hand of one person called a prince or into the hands of many called states for the administration of government in the execution of those laws this is totally denied the executive power is not naturally nor necessarily and ought never to be in fact derived from the legislative the body of the people according to our author and to truth is the fountain and original of all power and authority     executive and judicial as well as legislative and the executive ought to be appointed by the people in the formation of their constitution as much as the legislative the executive represents the majesty persons wills and power of the people in the administration of government and dispensing of laws as the legislative does in making altering and repealing them the executive represents the people for one purpose as much as the legislative does for another and the executive ought to be as distinct and independent of the legislative as the legislative is of that there is no more truth nature or propriety in saying that the executive is derived from the legislative than that the legislative is derived from the executive both are derived from the people it is as untrue to say that the executive power is transferred by the authority of the legislative into the hands of a prince as it would be to say that the legislative power was transferred by the authority of the prince into the hands of a legislative assembly the people may indeed by their constitution appoint the house of representatives to represent them in watching the executive magistrates and in accusing them of misrule and misdemeanors they may appoint a senate to represent them in hearing and determining upon those accusations the people are represented by every power and body in the state and in every act they do so the people are represented in courts of justice by the judges and juries grand and petit in hearing and determining complaints against ministers of the executive power as well as members of the senate and the house it is true the body of the people have authority if they please to empower the legislative assembly or assemblies to appoint the executive power by appointing a prince president governor podestà doge or king and to call him by which of these names they please but it would be a fatal error in policy to do it because it would in fact amount to the same thing which our author seemed to contend for through his whole book and which he now allows to be inconsistent with the safety of the state namely—a union of the legislative and executive powers in the same hands whoever appoints bishops and judges will dictate law and gospel whoever appoints a general will command the army an admiral the fleet any executor of the law will have it executed as he will it makes the executive power a mere tool of     the legislative and the prince a weathercock blown about by the leading member of the house every commission will be disposed of as the lord and master in the house shall direct military discipline will bow before his nod and the judicial power must have the same complaisance so that both executive and judicial powers will be prostituted to corrupt the people in elections and the members of the house as much as if all these powers were exercised in the house and all the legislative executive and judicial powers in the same hands the state unsafe the people left without remedy in case of injustice but by an appeal to heaven by our authors own confession in all free states the legislative and executive powers have been managed in distinct hands says our author that is the lawmakers have set down rules and then put power into the hands of others to govern by those rules i wonder where in sparta the executive power was in the kings hereditary kings not appointed by the senate or either of the popular assemblies that of the city or that for the country in athens the executive power was in the archons in rome first in kings and then in consuls through all the period of the republic but what is worse some important executive powers were reserved in the hands of the senate in sparta in the popular assemblies in athens in the senate in rome that is the executive and legislative powers were so far united which finally produced the ruin of all of them in short our author is perfectly right in his rule that the two powers ought to be distinct and in the fatal effects of their union but totally wrong in deriving one from the other and in his examples to show they ever were so derived but as the separation and division of authority for the preservation of equity equality and liberty in opposition to the union of it simply in one the few or the many is the end of all the pains we have taken upon this subject not a word of assistance afforded us by our author ought to be lost he goes on— cicero in his second book de officiis and his third de legibus speaking of the first institution of kings tells us how they were at first left to govern at their own discretion without laws then their wills and their words were law the making and execution of laws were in one and the same hands but what was the consequence nothing but injustice and injustice     without remedy till the people were taught by necessity to ordain laws as rules whereby they ought to govern then began the meeting of the people successively in their supreme assemblies to make laws whereby kings in such places as continued under the kingly form were limited and restrained so that they could do nothing in government but what was agreeable to law for which they were accountable as well as other officers were in other forms of government to those supreme councils and assemblies witness all the old stories of athens sparta and other countries of greece where you shall find that the lawmaking and the lawexecuting powers were placed in distinct hands under every form of government for so much of freedom they retained still under every form till they were both swallowed up as they were several times by an absolute domination in old rome we find romulus their first king cut in pieces by the senate for taking upon him to make and execute laws at his own pleasure and livy tells us that the reason why they expelled tarquin their last king was because he took the executive and legislative powers both into his own hands making himself both legislator and officer inconsulto senatu without advice and in defiance of the senate kings being cashiered then their standing senates came in play who making and executing laws by decrees of their own soon grew intolerable and put the people upon divers desperate adventures to get the legislative power out of their hands and place it in their own that is in a succession of their supreme assemblies but the executive power they left part in the hands of officers of their own and part in the senate in which state it continued some hundreds of years to the great happiness and content of all till the senate by sleights and subtilties got both powers into their own possession again and turned all into confusion afterwards their emperors though usurpers durst not at first turn both these powers into the channel of their own unbounded will but did it by degrees that they might the more insensibly deprive the people of their liberty till at length they openly made and executed laws at their own pleasure being both legislators and officers without giving an account to any and so there was an end of the roman liberty     to come nearer home let us look into the old constitution of the commonwealths and kingdoms of europe we find in the italian states venice which having the legislative and executive power confined within the narrow pale of its nobility in the senate is not so free as once florence was with siena milan and the rest before their dukes by arrogating both those powers to themselves wormed them out of their liberty of all those states only genoa remains in a free posture by keeping the power of legislation only in their supreme assemblies and leaving the execution of law in a titular duke and a council the keeping of these powers asunder within their proper sphere is one principal reason why they have been able to exclude tyranny out of their own state while it hath run the round in italy what made the grand signor absolute of old but his engrossing both these powers and of late the kings of spain and france in ancient times the case stood far otherwise for in ambrosio morales his chronicle you will find that in spain the legislative power was lodged only in their supreme council and their king was no more but an elective officer to execute such laws as they made and in case of failing to give them an account and submit to their judgments which was the common practice as you may see also in mariana it was so also in arragon till it was united to castile by the marriage of ferdinand and isabella and then both states soon lost their liberty by the projects of ferdinand and his successors who drew the powers of legislation and execution of law within the verge and influence of the prerogative royal whilst these two powers were kept distinct then these states were free but the engrossing of them in one and the same hands was the loss of their freedom france likewise was once as free as any nation under heaven though the king of late hath done all and been all in all till the time of louis xi he was no more but an officer of state regulated by law to see the laws put in execution and the legislative power rested in the assembly of the three estates but louis by snatching both these powers into the single hands of himself and his successors rooked them out of their liberty which they may now recover again if they have but so much manhood as to reduce the two powers into their ancient or into better channels     this pattern of louis was followed close by the late king of england charles i who by our ancient laws was the same here that louis ought to have been in france an officer in trust to see to the execution of the laws but by aiming at the same ends which louis attained and straining by the ruin of parliaments to reduce the legislative power as well as the executive into his own hands he instead of an absolute tyranny which might have followed his project brought a swift destruction upon himself and his family thus you see it appears that the keeping of these two powers distinct hath been a ground preservative of the peoples interest whereas their uniting hath been its ruin all along in so many ages and nations this passage at large in the authors own words has been quoted with pleasure because although the accuracy of it in every particular cannot be answered for the principle and examples are good and he might have added as many more examples as there were or had been simple governments in the world it is in mixed governments alone where these two powers are separated but the misfortune is that our author contends for a mixed government and a separation of the legislative and executive powers in name and appearance only if the executive is appointed by or derived from the legislative it is still in essence but one power and in the same hands it is inaccurate to say that in athens and sparta the lawmaking and lawexecuting powers were placed in distinct hands under every form of government it would be nearer the truth to say that they were free and happy in proportion as they separated these powers but the fact is these powers were never wholly separated part of the executive always was in the legislative and sometimes all of it and these errors proved their ruin when the executive power was left by the people of rome partly in the hands of officers of their own and partly in the senate it was a continual object of jealousy and contention between the senate and people whether france was ever as free as any nation under heaven or not may be learned from boulainvilliers the abbé de mably† and m moreau‡     to read through the voluminous histories of father daniel mezeray velly and consult original authorities as gregory of tours froissart c would be a tedious enterprise and after all the controversy would remain boulainvilliers contends that france was a republic and that the feudal lords had a right to make war upon the kings and upon one another but it was according to him but an aristocracy m moreau who examines all the other writers as boulainvilliers du bos de mably c contends that the monarchs have ever been absolute but at what period the common people such as farmers mechanics merchants c were admitted to a vote in the choice of their rulers even of the procurators of cities and boroughs which composed the third estate the public would yet be glad to be informed louis xvi has the unrivalled glory of admitting the people to a share in the government upon what grounds our author could pretend that france was ever as free as any nation under heaven is utterly incomprehensible the kings nobles and clergy were such standing powers as our author detested and the third estate was very far from being an adequate representation of the people so that the assemblies of the states and the ancient parliaments were by no means successions of the peoples sovereign assemblies the constitutions of the cortes in castile arragon portugal and all the other kingdoms now united under the kings of spain or portugal were equally repugnant to our authors system and equally destructive of it sixth error reducing transactions and the interests of the public into the disposition and power of a few particular persons the ill consequences have been that matters were not carried by fair debate but by design and surprise not by deliberation of the people in their open assemblies but according to the premeditated resolutions and forestalments of crafty projectors in private juntos not according to the true interest of state but in order to the serving of mens ends not for the benefit and improvement of the people but to keep them under as ignorant of true liberty as the horse and mule to be bridled saddled and ridden under the wise pretences of being governed and kept in order     but the grand and worse consequence of all hath been this that such colleagues partners and engrossers of power having once brought about their ends by lying practices upon the people have ever fallen into fits of emulation against themselves and their next design hath ever been to rook their fellows and rid themselves of competitors so that at length they have been their own executioners and ruined one another and the people having by this means been torn with civil dissensions and the miseries of war by being drawn into parties according to their several humors and affections the usual event ever was that in the end they have been seized as the prey of some single tyrant it must be confessed our author understands himself and his subject very well he is aware of all the difficulties and dangers but yet he will not see or will not confess that his own right constitution remains exposed to all their ravages without the smallest provision to defend it how will it be possible in a single sovereign assembly to prevent transactions and public interests falling into the disposition of a few how will it be possible that matters should always be carried by friendly debate and not by design and surprise by premeditated resolutions of crafty projectors in private cabinets not according to public interest but private ends not for the benefit of the people but to keep them in ignorance to be bridled and ridden how can such colleagues and partners be prevented from imposing lying practices on the people from emulation envy and jealousy among themselves and from rooking one another how shall the people be prevented from being torn with civil dissensions and drawn into parties by their several humors principles superstitions prejudices fancies and affections and how shall all this be prevented from ending in a single tyranny not one check not the least restraint no appearance of balance or control is once mentioned or thought of for an executive appointed by the legislative will be none at all it will only facilitate intrigue and artifice to disguise and conceal the blackest designs the example of the thirty tyrants of athens is a proof of this xenophon tells us they drew the determinations of all things into their own closets but seemed to manage them calculis et suffragiis populi by the votes of the people which they had brought to their own devotion in the assembly to countenance their proceedings and their custom was if any sort of men     complained and murmured at their doings or appeared for the public immediately to snap them off by the loss of life or fortune under a pretence of being seditious and turbulent fellows against the peace of their tyranny but will not such thirty or less number of tyrants arise in every single sovereign assembly and behave in the same manner in a representative assembly they may take off a troublesome member in an easier manner by applying the executive and judicial powers and the public treasure among his constituents to have him rejected or left out at the next election the event of the thirty tyrants combination was a civil war which ended in their banishment but a new junto of ten men got into their places whose government proving little less odious than the former gave occasion to new changes which never left shifting till they fell into a single tyranny if the wilder sort of people having by a sad experience felt the fruits of their own error in following the lusts of particular powerful persons grew wise and combining with the honester sort they all as one man set their shoulders to the work and restored the primitive majesty and authority of their supreme assemblies how long did it last aristides himself began to destroy it themistocles did more pericles more still and alcibiades finished the ruin it is not possible to say that the athenian constitution operated as a steady system of liberty for one moment because although a multitude of checks played in it there was no settled balance the example cited from herodotus is still more decisive in our favor and against our author monarchy being abolished in egypt after the death of king setho and a declaration published for the freedom of the people immediately the administration of all affairs was engrossed in the hands of twelve grandees or popular men principes populi who having made themselves secure against the people in a few years fell to quarrelling with one another as the manner is about their share in the government this drew the people into several parties and a civil war ensued wherein psammeticus one of the twelve having slain all his partners left the people in the lurch and instead of a free state seated himself in the possession of a single tyranny our author might have quoted the example of the apostles themselves who fell into disputes who should be the first in the kingdom they thought approaching   0 the two triumvirates are illustrious among thousands of other examples equally apposite pompey cæsar and crassus drew the affairs of the world into their hands determining all in a private junto without the advice or the consent of the senate or people unless it were now and then to make stalkinghorses of them for the more clear conveyance of some unpleasing design these men having made an agreement among themselves that nothing should be done in the commonwealth but what pleased their own humor it was not long ere the spirit of ambition set them flying at the faces of one another and drew the whole world upon the stage to act that bloody tragedy whose catastrophe was the death of pompey and the dominion of cæsar the second triumvirate was between octavius lepidus and antony these having shared the world between them presently fell a bandying against one another augustus picking a quarrel with lepidus gave him a lift out of his authority and confined him to a close imprisonment in the city next he picks a quarrel with antony begins a new civil war in which he ruined antony and seated himself in the enjoyment of a single tyranny but our author should have remembered that all this was after the senate had lost its authority and the people in their assemblies assumed all power and he should have been sensible that thus it will and must ever be in all simple governments to the end of the world in the great contest between henry iii and the barons about the liberties of themselves and the people the king being forced at length to yield the lords instead of freeing the nation indeed engrossed all power into their own hands under the name of the twentyfour conservators of the kingdom and behaved themselves like totidem tyranni acting all in their own names neglecting or overruling parliaments but then not agreeing among themselves there were three or four of them defeated the other twenty and drew the entire management of affairs into their own hands namely—the earls of leicester gloucester hereford and spencer yet it continued so not long for leicester getting all into his power fell at enmity with gloucester and was defeated by him at length leicester putting his fortune to a battle was slain and the king thereupon getting all power back again took advantage     of that opportunity for the greatening himself and his prerogative and so you see all that the people got by the effusion of their blood and loss of their peace was that instead of one tyrant they had twentyfour and then four and after them a single usurper montfort earl of leicester and he being gone they were forced to serve their old tyrant henry iii again who by this means became the more secure and firm in his tyranny and are not all these examples and millions of others that happen in every village hamlet and burgade in the world for in all these there are contentions for precedence and men who would rather be there the first than the second in rome as sincerely as cæsar enough to convince the people and popular writers of the necessity of more than one branch of power and indeed of more than two the single struggle for the first place must eternally distract every simple government and must disturb every one that has only two branches unless there is a legal constitutional and habitual mode of always determining who shall be foremost there can be no tranquillity among mankind grave exhortations to single assemblies whether senates or representatives not to permit public transactions to be engrossed and rest in the power of a few particular persons will be thrown away for such are the contradictions in the human character the multitude who have no hopes of being intrusted are as servile as the few who have are aspiring and upon the whole there is more superiority in the world given than assumed seventh error driving of factions and parties faction destroyed rome the factions headed by the two potent families of hannibal and hanno destroyed carthage faction made rome stoop to cæsar athens to pisistratus faction let the turk into constantinople and hungary the goths and vandals into spain and italy the romans into jerusalem it subjected genoa to the family of sforza dukes of milan brought the spaniard into sicily and naples and the french into milan where they ousted sforza to these instances might be added as many as you please but it is amazing that all that have happened have not been sufficient to show the necessity of a government so mixed that factions may always be ruled there can be no faction but of     the one the few or the many and a triple balance of equal powers affords a neverfailing remedy against either and if either of these is wanting there is always not only a possibility and a probability but an absolute certainty of one species of faction arising against which the constitution affords no defence eighth error violation of faith principles promises and engagements an impiety that ought to be exploded out of all nations that bear the name of christians and yet we find it often pass among the less discerning sort of men for admirable policy and those impostors that used it have had the luck to be esteemed the only politicians our author wisely and nobly condemns the reasoning of machiavel in his prince that because the greatest part of the world being wicked unjust deceitful full of treachery and circumvention there is a necessity that those who are downright and confine themselves to the strict rule of honesty must ever look to be overreached by the knavery of others he quotes too from machiavel this part hath been covertly showed to princes by ancient writers who say that achilles and many others of those ancient princes were intrusted to chiron the centaur to be brought up under his discipline the moral of this having for their teacher one that was half a beast and half a man was nothing else but that it was needful for a prince to understand how to make his advantage of the one and other nature because neither could submit without the other without condemning our species so far as machiavel by pronouncing the greatest part wicked or going the length of the ancients in supposing them half beasts or of some moderns in calling them half devils candor and charity itself must allow that in all great nations at least there are many both wicked brutal and diabolical and enough of both to trample on the laws and disturb the peace liberty and property of the good and humane unless provision is made in the constitution to restrain them in all simple governments the worst part of the species are least controlled and have most temptations and from hence arises a new and strong argument in favor of such a mixture as shall guard every avenue to imposture and every inlet to vice although the vices and follies of mankind no more than their diseases and bodily infirmities can never be wholly eradicated in this mixed state of good and evil and we cannot     rationally hope that policy will ever change the earth into heaven yet the balance of three branches appears to afford all that the constitution and course of things will admit at least all that have hitherto been discovered it would be folly to say that no further improvements can be discovered the moral and intellectual world is as little known as the physical we may hope from education inquiry and experiment great advances but until they are further pursued let us adopt such as have already been found practicable and useful there is one alteration which will be found indispensable before any great meliorations can be made in society and government some more rational method of determining the peoples votes in elections and some effectual provision against corruption the cry of family fortune some prejudice of superstition some habitual fondness a prejudice a whim a name too often determine the votes of multitudes even when grosser profligacy has no share the people must be taught to be governed more by reason and less by sounds the word king like magic excites the adoration of some and execration of others some who would obey the lawful orders of a king would rebel against the same orders given by the same authority under the name of governors or president others would cheerfully submit to a governor or president but think rebellion against a king with only the same authority virtue and merit and obedience to god until the nature of things is more generally understood by the people and mere sounds have less influence it will be in vain to expect any great improvements there is another particular too in which i suspect the people must change the fundamental maxim of their policy throughout the world before much further improvements will be made the people in all ages and countries have laid it down as a rule that their service must be perfectly disinterested no man deserves to be employed by them who will not serve them gratis at least if not put himself to great expense to procure their votes the consequences of this are many   no man can serve them who is not rich this is giving up at once their own right of election into the hands of an aristocracy and that characteristic of aristocracy too which has the least merit in it mere wealth   this introduces a universal system of machiavelian hypocrisy     into popular elections and those who are most interested most corrupted and most determined to carry the commodity to market are the most liberal in their offers of a price to purchase it the most ostentatious in professions of disinterested motives aristides fabricius and cincinnatus are eternally quoted as if such characters were always to be found in sufficient numbers to protect the peoples liberties and a cry and show of pure virtue is set up by the most profligate and abandoned of human kind such as would sell their fathers their country and their god for profit place and power hypocrisy simulation finesse are not more practised in the courts of princes than they are in popular elections nor more encouraged by kings than people unless some means can be discovered to reform the people and to enlighten them to make rectitude instead of chicanery the visible obvious interest both of governors and governed it will be in vain to expect great changes for the better in government to improve this morals and science must be improved extended and made more general if not universal and after all perfection we know can never be attained in either first rule of policy to educate the young fry in principles of dislike and enmity against kingly government and enter into an oath of abjuration to abjure a toleration of kings and kingly power in time to come this rule was made for charles stuart brutus made the romans swear that they never should suffer any man again to reign at rome the hollanders abjured philip his family and all kings forever these were inventions of aristocratical cunning and the people were dupes for taking them a king meaning a single person vested with the whole executive is the only remedy for the people whenever the nobles get the better of them and are on the scramble for unlimited power let every people have a care how they enslave themselves by such an oath or lay themselves under the necessity of committing perjury let them swear if they will never to be governed by an absolute monarch but even this had better be omitted for there are cases in which an absolute monarch is a less evil than a crowd of lawless lords a better oath for the common people would be never to intrust any part of the executive power to a senate or in other words to the body of the gentlemen     i am not without apprehensions that i have not made myself fully understood the people in all nations are naturally divided into two sorts the gentlemen and the simplemen a word which is here chosen to signify the common people by gentlemen are not meant the rich or the poor the highborn or the lowborn the industrious or the idle but all those who have received a liberal education an ordinary degree of erudition in liberal arts and sciences whether by birth they be descended from magistrates and officers of government or from husbandmen merchants mechanics or laborers or whether they be rich or poor we must nevertheless remember that generally those who are rich and descended from families in public life will have the best education in arts and sciences and therefore the gentlemen will ordinarily notwithstanding some exceptions to the rule be the richer and born of more noted families by the common people we mean laborers husbandmen mechanics and merchants in general who pursue their occupations and industry without any knowledge in liberal arts or sciences or in any thing but their own trades or pursuits though there may be exceptions to this rule and individuals may be found in each of these classes who may really be gentlemen now it seems to be clear that the gentlemen in every country are and ever must be few in number in comparison of the simplemen if you please then by the democratical portion of society we will understand the common people as before explained by the aristocratical part of the community we will understand the gentlemen the distinctions which have been introduced among the gentlemen into nobility greater or lesser are perfectly immaterial to our present purpose knights barons earls viscounts marquises dukes and even princes and kings are still but gentlemen and the word noble signifies no more than knowable or conspicuous but the gentlemen are more intelligent and skilful as well as generally richer and better connected and therefore have more influence and power than an equal number of the common people there is a constant energy and effort in the minds of the former to increase the advantages they possess over the latter and to augment their wealth and influence at their expense this effort produces resentments and jealousies contempt hatred and fear between the one sort and the other individuals among the common     people endeavor to make friends patrons and protectors among the gentlemen this produces parties divisions tumults and war but as the former have most address and capacity they gain more and more continually until they become exorbitantly rich and the others miserably poor in this progress the common people are continually looking up for a protector among the gentlemen and he who is most able and willing to protect them acquires their confidence they unite together by their feelings more than their reflections in augmenting his power because the more power he has and the less the gentlemen have the safer they are this is a short sketch of the history of that progress of passions and feelings which has produced every simple monarchy in the world and if nature and its feelings have their course without reflection they will produce a simple monarchy forever it has been the common people then and not the gentlemen who have established simple monarchies all over the world the common people against the gentlemen established a simple monarchy in cæsar at rome in the medici at florence c and are now in danger of doing the same thing in holland and if the british constitution should have its euthanasia in simple monarchy according to the prophecy of mr hume it will be effected by the common people to avoid the increasing oppressions of the gentlemen if this is the progress and course of things and who does not know that it is it follows that it is the true interest and best policy of the common people to take away from the body of the gentlemen all share in the distribution of offices and management of the executive power why because if any body of gentlemen have the gift of offices they will dispose of them among their own families friends and connections they will also make use of their votes in disposing of offices to procure themselves votes in popular elections to the senate or other council or to procure themselves appointments in the executive department it is the true policy of the common people to place the whole executive power in one man to make him a distinct order in the state from whence arises an inevitable jealousy between him and the gentlemen this forces him to become a father and protector of the common people and to endeavor always to humble every proud aspiring senator or other officer in the state who is in danger of acquiring an influence too great     for the law or the spirit of the constitution this influences him to look for merit among the common people and to promote from among them such as are capable of public employments so that the road to preferment is open to the common people much more generally and equitably in such a government than in an aristocracy or one in which the gentlemen have any share in appointments to office from this deduction it follows that the precept of our author to educate children of the common people in principles of dislike and enmity against kingly government and enter into an oath of abjuration to abjure a toleration of kings and kingly powers is a most iniquitous and infamous aristocratical artifice a most formal conspiracy against the rights of mankind and against that equality between the gentlemen and the common people which nature has established as a moral right and law should ordain as a political right for the preservation of liberty by kings and kingly power is meant both by our author and me the executive power in a single person american common people are too enlightened it is hoped ever to fall into such a hypocritical snare the gentlemen too it is hoped are too enlightened as well as too equitable ever to attempt such a measure because they must know that the consequence will be that after suffering all the evils of contests and dissensions cruelty and oppression from the aristocratics the common people will perjure themselves and set up an unlimited monarchy instead of a regal republic the second rule of policy is not to suffer particular persons to grandize or greaten themselves more than ordinary for that by the romans was called affectatio regni an aspiring to kingship mælius and manlius are again cited the name of the latter was ever after disowned by his whole family that famous family of the manlii and both the name and memory of him and of his consulship were razed out of all public records by decree of the senate it is certainly an essential rule in a free government to suffer no man to greaten himself above the law but it is impossible it should ever be observed in a simple democracy or aristocracy what might not manlius have done if rome had been governed by a single sovereign assembly of representatives it was the aristocracy that murdered manlius much against the will of the     democracy so that the instance is against the author the orange family in holland are mentioned too but it is the common people who have supported that family for their protection against the aristocracy it is agreed however by many respectable writers that the family of orange have been dangerous in that state because the people have no constitutional share in the government and the authority exercised by the stadtholder is not legally defined if the people therefore in their anger should augment the power of that house too much above the aristocracy it would be absolute but if the people should expel that house they must set up another as well as demand a share in the legislature for themselves or become slaves and a prey to the aristocracy it is a good rule for holland to beware of too great a man but it is equally necessary to beware of five thousand men who may easily become too great but in our authors right constitution the observance of the rule is impossible the people if unrestrained by a senate or a king will set up some one man and advance him to a greatness of dignity and authority inconsistent with liberty as soon as any one in such a government gets the commandinchief of an army he has the state in his power the common people in holland would assist the army in making the prince absolute if indeed the prince would accept of a gift that would ruin his country as well as his house if they were not restrained by a standing aristocratical power which our author abhors third rule non diurnare imperia not to permit a continuation of command and authority in the hands of particular persons or families this rule is undoubtedly necessary to preserve a simple aristocracy or democracy but it is impracticable in both and therefore it is impracticable to preserve an aristocracy or democracy but this is by no means a necessary or proper rule in a well constituted free government command and authority may be continued for any number of years or for life in the same person without the least danger because upon the smallest symptom of an inclination to abuse his power he may be displaced by the executive without danger or inconvenience but in a simple aristocracy or democracy he cannot be removed at all the majority will support him at all events or if they do not the majority that removes him will be so small that the minority who are his friends may often raise convulsions     it is a necessary rule too in such a mixed government as that of rome where in the best of times the people had an authority nearly equal to that of the senate where the mixture is of two powers only and the executive is wholly in one of them or partly in one and partly in another they are in continual danger of the tyranny of a single person on account of the frequent disputes between the two branches about the exercise of the executive and judicial power but where the executive is in one hand the legislative in three and the judicial in hands different from both there is rarely if ever any danger from a continuance of command in any one livy had good reason in the roman state to say libertatis magna custodia est si magna imperia esse non sinas et temporis modus imponatur it is a grand preservative of liberty if you do not permit great powers and commands to continue long and if you limit in point of time and to this purpose the æmilian law if it could have been observed would have been a good one the noble roman in the ninth book spoke in character when he said hoc quidem regno simile est and this indeed is like a kingship that i alone should bear this great office of censorship triennium et sex menses three years and six months contrary to the æmilian law livy too speaks in character as a good citizen of an aristocratical government when in his third book he speaks of a monstrous business that the ides of may were come which was the time of their years choice and yet no new election appointed id vero regnum haud dubie videri deploratur in perpetuum libertas it without doubt seems no other than a kingdom and liberty is lost for ever it was treason for any man to hold that high office of the dictatorship in his own hand beyond six months ciceros epistles to atticus concerning cæsar contain notable stuff to this purpose the care of that people in not permitting any man to bear the same office twice together was all in character because continuance in high office constantly exposed the state and constitution to the danger of being overturned and converted into an absolute monarchy in this constitution too in consequence of the checks between the senate the tribunes and the people there was some chance for having this law observed but an æmilian law in our authors right constitution would be made to no purpose it would be set aside without ceremony when nothing but a vote of an allpowerful majority would be wanting to set   0 it at defiance but in a mixed constitution of three branches such a law if made would be punctually executed much more exactly and certainly than in the roman constitution but in such a constitution such a law would be unnecessary as no danger can arise from the continuance of any general or admiral in command the same reasoning is applicable to the free states of greece where aristotle tells us this rule was observed the speech of cincinnatus to the people to persuade them to let him lay down his command now the time was come though the enemy was almost at the gates and never more need than at that time of his valor and prudence is a terrible example against our authors system for though no persuasion would serve the turn resign he would telling them there would be more danger to the state in prolonging his power than from the enemy since it might prove a pernicious precedent to the roman freedom yet as no more than two or three such characters as cincinnatus appeared in seven hundred years a statesman would be mad who should place the existence of his form of government upon the presumption that a succession of characters so disinterested would appear to resist the people themselves in their desire to violate a law if the people at that period could forget a rule so essential to their safety what are we to expect when they and their idols too are more corrupt m rutilius censorinus although he too made a speech against it gave way to the people when they forced him to undergo the office of censor twice together contrary to the intent and practice of their ancestors and accepted it upon this condition that a law might pass against the title in that and other officers lest it should be drawn into precedent in time to come but our author all along mistakes the spirit of this rule it was an aristocratical regulation altogether it was the senate and patricians who procured it to be observed from an aristocratical motive and principle from a jealousy of the people on one side and of kingly power on the other it is the same spirit which precipitated cassius and manlius from the rock and put mælius to death without ceremony the people or their representatives if uncontrolled would not probably ever make such a law if they did they would never long observe it the people would not suffer it to be much or long observed in rome notwithstanding     all the exertions of the aristocracy the times soon came when cincinnatuses and censorinuses were not found to refuse power and office offered them against law any more than horatii and valerii were found to postpone their private fortune to plebeian liberty even the grecian aristocracies could not observe this rule it was a law of sparta that no man should be twice admiral but lysander had address enough to persuade his countrymen to give the title to aratus but the real command to himself under the title of viceadmiral even in that which was in appearance the most democratical state of greece achaia aratus had the real power and command when he was out of place as much as when he was in our author mistakes too the spirit of the law that no tribune should be continued two years together this law was a mere aristocratical artifice to weaken the influence of the tribunes and their constituents by preventing them from acquiring confidence skill and influence by experience if the people had understood their own cause they would have insisted upon the privilege of choosing the same tribune as long as they approved his conduct fourth rule not to let two of one family to bear offices of high trust at one time nor to permit a continuation of great powers in any one family this rule is indispensable in aristocracies where the sovereignty is in continual danger from individuals of great influence and powerful connections where a jealousy of popular men and measures must be constantly kept up to its highest pitch the roman rule ne duo vel plures ex unâ familiâ magnos magistratus gerant eodem tempore let not two or more of one family bear great offices at the same time and the other ne magna imperia ab unâ familiâ prescribantur let not great commands be prescribed or continued in one family were necessary aristocratical rules because as the patricians were always afraid of the people who were continually urging for more power a very powerful family by joining with the people might have changed the constitution it is a wise and useful rule in general in all governments but in a simple democracy though it may be more necessary than in any other form it is always impracticable the people will set it aside whenever they please and will always be sure to depart from it in favor of a favorite man or family but in a mixed constitution of three branches there is less necessity of observing the rule with strictness     and more facility of observing it when necessary it is very doubtful whether the constitution of rome could have been longer preserved if cicero had joined antony instead of octavius the people were now uncontrolled and the senate had lost its authority and the people behaved as they always do when they pretend to exercise the whole executive and legislative power that is they set up immediately one man and one family for an emperor in effect sometimes respecting ancient forms at first and sometimes rejecting them altogether but of all rules this is the least possible to persuade them to observe in such a case the florentine family of the medici were set up in this manner by the people who as machiavel informs us aimed at all power and a simple democracy and in such cases cosimus is always easily admitted to succeed his cousin alexander it is not to be wondered at that pompeius columba stood up in the conclave and showed them how dangerous and prejudicial it must of necessity prove to the liberties of italy that the popedom should be continued in one house in the hands of two brothers one after another but if the election of a pope had depended upon the people of florence julian de medici would have been chosen to succeed his brother though columba had harangued them with ever so much eloquence against it a conclave of cardinals and a body of people in a city are very different electors the continuation of power in the house of orange is another instance in point that family have been continued in power by the will of the people very often expressed in outrageous fury and very often much against the inclination of the aristocracy in every nation under every form of government public affairs were always managed by a very small number of families compared with the whole number in a simple democracy they will ever be conducted by the smallest number of all the people will confer all upon a very few families at first and upon one alone at length the roman senate carried all by families so does the senate of venice but the number is greater than will ever be intrusted by a people who exercise the whole executive and legislative power in one assembly but the largest number of families that can be introduced into actual confidence and service in any combination of the powers of society is in the composition of three branches because here as many families     are employed to represent the people by numbers as to represent property in the senate and it is in such a form alone that so many families may be employed without confusion and sedition here then this rule of policy may be best observed not to let two or more unnecessarily bear high offices at once or if there are several of a family whose merit is acknowledged they may be employed without the smallest danger fifth rule to hold up the majesty and authority of their suffrages or votes entire in their senators or supreme assemblies or in other words to maintain the free suffrages of senates or people untainted with the influence or mixture of any commanding power for if this were not secured from control or influence of any other power then actum erat de libertate to maintain the independence and integrity of suffrages without corruption from flattery artifice bribes or fear is no doubt a good rule but if the author here means that the power of the people should be absolute and without control from a senate or a first executive magistrate it is begging the question and what is more it is notoriously false and destructive so long says our author as the roman people kept up their credit and authority as sacred in their tribunes and supreme assemblies so long they continued really free but how long was this while they were only defending themselves from the tyranny of the senate while they were greatly inferior to the senate in power while they were increasing their own power by obtaining the office of tribune by obtaining liberty to marry into patrician families to be appointed ædiles consuls censors c in short while their power was inferior to that of the senate and controllable by it they enjoyed as much liberty as ever was enjoyed under that government but the moment they obtained an equality of power with the senate they began to exercise more than their half and to give it to their idols when by their own neglect they gave sylla and his party in the senate an opportunity of power to curb them then their suffrages once esteemed sacred were trodden under foot for immediately after they came to debate and act but by courtesy the authority being left by sylla after the expiration of his dictatorship in the hands of the standing senate so that it could never after be regained by the people cæsar when he marched to rome deprived them also of the authority of their     suffrages only in a formal way made use of them and so under a shadow of legality he assumed that power unto himself which they durst not deny him our author is never weary of producing anecdotes and examples from history which prove his own system to be infallibly destructive of liberty it is a miserable consolation to a virtuous citizen who has lost his liberty to tell him that he has lost it by the neglect and fault of his fellowcitizens in general it is the most humiliating and desperate slavery of all if he had lost it by the simple usurpation of a single man or senate without the fault of the people if that indeed is a possible or supposable case he might still entertain a hope of regaining it but when we are told that a people lost their liberty by a neglect or fault that we know they will always commit when uncontrolled is it not a conclusive argument for providing in the constitution for an effectual control when the people exercise all powers in single assemblies we know that the power of sylla and cæsar will always mix in and influence and control it is impossible then that in our authors form of government this fifth rule of policy ever should be observed or the suffrages kept pure and upright just in the same manner dealt cosmus in the florentine senate he made use of their suffrages but he had so played his cards beforehand that they durst not but yield to his ambition so also tiberius first brought the suffrages of the senate at his own devotion that they durst not but consent to his establishment and then so ordered the matter that he might seem to do nothing not only without their consent but to be forced to accept the empire by their intreaty so that you see there was an empire in effect long before it was declared in formality will duplicity be less practicable or less common in an assembly of the people than in a senate may not an empire or despotism in effect though democratical in form be less difficult to accomplish than even under an aristocratical form empire of particular men will exist in effect under every simple form and every unequal mixture an empire of laws in reality can be maintained only in an equal mixture of all three sixth rule that the people be continually trained up in the exercise of arms and the militia lodged only in the peoples hands or that part of them which are most firm to the interest of liberty that so the power may rest fully in the disposition of their supreme assemblies     the limitation to that part most firm to the interest of liberty was inserted here no doubt to reserve the right of disarming all the friends of charles stuart the nobles and bishops without stopping to inquire into the justice policy or necessity of this the rule in general is excellent all the consequences that our author draws from it however cannot be admitted one consequence was according to him— that nothing could at any time be imposed upon the people but by their consent that is by the consent of themselves or of such as were by them intrusted as aristotle tells us in his fourth book of politics the grecian states ever had special care to place the use and exercise of arms in the people because the commonwealth is theirs who held the arms the sword and sovereignty ever walk hand in hand together this is perfectly just rome and the territories about it were trained up perpetually in arms and the whole commonwealth by this means became one formal militia there was no difference in order between the citizen the husbandman and the soldier this was the usual course even before they had gained their tribunes and assemblies that is in the infancy of the senate immediately after the expulsion of their kings but why does our author disguise that it was the same under the kings this is the truth and it is not honest to conceal it here in the times of tarquin even we find no standing army not any form of soldiery nor do we find that in after times they permitted a deposition of the arms of the commonwealth in any other way till their empire increasing necessity constrained them to erect a continued stipendiary soldiery abroad in foreign parts either for the holding or winning of provinces thus we have the truth from himself the whole people were a militia under the kings under the senate and after the senates authority was tempered by popular tribunes and assemblies but after the people acquired power equal at least if not superior to the senate then forces were kept up the ambition of cinna the horrid tyranny of sylla the insolence of marius and the self ends of divers other leaders both before and after them filled all italy with tragedies and the world with wonder is not this an argument for the power of kings and senates rather than the uncontrollable power of the people when it is confessed that the two first used it wisely and the last perniciously     the truth is as he said before the sword and sovereignty go together while the sovereignty was in the senate under kings the militia obeyed the orders of the senate given out by the kings while the sovereignty was in the senate under the consuls the militia obeyed the orders of the senate given out by consuls but when the sovereignty was lost by the senate and gained by the people the militia was neglected a standing army set up and obeyed the orders of the popular idols the people seeing what misery they had brought on themselves by keeping their armies within the bowels of italy passed a law to prevent it and to employ them abroad or at a convenient distance the law was that if any general marched over the river of rubicon he should be declared a public enemy and in the passage of that river this following inscription was erected to put the men of arms in mind of their duty imperator sive miles sive tyrannus armatus quisquis sistito vexillum armaque deponito nec citra hunc amnem trajicito general or soldier or tyrant in arms whosoever thou be stand quit thy standard and lay aside thy arms or else cross not this river but to what purpose was the law cæsar knew the people now to be sovereign without control of the senate and that he had the confidence both of them and his army and cast the die and erected a prætorian band instead of a public militia and was followed in it by his successors by the grand signor by cosmus the first great duke of tuscany by the muscovite the russian the tartar by the french and he might have added by all europe who by that means are all absolute excepting england because the late king charles i who attempted it did not succeed and because our authors right constitution of a commonwealth did not succeed if it had oliver cromwell and his descendants would have been emperors of old england as the cæsars were of old rome the militia and sovereignty are inseparable in the english constitution if the whole nation were a militia there would be a militia to defend the crown the lords or the commons if either were attacked the crown though it commands them has no power to use them improperly because it cannot pay or subsist them without the consent of the lords and commons but if the militia are to obey a sovereignty in a single assembly it is commanded paid and subsisted and a standing army too may be raised paid     and subsisted by the vote of a majority the militia then must all obey the sovereign majority or divide and part follow the majority and part the minority this last case is civil war but until it comes to this the whole militia may be employed by the majority in any degree of tyranny and oppression over the minority the constitution furnishes no resource or remedy nothing affords a chance of relief but rebellion and civil war if this terminates in favor of the minority they will tyrannize in their turn exasperated by revenge in addition to ambition and avarice if the majority prevail their domination becomes more cruel and soon ends in one despot it must be made a sacred maxim that the militia obey the executive power which represents the whole people in the execution of laws to suppose arms in the hands of citizens to be used at individual discretion except in private selfdefence or by partial orders of towns counties or districts of a state is to demolish every constitution and lay the laws prostrate so that liberty can be enjoyed by no man it is a dissolution of the government the fundamental law of the militia is that it be created directed and commanded by the laws and ever for the support of the laws this truth is acknowledged by our author when he says the arms of the commonwealth should be lodged in the hands of that part of the people which are firm to its establishment seventh rule children should be educated and instructed in the principles of freedom aristotle speaks plainly to this purpose saying that the institution of youth should be accommodated to that form of government under which they live forasmuch as it makes exceedingly for the preservation of the present government whatsoever it be  it is unnecessary to take pains to show that the impression men receive in youth are retained in full age though never so bad unless they happen which is very rare to quell the corrupt principles of education by an excellent reason and sound judgment nor is it necessary to cite the testimonies of plutarch or isocrates plato or solomon or cæsars commentaries nor the examples of greece or gallia and her druids the example of the difficulty the romans found to establish their aristocracy upon the ruins of monarchy arising from the education of their youth even the sons of brutus in different principles and the obstructions experienced by the cæsars in establishing     despotism among a people educated under a commonwealth are apposite enough education is more indispensable and must be more general under a free government than any other in a monarchy the few who are likely to govern must have some education but the common people must be kept in ignorance in an aristocracy the nobles should be educated but here it is even more necessary that the common people should be ignorant but in a free government knowledge must be general and ought to be universal yet such is the miserable blindness of mankind that in our authors right constitution it is very doubtful whether the pitiful motive of saving the expense would not wholly extinguish public education if there were not a senate but the people in one assembly ruled all it is a serious question whether there is one people upon earth so generally generous and intelligent as to maintain schools and universities at the public expense the greater number of every people are still ignorant and although their leaders might artfully persuade them to a thousand idle expenses they would not be able to persuade them to this education then must be supported by private munificence and this source although sufficient to maintain a few schools and a university in a great nation can never be sufficient to maintain schools in sufficient numbers to educate a whole people where a senate is preserved it is always a maxim with them to respect learning and educate their own families their example is followed by all others who are any way in easy circumstances in a government of three branches commoners as well as nobles are under a necessity of educating their children because they hope to be called to public service where it is necessary in all the mixed governments of antiquity education was necessary and where the people had a share it was the most generally practised but in a simple government it never was general in sparta it was far from being general it was confined to youth of family so it was under the aristocracy in rome and although we have no examples of simple democracy to recur to we need only consider that the majority must be ignorant and poor and recollect the murmurs and opposition made by numbers of the lowest classes who are often joined for sinister purposes by some men of consequence to be convinced that a general public education never can long exist in a simple democracy the stinginess the envy and malignity of the base     and ignorant would be flattered by the artful and designing and the education of every family left to its own expense that the rich only might have their children educated eighth rule to use liberty with moderation lest it turn to licentiousness which as it is a tyranny itself so in the end it usually occasions the corruption and conversion of a free state into monarchical tyranny this is a caution to the people and can do no harm but will do little more good than be ye warmed and be ye clothed will relieve the wants of the poor lectures and sermons and admonitions will never be sufficient to make all men virtuous political as well as moral writers and exhorters will spend their ink and breath not in vain it is to be hoped but without completely reforming the world and restoring innocence and purity to all mankind how then is the tyranny of licentiousness to be avoided by the energy of laws and where will be the energy of law when a majority may set it aside upon every question will not the licentious rich man who has perhaps greater influence in elections for his licentiousness be protected from punishment by his party in the house will not the continual prostitution of judgment in the executive courts to the views of a political party increase and propagate licentiousness will not the daily prostitution of the executive power by bestowing offices not for virtue or abilities but merely for party merit daily increase licentiousness will not the appropriation of the public money to elections increase the means of debauchery among the vicious will not the minor party be necessitated to imitate the majority in these practices as much as possible in order to keep themselves in any hopes when their hopes are gone they must join the other side in worshipping the same idols who then become complete despots in our authors plan of government then his caution against licentiousness will be thrown away but in a mixed government it will be extremely useful the laws may be made to concur with sermons and the scourge the pillory and the gallows may enforce the precepts of moral writers the magistrate may be a terror to evil doers and a praise to them that do well instead of being a terror only to the minority and a praise to those who oppress them as cautions and admonitions therefore are undoubtedly useful in a government truly free though idle and trifling in a simple democracy let us proceed to consider those of our author  00 his first caution under this eighth rule of policy is it is above all things necessary to avoid civil dissension and the uttermost remedy is not to be used upon every distemper or default of those that shall be intrusted with the peoples power and authority how charming it is for brothers to live in harmony the smallest things increase by concord how many beautiful sentiments in heavenly numbers from writers sacred and profane might be said or sung in honor of peace concord harmony and brotherly love repetitions of them from age to age have been made no doubt to the edification and comfort of many but alas dissensions still exist and daily arise in every nation city village and i fear i may add family in the whole world something more efficacious then than moral song ingenious fable philosophic precept or christian ordinance with reverence be it spoken must be employed in society or dissensions will still ravage and desolate the world in a simple democracy the citizens will not all think alike various systems of policy will be approved by different persons parties will be formed even with the best intentions and from the purest motives others will be formed from private views and from base motives the majority must decide and to obtain this the good will be obliged to unite with the bad and probably there will be no circle or combination no club or party in the house but will be composed partly of disinterested men and partly of interested ones partly by the virtuous and partly by the vicious honest men and knaves wise men and fools will be kneaded together in every mass out of the collisions of these dissensions unavoidably grow and therefore some provision must be made to decide them an upright independent tribunal to judge of controversies is indispensable and an upright independent judiciary tribunal in a simple democracy is impossible the judges cannot hold their commissions but durante bene placito of the majority if a law is made that their commissions shall be quamdiu se bene gesserint this may be repealed whenever the majority will and without repealing it the majority only are to judge when the judges behave amiss and therefore have them always at mercy when disputes arise between the rich and poor the higher and the lower classes the majority in the house must decide them there is no possibility therefore  0  of having any fixed rule to settle disputes and compose contentions but in a mixed government the judges cannot be displaced but by the concurrence of two branches who are jealous of each other and can agree in nothing but justice the house must accuse and the senate condemn this cannot be without a formal trial and a full defence in the other a judge may be removed or condemned to infamy without any defence or hearing or trial this part of our authors caution then is vain useless and idle in his own form of government but wise just and excellent in a government properly mixed such cautions are provided by the constitution itself that civil dissensions can scarcely ever arise or if they do may be easily composed the other part of the caution that the uttermost remedy is not to be used upon every distemper or default of those that shall be intrusted with the peoples power and authority is in a simple democracy totally useless and impracticable there is no other remedy but the uttermost for any distemper or default the courts of justice being tools of the majority will give no remedy to any of the minority petitions and remonstrances to the house itself against its own proceedings will be despised or resented so that there can be absolutely no remedy but in arms or by the enormity of tumult dissension and sedition which i suppose are meant by the uttermost remedy it is very true as our author says if one inconvenience happen in government the correction or curing of it by violence introduceth a thousand and for a man to think civil war or the sword is a way to be ordinarily used for the recovery of a sick state it were as great a madness as to give strong waters in a high fever or as if he shall let himself blood in the heart to cure the aching of his head this is perfectly just and expressed with great beauty propriety and force yet it is certain that a member of the minor party in nedhams and turgots government has no chance for any other remedy and even this is often as desperate as it is always dreadful because the weaker must attack the stronger if the only expedient to confute the arguments against such a collection of authority in one centre be that such a people give them the lie by a discreet and moderate behavior in all their proceedings and a due reverence of such as they have once elected and made their superiors these arguments will never be confuted and the cause of liberty is  0  desperate because it is as desperate to expect that a majority uncontrolled should behave always discreetly and moderately as to expect that all men will be wise and good our authors criterion for determining the cases in which the people in whom all majesty and authority fundamentally resides being only ministerially in their trustees or representatives may use sharp and quick remedies for the cure of a commonwealth is very judicious and has been the rule in all english revolutions since in such cases only as appear to be manifest intrenchments either in design or in being by men of power upon the fundamentals or essentials of their liberty without which liberty cannot consist this rule is common to him and milton and has been adopted by sidney locke burnet hoadley but this rule is useless in a simple democracy the minority have no chance for justice in smaller cases because every department is in the hands of their enemies and when the tyranny arrives at this last extremity they have no hope for all the means at least the most of the means of quick and sharp remedies are in the hands of their enemies too so that the most desperate irremediable and forlorn condition of liberty is in that very collection of all authority into one centre that our author calls a right constitution of a commonwealth the instance brought by our author to illustrate his meaning proves the same thing in that contention of three hundred years in rome between the senate and people about the division of the conquered lands the people made a law that no citizen should possess above five hundred acres of land the senators cried it was an abridgment of liberty the people cried it was inconsistent with liberty that the senators should engross too much wealth and power livy says the people were right and the senators wrong but that both did ill in making it a ground of civil dissension for the gracchi instead of finding out moderate expedients to reduce the senators to reason proceeded with such heat and violence that the senate was forced to choose sylla for their general which being observed by the people they also raised an army and made marius their general and herein came to a civil war which through fines banishment inhuman cruelties acted on both sides defeats in the open field and massacres within the city cost the best blood and estates of the nobility and commons and in the end cost  0  them their liberty for out of the root of this sprang that civil war between pompey and cæsar all this again which is true and just shows that our author had read the roman history with discernment and renders it more unaccountable that he should have perverted so much good sense and learning to support a fantastical image that he must have seen could not endure the example in question shows more than the impracticability of liberty in a simple democracy it shows the imperfection of a mixture of two powers a senate and people in a simple democracy whatever dispute arises whether about a division of lands or any thing else must be decided by the majority and if their decree is unjust there is no remedy but to appoint sylla and marius generals in the roman mixture of two powers there is no remedy to decide the dispute but to appoint sylla and marius pompey and cæsar but when there are three branches after two have offered all possible arguments and cannot agree the third has only to consider which is nearest justice and join with that to decide the controversy and restore the peace it shall readily be granted that the civil war between marius and sylla was needless and about an object which did not immediately affect the fundamentals of the constitution yet indirectly it did and the fact is that the struggle now began to be serious which should be master it was no longer a question whether the senate should be restrained but whether the people should be masters the army under pompey was necessary why to prevent the people from being masters and to defend the existence of the senate the people indeed were already masters and would have an idol the instance of charles i may be equally applicable but those times afford as melancholy an example of a dominatio plebis as they do a successful one of resistance to a tyrant but if any one thinks these examples and cautions without a balance in the constitution will instruct people how to demean themselves and avoid licentiousness tumult and civil dissension and in all the necessary points of prudence and forbearance which ought to take place in respect of superiors till it shall evidently appear unto a people that there is a design on foot to surprise and seize their liberties he will be miserably mistaken in a simple democracy they will rise in arms a thousand times about common affairs of meum and tuum between  0  the major and minor party before any fundamental attack shall be made on the constitution second caution that in all elections of magistrates they have an especial eye upon the public in making choice of such persons only as have appeared most eminent and active in the establishment and love of freedom but suppose any of the people should love their friends better than liberty and themselves better than the public as nine tenths of the people did in the purest moments of grecian and roman liberty even when aristides appeared as a rare phenomenon in one and cincinnatus in the other in such case they will vote for their friends though royalists papists malignants or call them by what name you will in our authors right constitution many will vote for a treat many for a job some for exemption from punishment for a crime some for a monopoly and some for the promise of an office this will not be virtuous but how can you help that in the hands of those says our author who have appeared most eminent and active in the establishment of freedom may be safely placed the guardianship of liberty because such men have made the public interest and their own all one and therefore will neither betray nor desert it in prosperity or adversity this was modestly bespeaking unlimited confidence for oliver cromwell and his associates and such blind rash confidence has surrendered the liberties of all nations but it is not the language nor the maxim of liberty her universal precept should be trust not to human nature without a control the conduct of my cause to lay it down as a certain rule that if any person be admitted into power that loves not the commonwealth above all other considerations such a man is as we say every mans money any statemerchant may have him for a factor and for good consideration he will often make returns upon the public interest have a stock going in every party and with men of every opinion and if occasion serve truck with the common enemy and commonwealth both together is perhaps to rely upon a patriotism that never existed in any whole nation it is to be feared the commonwealth would suffer in most countries but admitting so exalted an opinion of the patriotism of any given country it will still remain true that there will be differences of sentiment  0  concerning the good of the commonwealth and the parties formed by these divisions if uncontrolled will have all the ill consequences that have been pointed out the more sincerely parties love the republic with so much the more ardor will they pursue their own notions of its good aristotles opinion in the first book of his politics per negligentiam mutatur status reipublicæ cum ad potestates assumuntur illi qui presentem statum non amant the form of a commonwealth is then altered by negligence when those men are taken into power who do not love the present establishment may be well founded and yet it may not follow that it is safe to trust omnipotence to those who are well affected nay even to those who really love the commonwealth above all other things and prefer her good to their own since that character may change and those virtues too may not be accompanied with so many motives and so many advantages of information in what the good of the public consists as may be had in a division and mixture of powers it is a good rule to avoid those who hate the commonwealth and those who are neutral and indifferent about it and no doubt most of the broils tumults and civil dissensions in free states have been occasioned by the ambitious treacherous and indirect practices of such persons admitted into power as have not been firm in their hearts to the interests of liberty but how shall the people know whose heart will stand the trial when so many people have been disappointed before them rome is again quoted as an example and the senate are said to have garbled perplexed and turmoiled the peoples affairs concernments and understandings but although this is true it is equally so that the people perplexed their own affairs and those of the senate too the reader who has pardoned already so many digressions will easily excuse another in this place the words virtue and patriotism might have been enumerated among those of various and uncertain signification montesquieus spirit of laws is a very useful collection of materials but is it too irreverent to say that it is an unfinished work he defines a republican government to be that in which the body or only a part of the  0  people is possessed of the supreme power this agrees with johnsons definition a state in which the government is more than one when the body of the people says montesquieu† in a republic are possessed of the supreme power this is called a democracy when the supreme power is lodged in the hands of a part of the people it is then an aristocracy and again‡ it is the nature of a republican government that either the collective body of the people or particular families should be possessed of the sovereign power in a popular state virtue is the necessary spring of government as virtue is necessary in a popular government so it is necessary also under an aristocracy true it is that in the latter it is not so absolutely requisite§ does this writer mean that honor and fear the former of which he calls the principle of monarchy and the latter of despotism cannot exist in a republic or that they are not necessary fear surely is necessary in a republican government there can be no government without hopes and fears fear then in truth is at least one principle in every kind of government in the simplest democracy as well as the simplest despotism this arrangement so exact and systematical in appearance and which has been celebrated as a discovery of the principles of all government is by no means satisfactory since virtue and honor cannot be excluded from despotisms nor fear nor virtue from monarchies nor fear nor honor from republics but at least it is apparent that in a republic constituted as we propose the three principles of fear honor and virtue unite and produce more union among the citizens and give greater energy to the laws but not to enlarge on this let us proceed to the inquiry what is virtue it is not that classical virtue which we see personified in the choice of hercules and which the ancient philosophers summed up in four words—prudence justice temperance and fortitude it is not christian virtue so much more sublime which is summarily comprehended in universal benevolence what is it then according to montesquieu∥ it should seem to be merely a negative quality the absence only of ambition  0  and avarice and he thinks that what he thus advances is confirmed by the unanimous testimony of historians but is this matter well considered look over the history of any republic and can you find a period in it in which ambition and avarice do not appear in very strong characters and in which ambitious men were not the most popular in athens pisistratus and his successors were more popular as well as ambitious than solon themistocles than aristides c in rome under the kings the eternal plots of the nobles against the lives of the kings to usurp their thrones are proofs of an ardent and unbridled ambition nay if we attentively examine the most virtuous characters we shall find unequivocal marks of an ardent ambition the elder brutus camillus regulus curius æmilius cato all discover an ambition a thirst of glory as strong as that of cæsar an honorable ambition an ambition governed by justice if you will but an ambition still but there is not a period in athenian or roman annals when great characters did not appear actuated by ambition of another kind an unjust and dishonorable ambition such as pisistratus themistocles appius claudius c and these characters were always more popular than the others and were supported chiefly by plebeians not senates and patricians if the absence of avarice is necessary to republican virtue can you find any age or country in which republican virtue has existed that single characters or a few among the patricians have existed who were exempt from avarice has been already admitted but that a moment ever existed in any country where property was enjoyed when the body of the people were universally or even generally exempted from avarice is not easy to prove every page of the history of rome appears equally marked with ambition and avarice and the only difference appears in the means and objects in some periods the nation was extremely poor in others immensely rich but the passions existed in all and the roman soldiers and common people were forever quarrelling with their most virtuous generals for refusing to indulge their avarice by distributing the spoils among them and for loving the public too well by putting the booty into the public treasury shall we say then that republican virtue is nothing but simple poverty and that poverty alone can support such a government but montesquieu tells us virtue in a republic is a love of the  0  republic virtue in a democracy is a love of the democracy and why might he not have said that virtue in a monarchy is a love of the monarchy in a despotism of the despot in a mixed government of the mixture men in general love their country and its government can it be proved that athenians loved athens or romans rome more than frenchmen love france or englishmen their island there are two principal causes of discrimination the first is the greatness or smallness of the state a citizen of a small republic who knows every man and every house in it appears generally to have the strongest attachment to it because nothing can happen in it that does not interest and affect his feelings but in a great nation like france or england a man is as it were lost in the crowd there are very few persons that he knows and few events that will much affect him yet you will find him as much attached to his circle of friends and knowledge as the inhabitant of the small state the second is the goodness or badness of the constitution the climate soil c other things being equal that constitution whose blessings are the most felt will be most beloved and accordingly we find that governments the best ordered and balanced have been most beloved as sparta athens carthage rome and england and we might add holland for there has been in practice and effect a balance of three powers in that country though not sufficiently defined by law moral and christian and political virtue cannot be too much beloved practised or rewarded but to place liberty on that foundation only would not be safe but it may be well questioned whether love of the body politic is precisely moral or christian virtue which requires justice and benevolence to enemies as well as friends and to other nations as well as our own it is not true in fact that any people ever existed who loved the public better than themselves their private friends neighbors c and therefore this kind of virtue this sort of love is as precarious a foundation for liberty as honor or fear it is the laws alone that really love the country the public the whole better than any part and that form of government which unites all the virtue honor and fear of the citizens in a reverence and obedience to the laws is the only one in which liberty can be secure and all orders and ranks and parties compelled to prefer the public good before their own that is the government for which we plead  0  the first magistrate may love himself and family and friends better than the public but the laws supported by the senate commons and judges will not permit him to indulge it the senate may love themselves their families and friends more than the public but the first magistrate commons and judges uniting in support of public law will defeat their projects the common people or their representatives may love themselves and partial connections better than the whole but the first magistrate senate and judges can support the laws against their enterprises the judges may be partial to men or factions but the three branches of the legislature united to the executive will easily bring them back to their duty in this way and in no other can our authors rule be always observed to avoid all who hate the commonwealth and those who are neutral and indifferent about it montesquieu adds a love of democracy is that of equality but what passion is this every man hates to have a superior but no man is willing to have an equal every man desires to be superior to all others if the meaning is that every citizen loves to have every other brought down to a level with himself this is so far true but is not the whole truth when every man is brought down to his level he wishes them depressed below him and no man will ever acknowledge himself to be upon a level or equality with others till they are brought down lower than him montesquieu subjoins a love of the democracy is likewise that of frugality this is another passion not easily to be found in human nature a passion for frugality perhaps never existed in a nation if it ever did in an individual it is a virtue but reason and reflection prove the necessity and utility of this virtue and after all it is admired and esteemed more than beloved but to prove that nations as bodies are never actuated by any such passion for frugality it is sufficient to observe that no nation ever practised it but from necessity poor nations only are frugal rich ones always profuse excepting only some few instances when the passion of avarice has been artfully cultivated and has become the habitual national character but the passion of avarice is not a love of frugality   0 is there or is there not any solid foundation for these doubts must we bow with reverence to this great master of laws or may we venture to suspect that these doctrines of his are spun from his imagination before he delivered so many grave lessons upon democracies he would have done well to have shown when or where such a government existed until some one shall attempt this one may venture to suspect his love of equality love of frugality and love of the democracy to be fantastical passions feigned for the regulation and animation of a government that never had a more solid existence than the flying island of lagado suppose we should venture to advance the following propositions for further examination and reflection—   no democracy ever did or can exist   if however it were admitted for argument sake that a democracy ever did or can exist no such passion as a love of democracy stronger than selflove or superior to the love of private interest ever did or ever can prevail in the minds of the citizens in general or of a majority of them or in any party or individual of them   that if the citizens or a majority of them or any party or individual of them in action and practice preferred the public to their private interest as many undoubtedly would it would not be from any such passion as love of the democracy but from reason conscience a regard to justice and a sense of duty and moral obligation or else from a desire of fame and the applause gratitude and rewards of the public   that no love of equality at least since adams fall ever existed in human nature any otherwise than as a desire of bringing others down to our own level which implies a desire of raising ourselves above them or depressing them below us that the real friends of equality are such from reflection judgment and a sense of duty not from any passion natural or artificial   that no love of frugality ever existed as a passion but always as a virtue approved by deep and long reflection as useful to individuals as well as the democracy   that therefore the democracy of montesquieu and its principle of virtue equality frugality c according to his definitions of them are all mere figments of the brain and delusive imaginations       that his passion of love of the democracy would be in the members of the majority only a love of the majority in those of the minority only a love of the minority   that his love of equality would not even be pretended towards the members of the minority but the semblance of it would only be kept up among the members of the majority   that the distinction between nature and philosophy is not enough attended to that nations are actuated by their passions and prejudices that very few in any nation are enlightened by philosophy or religion enough to be at all times convinced that it is a duty to prefer the public to a private interest and fewer still are moral honorable or religious enough to practise such selfdenial  0 is not every one of these propositions proved beyond dispute by all the histories in this and the preceding volumes by all the other histories of the world and by universal experience    that in reality the word democracy signifies nothing more nor less than a nation of people without any government at all and before any constitution is instituted    that every attentive reader may perceive that the notions of montesquieu concerning a democracy are imaginations of his own derived from the contemplation of the reveries of xenophan and plato concerning equality of goods and community of wives and children in their delirious ideas of a perfect commonwealth    that such reveries may well be called delirious since besides all the other arguments against them they would not extinguish the family spirit or produce the equality proposed because in such a state of things one man would have twenty wives while another would have none and one woman twenty lovers while others would languish in obscurity solitude and celibacy third caution a third caution is that in all their elections of any into the supreme court or councils they be not led by any bent of faction alliance or affection and that none be taken in but purely upon the account of merit this is the rule of virtue wisdom and justice and if all the people were wise and just they would follow it but how shall we make them so when the law of god in nature and in revelation     has not yet effected it harrington thinks that advising men to be mannerly at the public table will not prevent some from carving for themselves the best parts and more than their shares putting men in authority who have a clear reputation of transcendent honesty and wisdom tends no doubt to silence gainsayers and draw the consent and approbation of all the world but how shall we prevent some from getting in who are transcendent only in craft hypocrisy knavery or folly the best way that can be conceived of surely is to separate the executive power from the legislative make it responsible to one part of the legislature on the impeachment of another for the use of its power of appointment to offices and to appoint two assemblies in the legislature that the errors of one may be corrected by the other fourth caution to avoid false charges accusations and calumniations against persons in authority which are the greatest abuses and blemishes of liberty and have been the most frequent causes of tumult and dissension though it is the secret of liberty that all magistrates and public officers be kept in an accountable state liable to render an account of their behavior and actions and that the people have freedom to accuse whom they please difficult as it is to reconcile these necessary rules in a free government where an independent grand jury protects the reputation of the innocent and where a senate judges of the accusations of the commons how can it be done in a simple democracy where a powerful majority in a torrent of popularity influences the appointment of grand and petit juries as well as the opinion of the judges and where a triumphant party in the legislature is both accuser and judge is there not danger that an accuser belonging to the minor party will be punished for calumniation though his complaint is just and that an accused of the minor party will be found guilty though innocent and an accused of the major party acquitted though guilty it is ridiculous to hope that magistrates and public officers will be really responsible in such a government or that calumniations will be discountenanced except on one side of the house the ostracisms and petalisms of antiquity however well intended against suspected men were soon perverted by party and turned against the best men and the least suspicious and in the same     manner it is obvious that responsibility and calumniation in a simple democracy will be mere instruments in the hands of the majority to be employed against the best men of an opposite party and to screen the worst in their own the romans by their caution to retain in full force and virtue that decree of the senate called turpilianum whereby a severe fine was set on the heads of all calumniators and false accusers at the same time that they retained the freedom of keeping all persons accountable and accusing whom they pleased although they preserved their state a long time from usurpation of men in power on one side and from popular clamor and tumult on the other side we must remember had a senate to check the people as well as to be checked by them and yet even this mixture did not prevent the gracchi marius sylla and cæsar from usurping nor the people from being tumultuous as soon as they obtained even an equality with the senate so that their example cannot convince us that either of these rules can be observed in a simple democracy on the contrary it is a proof that the more perfect the balance of power the more exactly both these necessary rules may be observed fifth caution a fifth caution is that as by all means they should beware of ingratitude and unhandsome returns to such as have done eminent services for the commonwealth so it concerns them for the public peace and security not to impose a trust in the hands of any person or persons further than as they may take it back again at pleasure the reason is honores mutant mores accessions and continuations of power expose the mind to temptations they are sails too big for any bulk of mortality to steer an even course by how is this consistent with what is said under the head of the second caution in the hands of such as have appeared most eminent and active in the establishment and love of liberty the guardianship of liberty may be safely placed because such men have made the public interest and their own all one and therefore will never betray nor desert it in prosperity or adversity in short our author inculcates a confidence and diffidence at the same time that seem irreconcilable under this head he is diffident the kingdoms of the world are baits that seldom fail none     but he that was more than man could have refused them how many free states by trusting their own servants too far have been forced to receive them for their masters immoderate power lets in high thoughts the spirit of ambition is a spirit of giddiness it foxes men makes them drunk mere sots non compos mentis hurried on without fear or wit all temptations and opportunities of ambition must be removed or there will arise a necessity of tumult and civil dissension the common consequence whereof hath ever been a ruin of the public freedom how is it possible for a man who thinks in this manner to propose his right constitution where the whole authority being in one representative assembly the utmost latitude temptation and opportunity are given to private ambition what has a rich and ambitious man to do but stand candidate for an election in a town where he has many relations much property numerous dependents there can be no difficulty in getting chosen when once in he has a vote in the disposal of every office the appointment of every judge and the distribution of all the public money may not he and others join together to vote for such as will vote for them a man once in has twice as much power to get in again at the next election and every day adds accessions accumulations and continuations of power to him cæsar who first took arms upon the public score and became the peoples leader letting in ambitious thoughts soon shook hands with his first friends and principles and became another man and turned his arms on the public liberty and has not every nation and city and assembly many cæsars in it when private men look to the people for public offices and commands that is when the people claim the executive power they will at first be courted then deceived and then betrayed thus did sylla serve the senate and marius the people thus every simple government is served but where the executive appoints and the legislative pay it is otherwise where one branch of a legislative can accuse and another condemn where both branches of the legislature can accuse before the executive private commanders must always have a care they may be disarmed in an instant pisistratus agathocles cosmo soderini savonarola castruccio and orange all quoted by our author are all examples in point to show that simple democracies     and unbalanced mixtures can never take a trust back again when once committed to an ambitious commander that this caution therefore may be observed and trust taken back at pleasure when ill managed or in danger of being so no government is equal to the tripartite composition ninth rule the ninth rule is that it be made an unpardonable crime to incur the guilt of treason against the interest and majesty of the people it was treason in brutuss sons to conspire the restoration of tarquin so their father judged it but it was the interest and majesty of the senate here that was held to be the interest and majesty of the people the treason of mælius and manlius too was against the majesty of the senate and in favor of the majesty of the people the treason of the decemviri too was against the senate and so was that of cæsar in venice too it is treason to think of conspiring with the people against the aristocracy as much as it was in rome it is treason to betray secrets both in venice and in rome the guilty were hanged upon a gibbet or burnt alive no doubt a simple democracy would make it treason to introduce an aristocracy or a monarchy but how could they punish it when the man who commits it has the army the judges the bishops and a majority of the assembly and people too at his devotion how can secrecy in a simple democracy be kept where the numbers are so great and where constituents can call to account or how can it be punished when betrayed when so many will betray it when a member of the majority betrays it to serve the cause of the majority it is treason in venice for a senator to receive gifts or pensions from a foreign prince or state but as according to the heathen proverb the gods themselves may be taken with gifts how can you prevent them from being taken by the majority in a simple democracy thuanus who says the king of france needs not use much labor to purchase an interest with any prince or state in italy unless it be the venetian republic where all foreign pensioners and compliances are punished with utmost severity but escape well enough in other places might have added that no difficulty would ever be found to purchase an interest in a simple democracy or in any other simple uncontrolled assembly in a simple democracy no great sum would     would be required to purchase elections for proper instruments or to purchase the suffrages of some already in their seats a party pardons many crimes as well as lesser faults it is treason for any venetian senator to have any private conference with foreign ambassadors and agents and one article of the charge which took off barnevelts head was for that he held familiarity and converse with the spanish ambassador in time of war although receiving bribes from foreign ambassadors ought to be punished with the utmost severity and all uncommon familiarity with them avoided as suspicious and dishonorable such extremes as these of venice and of holland in the case of barnevelt may as well be avoided but in a simple democracy it will be found next to impossible to prevent foreign powers from making a party and purchasing an interest an ambassador will have a right to treat with all the members as parts of the sovereignty and therefore may have access to those who are least on their guard and most easily corrupted but in a mixed government where the executive is by itself the ministers only can be purchased who being few are more easily watched and punished besides that it is the executive power only that is managed by ministers and this often cannot be completed but by concurrence of the legislature the difficulties of corrupting such a government therefore are much greater as both the legislative executive and judicial power must be all infected or there will be danger of detection and punishment     chapter fourth conclusion it should have been before observed that the western empire fell in the fifth century and the eastern in the fifteenth augustulus was compelled by odoacer king of the heruli in     to abdicate the western empire and was the last roman who possessed the imperial dignity at rome the dominion of italy fell soon afterwards into the hands of theodoric the goth the eastern empire lasted many centuries afterwards till it was annihilated by mahomet the great and constantinople was taken in the year      the interval between the fall of these two empires making a period of about a thousand years is called the middle age during this term republics without number arose in italy whirled upon their axles or single centres foamed raged and burst like so many waterspouts upon the ocean they were all alike ill constituted all alike miserable and all ended in similar disgrace and despotism it would be curious to pursue our subject through all of them whose records have survived the ravages of goths saracens and bigoted christians through those other republics of castile arragon catalonia galicia and all the others in spain through those in portugal through the several provinces that now compose the kingdom of france through those in germany sweden denmark holland england scotland ireland c but if such a work should be sufficiently encouraged by the public which is not probable for mankind in general dare not as yet read or think upon constitutions it is too extensive for my forces and ought not to be done in so much haste the preceding has been produced upon the spur of a particular occasion which made it necessary to write and publish with precipitation or it might have been useless to have published at all the whole has been done in the midst of other occupations     in so much hurry that scarce a moment could be spared to correct the style adjust the method pare off excrescences or even obliterate repetitions in all which respects it stands in need of an apology the investigation may be pursued to any length all nations from the beginning have been agitated by the same passions the principles developed here will go a great way in explaining every phenomenon that occurs in the history of government the vegetable and animal kingdoms and those heavenly bodies whose existence and movements we are as yet only permitted faintly to perceive do not appear to be governed by laws more uniform or certain than those which regulate the moral and political world nations move by unalterable rules and education discipline and laws make the greatest difference in their accomplishments happiness and perfection it is the master artist alone who finishes his building his picture or his clock the present actors on the stage have been too little prepared by their early views and too much occupied with turbulent scenes to do more than they have done impartial justice will confess that it is astonishing they have been able to do so much it is for the young to make themselves masters of what their predecessors have been able to comprehend and accomplish but imperfectly a prospect into futurity in america is like contemplating the heavens through the telescopes of herschell objects stupendous in their magnitudes and motions strike us from all quarters and fill us with amazement when we recollect that the wisdom or the folly the virtue or the vice the liberty or servitude of those millions now beheld by us only as columbus saw these times in vision are certainly to be influenced perhaps decided by the manners examples principles and political institutions of the present generation that mind must be hardened into stone that is not melted into reverence and awe with such affecting scenes before his eyes is there can there be a young american indolent and incurious surrendered up to dissipation and frivolity vain of imitating the loosest manners of countries which can never be made much better or much worse a profligate american youth must be profligate indeed and richly merits the scorn of all mankind     the world has been too long abused with notions that climate and soil decide the characters and political institutions of nations the laws of solon and the despotism of mahomet have at different times prevailed at athens consuls emperors and pontiffs have ruled at rome can there be desired a stronger proof that policy and education are able to triumph over every disadvantage of climate mankind have been still more injured by insinuations that a certain celestial virtue more than human has been necessary to preserve liberty happiness whether in despotism or democracy whether in slavery or liberty can never be found without virtue the best republics will be virtuous and have been so but we may hazard a conjecture that the virtues have been the effect of the well ordered constitution rather than the cause and perhaps it would be impossible to prove that a republic cannot exist even among highwaymen by setting one rogue to watch another and the knaves themselves may in time be made honest men by the struggle it is now in our power to bring this work to a conclusion with unexpected dignity in the course of the last summer two authorities have appeared greater than any that have been before quoted in which the principles we have attempted to defend have been acknowledged the first is an ordinance of congress of the thirteenth of july      for the government of the territory of the united states northwest of the river ohio the second is the report of the convention at philadelphia of the seventeenth of september      the former confederation of the united states was formed upon the model and example of all the confederacies ancient and modern in which the federal council was only a diplomatic body even the lycian which is thought to have been the best was no more the magnitude of territory the population the wealth and commerce and especially the rapid growth of the united states have shown such a government to be inadequate to their wants and the new system which seems admirably calculated to unite their interests and affections and bring them to an uniformity of principles and sentiments is equally well combined to unite their wills and forces as a single nation a result of accommodation cannot be supposed to reach the ideas of perfection of any one but the conception of such an idea and the   0 deliberate union of so great and various a people in such a plan is without all partiality or prejudice if not the greatest exertion of human understanding the greatest single effort of national deliberation that the world has ever seen that it may be improved is not to be doubted and provision is made for that purpose in the report itself a people who could conceive and can adopt it we need

  mr adams returned to the united states in      just as the organization of government under the new constitution of the united states was taking place he became the first vicepresident having received more votes than any one excepting washington under the original provision of that instrument which made no distinction in the votes given to the candidates for the two highest offices and presided in the senate throughout the critical period of the adoption of all the organic laws necessary for the execution of the new system it was during the first year of this service that he undertook to write the following series of papers in the gazette of the united states at philadelphia as a sequel to his volumes of the defence they were stimulated mainly by the manifest tendencies of the revolution in france but mediately by the publication of the marquis condorcet entitled quatre lettres dun bourgeois de new haven sur lunité de la législation being a defence of the position formerly taken by m turgot they furnished however to the partisans of the day so much material for immediate political use in the contest just then beginning that the author deemed it best to desist and they were left incomplete fifteen years afterwards when mr adams was withdrawn from political life the papers were collected in boston and published by russell and cutler in one volume with the following preface not from his hand the motto however was furnished by him a copy of this edition remains in the authors library given by him to the town of quincy and in it are a considerable number of marginal notes made as late as the year        in his handwriting such of them as are in any way interesting are inserted in the present work     preface since the publication of these discourses in    0 our observations abroad and experience at home have sufficiently taught us the lessons they were intended to inculcate and the evils they were designed to prevent have borne testimony of their truth it is unnecessary to mention the rank or reputation of the supposed author to give celebrity to the work the discourses are allowed by the best judges to form a complete essay on associated man in which practical improvement is drawn from profound investigation his principles of action as an individual traced to their effects in his relative capacity and from the light of history and a thorough knowledge of his nature his past disasters are made subservient to his present and future happiness the maxims inculcated in these discourses are calculated to secure virtue by laying a restraint upon vice to give vigor and durability to the tree of liberty by pruning its excrescences and to guard it against the tempest of faction by the protection of a firm and wellbalanced government a work combining so much excellence on a subject of such dignity and importance cannot be too much appreciated      conceiving it to be both useful and honorable to their country the editors are desirous of preserving it from the inevitable wreck of a newspaper publication and believing the work will not fail of being approved by their fellowcitizens they now transmit it to the public in a more durable form without the aid of subscription or private patronage two factions drunk with enthusiasm and headed by men of the most desperate ambition desolated france remarks on the history of england boston march   0      discourses on davila  this dull heavy volume still excites the wonder of its author—first that he could find amidst the constant scenes of business and dissipation in which he was enveloped time to write it secondly that he had the courage to oppose and publish his own opinions to the universal opinion of america and indeed of all mankind not one man in america then believed him he knew not one and has not heard of one since who then believed him the work however powerfully operated to destroy his popularity it was urged as full proof that he was an advocate for monarchy and laboring to introduce a hereditary president in america j a      i felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum the french nation known in antiquity under the appellation of the franks were originally from the heart of germany in the declension of the roman empire they inhabited a country in the north along the river rhine situated between bavaria and saxony which still preserves the name of franconia having     excessively multiplied as it happens in cold climates their country was found not sufficiently extensive to contain them nor fertile enough to nourish them excited by the example of their neighbors they resolved by a common voice to divide themselves into two nations one of which should continue to inhabit their ancient country and the other endeavor to procure elsewhere by the force of arms an establishment more vast more commodious and more fertile this enterprise was resolved upon and this division made by unanimous consent such as were destined by lot to essay their fortune although trained to war and incapable of terror at the apprehension of the dangers of such an enterprise thought however that they ought not to abandon it to anarchy or hazard but to conduct it with prudence and order to concert the measures necessary for the execution of their project they assembled in the plains in the neighborhood of the river sala accustomed for many ages to live in the obedience of a prince and thinking the monarchical state the most convenient to a people who aspire to augment their power and extend their conquests they resolved to choose a king who should unite in his single person all the authority of the nation here perhaps davila is incautious and incorrect for the franks as well as saxons and other german nations though their governments were monarchical had their grandees and people who met and deliberated in national assemblies whose results were often to say the least considered as laws their great misfortune was that while it never was sufficiently ascertained whether the sovereignty resided in the king or in the national assembly it was equally uncertain whether the king had a negative on the assembly whether the grandees had a negative on the king or the people and whether the people had a negative on both or either this uncertainty will appear hereafter in davila himself to mark its course in bloody characters and the whole history of france will show that from the first migration of the franks from germany to this hour it has never been sufficiently explained and decided to this supreme degree of power in the king as davila proceeds they added that the crown should be hereditary in the family elected foreseeing that if it were elective it would be     a source of civil wars which would prove destructive to all their enterprises mankind in new establishments generally act with sincerity and with a single view to the public good they listen neither to the ambition nor the interest of private persons pharamond was elected king by unanimous consent he was a son of marcomir issue of the blood which had governed the nation for many ages and to an experienced valor united a profound wisdom in the art of government it was agreed that the same title and equal power should descend to his legitimate posterity of the male line in default of which the nation should return to their right of electing a new sovereign but as unlimited authority may easily degenerate into tyranny the franks at the time of the election of their king demanded the establishment of certain perpetual and irrevocable laws which should regulate the order of succession to the throne and prescribe in a few words the form of government these laws proposed by their priests whom they named saliens and instituted in the fields which take their name from the river sala were originally called salique laws and have been considered from the establishment of the monarchy as the primitive regulations and fundamental constitutions of the kingdom† leaving their country to the old prince marcomir and passing the rhine under the command of pharamond the franks marched to the conquest of the gauls about the four hundred and nineteenth year of the christian era the roman legions united with the gaulish troops resisted pharamond till his death the sceptre was left to his son clodion an intrepid prince in the flower of his age who in several battles defeated the nations of the country dissipated the roman armies and established himself in belgic gaul meroveus who succeeded him made a rapid progress penetrated into celtic gaul and extended his empire to the gates of paris judging that he had conquered country enough to contain his subjects and form a state of reasonable extent he limited the course of his exploits   0 and turned all his cares to peace after having united under the same laws and the same name the conquerors and the vanquished whom he governed peaceably he died leaving the franks solidly established in gaul such is the origin of the french monarchy and such are her fundamental laws by the dispositions of the same laws the work of the nation are regulated the rights and prerogatives of the princes of the blood as each of them in default of direct heirs may according to his rank be called to the crown their interests are necessarily connected with those of the state the people regard these privileges as inviolable neither length of time nor distance of degree has ever done them any injury all these princes preserve the rank which nature has allotted them to succeed to the throne they have indeed in the course of time taken different names such as those of valois of bourbon of orléans of angoulême of vendôme of alençon of montpensier but they have not by these means lost the rights attached to the royal consanguinity and that especially of succeeding to the crown these different branches have from time to time asserted the preeminence due to their blood to interest them the more forcibly in the preservation of a crown to which in succession they may all be called it has been commonly made a rule in case of the minority or absence of the lawful king to choose for the tutors or regents of the kingdom the princes who were nearest related it would not indeed be natural to intrust the administration to the hands of strangers who might destroy or at least dismember so beautiful a state whereas princes born of the same blood ought for that reason to watch over the conservation of an inheritance which belongs to them in some sort this right is not simply founded upon usage the states general of the kingdom in whom resides the entire power of the whole nation whom they represent have frequently confirmed it here again we meet with another inaccuracy if not a contradiction in davila or rather with another proof of that confusion of law and that uncertainty of the sovereignty which for fifteen hundred years has been to france the fatal source of so many calamities† here the sovereignty or whole power of the nation     is asserted to be in the states general whereas only three pages before he had asserted that the whole authority of the nation was united in the king these two prerogatives of succeeding to the throne when a king dies without masculine posterity and of governing the kingdom during the absence or minority of the legitimate sovereign have at all times procured to the princes of the blood a great authority among the people and the best part in the government they have applied themselves accordingly with remarkable vigilance to the administration of an empire which they regarded with justice as their patrimony and the people judging that they might have them one day for their first magistrates have always shown them the more respect as they have more than once known the younger branches to ascend the throne in default of the elder thus the crown has passed from the merovingians to the carlovingians and finally to the capetians but always from male to male in the princes of the blood of these three races from the last of these descended the king louis ix whom the innocence of his life and the integrity of his manners have placed in the number of the saints he left two sons philip iii surnamed the hardy and robert earl of clermont philip continued the elder branch which reigned more than three hundred years and took the surname of valois from robert is descended the younger branch or the house of bourbon so called from the province in which it possessed its settlement this house respectable not only by birth which placed it near the throne but also by the extent of its lands and riches by the valor and number of its princes almost all distinguished by their merit and a singular affability arrived soon at a high degree of power this elevation joined to the favor of the people excited against the bourbons the jealousy and envy of the kings whom this great credit and distinguished splendor displeased and alarmed every day brought fresh occasions of hatred suspicion and distrust which several times broke out in arms thus in the war for the public good john duke of bourbon declared himself against louis xi and louis xii before his accession to the throne was at war with peter of bourbon the jealousies which these princes inspired into kings exposed them sometimes to secret vexations and sometimes to declared enmities     we may add to this reflection of davila that it is extremely probable that these princes by frequently betraying symptoms of ambition aspiring at the throne might give to kings just grounds of jealousy and alarm before we proceed in our discourses on davila it will assist us in comprehending his narration as well as in making many useful reflections in morals and policy to turn our thoughts for a few moments to the constitution of the human mind this we shall endeavor to do in our next essay ii cest là le propre de lesprit humain que les exemples ne corrigent personne les sottises des pères sont perdues pour leurs enfans il faut que chaque génération fasse les siennes† men in their primitive conditions however savage were undoubtedly gregarious and they continue to be social not only in every stage of civilization but in every possible situation in which they can be placed as nature intended them for society she has furnished them with passions appetites and propensities as well as a variety of faculties calculated both for their individual enjoyment and to render them useful to each other in their social connections there is none among them more essential or remarkable than the passion for distinction a desire to be observed considered esteemed praised beloved and admired by his fellows is one of the earliest as well as keenest dispositions discovered in the heart of man if any one should doubt the existence of this propensity let him go and attentively observe the journeymen and apprentices in the first workshop or the oarsmen in a cockboat a family or a neighborhood the inhabitants of a house or the crew of a ship a school or a college a city or a village a savage or civilized people a hospital or a church the bar or the exchange a camp or a court wherever men women or children are to be found whether they be old or young rich or poor high or low wise or foolish ignorant or learned every individual is seen to be strongly actuated     by a desire to be seen heard talked of approved and respected by the people about him and within his knowledge moral writers

flatters on our tombs a regard to the sentiments of mankind concerning him and to their dispositions towards him every man feels within himself and if he has reflected and tried experiments he has found that no exertion of his reason no effort of his will can wholly divest him of it in proportion to our affection for the notice of others is our aversion to their neglect the stronger the desire of the esteem of the public the more powerful the aversion to their disapprobation the more exalted the wish for admiration the more invincible the abhorrence of contempt every man not only desires the consideration of others but he frequently compares himself with others his friends or his enemies and in proportion as he exults when he perceives that he has more of it than they he feels a keener affliction when he sees that one or more of them are more respected than himself this passion while it is simply a desire to excel another by fair industry in the search of truth and the practice of virtue is properly called emulation when it aims at power as a means of distinction it is ambition when it is in a situation to suggest the sentiments of fear and apprehension that another who is now inferior will become superior it is denominated jealousy when it is in a state of mortification at the superiority of another and desires to bring him down to our level or to depress him below us it is properly called envy when it deceives a man into a belief of false professions of esteem or admiration or into a false opinion of his importance in the     judgment of the world it is vanity these observations alone would be sufficient to show that this propensity in all its branches is a principal source of the virtues and vices the happiness and misery of human life and that the history of mankind is little more than a simple narration of its operation and effects there is in human nature it is true simple benevolence or an affection for the good of others but alone it is not a balance for the selfish affections nature then has kindly added to benevolence the desire of reputation in order to make us good members of society spectemur agendo expresses the great principle of activity for the good of others nature has sanctioned the law of selfpreservation by rewards and punishments the rewards of selfish activity are life and health the punishments of negligence and indolence are want disease and death each individual it is true should consider that nature has enjoined the same law on his neighbor and therefore a respect for the authority of nature would oblige him to respect the rights of others as much as his own but reasoning as abstruse though as simple as this would not occur to all men the same nature therefore has imposed another law that of promoting the good as well as respecting the rights of mankind and has sanctioned it by other rewards and punishments the rewards in this case in this life are esteem and admiration of others the punishments are neglect and contempt nor may any one imagine that these are not as real as the others the desire of the esteem of others is as real a want of nature as hunger and the neglect and contempt of the world as severe a pain as the gout or stone it sooner and oftener produces despair and a detestation of existence of equal importance to individuals to families and to nations it is a principal end of government to regulate this passion which in its turn becomes a principal means of government it is the only adequate instrument of order and subordination in society and alone commands effectual obedience to laws since without it neither human reason nor standing armies would ever produce that great effect every personal quality and every blessing of fortune is cherished in proportion to its capacity of gratifying this universal affection for the esteem the sympathy admiration and congratulations of the public beauty in the face elegance of figure     grace of attitude and motion riches honors every thing is weighed in the scale and desired not so much for the pleasure they afford as the attention they command as this is a point of great importance it may be pardonable to expatiate a little upon these particulars why are the personal accomplishments of beauty elegance and grace held in such high estimation by mankind is it merely for the pleasure which is received from the sight of these attributes by no means the taste for such delicacies is not universal in those who feel the most lively sense of them it is but a slight sensation and of shortest continuance but those attractions command the notice and attention of the public they draw the eyes of spectators this is the charm that makes them irresistible is it for such fading perfections that a husband or a wife is chosen alas it is well known that a very short familiarity totally destroys all sense and attention to such properties and on the contrary a very little time and habit destroy all the aversion to ugliness and deformity when unattended with disease or ill temper yet beauty and address are courted and admired very often more than discretion wit sense and many other accomplishments and virtues of infinitely more importance to the happiness of private life as well as to the utility and ornament of society is it for the momentous purpose of dancing and drawing painting and music riding or fencing that men or women are destined in this life or any other yet those who have the best means of education bestow more attention and expense on those than on more solid acquisitions why because they attract more forcibly the attention of the world and procure a better advancement in life notwithstanding all this as soon as an establishment in life is made they are found to have answered their end are neglected and laid aside is there any thing in birth however illustrious or splendid which should make a difference between one man and another if from a common ancestor the whole human race is descended they are all of the same family how then can they distinguish families into the more or the less ancient what advantage is there in an illustration of an hundred or a thousand years of what avail are all these histories pedigrees traditions what foundation has the whole science of genealogy     and heraldry are there differences in the breeds of men as there are in those of horses if there are not these sciences have no foundation in reason in prejudice they have a very solid one all that philosophy can say is that there is a general presumption that a man has had some advantages of education if he is of a family of note but this advantage must be derived from his father and mother chiefly if not wholly of what importance is it then in this view whether the family is twenty generations upon record or only two the mighty secret lies in this—an illustrious descent attracts the notice of mankind a single drop of royal blood however illegitimately scattered will make any man or woman proud or vain why because although it excites the indignation of many and the envy of more it still attracts the attention of the world noble blood whether the nobility be hereditary or elective and indeed more in republican governments than in monarchies least of all in despotisms is held in estimation for the same reason it is a name and a race that a nation has been interested in and is in the habit of respecting benevolence sympathy congratulation have been so long associated to those names in the minds of the people that they are become national habits national gratitude descends from the father to the son and is often stronger to the latter than the former it is often excited by remorse upon reflection on the ingratitude and injustice with which the former has been treated when the names of a certain family are read in all the gazettes chronicles records and histories of a country for five hundred years they become known respected and delighted in by every body a youth a child of this extraction and bearing this name attracts the eyes and ears of all companies long before it is known or inquired whether he be a wise man or a fool his name is often a greater distinction than a title a star or a garter this it is which makes so many men proud and so many others envious of illustrious descent the pride is as irrational and contemptible as the pride of riches and no more a wise man will lament that any other distinction than that of merit should be made a good man will neither be proud nor vain of his birth but will earnestly improve every advantage he has for the public good a cunning man will carefully conceal his pride but will indulge it in secret the more effectually and improve his advantage to     greater profit but was any man ever known so wise or so good as really to despise birth or wealth did you ever read of a man rising to public notice from obscure beginnings who was not reflected on although with every liberal mind it is an honor and a proof of merit yet it is a disgrace with mankind in general what a load of sordid obloquy and envy has every such man to carry the contempt that is thrown upon obscurity of ancestry augments the eagerness for the stupid adoration that is paid to its illustration this desire of the consideration of our fellowmen and their congratulations in our joys is not less invincible than the desire of their sympathy in our sorrows it is a determination of our nature that lies at the foundation of our whole moral system in this world and may be connected essentially with our destination in a future state iii o fureur de se distinguer que ne pouvez vous point voltaire why do men pursue riches what is the end of avarice the labor and anxiety the enterprises and adventures that are voluntarily undertaken in pursuit of gain are out of all proportion to the utility convenience or pleasure of riches a competence to satisfy the wants of nature food and clothes a shelter from the seasons and the comforts of a family may be had for very little the daily toil of the million and of millions of millions is adequate to a complete supply of these necessities and conveniences with such accommodations thus obtained the appetite is keener the digestion more easy and perfect and repose is more refreshing than among the most abundant superfluities and the rarest luxuries for what reason then are any mortals averse to the situation of the farmer mechanic or laborer why do we tempt the seas and encompass the globe why do any men affront heaven and earth to accumulate wealth which will forever be useless to them why do we make an ostentatious display of riches why should any man be proud of his purse houses lands or gardens or in better words why should the rich man glory in     his riches what connection can there be between wealth and pride the answer to all these questions is because riches attract the attention consideration and congratulations of mankind it is not because the rich have really more of ease or pleasure than the poor riches force the opinion on a man that he is the object of the congratulations of others and he feels that they attract the complaisance of the public his senses all inform him that his neighbors have a natural disposition to harmonize with all those pleasing emotions and agreeable sensations which the elegant accommodations around him are supposed to excite his imagination expands and his heart dilates at these charming illusions his attachment to his possessions increases as fast as his desire to accumulate more not for the purposes of beneficence or utility but from the desire of illustration why on the other hand should any man be ashamed to make known his poverty why should those who have been rich or educated in the houses of the rich entertain such an aversion or be agitated with such terror at the prospect of losing their property or of being reduced to live at a humbler table in a meaner house to walk instead of riding or to ride without their accustomed equipage or retinue why do we hear of madness melancholy and suicides upon bankruptcy loss of ships or any other sudden fall from opulence to indigence or mediocrity ask your reason what disgrace there can be in poverty what moral sentiment of approbation praise or honor can there be in a palace what dishonor in a cottage what glory in a coach what shame in a wagon is not the sense of propriety and sense of merit as much connected with an empty purse as a full one may not a man be as estimable amiable and respectable attended by his faithful dog as if preceded and followed by a train of horses and servants all these questions may be very wise and the stoical philosophy has her answers ready but if you ask the same questions of nature experience and mankind the answers will be directly opposite to those of epictetus namely—that there is more respectability in the eyes of the greater part of mankind in the gaudy trappings of wealth than there is in genius or learning wisdom or virtue     the poor mans conscience is clear yet he is ashamed his character is irreproachable yet he is neglected and despised he feels himself out of the sight of others groping in the dark mankind take no notice of him he rambles and wanders unheeded in the midst of a crowd at church in the market at a play at an execution or coronation he is in as much obscurity as he would be in a garret or a cellar he is not disapproved censured or reproached he is only not seen this total inattention is to him mortifying painful and cruel he suffers a misery from this consideration which is sharpened by the consciousness that others have no fellowfeeling with him in this distress if you follow these persons however into their scenes of life you will find that there is a kind of figure which the meanest of them all endeavors to make a kind of little grandeur and respect which the most insignificant study and labor to procure in the small circle of their acquaintances not only the poorest mechanic but the man who lives upon common charity nay the common beggars in the streets and not only those who may be all innocent but even those who have abandoned themselves to common infamy as pirates highwaymen and common thieves court a set of admirers and plume themselves upon that superiority which they have or fancy they have over some others there must be one indeed who is the last and lowest of the human species but there is no risk in asserting that there is no one who believes and will acknowledge himself to be the man to be wholly overlooked and to know it are intolerable instances of this are not uncommon when a wretch could no longer attract the notice of a man woman or child he must be respectable in the eyes of his dog who will love me then was the pathetic reply of one who starved himself to feed his mastiff to a charitable passenger who advised him to kill or sell the animal in this who will love me then there is a key to the human heart to the history of human life and manners and to the rise and fall of empires to feel ourselves unheeded chills the most pleasing hope damps the most fond desire checks the most agreeable wish disappoints the most ardent expectations of human nature is there in science and letters a reward for the labor they require scholars learn the dead languages of antiquity as well as the living tongues of modern nations those of the east   0 as well as the west they puzzle themselves and others with metaphysics and mathematics they renounce their pleasures neglect their exercises and destroy their health for what is curiosity so strong is the pleasure that accompanies the pursuit and acquisition of knowledge so exquisite if crusoe on his island had the library of alexandria and a certainty that he should never again see the face of man would he ever open a volume perhaps he might but it is very probable he would read but little a sense of duty a love of truth a desire to alleviate the anxieties of ignorance may no doubt have an influence on some minds but the universal object and idol of men of letters is reputation it is the notoriety the celebration which constitutes the charm that is to compensate the loss of appetite and sleep and sometimes of riches and honors the same ardent desire of the congratulations of others in our joys is the great incentive to the pursuit of honors this might be exemplified in the career of civil and political life that we may not be too tedious let us instance in military glory is it to be supposed that the regular standing armies of europe engage in the service from pure motives of patriotism are their officers men of contemplation and devotion who expect their reward in a future life is it from a sense of moral or religious duty that they risk their lives and reconcile themselves to wounds instances of all these kinds may be found but if any one supposes that all or the greater part of these heroes are actuated by such principles he will only prove that he is unacquainted with them can their pay be considered as an adequate encouragement this which is no more than a very simple and moderate subsistence would never be a temptation to renounce the chances of fortune in other pursuits together with the pleasures of domestic life and submit to this most difficult and dangerous employment no it is the consideration and the chances of laurels which they acquire by the service the soldier compares himself with his fellows and contends for promotion to be a corporal the corporals vie with each other to be sergeants the sergeants will mount breaches to be ensigns and thus every man in an army is constantly aspiring to be something higher as every citizen in the commonwealth is constantly struggling for a better rank that he may draw the observation of more eyes     iv such bribes the rapid greek oer asia hurled for such the steady romans shook the world in a city or a village little employments and trifling distinctions are contended for with equal eagerness as honors and offices in commonwealths and kingdoms what is it that bewitches mankind to marks and signs a ribbon a garter a star a golden key a marshals staff or a white hickory stick though there is in such frivolities as these neither profit nor pleasure nor any thing amiable estimable or respectable yet experience teaches us in every country of the world they attract the attention of mankind more than parts or learning virtue or religion they are therefore sought with ardor very often by men possessed in the most eminent degree of all the more solid advantages of birth and fortune merit and services with the best faculties of the head and the most engaging recommendations of the heart fame has been divided into three species glory which attends the great actions of lawgivers and heroes and the management of the great commands and first offices of state reputation which is cherished by every gentleman and credit which is supported by merchants and tradesmen but even this division is incomplete because the desire and the object of it though it may be considered in various lights and under different modifications is not confined to gentlemen nor merchants but is common to every human being there are no men who are not ambitious of distinguishing themselves and growing considerable among those with whom they converse this ambition is natural to the human soul and as when it receives a happy turn it is the source of private felicity and public prosperity and when it errs produces private uneasiness and public calamities it is the business and duty of private prudence of private and public education and of national policy to direct it to right objects for this purpose it should be considered that to every man who is capable of a worthy conduct the pleasure from the approbation of worthy men is exquisite and inexpressible it is curious to consider the final causes of things when the physical are wholly unknown the intellectual and moral qualities     are most within our power and undoubtedly the most essential to our happiness the personal qualities of health strength and agility are next in importance yet the qualities of fortune such as birth riches and honors though a man has less reason to esteem himself for these than for those of his mind or body are everywhere acknowledged to glitter with the brightest lustre in the eyes of the world as virtue is the only rational source and eternal foundation of honor the wisdom of nations in the titles they have established as the marks of order and subordination has generally given an intimation not of personal qualities nor of the qualities of fortune but of some particular virtues more especially becoming men in the high stations they possess reverence is attributed to the clergy veneration to magistrates honor to senators serenity clemency or mildness of disposition to princes the sovereign authority and supreme executive have commonly titles that designate power as well as virtue—as majesty to kings magnificent most honored and sovereign lords to the government of geneva noble mightinesses to the states of friesland noble and mighty lords to the states of guelderland noble great and venerable lords to the regency of leyden noble and grand mightinesses to the states of holland noble great and venerable lords the regency of amsterdam noble mightinesses the states of utrecht and high mightinesses the states general a death bed it is said shows the emptiness of titles that may be but does it not equally show the futility of riches power liberty and all earthly things the cloudcapt towers the gorgeous palaces the solemn temples the great globe itself appear the baseless fabric of a vision and life itself a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing shall it be inferred from this that fame liberty property and life shall be always despised and neglected shall laws and government which regulate sublunary things be neglected because they appear baubles at the hour of death the wisdom and virtue of all nations have endeavored to regulate the passion for respect and distinction and to reduce it to some order in society by titles marking the gradations of magistracy to prevent as far as human power and policy can prevent collisions among the passions of many pursuing the     same objects and the rivalries animosities envy jealousy and vengeance which always result from them has there ever been a nation who understood the human heart better than the romans or made a better use of the passion for consideration congratulation and distinction they considered that as reason is the guide of life the senses the imagination and the affections are the springs of activity reason holds the helm but passions are the gales and as the direct road to these is through the senses the language of signs was employed by roman wisdom to excite the emulation and active virtue of the citizens distinctions of conditions as well as of ages were made by difference of clothing the laticlave or large flowing robe studded with broad spots of purple the ancient distinction of their kings was after the establishment of the consulate worn by the senators through the whole period of the republic and the empire the tribunes of the people were after their institution admitted to wear the same venerable signal of sanctity and authority the angusticlave or the smaller robe with narrower studs of purple was the distinguishing habit of roman knights the golden ring was also peculiar to senators and knights and was not permitted to be worn by any other citizens the prætext or long white robe reaching down to the ancles bordered with purple which was worn by the principal magistrates such as consuls prætors censors and sometimes on solemn festivals by senators the chairs of ivory the lictors the rods the axes the crowns of gold of ivory of flowers of herbs of laurel branches and of oak leaves the civil and the mural crowns their ovations and their triumphs every thing in religion government and common life among the romans was parade representation and ceremony every thing was addressed to the emulation of the citizens and every thing was calculated to attract the attention to allure the consideration and excite the congratulations of the people to attach their hearts to individual citizens according to their merit and to their lawgivers magistrates and judges according to their rank station and importance in the state and this was in the true spirit of republics in which form of government there is no other consistent method of preserving order or procuring submission to the laws to such means as these or to force and a standing army recourse must be had for the guardianship of     laws and the protection of the people it is universally true that in all the republics now remaining in europe there is as there ever has been a more constant and anxious attention to such forms and marks of distinctions than there is in the monarchies the policy of rome was exhibited in its highest perfection in the triumph of paulus æmilius over perseus it was a striking exemplification of congratulation and sympathy contrasted with each other congratulation with the conqueror sympathy with the captive both suddenly changed into sympathy with the conqueror the description of this triumph is written with a pomp of language correspondent to its dazzling magnificence the representation of the king and his children must excite the pity of every reader who is not animated with the ferocious sentiments of roman insolence and pride never was there a more moving lesson of the melancholy lot of humanity than the contrasted fortunes of the macedonian and the roman the one divested of his crown and throne led in chains with his children before his chariot the other blazing in gold and purple to the capitol this instructive lesson is given us by the victor himself in a speech to the people my triumph romans as if it had been in derision of all human felicity has been interposed between the funerals of my children and both have been exhibited as spectacles before you perseus who himself a captive saw his children led with him in captivity now enjoys them in safety i who triumphed over him having ascended the capitol from the funeral chariot of one of my sons descended from that capitol to see another expire in the house of paulus none remains but himself† but your felicity romans and the prosperous fortune of the public is a consolation to me under this destruction of my family it is easy to see how such a scene must operate on the hearts of a nation how it must affect the passion for distinction and how it must excite the ardor and virtuous emulation of the citizens     v the senates thanks the gazettes pompous tale with force resistless oer the brave prevail this power has praise that virtue scarce can warm till fame supplies the universal charm johnson the result of the preceding discourses is that avarice and ambition vanity and pride jealousy and envy hatred and revenge as well as the love of knowledge and desire of fame are very often nothing more than various modifications of that desire of the attention consideration and congratulations of our fellow men which is the great spring of social activity that all men compare themselves with others especially those with whom they most frequently converse those who by their employments or amusements professions or offices present themselves most frequently at the same time to the view and thoughts of that public little or great to which every man is known that emulations and rivalries naturally and necessarily are excited by such comparisons that the most heroic actions in war the sublimest virtues in peace and the most useful industry in agriculture arts manufactures and commerce proceed from such emulations on the one hand and jealousies envy enmity hatred revenge quarrels factions seditions and wars on the other the final cause of this constitution of things is easy to discover nature has ordained it as a constant incentive to activity and industry that to acquire the attention and complacency the approbation and admiration of their fellows men might be urged to constant exertions of beneficence by this destination of their natures men of all sorts even those who have the least of reason virtue or benevolence are chained down to an incessant servitude to their fellow creatures laboring without intermission to produce something which shall contribute to the comfort convenience pleasure profit or utility of some or other of the species they are really thus constituted by their own vanity slaves to mankind slaves i say again for what a folly is it on a selfish system what are the thoughts passions and sentiments of mankind to us whats fame a fancied life in others breath what is it to us what shall be said of us after we are dead or in asia africa or europe while we live there is no     greater possible or imaginable delusion yet the impulse is irresistible the language of nature to man in his constitution is this—i have given you reason conscience and benevolence and thereby made you accountable for your actions and capable of virtue in which you will find your highest felicity but i have not confided wholly in your laudable improvement of these divine gifts to them i have superadded in your bosoms a passion for the notice and regard of your fellow mortals which if you perversely violate your duty and wholly neglect the part assigned you in the system of the world and the society of mankind shall torture you from the cradle to the grave nature has taken effectual care of her own work she has wrought the passions into the texture and essence of the soul and has not left it in the power of art to destroy them to regulate and not to eradicate them is the province of policy it is of the highest importance to education to life and to society not only that they should not be destroyed but that they should be gratified encouraged and arranged on the side of virtue to confine our observations at present to that great leading passion of the soul which has been so long under our consideration what discouragement distress and despair have not been occasioned by its disappointment to consider one instance among many which happen continually in schools and colleges put a supposition of a pair of twin brothers who have been nourished by the same nurse equally encouraged by their parents and preceptors with equal genius health and strength pursuing their studies with equal ardor and success one is at length overtaken by some sickness and in a few days the other who escapes the influenza is advanced some pages before him this alone will make the studies of the unfortunate child when he recovers his health disgustful as soon as he loses the animating hope of preëminence and is constrained to acknowledge a few others of his form or class his superiors he becomes incapable of industrious application even the fear of the ferule or the rod will after this be ineffectual the terror of punishment by forcing attention may compel a child to perform a task but can never infuse that ardor for study which alone can arrive at great attainments emulation really seems to produce genius and the desire of superiority to create talents either this or the reverse of it must be true and     genius produces emulation and natural talents the desire of superiority for they are always found together and what god and nature have united let no audacious legislator presume to put asunder when the love of glory enkindles in the heart and influences the whole soul then and only then may we depend on a rapid progression of the intellectual faculties the awful feeling of a mortified emulation is not peculiar to children in an army or a navy sometimes the interest of the service requires and oftener perhaps private interest and partial favor prevail to promote officers over their superiors or seniors but the consequence is that those officers can never serve again together they must be distributed in different corps or sent on different commands nor is this the worst effect it almost universally happens that the superseded officer feels his heart broken by his disgrace his mind is enfeebled by grief or disturbed by resentment and the instances have been very rare of any brilliant action performed by such an officer what a monument to this character of human nature is the long list of yellow admirals in the british service consider the effects of similar disappointments in civil affairs ministers of state are frequently displaced in all countries and what is the consequence are they seen happy in a calm resignation to their fate do they turn their thoughts from their former employments to private studies or business are they men of pleasant humor and engaging conversation are their hearts at ease or is their conversation a constant effusion of complaints and murmurs and their breast the residence of resentment and indignation of grief and sorrow of malice and revenge is it common to see a man get the better of his ambition and despise the honors he once possessed or is he commonly employed in projects upon projects intrigues after intrigues and manœuvres on manœuvres to recover them so sweet and delightful to the human heart is that complacency and admiration which attends public offices whether they are conferred by the favor of a prince derived from hereditary descent or obtained by election of the people that a mind must be sunk below the feelings of humanity or exalted by religion or philosophy far above the common character of men to be insensible or to conquer its sensibility pretensions to such conquests are not uncommon but the sincerity of such     pretenders is often rendered suspicious by their constant conversation and conduct and even by their countenances the people are so sensible of this that a man in this predicament is always on the compassionate list and except in cases of great resentment against him for some very unpopular principles or behavior they are found to be always studying some other office for a disappointed man to console him in his affliction in short the theory of education and the science of government may be reduced to the same simple principle and be all comprehended in the knowledge of the means of actively conducting controlling and regulating the emulation and ambition of the citizens vi haud facile emergunt quorum virtutibus obstat res angusta domi juvenal this mournful truth is everywhere confessd slow rises worth by poverty depressed johnson if we attempt to analyze our ideas still further upon this subject we shall find that the expressions we have hitherto used attention consideration and congratulation comprehend with sufficient accuracy the general object of the passion for distinction in the greater part of mankind there are not a few—from him who burned a temple to the multitudes who plunge into low debauchery—who deliberately seek it by crimes and vices the greater number however search for it neither by vices nor virtues but by the means which common sense and every days experience show are most sure to obtain it by riches by family records by play and other frivolous personal accomplishments but there are a few and god knows but a few who aim at something more they aim at approbation as well as attention at esteem as well as consideration and at admiration and gratitude as well as congratulation admiration is indeed the complete idea of approbation congratulation and wonder united this last description of persons is the tribe out of which proceed your patriots and heroes and most of the great benefactors to mankind but for our humiliation we must still remember that even in these esteemed beloved and adored characters the passion although refined by the purest moral sentiments     and intended to be governed by the best principles is a passion still and therefore like all other human desires unlimited and insatiable no man was ever contented with any given share of this human adoration when cæsar declared that he had lived enough to glory cæsar might deceive himself but he did not deceive the world who saw his declaration contradicted by every action of his subsequent life man constantly craves for more even when he has no rival but when he sees another possessed of more or drawing away from himself a part of what he had he feels a mortification arising from the loss of a good he thought his own his desire is disappointed the pain of a want unsatisfied is increased by a resentment of an injustice as he thinks it he accuses his rival of a theft or robbery and the public of taking away what was his property and giving it to another these feelings and resentments are but other names for jealousy and envy and altogether they produce some of the keenest and most tormenting of all sentiments these fermentations of the passions are so common and so well known that the people generally presume that a person in such circumstances is deprived of his judgment if not of his veracity and reason it is too generally a sufficient answer to any complaint to any fact alleged or argument advanced to say that it comes from a disappointed man there is a voice within us which seems to intimate that real merit should govern the world and that men ought to be respected only in proportion to their talents virtues and services but the question always has been how can this arrangement be accomplished how shall the men of merit be discovered how shall the proportions of merit be ascertained and graduated who shall be the judge when the government of a great nation is in question shall the whole nation choose will such a choice be better than chance shall the whole nation vote for senators thirty millions of votes for example for each senator in france it is obvious that this would be a lottery of millions of blanks to one prize and that the chance of having wisdom and integrity in a senator by hereditary descent would be far better there is no individual personally known to an hundredth part of the nation the voters then must be exposed to deception from intrigues and manœuvres without number that is to say from all the chicanery impostures   0 and falsehoods imaginable with scarce a possibility of preferring real merit will you divide the nation into districts and let each district choose a senator this is giving up the idea of national merit and annexing the honor and the trust to an accident that of living on a particular spot a hundred or a thousand men of the first merit in a nation may live in one city and none at all of this description in several whole provinces real merit is so remote from the knowledge of whole nations that were magistrates to be chosen by that criterion alone and by a universal suffrage dissensions and venality would be endless the difficulties arising from this source are so obvious and universal that nations have tried all sorts of experiments to avoid them as no appetite in human nature is more universal than that for honor and real merit is confined to a very few the numbers who thirst for respect are out of all proportion to those who seek it only by merit the great majority trouble themselves little about merit but apply themselves to seek for honor by means which they see will more easily and certainly obtain it by displaying their taste and address their wealth and magnificence their ancient parchments pictures and statues and the virtues of their ancestors and if these fail as they seldom have done they have recourse to artifice dissimulation hypocrisy flattery imposture empiricism quackery and bribery what chance has humble modest obscure and poor merit in such a scramble nations perceiving that the still small voice of merit was drowned in the insolent roar of such dupes of impudence and knavery in national elections without a possibility of a remedy have sought for something more permanent than the popular voice to designate honor many nations have attempted to annex it to land presuming that a good estate would at least furnish means of a good education and have resolved that those who should possess certain territories should have certain legislative executive and judicial powers over the people other nations have endeavored to connect honor with offices and the names and ideas at least of certain moral virtues and intellectual qualities have been by law annexed to certain offices as veneration grace excellence honor serenity majesty other nations have attempted to annex honor to families without regard to lands or offices the romans allowed none but those     who had possessed curule offices to have statues or portraits he who had images or pictures of his ancestors was called noble he who had no statue or pictures but his own was called a new man those who had none at all were ignoble other nations have united all those institutions connected lands offices and families made them all descend together and honor public attention consideration and congratulation along with them this has been the policy of europe and it is to this institution she owes her superiority in war and peace in legislation and commerce in agriculture navigation arts sciences and manufactures to asia and africa these families thus distinguished by property honors and privileges by defending themselves have been obliged to defend the people against the encroachments of despotism they have been a civil and political militia constantly watching the designs of the standing armies and courts and by defending their own rights liberties properties and privileges they have been obliged in some degree to defend those of the people by making a common cause with them but there were several essential defects in this policy one was that the people took no rational measures to defend themselves either against these great families or the courts they had no adequate representation of themselves in the sovereignty another was that it never was determined where the sovereignty resided generally it was claimed by kings but not admitted by the nobles sometimes every baron pretended to be sovereign in his own territory at other times the sovereignty was claimed by an assembly of nobles under the name of states or cortes sometimes the united authority of the king and states was called the sovereignty the common people had no adequate and independent share in the legislatures and found themselves harassed to discover who was the sovereign and whom they ought to obey as much as they ever had been or could be to determine who had the most merit a thousand years of barons wars causing universal darkness ignorance and barbarity ended at last in simple monarchy not by express stipulation but by tacit acquiescence in almost all europe the people preferring     a certain sovereignty in a single person to endless disputes about merit and sovereignty which never did and never will produce any thing but aristocratical anarchy and the nobles contenting themselves with a security of their property and privileges by a government of fixed laws registered and interpreted by a judicial power which they called sovereign tribunals though the legislation and execution were in a single person in this system to control the nobles the church joined the kings and common people the progress of reason letters and science has weakened the church and strengthened the common people who if they are honestly and prudently conducted by those who have their confidence will most infallibly obtain a share in every legislature but if the common people are advised to aim at collecting the whole sovereignty in single national assemblies as they are by the duke de la rochefoucauld and the marquis of condorcet or at the abolition of the regal executive authority or at a division of the executive power as they are by a posthumous publication of the abbé de mably they will fail of their desired liberty as certainly as emulation and rivalry are founded in human nature and inseparable from civil affairs it is not to flatter the passions of the people to be sure nor is it the way to obtain a present enthusiastic popularity to tell them that in a single assembly they will act as arbitrarily and tyrannically as any despot but it is a sacred truth and as demonstrable as any proposition whatever that a sovereignty in a single assembly must necessarily and will certainly be exercised by a majority as tyrannically as any sovereignty was ever exercised by kings or nobles and if a balance of passions and interests is not scientifically concerted the present struggle in europe will be little beneficial to mankind† and produce nothing but another thousand years of feudal fanaticism under new and strange names     vii tis from high life high characters are drawn a saint in crape is twice a saint in lawn pope providence which has placed one thing over against another in the moral as well as physical world has surprisingly accommodated the qualities of men to answer one another there is a remarkable disposition in mankind to congratulate with others in their joys and prosperity more than to sympathize with them in their sorrows and adversity we may appeal to experience there is less disposition to congratulation with genius talents or virtue than there is with beauty strength and elegance of person and less with these than with the gifts of fortune and birth wealth and fame the homage of the world is devoted to these last in a remarkable manner experience concurs with religion in pronouncing most decisively that this world is not the region of virtue or happiness both are here at school and their struggles with ambition avarice and the desire of fame appear to be their discipline and exercise the gifts of fortune are more level to the capacities and more obvious to the notice of mankind in general and congratulation with the happiness or fancied happiness of others is agreeable sympathy with their misery is disagreeable from the former sources we derive pleasure from the latter pain the sorrow of the company at a funeral may be more profitable to moral purposes by suggesting useful reflections than the mirth at a wedding but it is not so vivid nor so sincere the acclamations of the populace at an ovation or triumph at a coronation or installation are from the heart and their joy is unfeigned their grief at a public execution is less violent at least if their feelings at such spectacles were very distressing they would be less eager to attend them what is the motive of that ardent curiosity to see sights and shows of exultation the processions of princes the ostentation of wealth the magnificence of equipage retinue furniture buildings and entertainment there is no other answer to be given to these questions than the gayety of heart the joyous feelings of congratulation with such appearances of felicity and for the vindication of the ways of god to man and the perpetual consolation of the many who are spectators it is certainly true that     their pleasure is always as great and commonly much greater than that of the few who are the actors national passions and habits are unwieldy unmanageable and formidable things the number of persons in any country who are known even by name or reputation to all the inhabitants is and ever must be very small those whose characters have attracted the affections as well as the attention of a whole people acquire an influence and ascendency that it is difficult to resist in proportion as men rise higher in the world whether by election descent or appointment and are exposed to the observation of greater numbers of people the effects of their own passions and of the affections of others for them become more serious interesting and dangerous in elective governments where first magistrates and senators are at stated intervals to be chosen these if there are no parties become at every fresh election more known considered and beloved by the whole nation but if the nation is divided into two parties those who vote for a man become the more attached to him for the opposition that is made by his enemies this national attachment to an elective first magistrate where there is no competition is very great but where there is a competition the passions of his party are inflamed by it into a more ardent enthusiasm if there are two candidates each at the head of a party the nation becomes divided into two nations each of which is in fact a moral person as much as any community can be so and are soon bitterly enraged against each other it has been already said that in proportion as men rise higher in the world and are exposed to the observation of greater numbers the effects of these passions are more serious and alarming impressions on the feelings of the individual are deeper and larger portions of mankind become interested in them when you rise to the first ranks and consider the first men—a nobility who are known and respected at least perhaps habitually esteemed and beloved by a nation princes and kings on whom the eyes of all men are fixed and whose every motion is regarded—the consequences of wounding their feelings are dreadful because the feelings of a whole nation and sometimes of many nations are wounded at the same time if the smallest variation is made in their situation relatively to each other if one who was inferior is raised to be superior unless it be by fixed laws whose     evident policy and necessity may take away disgrace nothing but war carnage and vengeance has ever been the usual consequence of it in the examples of the houses valois and bourbon guise and montmorenci guise and bourbon and guise and valois we shall see very grave effects of these feelings and the history of a hundred years which followed is nothing but a detail of other and more tragical effects of similar causes to any one who has never considered the force of national attention consideration and congratulation and the causes natural and artificial by which they have been excited it will be curious to read in platos alcibiades the manner in which these national attachments to their kings were created by the ancient persians the policy of the modern monarchies of europe seems to be an exact imitation of that of the persian court as it is explained by the grecian philosopher in france for example the pregnancy of the queen is announced with great solemnity to the whole nation her majesty is scarcely afflicted with a pain which is not formally communicated to the public to this embryo the minds of the whole nation are turned and they follow him day by day in their thoughts till he is born the whole people have a right to be present at his birth and as many as the chamber will hold crowd in till the queen and prince are almost suffocated with the loyal curiosity and affectionate solicitude of their subjects in the cradle the principal personages of the kingdom as well as all the ambassadors are from time to time presented to the royal infant to thousands who press to see him he is daily shown from the nursery of every step in his education and of every gradation of his youthful growth in body and mind the public is informed in the gazettes not a stroke of wit not a sprightly sally not a trait of generous affection can escape him but the world is told of it and very often pretty fictions are contrived for the same purpose where the truth will not furnish materials thus it becomes the national fashion it is the tone of the city and the court to think and converse daily about the dauphin when he accedes to the throne the same attention is continued till he dies in elective governments something very like this always takes place towards the first character his person countenance character and actions are made the daily contemplation and     conversation of the whole people hence arises the danger of a division of this attention where there are rivals for the first place the national attention and passions are divided and thwart each other the collision enkindles fires the conflicting passions interest all ranks they produce slanders and libels first mobs and seditions next and civil war with all her hissing snakes burning torches and haggard horrors at last this is the true reason why all civilized free nations have found by experience the necessity of separating from the body of the people and even from the legislature the distribution of honors and conferring it on the executive authority of government when the emulation of all the citizens looks up to one point like the rays of a circle from all parts of the circumference meeting and uniting in the centre you may hope for uniformity consistency and subordination but when they look up to different individuals or assemblies or councils you may expect all the deformities eccentricities and confusion of the polemic system viii wise if a minister but if a king more wise more learnd more just more every thing pope there is scarcely any truth more certain or more evident than that the noblesse of europe are in general less happy than the common people there is one irrefragable proof of it which is that they do not maintain their own population families like stars or candles which you will are going out continually and without fresh recruits from the plebeians the nobility would in time be extinct if you make allowances for the state which they are condemned by themselves and the world to support they are poorer than the poor deeply in debt and tributary to usurious capitalists as greedy as the jews the kings of europe in the sight of a philosopher are the greatest slaves on earth how often soever we may call them despots tyrants and other rude names in which our pride and vanity take a wonderful delight they have the least exercise of their inclinations the least personal liberty and the least free indulgence of their passions of any men alive yet how rare are the instances of     resignations and how universal is the ambition to be noble and the wish to be royal experience and philosophy are lost upon mankind the attention of the world has a charm in it which few minds can withstand the people consider the condition of the great in all those delusive colors in which imagination can paint and gild it and reason can make little resistance to this impetuous propensity to better their condition to advance their fortunes without limits is the object of their constant desire the employment of all their thoughts by day and by night they feel a peculiar sympathy with that pleasure which they presume those enjoy who are already powerful celebrated and rich we favor says a great writer all their inclinations and forward all their wishes what pity we think that any thing should spoil and corrupt so agreeable a situation we could even wish them immortal and it seems hard to us that death should at last put an end to such perfect enjoyment it is cruel we think in nature to compel them from their exalted stations to that humble but hospitable home which she has provided for all her children great king live forever is the compliment which after the manner of eastern adulation we should readily make them if experience did not teach us its absurdity every calamity that befalls them every injury that is done them excites in the breast of the spectator ten times more compassion and resentment than he would have felt had the same things happened to other men it is the misfortunes of kings only which afford the proper subjects for tragedy they resemble in this respect the misfortunes of lovers those two situations are the chief which interest us upon the theatre because in spite of all that reason and experience can tell us to the contrary the prejudices of the imagination attach to these two states a happiness superior to any other to disturb or to put an end to such perfect enjoyment seems to be the most atrocious of all injuries the traitor who conspires against the life of his monarch is thought a greater monster than any other murderer all the innocent blood that was shed in the civil wars provoked less indignation than the death of charles i a stranger to human nature who saw the indifference of men about the misery of their inferiors and the regret and indignation which they feel for the misfortunes and sufferings of those above them would     be apt to imagine that pain must be more agonizing and the convulsions of death more terrible to persons of higher rank than to those of meaner stations upon this disposition of mankind to go along with all the passions of the rich and the powerful is founded the distinction of ranks and the order of society our obsequiousness to our superiors more frequently arises from our admiration for the advantages of their situation than from any private expectations of benefit from their good will their benefits can extend but to a few but their fortunes interest almost everybody we are eager to assist them in completing a system of happiness that approaches so near to perfection and we desire to serve them for their own sake without any other recompense but the vanity or the honor of obliging them neither is our deference to their inclinations founded chiefly or altogether upon a regard to the utility of such submission and to the order of society which is best supported by it even when the order of society seems to require that we should oppose them we can hardly bring ourselves to do it that kings are the servants of the people to be obeyed resisted deposed or punished as the public conveniency may require is the doctrine of reason and philosophy but it is not the doctrine of nature nature would teach us to submit to them for their own sake to tremble and bow down before their exalted station to regard their smile as a reward sufficient to compensate any services and to dread their displeasure though no other evil were to follow from it as the severest of all mortifications to treat them in any respect as men to reason and dispute with them upon ordinary occasions requires such resolution that there are few men whose magnanimity can support them in it unless they are likewise assisted by familiarity and acquaintance the strongest motives the most furious passions fear hatred and resentment are scarce sufficient to balance this natural disposition to respect them and their conduct must either justly or unjustly have excited the highest degree of all those passions before the bulk of the people can be brought to oppose them with violence or to desire to see them either punished or deposed even when the people have been brought to this length they are apt to relent every moment and easily relapse into their habitual state of deference they cannot stand the mortification of their monarch compassion     soon takes the place of resentment they forget all past provocations their old principles of loyalty revive and they run to reestablish the ruined authority of their old masters with the same violence with which they had opposed it the death of charles i brought about the restoration of the royal family compassion for james ii when he was seized by the populace in making his escape on shipboard had almost prevented the revolution and made it go on more heavily than before do the great seem insensible of the easy price at which they may acquire the public admiration or do they seem to imagine that to them as to other men it must be the purchase either of sweat or of blood by what important accomplishments is the young nobleman instructed to support the dignity of his rank and to render himself worthy of that superiority over his fellowcitizens to which the virtue of his ancestors had raised them is it by knowledge by industry by patience by selfdenial or by virtue of any kind as all his words as all his motions are attended to he learns an habitual regard to every circumstance of ordinary behavior and studies to perform all those small duties with the most exact propriety as he is conscious how much he is observed and how much mankind are disposed to favor all his inclinations he acts upon the most indifferent occasions with that freedom and elegance which the thought of this naturally inspires his air his manner his deportment all mark that elegant and graceful sense of his own superiority which those who are born to inferior stations can hardly ever arrive at these are the arts by which he proposes to make mankind more easily submit to his authority and to govern their inclinations according to his own pleasure and in this he is seldom disappointed these arts supported by rank and preëminence are upon ordinary occasions sufficient to govern the world but it is not by accomplishments of this kind that the man of inferior rank must hope to distinguish himself politeness is so much the virtue of the great that it will do little honor to any body but themselves the coxcomb who imitates their manner and affects to be eminent by the superior propriety of his ordinary behavior is rewarded with a double share of contempt for his folly and presumption why should the man whom nobody thinks it worth while to look at be very anxious about the manner in which he holds up his head or disposes of   0 his arms while he walks through a room he is occupied surely with a very superfluous attention and with an attention too that marks a sense of his own importance which no other mortal can go along with the most perfect modesty and plainness joined to as much negligence as is consistent with the respect due to the company ought to be the chief characteristics of the behavior of a private man if ever he hopes to distinguish himself it must be by more important virtues he must acquire dependents to balance the dependents of the great and he has no other fund to pay them from but the labor of his body and the activity of his mind he must cultivate these therefore he must acquire superior knowledge in his profession and superior industry in the exercise of it he must be patient in labor resolute in danger and firm in distress these talents he must bring into public view by the difficulty importance and at the same time good judgment of his undertakings and by the severe and unrelenting application with which he pursues them probity and prudence generosity and frankness must characterize his behavior upon all ordinary occasions and he must at the same time be forward to engage in all those situations in which it requires the greatest talents and virtues to act with propriety but in which the greatest applause is to be acquired by those who can acquit themselves with honor with what impatience does the man of spirit and ambition who is depressed by his situation look round for some great opportunity to distinguish himself no circumstances which can afford this appear to him undesirable he even looks forward with satisfaction to the prospect of foreign war or civil dissension and with secret transport and delight sees through all the confusion and bloodshed which attend them the probability of those wishedfor occasions presenting themselves in which he may draw upon himself the attention and admiration of mankind the man of rank and distinction on the contrary whose whole glory consists in the propriety of his ordinary behavior who is contented with the humble renown which this can afford him and has no talents to acquire any other is unwilling to embarrass himself with what can be attended either with difficulty or distress to figure at a ball is his great triumph he has an aversion to all public confusions not from want of courage for in that he is seldom defective but from a consciousness that he     possesses none of the virtues which are required in such situations and that the public attention will certainly be drawn away from him by others he may be willing to expose himself to some little danger and to make a campaign when it happens to be the fashion but he shudders with horror at the thought of any situation which demands the continual and long exertion of patience industry fortitude and application of thought these virtues are hardly ever to be met with in men who are born to those high stations in all governments accordingly even in monarchies the highest offices are generally possessed and the whole detail of the administration conducted by men who were educated in the middle and inferior ranks of life who have been carried forward by their own industry and abilities though loaded with the jealousy and opposed by the resentment of all those who were born their superiors and to whom the great after having regarded them first with contempt and afterwards with envy are at last contented to truckle with the same abject meanness with which they desire that the rest of mankind should behave to themselves it is the loss of this easy empire over the affections of mankind which renders the fall from greatness so insupportable when the family of the king of macedon was led in triumph by paulus æmilius their misfortunes made them divide with their conqueror the attention of the roman people the sight of the royal children whose tender age rendered them insensible of their situation struck the spectators amidst the public rejoicings and prosperity with the tenderest sorrow and compassion the king appeared next in the procession and seemed like one confounded and astonished and bereft of all sentiment by the greatness of his calamities his friends and ministers followed after him as they moved along they often cast their eyes upon their fallen sovereign and always burst into ears at the sight their whole behavior demonstrating that they thought not of their own misfortunes but were occupied entirely by the superior greatness of his the generous romans on the contrary beheld him with disdain and indignation and regarded as unworthy of all compassion the man who could be so meanspirited as to bear to live under such calamities yet what did those calamities amount to he was to spend the remainder of his days in a state which in itself should     seem worthy of envy a state of plenty ease leisure and security from which it was impossible for him even by his own folly to fall but he was no longer to be surrounded by that admiring mob of fools flatterers and dependents who had formerly been accustomed to attend upon all his motions he was no longer to be gazed upon by multitudes nor to have it in his power to render himself the object of their respect their gratitude their love their admiration the passions of nations were no longer to mould themselves upon his inclinations this was that insupportable calamity which bereaved the king of all sentiment which made his friends forget their own misfortunes and which the roman magnanimity could scarce conceive how any man could be so meanspirited as to bear to survive to those who have been accustomed to the possession or even to the hope of public admiration all other pleasures sicken and decay of such mighty importance does it appear to be in the imaginations of men to stand in that situation which sets them most in the view of general sympathy and attention and thus place that great object which divides the wives of aldermen is the end of half the labors of human life and is the cause of all the tumult and bustle all the rapine and injustice which avarice and ambition have introduced into this world people of sense it is said indeed despise place that is they despise sitting at the head of the table and are indifferent who it is that is pointed out to the company by that frivolous circumstance which the smallest advantage is capable of overbalancing but rank distinction preëminence no man despises  ix heroes proceed what bounds your pride shall hold what check restrain your thirst of power and gold johnson the answer to the question in the motto can be none other than this that as nature has established in the bosoms of heroes no limits to those passions and as the world instead of restraining     encourages them the check must be in the form of government the world encourages ambition and avarice by taking the most decided part in their favor the roman world approved of the ambition of cæsar and notwithstanding all the pains that have been taken with so much reason by moral and political writers to disgrace it the world has approved it these seventeen hundred years and still esteems his name an honor to the first empire in europe consider the story of the ambition and the fall of cardinal wolsey and archbishop laud the indignation of the world against their tyranny has been very faint the sympathy with their fall has been very strong consider all the examples in history of successful ambition you will find none generally condemned by mankind on the other hand think of the instances of ambition unsuccessful and disappointed or of falls from great heights you find the sympathy of the world universally affected cruelty and tyranny of the blackest kind must accompany the story to destroy or sensibly diminish this pity that world for the regulation of whose prejudices passions imaginations and interests governments are instituted is so unjust that neither religion natural nor revealed nor any thing but a wellordered and wellbalanced government has ever been able to correct it and that but imperfectly it is true in modern london as it was in ancient rome that the sympathy of the world is less excited by the destruction of the house of a man of merit in obscurity or even in middle life though it be by the unjust violence of men than by the same calamity befalling a rich man by the righteous indignation of heaven   nil habuit codrus quis enim negat et tamen illud   perdidit infelix totueditor illegible characters nihil

most wisely hath ulysses here discovered   the fever whereof all our power is sick     xi think we like some weak prince th eternal cause prone for his favrites to reverse his laws pope emulation which is imitation and something more—a desire not only to equal or resemble but to excel is so natural a movement of the human heart that wherever men are to be found and in whatever manner associated or connected we see its effects they are not more affected by it as individuals than they are in communities there are rivalries between every little society in the same city between families and all the connections by consanguinity and affinity between trades faculties and professions between congregations parishes and churches between schools colleges and universities between districts villages cities provinces and nations national rivalries are more frequently the cause of wars than the ambition of ministers or the pride of kings as long as there is patriotism there will be national emulation vanity and pride it is national pride which commonly stimulates kings and ministers national fear apprehension of danger and the necessity of selfdefence is added to such rivalries for wealth consideration and power the safety independence and existence of a nation depend upon keeping up a high sense of its own honor dignity and power in the hearts of its individuals and a lively jealousy of the growing power and aspiring ambition of a neighboring state this is well illustrated in the political geography published in our newspapers from london within a few weeks the jealousies and enmities the alliances and friendships or rather the combinations of different states and princes might almost be learned from a map without attention to what has passed or is now passing in the world next neighbors are political enemies states between which a common neighbor and therefore a common enemy intervenes are good friends in this respect europe may be compared to a chessboard marked with the black and with the white spots of political discord and concord before the union between england and scotland a friendship and alliance subsisted for centuries between the latter of these kingdoms and france because they were both inimical to england for a like reason     before a prince of bourbon in the beginning of the present century was raised to the spanish throne a good understanding subsisted for the most part between england and spain and before the late alliance there was peace and kindness with little interruption for the space of centuries between england and the emperor an alliance has long subsisted between the french and the turks on account of the intervening dominion of the austrians the swedes were long the friends of france on account of the intervention of holland and denmark and because sweden the friend of france was situated in the neighborhood of the russian territories a friendship and commercial intercourse were established from the very first time that muscovy appears on the political theatre of europe between england and russia it is superfluous to multiply instances of this kind all past history and present observation will confirm the truth of our position—which though very simple is like all other simple truths of very great importance for however the accidental caprices and passions of individual princes or their ministers may alter the relative dispositions and interests of nations for a time there is a natural tendency to revert to the alteration already described we have been led into these reflections by the treaty offensive and defensive that has been formed between sweden prussia and the sublime porte between prussia and holland and the report which is very probable that a treaty offensive and defensive is on the point of being concluded between turkey and poland in this chain of alliances we find the order of the chessboard adhered to in some instances but passed over in others it is observed that there should be an alliance between turkey and sweden and also that there should be an alliance between poland and turkey because russia intervenes between turkey and sweden and hungary between turkey and poland but that there should be an alliance between poland and prussia is owing to particular and accidental circumstances the two former alliances may therefore be expected to be lasting the latter to be only temporary and precarious in general the chain of alliance that is formed or forming among the swedes prussians poles dutch turks and we may say the english is a most striking proof of the real or supposed strength and influence of the two imperial courts of russia and germany     the writer of this paragraph might have added the alliance between england and portugal and that between the united states of america and france the principle of all these examples is as natural as emulation and as infallible as the sincerity of interest on it turns the whole system of human affairs the congress of      were fully aware of it with no small degree of vehemence was it urged as an argument for the declaration of independence with confidence and firmness was it foretold that france could not avoid accepting the propositions that should be made to her that the court of versailles could not answer it to her own subjects and that all europe would pronounce her blind lost and undone if she rejected so fair an opportunity of disembarrassing herself from the danger of so powerful and hostile a rival whose naval superiority held all her foreign dominions her maritime power and commercial interest at mercy† but why all this of emulation and rivalry because as the whole history of the civil wars of france given us by davila is no more than a relation of rivalries succeeding each other in a rapid series the reflections we have made will assist us both to understand that noble historian and to form a right judgment of the state of affairs in france at the present moment they will suggest also to americans especially to those who have been unfriendly and may be now lukewarm to their national constitution‡ some useful inquiries such as these for example whether there are not emulations of a serious complexion among ourselves between cities and universities between north and south the middle and the north the middle and the south between one state and another between the governments of states and the national government and between individual patriots and heroes in all these what is the natural remedy against the inconveniences and dangers of these rivalries whether a wellbalanced constitution such as that of our union purports to be ought not to be cordially supported by every good citizen as our only hope of peace and our ark of safety till its defects if it has any can be corrected but it must be left to the contemplations of our state physicians to discover   0 the causes and the remedy of that fever whereof our power is sick the question only shall be respectfully insinuated whether equal laws the result only of a balanced government can ever be obtained and preserved without some signs or other of distinction and degree we are told that our friends the national assembly of france have abolished all distinctions but be not deceived my dear countrymen impossibilities cannot be performed have they levelled all fortunes and equally divided all property have they made all men and women equally wise elegant and beautiful have they annihilated the names of bourbon and montmorenci rochefoucauld and noailles lafayette and la moignon necker and de calonne mirabeau and bailly have they committed to the flames all the records annals and histories of the nation all the copies of mezerai daniel de thou velly and a thousand others have they burned all their pictures and broken all their statues have they blotted out of all memories the names places of abode and illustrious actions of all their ancestors have they not still princes of the first and second order nobles and knights have they no record nor memory who are the men who compose the present national assembly do they wish to have that distinction forgotten have the french officers who served in america melted their eagles and torn their ribbons xii tis with our judgments as our watches—none go just alike yet each believes his own pope all the miracles enumerated in our last number must be performed in france before all distinctions can be annihilated and distinctions in abundance would be found after all for french gentlemen in the history of england holland spain germany italy america and all other countries on the globe the wisdom of nations has remarked the universal consideration paid to wealth and that the passion of avarice excited by     it produced treachery cowardice and a selfish unsocial meanness but had no tendency to produce those virtues of patience courage fortitude honor or patriotism which the service of the public required in their citizens in peace and war the wisdom of nations has observed that the general attention paid to birth produced a different kind of sentiments—those of pride in the maxims and principles of religion morals and government as well as in the talents and virtues which first produced illustration to ancestors as the pride of wealth produced nothing but meanness of sentiment and a sordid scramble for money and the pride of birth produced some degree of emulation in knowledge and virtue the wisdom of nations has endeavored to employ one prejudice to counteract another the prejudice in favor of birth to moderate correct and restrain the prejudice in favor of wealth the national assembly of france is too enlightened a body to overlook the inquiry what effect on the moral character of the nation would be produced by destroying if that were possible all attention to families and setting all the passions on the pursuit of gain whether universal venality and an incorrigible corruption in elections would not be the necessary consequence it may be relied on however that the intentions of that august and magnanimous assembly are misunderstood and misrepresented time will develop their designs will show them to be more judicious than to attempt impossibilities so obvious as that of the abolition of all distinctions alphonsus x the astronomical king of castile has been accused of impiety for saying that if at the time of the creation he had been called to the councils of the divinity he could have given some useful advice concerning the motions of the stars it is not probable that any thing was intended by him more than a humorous sarcasm or a sneer of contempt at the ptolemaic system a projection of which he had before him but if the national assembly should have seriously in contemplation and should resolve in earnest the total abolition of all distinctions and orders it would be much more difficult to vindicate them from an accusation of impiety god in the constitution of nature has ordained that every man shall have a disposition to emulation as well as imitation and consequently a passion for distinction and that all men shall not have equal     means and opportunities of gratifying it shall we believe the national assembly capable of resolving that no man shall have any desire of distinction or that all men shall have equal means of gratifying it or that no man shall have any means of gratifying it what would this be better than saying if we had been called to the councils of the celestials we could have given better advice in the constitution of human nature if nature and that assembly could be thus at variance which however is not credible the world would soon see which is the most powerful that there is already a scission in the national assembly like all others past present and to come is most certain there is an aristocratical party an armed neutrality and most probably a monarchical party besides another division who must finally prevail or liberty will be lost i mean a set of members who are equal friends to monarchy aristocracy and democracy and wish for an equal independent mixture of all three in their constitution each of these parties has its chief and these chiefs are or will be rivals religion will be both the object and the pretext of some liberty of others submission and obedience of others and levelling downright levelling of not a few but the attention consideration and congratulations of the public will be the object of all situation and office will be aimed at by some of all parties contests and dissensions will arise between these runners in the same race the natural and usual progress is from debate in the assembly to discussions in print from the search of truth and public utility in both to sophistry and the spirit of party evils so greatly dreaded by the ingenuous citizen of new haven to whom we have now the honor of paying our first respects hoping that hereafter we may find an opportunity to make him our more particular compliments from sophistry and party spirit the transition is quick and easy to falsehood imposture and every species of artificial evolution     and criminal intrigue as unbalanced parties of every description can never tolerate a free inquiry of any kind when employed against themselves the license and even the most temperate freedom of the press soon excite resentment and revenge a writer unpopular with an opposite party because he is too formidable in wit or argument may first be burnt in effigy or a printer may have his office assaulted cuffs and kicks boxes and cudgels are heard of among plebeian statesmen challenges and single combats among the aristocratic legislators riots and seditions at length break mens bones or flay off their skins lives are lost and when blood is once drawn men like other animals become outrageous if one party has not a superiority over the other clear enough to decide every thing at its pleasure a civil war ensues when the nation arrives at this period of the progression every leader at the head of his votaries even if you admit him to have the best intentions in the world will find himself compelled to form them into some military arrangement both for offence and defence to build castles and fortify eminences like the feudal barons for aristocratical rivalries and democratical rivalries too when unbalanced against each other by some third mediating power naturally and unfailingly produce a feudal system if this should be the course in france the poor deluded and devoted partisans would soon be fond enough of decorating their leaders with the old titles of dukes marquises and counts or doing any thing else to increase the power of their commander over themselves to unite their wills and forces for their own safety and defence or to give him weight with their enemies the men of letters in france are wisely reforming one feudal system but may they not unwisely lay the foundation of another a legislature in one assembly can have no other termination than in civil dissension feudal anarchy or simple monarchy the best apology which can be made for their fresh attempt of a sovereignty in one assembly an idea at least as ancient in france as stephen boethius is that it is only intended to be momentary if a senate had been proposed it must have been     formed most probably of princes of the blood cardinals archbishops dukes and marquises and all these together would have obstructed the progress of the reformation in religion and government and procured an abortion to the regeneration of france pennsylvania established her single assembly in      upon the same principle an apprehension that the proprietary and quaker interests would prevail to the election of characters disaffected to the american cause finally preponderated against two legislative councils pennsylvania and georgia who followed her example have found by experience the necessity of a change and france by the same infallible progress of reasoning will discover the same necessity happy indeed if the experiment shall not cost her more dear that the subject is considered in this light by the best friends of liberty in europe appears by the words of dr price lately published in this paper—had not the aristocratical and clerical orders says that sage and amiable writer been obliged to throw themselves into one chamber with the commons no reformation could have taken place and the regeneration of the kingdom would have been impossible and in future legislatures were these two orders to make distinct and independent states all that has been done would probably be soon undone hereafter perhaps when the new constitution as now formed has acquired strength by time the national assembly may find it practicable as well as expedient to establish by means of a third estate such a check as now takes place in the american government and is indispensable in the british government xiii first follow nature and your judgment frame by her just standard which is still the same pope the world grows more enlightened knowledge is more equally diffused newspapers magazines and circulating libraries have made mankind wiser titles and distinctions ranks and orders parade and ceremony are all going out of fashion     this is roundly and frequently asserted in the streets and sometimes on theatres of higher rank some truth there is in it and if the opportunity were temperately improved to the reformation of abuses the rectification of errors and the dissipation of pernicious prejudices a great advantage it might be but on the other hand false inferences may be drawn from it which may make mankind wish for the age of dragons giants and fairies if all decorum discipline and subordination are to be destroyed and universal pyrrhonism anarchy and insecurity of property are to be introduced nations will soon wish their books in ashes seek for darkness and ignorance superstition and fanaticism as blessings and follow the standard of the first mad despot who with the enthusiasm of another mahomet† will endeavor to obtain them are riches honors and beauty going out of fashion is not the rage for them on the contrary increased faster than improvement in knowledge as long as either of these are in vogue will there not be emulations and rivalries does not the increase of knowledge in any man increase his emulation and the diffusion of knowledge among men multiply rivalries has the progress of science arts and letters yet discovered that there are no passions in human nature no ambition avarice or desire of fame are these passions cooled diminished or extinguished is the rage for admiration less ardent in men or women have these propensities less a tendency to divisions controversies seditions mutinies and civil wars than formerly on the contrary the more knowledge is diffused the more the passions are extended and the more furious they grow had cicero less vanity or cæsar less ambition for their vast erudition had the king of prussia less of one than the other there is no connection in the mind between science and passion by which the former can extinguish or diminish the latter it on the contrary sometimes increases them by giving them exercise were the passions of the romans less vivid in the age of pompey than in the time of mummius are those of the britons more moderate at this hour than in the reigns of the tudors are the passions of monks the weaker for all their learning are not jealousy envy hatred malice and     revenge as well as emulation and ambition as rancorous in the cells of carmelites as in the courts of princes go to the royal society of london is there less emulation for the chair of sir isaac newton than there was and commonly will be for all elective presidencies is there less animosity and rancor arising from mutual emulations in that region of science than there is among the most ignorant of mankind go to paris how do you find the men of letters united friendly harmonious meek humble modest charitable prompt to mutual forbearance unassuming ready to acknowledge superior merit zealous to encourage the first symptoms of genius ask voltaire and rousseau marmontel and de mably the increase and dissemination of knowledge instead of rendering unnecessary the checks of emulation and the balances of rivalry in the orders of society and constitution of government augment the necessity of both it becomes the more indispensable that every man should know his place and be made to keep it bad men increase in knowledge as fast as good men and science arts taste sense and letters are employed for the purposes of injustice and tyranny as well as those of law and liberty for corruption as well as for virtue frenchmen act and think like yourselves confessing human nature be magnanimous and wise acknowledging and boasting yourselves to be men avow the feelings of men the affectation of being exempted from passions is inhuman the grave pretension to such singularity is solemn hypocrisy both are unworthy of your frank and generous natures consider that government is intended to set bounds to passions which nature has not limited and to assist reason conscience justice and truth in controlling interests which without it would be as unjust as uncontrollable americans rejoice that from experience you have learned wisdom and instead of whimsical and fantastical projects you have adopted a promising essay towards a wellordered government instead of following any foreign example to return to the legislation of confusion contemplate the means of restoring decency honesty and order in society by preserving and completing if any thing should be found necessary to complete the     balance of your government in a wellbalanced government reason conscience truth and virtue must be respected by all parties and exerted for the public good advert to the principles on which you commenced that glorious selfdefence which if you behave with steadiness and consistency may ultimately loosen the chains of all mankind if you will take the trouble to read over the memorable proceedings of the town of boston on the twentyeighth day of october      when the committee of correspondence of twentyone persons was appointed to state the rights of the colonists as men as christians and as subjects and to publish them to the world with the infringements and violations of them† you will find the great principles of civil and religious liberty for which you have contended so successfully and which the world is contending for after your example i could transcribe with pleasure the whole of this immortal pamphlet which is a real picture of the sun of liberty rising on the human race but shall select only a few words more directly to the present purpose the first fundamental positive law of all commonwealths or states is the establishment of the legislative power page   it is absolutely necessary in a mixed government like that of this province that a due proportion or balance of power should be established among the several branches of the legislative our ancestors received from king william and queen mary a charter by which it was understood by both parties in the contract that such a proportion or balance was fixed and therefore every thing which renders any one branch of the legislative more independent of the other two than it was originally designed is an alteration of the constitution americans in your congress at philadelphia on friday the fourteenth day of october      you laid down the fundamental principles for which you were about to contend and from which it is to be hoped you will never depart for asserting and vindicating your rights and liberties you declared that by the immutable laws of nature the principles of the english constitution and your several charters or compacts you were     entitled to life liberty and property that your ancestors were entitled to all the rights liberties and immunities of free and natural born subjects in england that you their descendants were entitled to the exercise and enjoyment of all such of them as your local and other circumstances enabled you to exercise and enjoy that the foundation of english liberty and of all free governments is a right in the people to participate in their legislative council that you were entitled to the common law of england and more especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by your

selfpreservation will forever be the great spring of human actions and the balance of a wellordered government will alone be able to prevent that emulation from degenerating into dangerous ambition irregular rivalries destructive factions wasting seditions and bloody civil wars† the great question will forever remain who shall work our   0 species cannot all be idle leisure for study must ever be the portion of a few the number employed in government must forever be very small food raiment and habitations the indispensable wants of all are not to be obtained without the continual toil of ninetynine in a hundred of mankind as rest is rapture to the weary man those who labor little will always be envied by those who labor much though the latter in reality be probably the most enviable with all the encouragements public and private which can ever be given to general education and it is scarcely possible they should be too many or too great the laboring part of the people can never be learned the controversy between the rich and the poor the laborious and the idle the learned and the ignorant distinctions as old as the creation and as extensive as the globe distinctions which no art or policy no degree of virtue or philosophy can ever wholly destroy will continue and rivalries will spring out of them these parties will be represented in the legislature and must be balanced or one will oppress the other there will never probably be found any other mode of establishing such an equilibrium than by constituting the representation of each an independent branch of the legislature and an independent executive authority such as that in our government to be a third branch and a mediator or an arbitrator between them property must be secured or liberty cannot exist but if unlimited or unbalanced power of disposing property be put into the hands of those who have no property france will find as we have found the lamb committed to the custody of the wolf in such a case all the pathetic exhortations and addresses of the national assembly to the people to respect property will be regarded no more than the warbles of the songsters of the forest the great art of lawgiving consists in balancing the poor against the rich in the legislature and in constituting the legislative a perfect balance against the executive power at the same time that no individual or party can become its rival the essence of a free government consists in an effectual control of rivalries the executive and the legislative powers are natural rivals and if each has not an effectual control over the other the weaker will ever be the lamb in the paws of the wolf the nation which will not adopt an equilibrium of power must adopt a despotism there is no other alternative rivalries must be controlled or     they will throw all things into confusion and there is nothing but despotism or a balance of power which can control them even in the simple monarchies the nobility and the judicatures constitute a balance though a very imperfect one against the royalties let us conclude with one reflection more which shall barely be hinted at as delicacy if not prudence may require in this place some degree of reserve is there a possibility that the government of nations may fall into the hands of men who teach the most disconsolate of all creeds that men are but fireflies and that this all is without a father is this the way to make man as man an object of respect or is it to make murder itself as indifferent as shooting a plover and the extermination of the rohilla nation as innocent as the swallowing of mites on a morsel of cheese if such a case should happen would not one of these the most credulous of all believers have reason to pray to his eternal nature or his almighty chance the more absurdity there is in this address the more in character give us again the gods of the greeks give us again the more intelligible as well as more comfortable systems of athanasius and calvin nay give us again our popes and hierarchies benedictines and jesuits with all their superstition and fanaticism impostures and tyranny a certain duchess of venerable years and masculine understanding said of some of the philosophers of the eighteenth century admirably well—on ne croit pas dans le christianisme mais on croit toutes les sottises possibles xiv la nature parle aux cœurs des rois tout comme à ceux des particuliers nature speaks the same language to the hearts of princes as to those of other men kings compare themselves with kings or with such of their own subjects as are nearest to them and have the same sentiments as private persons of pride vanity     jealousy resentment and hatred arising from such comparisons francis i  after his ascension to the throne whether he was misled by an imprudence of youth or whether he consulted only his own beneficent disposition proposed to himself from the first day of his reign to aggrandize the princes of the blood and load them with favors to elevate in dignity those who belonged to the royal family by proximity of blood he believed to be for his own glory having discerned in charles the head of the branch of bourbon all the talents which form the great captain and the able statesman he gave him the office of constable and by conferring on him and the princes of that house the most distinguished employments he placed them at the head of the most important affairs of his kingdom this it must be confessed was impolitic since it is always dangerous for the first in office or command to be over fond or familiar with the second to confer too many opportunities of eclipsing his own glory or of drawing away the attention of the public or to offer too many temptations to ambition rivalry or envy accordingly the first fire of this zeal abated and experience having excited his jealousy or policy revealed to him the reasons of the conduct which his predecessors had holden he manifested in the sequel as much eagerness to lower the bourbons as he had at first discovered of affection to exalt them fortune soon presented an opportunity favorable to his design louisa of savoy his mother had commenced a lawsuit against charles for the duchy of bourbon in his possession judges in those days were not independent the king thought that by influencing the decision in favor of his mother and by thus despoiling the house of bourbon of the richest portion of their patrimony he might accelerate the declension of a credit founded in part on their immense riches charles in the course of the proceedings discovered the manœuvres which were practised to his prejudice by the chancellor     duprat by order of the king the indignation which he conceived at this injury and the apprehension of the reverse of fortune which threatened him struck him so forcibly that having negotiated secretly with the emperor charles v and henry viii king of england he conspired against the state and even against the person of the king his designs were discovered and necessitated to fly the kingdom with precipitation he afterwards bore arms against his sovereign he commanded the imperial army at the battle of pavia in which after the bloody defeat of the french army the king surrounded on all sides by the infantry of the enemy remained a prisoner the constable as a punishment of all these crimes was declared a rebel all his estates were confiscated and united to the dominions of the crown he was killed soon after at the taking of rome and there remained to the bourbons nothing of that grandeur which had inspired so much umbrage to kings their misfortunes did not cease here although charles was deceased without issue and the other princes of his house had not favored his revolt resentment in the breast of the king overcame his reason and the bourbons were deprived of the favors of the court and banished from the government their personal merit could not soften the hatred attached to their name this rigor it is true diminished with time and in proportion as the memory of the past and the disadvantageous ideas which the king had conceived of them were effaced from his mind nevertheless he cautiously applied himself to obstruct all the passages by which they might have returned to the possession of those dignities and that power to which royal favor had formerly raised them these secret dispositions of the king were perfectly known to charles of vendôme now at the head of that house who by his moderation studied to dissipate the suspicions which were entertained against his family in this view he refused during the imprisonment of the king to pretend to the regency which belonged to him of right after the king was set at liberty charles shut himself up with his domestics leading a private life without meddling in the government of a state in which he saw he was suspected all the other bourbons after his example retired as much to prove that they were innocent of the revolt of the constable as to mark their submission to the will of the king even when it was most disadvantageous     to them they avoided every thing which could revive the distrust against them and too openly in disgrace to think of elevating themselves to those dignities which they thought alone suitable to their birth and too haughty to descend to the smaller places they renounced all the honors and offices of the court the same causes produce the same effects the late revolution in france opened a prospect to the royal family not very different from that in      though the merits and injuries of orleans may not be compared to those of a constable de bourbon yet the passions of a prince of the blood of the second order may hereafter be painted by another davila opportunity will generally excite ambition to aspire and if even an improbable case should happen of an exception to this rule danger will always be suspected and apprehended in such circumstances from such causes we may soon see that a form of government in which every passion has an adequate counterpoise can alone secure the public from the dangers and mischiefs of such rivalries jealousies envies and hatreds xv auguste verité cest à toi de montrer aux yeux des nations les coupables effets de leurs divisions when one family is depressed either in a monarchy or in any species of republic another must arise while in the reign of francis i they thus humbled the branch of the bourbons there arose two other powerful families who soon obtained the administration of affairs—the house of montmorenci and that of guise both indeed inferior to the blood royal but both illustrious by the splendor of the most ancient nobility that of montmorenci produces titles which prove its descent by an uninterrupted succession from one of the principal grandees who accompanied pharamond in his first expedition it has the glory of having been the first french house which received baptism and the christian faith the memory of this distinction is preserved in the motto of their arms—god help the first christian baron a splendid testimony both of the     antiquity and religion of their ancestors anne of montmorenci who united a vast genius directed by prudence to a grave and imposing deportment who combined a singular address to a patience never to be exhausted in the intrigues and affairs of the court which change so often their aspect sprung from this stock his high qualities merited the confidence of francis i after having passed through all the military gradations of the state he was at first elevated to the dignity of grand master of the kings household and after the death of the duke of bourbon to that of constable in one word he concentred in his person the command of armies and the principal administration of all the affairs civil and political of the kingdom the house of lorraine of which that of guise is a branch derives its original from the highest antiquity it reckons among its paternal ancestors godfrey of bouillon the famous leader of the crusades who by his valor and piety conquered the kingdom of jerusalem and by the female line it traces its descent from a daughter of charlemagne anthony of lorraine chief of this rich and powerful family reigned over his people with an absolute authority claude his younger brother went into france to take possession of the duchy of guise and there recommended himself by his valor after the battle of marignano where he commanded the german troops he was taken out from a heap of dead bodies covered over with blood and wounds his cure was thought to be a miracle and he held afterwards the first rank among the greatest captains of france the houses of guise and montmorenci had rendered services of such importance to the state that it was difficult to determine which of the two merited the preëminence in the splendor of their birth and the extent of their domains the guises had the advantage in the favor of the king the family of the constable was most advanced and saw itself at the head of affairs nature which has established in the universe a chain of being and universal order descending from archangels to microscopic animalcules has ordained that no two objects shall be perfectly alike and no two creatures perfectly equal although among men all are subject by nature to equal laws of morality and in     society have a right to equal laws for their government yet no two men are perfectly equal in person property understanding activity and virtue or ever can be made so by any power less than that which created them and whenever it becomes disputable between two individuals or families which is the superior a fermentation commences which disturbs the order of all things until it is settled and each one knows his place in the opinion of the public the question of superiority between the guises and montmorencis had the usual effects of such doubts but as nothing is less stable than the fortune of courtiers in illordered governments they both experienced reverses towards the end of the reign of francis i that jealousy which never has an end because it is always well founded which reigns in every government where every passion and every interest has not its correspondent counterpoise actuated the king the two ministers not being subject to any regular plan of responsibility were become dangerous rivals of their master their enemies knew how to insinuate suspicions the constable fell into disgrace for having persuaded the king to trust the promises of charles v and to grant him a free passage through france as he went to chastise the rebellion of ghent the emperor not keeping his engagements the king and the court accused the constable of having failed either in prudence or fidelity he was obliged to leave the court and return to private life to conceal himself from the pursuits of his enemies the duke of guise was also constrained to quit the court and give way to the storm for having incurred the displeasure of the king by causing to be raised upon the frontiers without his consent certain troops which he sent to the duke of lorraine his brother at that time at war with the anabaptists the constable and the duke of guise thus disgraced were replaced by two ministers of consummate experience indefatigable industry and acknowledged abilities—the admiral dannebaut and the cardinal de tournon the mediocrity of their fortune and extraction excited little apprehension that they would ever arrive at that high power of which the king had reason to be jealous and which he dreaded in the hands of his subjects this prince who understood mankind and was become     unquiet and suspicious since his disgraces had long resolved to dismiss from his person the constable and the duke notwithstanding the long confidence with which he had honored them believing that he should not be able to govern according to his own mind while he should have about him two persons whose credit and reputation were capable of balancing his will he dreaded in the constable that profound experience and that lively penetration from which he could not conceal his most hidden secrets every thing was to him suspicious in the guises their illustrious birth their restless humor their active genius that ardent character to embrace every occasion to aggrandize themselves and that ambition capable of forming projects the most vast and daring as the judicial courts had no independence and there was no regular judicature for impeachments there could be no rational responsibility the king could inflict none but arbitrary punishments there was no tribunal but the statesgeneral and their committees and among these the ministers had as many friends as the king the ministers therefore thought themselves and as the constitution then stood they really were so nearly equal to the king in power that they might do as they pleased with impunity they presumed too far and the king was justly offended but had no remedy except in the assassination or dismission of his ministers he chose the latter though in the sequel we shall see many instances in similar cases of the former in the last years of his life this monarch if we may call by that name a prince who was in effect nothing more than the first individual in a miserable oligarchy secretly recommended to prince henry his son to distrust the excessive power of his subjects and especially of the house of guise whose elevation would infallibly disturb the repose of the kingdom francis now saw and felt that the house of guise was become as the house of bourbon had been before a dangerous rival of the house of valois ambition disappointed and disgraced by a king commonly becomes obsequious to the heir apparent or ostensible successor in      henry ii the successor of francis i disregarding the advice and example of his father dismissed from his court and service the admiral and the cardinal though possessed of his     secrets of the state and placed again at the head of affairs the constable anne of montmorenci and francis of lorraine son of claude duke of guise who soon engaged the confidence of the young king and regulated every thing at his court their authority was equal but as has been once observed nature has decreed that a perfect equality shall never long exist between any two mortals the views the conduct and the characters of the two ministers were unlike in all things the constable advanced in years was naturally fond of peace formed by a long experience in the art of government he enjoyed a high reputation for wisdom and held the first place in the conduct of affairs of state the duke in the flower of his age captivated by an elevated genius and sprightly wit united with a robust constitution and a noble figure the affections of the king henry treated him almost as his equal admitted him to his conversations his pleasures and those exercises of the body which were suitable to his age and inclination his affection for the constable was rather veneration his attachment to the duke was familiarity the conduct of the two favorites was very different the one an enemy of all show urged with a certain severity from which age is seldom exempted the necessity of economy he even opposed the profusion of the prince his austere virtue inspired a contempt for foreigners and rendered him little solicitous for the affection of the french the duke of guise affable and popular gained by his liberalities and politeness the hearts of the people and the soldiers with a generous warmth he protected the unfortunate and conciliated the esteem of strangers inclinations and conduct so opposite soon produced jealousies between the two ministers equally beloved of the king to insinuate themselves further into the royal graces and make themselves masters of his favors they exerted all their skill address and efforts their emulation and ambition were stimulated by their nearest relations and private friends the constable was irritated by his nephew gaspard de coligni lord of châtillon who had succeeded to the admiral dannebaut and who was not less distinguished for his policy than eminent for valor the duke of guise was animated by the cardinal charles of lorraine his brother who united the splendor of the roman purple     to a noble figure profound erudition and uncommon eloquence henceforward the demon of rivalry haunted the two houses of guise and montmorenci and fortune did not fail to open a vast career to the animated emulation of the two competitors xvi opposant sans relâche avec trop de prudence les guises aux condés et la france à la france toujours prête à sunir avec ses ennemis et changeant dintérêt de rivaux et damis the rivalry between the houses of guise and montmorenci or in other words the ambition of the cardinal de lorraine and the duke of guise to outstrip the montmorenci produced a war charles v was preparing with a numerous army to lay siege to metz it was not doubted that the conduct of so important a war would be committed to one of the two favorites but the constable montmorenci more than sixty years of age preferred a residence near the person of the king to a risk of his reputation in new dangers the duke of guise on the contrary full of courage and burning with ardor to distinguish himself solicited the command with the more vivacity as he saw no other resource than in military successes to efface the credit and eclipse the glory of the constable† he was therefore charged with the defence of metz with the consent or at least without the opposition of the constable who internally was not displeased to see his competitor expose his life or his reputation to danger the duke fulfilled perfectly the idea which had been   0 conceived of his valor and prudence uncertain as the success of the enterprise had been he came out of it victorious and covered with glory this great action did him so much honor with the king and the whole nation that they committed to him in preference of all others the command of the army which they sent afterwards to italy to reconquer the kingdom of naples either by the fault of the french or the inconstancy of their allies this expedition failed or at least produced little advantage yet the ill success was not imputed to the duke who drew from it more glory than he could have done from a victory for this reason—philip ii king of spain upon the abdication of his father charles v turned his arms against the frontiers of france and entered through flanders into picardie to make a diversion from the war in italy the constable as governor of that province was then obliged to take leave of the king and against his inclination run the hazards of war the loss of the battle of saintquintin where the spaniards took him prisoner spread a consternation through all the neighboring provinces the friends of the guises in council could discover no surer means of repelling this invasion of the enemy of repairing the losses and preventing the consequences of this defeat than by recalling from italy the duke of guise the celerity of his return added to the memorable conquests of calais guisne and thionville fully justified these hopes and gave him that superiority over the constable that a conqueror must ever have over one who is conquered the constable however obtained his liberty and returned to court the kings affection for him was not abated henry attributing his late misfortunes to the lot of arms and the fortune of war conversed familiarly with him and still convinced of his capacity confided to him the weight of public affairs in the critical circumstances of the state the duke and the cardinal who had acquired a great reputation the one by his exploits and the other by his abilities apprehended that if they could not throw some powerful obstacle in the way of the constable he would rise higher in favor than ever they resolved therefore to gain to their party diana duchess of valentinois to connect their interests with hers and to make her protection and favor serve as a foundation of their elevation and who was diana     of illustrious birth descended from the ancient house of the counts of poitiers in the flower of her age she united with uncommon beauty a sprightly wit an acute and subtle understanding the most insinuating graces of behavior and all the other qualities which in a young woman enchant the eyes and captivate the heart she had married the sénéchal of normandy who soon left her a widow with two daughters she took advantage of her single state to deliver herself up to the pleasures and amusements of the court her charms gained the heart of the king whom she governed with an absolute empire but  she behaved with so much arrogance and appropriated to herself the riches of the crown with so much avidity that she made herself odious and insupportable to the whole kingdom the queen full of indignation to have a rival so powerful behaved towards her with an exterior decency but in her heart bore her an implacable hatred the nobility whom she had ill treated in the persons of several gentlemen could not with patience see themselves trampled under foot by the pride of a woman and the people detested her avarice to which they imputed the rigorous imposts with which they were loaded the guises without regard to the general discontent sensible only to the fear of losing their power sought the friendship of the duchess who soon declared herself openly in their favor and by marrying one of her daughters to the duke of aumale their brother supported them with all her credit the constable easily unravelled the intrigues of the guises and not depending on the marks of confidence which he received from the king thought to fortify himself equally with the protection of diana if the guises had flattered her by the splendor of their birth he did not despair to gain her to his interest by satisfying her avarice a passion as ungovernable in her heart as ambition he began to make his court to her and endeavored to gain her by considerable presents he had so much at heart the success of his measures that in spite of his natural pride he did not hesitate to seek also her alliance by espousing to henry lord of damville his second son antoinette de la marck granddaughter by the mother of the duchess of valentinois a resolution so much the more imprudent as diana was already strictly united     with the party of the guises and labored sincerely with all her power for their aggrandizement whereas she favored but coldly the designs of the constable all the means which had been employed in opposition to the elevation of the guises became useless to the merit of their services to the intrigues by which they had continually advanced themselves at the time when they disputed with so much vivacity with their rivals for the first rank at the court was added the marriage of francis the dauphin of france and the eldest son of the king with the princess mary sole heiress of the kingdom of scotland daughter of james stuart lately deceased by mary of lorraine sister of the duke and cardinal an alliance of so much magnificence drew them near to the throne there remained now to the constable and his family only the friendly sentiments which the king preserved for them by habit and to the other courtiers only the offices of smaller importance the principal dignities the fairest governments and the general superintendence of affairs civil and military all were placed in the hands of the guises and their creatures while all minds were held in agitation at court by these events the bourbons saw themselves notwithstanding their proximity of blood and pretensions to the crown contrary to the usage of the nation excluded from employments and honors except when the necessity of a war or the exercise of some office of little consequence which remained to them required their presence they appeared not at court it is true that the count danguien one of the princes of this house had advanced himself by his merit and valor the king had given him the command of his army in piedmont the battle of cérizolles which he gained against the spaniards had raised his reputation but this advantage was too transitory to raise the house of bourbon this prince died by accident in the flower of his age and his brother the duke danguien was killed at the battle of st quintin there remained therefore none of the children of charles of bourbon but anthony duke of vendôme and king of navarre by his marriage with jane of albret louis prince of condé the stock of the branches of condé and conti killed afterwards at jarnac and charles     cardinal of bourbon proclaimed king afterward by the leaguers under the name of charles x the chiefs of the house were now anthony duke of vendôme and louis prince of condé his brother both sons of charles of vendôme who after the revolt of the constable de bourbon and the captivity of francis i by his moderation and disinterestedness had somewhat calmed the hatred which had been violently enkindled against those of his blood these princes depressed by the guises whom they called strangers and newcomers from lorraine complained bitterly that except the right of succession to the crown which no man could take from them they were deprived of all their privileges and especially of the honor of residing near the person of the king that they scarcely held any rank in a court where their birth called them to the first places after his majesty and that such conduct was equally inconsistent with reason and equity the king however maintained with inflexibility the power of the guises against all remonstances and complaints the bourbons endured with less impatience the elevation of the constable montmorenci on the contrary they were severely mortified to see his credit diminish united with him by an alliance by views and by interests they flattered themselves they might obtain by his means a decent rank if they could not reascend to that which their ancestors had possessed but now deprived of that hope which supports the unfortunate by softening the sentiment of their ills they bore with still greater impatience their disgraces anthony of vendôme a prince of a mild and moderate character appeared to support them with more tranquillity than the others because he meditated great designs he had married jane of albret only daughter of henry king of navarre and after the death of his father in law he had taken the crown and title of king his project was to recover his kingdom of navarre of which the spaniards had made themselves masters for several years during the war between louis xii and ferdinand the catholic the kings of france to whose interest this state had been sacrificed had attempted several times to reconquer it the spaniards who could easily march troops to its relief had hitherto defended it but the two crowns being then upon the point of concluding a solid peace the king of navarre hoped to comprehend in the treaty and to obtain a restitution of     his hereditary states or at least an equivalent he was confirmed in this thought by the birth of a son to whom he gave the name of henry in memory of his maternal grandfather this is the prince whom the splendor of his victories raised after long and bloody wars to the throne of france under the name of henry iv and whose exploits and virtues have merited the name of great he was born the thirteenth of december      at pau the capital of béarn this birth which filled with joy the king and queen of navarre inspired them with more ardor to recover their dominion anthony chose rather to interest the king of france to demand this restitution in the treaty of peace than to solicit in quality of first prince of the blood governments and dignities in the kingdom it was this which engaged him to dissemble with more patience and moderation than the rest the injustice done to his house the king persisting in the design of lowering continually the princes of the blood or perhaps irritated at the refusal of anthony to exchange béarn and his other states for cities and territories situated in the interior of the kingdom had dismembered from guienne of which the king of navarre was governor as first prince of the blood languedoc and the city of toulouse to give the government of them to the constable but the king of navarre showing little resentment of this injustice pursued constantly his first views louis prince of condé brother to the king of navarre full of ambition and inquietude and not restrained by similar interests saw with grief the mediocrity of his fortune answer so ill to the splendor of his birth without offices governments or employments to support him he could not bear but with a discontent which he took no pains to conceal the excessive grandeur of the guises who monopolized for themselves the first dignities and fairest employments of the kingdom to his personal mortification he joined the disgrace of the constable whose niece he had espoused he was so strictly connected with him and the maréchal of montmorenci his son that he saw in the humiliation of their house the completion of his own misfortunes the admiral of châtillon and dandelot his brother irritated him still more by their advice the first was an ambitious but an able politician who took a secret advantage of all occasions to profit of troubles to raise himself to     high power the other fiery passionate continually occupied in intrigues and plots ceased not by his discourse and example to nourish in the heart of louis the hatred already too deeply enkindled this prince transported with rage and almost reduced to despair saw no resource for himself but by causing a revolution in the state such was the situation of affairs such the jealousies and animosities of the grandees ready on the slightest occasion to break out in an open rupture when in the month of july      happened the unexpected death of henry ii killed by accident in a tournament by gabriel count of montgommeri one of the captains of his guards francis ii his eldest son with a weak understanding and a delicate constitution succeeded him those evils which even under his father had been expected hastened to make themselves felt under his feeble reign secret enmities were easily changed into declared hatreds and recourse was soon had to arms the youth and imbecility of the king rendered him incapable of governing it was necessary that he should have not a guardian because he had passed the age of fourteen years the term fixed for the majority of the kings of france but ministers prudent and laborious who should govern under his authority until time should have fortified his understanding and invigorated his constitution the ancient usage of the kingdom called the princes of the blood to this place and indicated the king of navarre and the prince de condé who united to the proximity of blood an established reputation the duke of guise and the cardinal of lorraine uncles of the king by his marriage with the queen of scots pretended that this honor belonged to them in consideration of their long labors and services to the crown but especially because they had in fact enjoyed it during the life of the late king catherine of medici mother of the king expected to govern alone she depended on the filial tenderness of her son several examples authorized her pretensions but she founded her strongest hopes on the divisions of the grandees and the terror of each faction lest the other should carry the point facilitated her design the guises were sensible that they wanted the advantage of being of the blood to which the laws and customs of the nation had usually confided the government of the kingdom     they foresaw moreover the empire which the counsels of a mother would have over the mind of her son still young and without experience they resolved therefore by joining and acting in concert with her to divide a power which they despaired of obtaining entire the queen a princess of refined genius and masculine courage knew that the princes of the blood suffered with impatience the authority and grandeur of queens she thought also that as a stranger and an italian she had occasion to fortify herself with the support of some faction she consented therefore cheerfully to combine with the guises whom she saw disposed to accept of part of that authority which the bourbons would have pretended to appropriate to themselves without partition there was but one obstacle to the intimacy of this union and that was the unlucky connection of the guises with the duchess of valentinois who had possessed the heart of the late king to the time of his death the occasion was pressing and the importance of the business would not admit of delay on one hand the queen to whom dissimulation was not difficult agreed to appear to forget the past with the same moderation which she had shown in bearing with her rival during the life of her husband on the other the guises occupied wholly with their present interest easily betrayed their friend by consenting that the duchess should be disgraced and dismissed from the court they only required that she should not be totally stripped of those immense riches which must one day revert to the duke of aumale their brother the king of navarre was then absent and very discontented with the king and the court who in the treaty concluded with spain had given no attention to his interests nor to the restitution of his states the new coalition at court had with great address disembarrassed themselves of the constable by deputing him to do the honors of the obsequies of henry ii the personage who has that commission must not absent himself from the place where the body is deposited during the threeandthirty days that the funeral pomp continues artifice and accident having thus removed the two great obstacles it was not difficult to obtain of francis ii seduced by the caresses and the charms of his scottish queen an arrangement by which he placed the reins of government in the hands of his nearest relations every thing which concerned the war was committed to     the duke of guise the cardinal had the departments of justice and finance and the queen mother the superintendence of all parts of the government to establish their measures which had so well succeeded and that the complaints and intrigues of the disaffected might not shake the resolution of the king and disarrange their plan there was no doubt but the first stroke of their policy would fall upon the constable whose prudence and credit were dreaded by the guises and against whom the queen had for some time entertained a secret aversion the guises feared him on account of the jealousy which for a long time had openly divided their houses because notwithstanding the fall of his favor at court the reputation of his wisdom preserved him a great influence throughout the whole kingdom in their secret interviews with the king they artfully drew the conversation to this subject and exaggerated to him the reputation which the constable enjoyed xvii ses mains autour du trône avec confusion semaient la jalousie et la division voltaire †the guises insinuated that if the constable resided at the court he would be assuming would think to govern his majesty like an infant and even to hold him under the ferule and the rod they represented his intimate connections with the bourbons the eternal enemies of a crown to which they had for so long     aspired finally they suggested that he could not confide in the constable without exposing his life and the lives of his brothers to the discretion of people whose ambition the kings his predecessors had always dreaded and whom they had ever held in a state of humiliation and at a distance from court penetrating genius easily inspires suspicions into contracted minds nothing more was wanting to persuade a weak king to seek a pretext honorably to dismiss the constable as soon as the ceremony of the obsequies of henry ii was completed the king overwhelming him with caresses signified to him that not being able with sufficient dignity to acknowledge his merit nor the value of the services which he had rendered the kings his ancestors he had resolved to discharge him from the cares and burthens of government too disproportionate to his great age that he would no longer require of him any excessive application to business but would reserve him for some occasions of éclat that he should always consider him not as a servant and a subject but as a venerable father and that he would give him leave to retire wherever he saw fit the constable easily comprehended that this lesson had been taught the king by the guises through the queen mother and the queen of scots that it would be useless to remonstrate and that it was better to receive as a recompense orders which his resistance might convert into disgrace he thanked the king recommended to him his sons and nephews and retired to his castle at chantilly ten leagues from paris where he had more than once before supported vicissitudes of fortune as soon as the queen mother and the guises had banished the constable they studied to disembarrass themselves of the prince de condé it was easy to foresee that his fiery temper and his animosity against the guises would transport him to attempt all the means imaginable to change the established form of government it may be remarked in this place that these expressions intimate an idea of reformation of government and regeneration of nations like those which prevail at this time in france and in many other countries after the example of america one would conjecture that the prince of condé had it in contemplation to establish committees of correspondence to call a convention or national assembly to deliberate on a rational plan of     government to be adopted by the nation at large there are indeed in history some traces of a party who wished for a republican government about this time but unfortunately their ideas of a republic appear to have been the same with those which prevail too much at present in france two hundred and fifty years of experience have not yet brought the nation to advert to the true principles in nature upon which government is founded the marquis of condorcet the friend of turgot and rochefoucauld so great in geometry is not more accurate in the science of government than etienne de la boetie the friend of de thou and montaigne the same reformation is wanting now that was so necessary in    0 whether a sovereignty in one single assembly constituted by a double representation as the present assembly is would have answered then or will succeed now are questions that hereafter may deserve consideration it ended formerly after a hundred years of civil wars in the simple absolute monarchy of louis xiv time must determine whether the continued deliberations and exertions of the national assembly will finally obtain a balance in their government† this is the point on which their success will turn if they fail in this simple monarchy or what is more to be dreaded simple despotism‡ after long struggles will infallibly return if the wild idea of annihilating the nobility should spread far and be long persisted in the men of letters§ and the national assembly as democratical as they may think themselves will find no barrier against despotism the french as well as the creek indians at this time our respectable guests∥ and all other nations civilized and uncivilized have their beloved families and nothing but despotism ever did or ever can prevent them from being distinguished by the people these beloved families in france are the nobility five eighths of the present  00 national assembly are noble the first fresh election will show the world the attachment of the people to those families in short the whole power of the nation will fall into their hands and a commoner will stand no chance for an election after a little time unless he enlist himself under the banner and into the regiment of some nobleman for the commoners this project of one assembly is the most impolitic imaginable it is the highest flight of aristocracy to the royal authority it is equally fatal as to the commons in what manner the nobility ought to be reformed modified methodized and wrought by representation or otherwise into an independent branch of the legislature what form of government would have been best for france under francis ii and whether the same is not now necessary under louis xvi are questions too deep and extensive perhaps for us to determine but we are very competent to demonstrate two propositions—first that a sovereignty in a single assembly cannot secure the peace liberty or safety of the people secondly that a federative republic or in other words a confederation of the republic of paris with the republics of the provinces will not be sufficient to secure the tranquillity liberty property or lives of the nation in some future time if neither business of more importance nor amusements more agreeable should engage us we may throw together a few thoughts upon these questions this may be done without the smallest apprehension of ever being confuted for although we should fail to produce arguments to convince our readers we know with infallible certainty that time will supply all our defects and demonstrate for us the truth of both the propositions at present we return to the narration of davila the prince de condés quality of prince of the blood and the want of plausible pretexts did not permit the guises so  0  easily to dismiss him from court they found however a favorable occasion to send him off for a time till the new ministry should be well established by nominating him plenipotentiary to the king of spain to ratify the peace and alliance contracted a little before the death of henry ii he quitted the court upon this embassy and left the field open for the perfection of projects which were as yet only in outline the queen mother and the guises proceeded in the same manner with all whom they feared strongly determined to consummate their designs they judged that they could succeed only by arranging all the strong places as well as the troops the finances and all the resources of the state under their own disposition so that the most important affairs should pass through no hands but their own or those of their creatures nevertheless to show that they consulted their interest less than the public good and their own glory they did not elevate to dignities people without merit and drawn from the dust for fear they should be thought to make creatures for themselves at any rate but they conferred favors only on persons who added acknowledged merit to conspicuous birth and above all estimable in the eyes of the people for integrity this conduct had a double advantage the first that the people commonly applauded their choice and their opponents had no pretence to condemn it the second that confiding in persons of honor and fidelity they were not exposed to be deceived nor to suspect their attachment as it often happens to those who commit the execution of their designs to people of base extraction or dishonored by their manners in this view they restored to office francis olivier formerly chancellor of the kingdom a personage of known integrity and inflexible firmness in the exercise of his employment the vigor with which he avowed and supported his sentiments had caused his dismission from court from the beginning of the reign of henry ii and the instigations of the constable had not a little contributed to his disgrace they recalled also to council and near the person of the king the cardinal de tournon who in the time of francis i grandfather of the reigning prince had the principal conduct of affairs by these measures they flattered the multitude and fulfilled the expectations of the public without neglecting their own interests the probity of the cardinal and the chancellor had rendered  0  them dear to the people who knew how often they had declared themselves against the multiplication of imposts with which they were oppressed moreover disgraced by the intrigues of the constable and recalled with honor by the guises they must both from resentment and gratitude support with their counsels and all their influence the projects of aggrandizement formed by the latter many others had been gained by similar artifices but the same management was not used with the house of bourbon nor with the family of the constable on the contrary the princes of lorraine drawn away by the desire of annihilating the credit of their ancient rival and of abasing the royal family seized with ardor every occasion of diminishing the authority and increasing the losses of their enemies the admiral gaspard de coligni had two different governments—that of the isle of france and that of picardie but as the laws of the kingdom permitted not the possession of more than one dignity or one government at the same time the late king had destined that of picardie to the prince de condé to appease his resentment and soften his complaints the prince earnestly desired this favor to which indeed he had just pretensions his father and the king of navarre had successively held it and the admiral had resigned it in consideration of the prince but the death of henry ii happening near the same time had hindered the effect of this arrangement which had already been made public francis ii had no regard to it at the solicitation of the guises and by a manifest injustice to the prince he granted this place to charles de cossé maréchal de brissac a captain of high reputation and great valor but who having been promoted by the favor of the princes of lorraine was closely attached to them and served them with zeal nor was there more attention paid to francis of montmorenci the eldest son of the constable he had married diana natural daughter of henry ii in consideration of this marriage he had been promised the office of grand master of the kings household a place which had been long held by his father from the first days of the reign of francis ii the duke of guise took it for himself that he might add this new éclat to his other dignities as well as deprive of it a house which he wished to depress thus the duke and the cardinal embraced with ardor every occasion of mortifying their rivals and aggrandizing themselves  0  the queen mother who foresaw that this unlimited ambition and this violent hatred must have fatal effects desired that they should act with more moderation management and dexterity but she dared not in the beginning oppose herself to the wills nor traverse the designs of those whose influence was the principal support of her authority at this time the bourbons excluded from all parts of the government banished from court and without hopes of carrying their complaints to the foot of the throne beginning to reflect upon the situation of their affairs and the conduct of their enemies who not content with their present grandeur labored by all sorts of means to perpetuate it resolved to remain no longer inactive spectators of their own misfortunes but to prevent the ruin that threatened them to this purpose a convention was called and we shall soon see what kind of convention it was anthony king of navarre after having left in béarn his son yet an infant under the conduct of the queen his wife as in an asylum at a distance from that conflagration which they saw ready to be lighted up in france repaired to vendôme with the prince of condé already returned from his embassy the admiral dandelot and the cardinal of châtillon his brothers charles comte de la rochefoucauld francis vidâme de chartres anthony prince of porcien all relations or common friends assembled also with several other noblemen attached for many years to the houses of montmorenci and bourbon the constable who although to all appearance wholly engaged in the delights of private life secretly set in motion all the springs of this enterprise had sent to this assembly at ardres his ancient and confidential secretary with instructions concerning the affairs to be there agitated they took into consideration the part which it was necessary to act in the present conjuncture of affairs all agreed in the same end but opinions as usual were divided concerning the means all equally felt the atrocious affronts committed against the princes of the blood for the guises had not only taken from them the first places in the government but the small number of dignities which had remained to them they saw evidently that the design was nothing less than to oppress these princes and their partisans all perceived the necessity of preventing so pressing  0  a danger without waiting for the last extremity but they were not equally agreed concerning the measures proper to ward it off xviii lun et lautre parti cruel également ainsi que dans le crime est dans laveuglement voltaire in the assembly convention caucus or conspiracy at ardres call it by which name you will the prince de condé the vidâme de chartres dandelot and others of a character more irritable and violent were of opinion that without leaving to the guises the time to augment their credit and their forces they should fly to arms as the remedy the most expeditious and the most efficacious  in vain said they shall we wait for the king of his own motion to determine to restore us the rank which is our right this prince incapable of deciding for himself will never come out of that lethargy in which he has been stupefied from his infancy governed by his mother and the guises he will never dare to redemand the power which he has so blindly abandoned to them how can the just complaints of the princes of the blood and the nobles the best affectioned to the welfare of the state ever reach the ear of a monarch who even in the service of his person is constantly surrounded with spies stationed by his ministers and sold to their tyranny what dependence can we have on the resolutions of a prince to whom they will represent our requisitions under the blackest colors and the odious appellations of revolts conspiracies and plots can we hope that the queen mother and the guises will dismiss themselves in favor of their enemies and rivals from a part of that power which has cost them so much labor and so many artifices this expectation would be more chimerical than the former men do not weakly abandon an authority which they have once usurped with so much boldness whoever arrives by slow and secret intrigues to unlawful power enjoys it haughtily and preserves it at all hazards the power and authority of the laws  0  may impose on private persons but they give way to force which alone decides the rights and interests of princes so much reserve and timidity on our part will only serve to augment the confidence and temerity of our enemies to begin by complaining would be to sound an alarm before an attack and to advertise our competitors to put themselves on their guard the promptitude of execution alone decides the success of great enterprises sloth and irresolution debase the courage enervate the forces and lose the opportunity which flies so rapidly away let us hasten then to take arms and overwhelm our enemies before they have time to collect themselves and let us not ruin our own hopes and projects by cowardly precautions and unseasonable delays the king of navarre the admiral the prince of porcien and the secretary of the constable in the name of his master rejected with horror counsels so extreme and proposed remedies less violent whatever protestations we may make they replied that we take arms only to deliver the king from the tyranny of strangers and that we aspire not to his authority our conduct will be ill interpreted all good frenchmen religiously attached to the person of the king will see our enterprise with indignation is it permitted to subjects to lay violence or constraint on their sovereign under any pretext or for any reason whatever do the laws of the kingdom authorize us to force our master to confide to us any portion of his authority he has passed his fourteenth year and ought no longer to be in tutelage thus our pretensions formed only on decency propriety and simple equity had better be urged with delicacy and moderation than by ways so violent as those of arms by employing the means which prudence and address may suggest to us let us not despair of gaining on the inclinations of the queen mother as soon as she can see her safety in our party we shall see the power of the guises dissolve and we shall open to ourselves a way equally honorable and easy to the execution of our designs the princes of lorraine have had hitherto no obstacle in their way perhaps when they see a formidable opposition arising they will determine to cede to us a part in the government we will then avail ourselves of opportunities to secure us against the dangers which threaten us and the outrages with which they overwhelm us is it not better to be  0  satisfied with reasonable conditions than to expose all to the inconstancy of fortune and the hazardous decision of arms have we in france forces to oppose to our lawful sovereign what succor can we expect from foreign powers who have lately renewed their alliances with the king to take arms at present would be to precipitate the house of bourbon into the deepest misfortunes rather than to open to us an honorable reception into the government this last sentiment prevailed and it was resolved that the king of navarre as the chief of the house and the first prince of the blood should repair to court and negotiate with the queen mother and endeavor to obtain some part in the administration of government for himself and for his brothers and partisans the governments and dignities of which they had been deprived or others equivalent it was foreseen however that the success would not be happy the king of navarre intimidated by the difficulty of the enterprise acted with a delicacy irresolution and complaisance dictated by that softness and moderation which formed the essence of his character the guises on the contrary full of that confidence which prosperity inspires prepared to repel with vigor the attempt that was made against them in concert with the queen they repeated incessantly to the young monarch that his predecessors had always mortified the princes of the blood as enemies to the reigning branch against which they never ceased to operate sometimes by secret cabals and sometimes by open force that in the present circumstances the king of navarre and the prince de condé seeing themselves so near the throne under a king of a tender complexion who had no children and whose brothers were under age sought only to deprive him of the support of his mother and his nearest relations that they might govern him at pleasure and hold him in dependence as the maires of the palace had formerly held the clovises the chilperics and other princes incapable of reigning that perhaps there was no crime at which they would hesitate even to employing poison or the sword to open a passage for themselves to the throne the king naturally timid and suspicious preoccupied by these artificial accusations which were colored with some appearance of probability saw with an evil eye the king of navarre and received him coldly in the audiences which he granted him always in the presence of the duke and the cardinal  0  who never quitted him a moment he gave him none but dry answers alleging that he was of age that he was not responsible to any man for his actions that he was satisfied with the good services of those who governed under him and rejected constantly all the requests and demands of the princes of the blood as irregular unreasonable and made with ill designs the efforts of the king of navarre had no better success with the queen mother she knew that she could not depend upon the attachment which the princes of the blood professed to her that as soon as they should obtain what they solicited they would exclude her from the government and force her perhaps to quit the court she judged moreover that it would be imprudent to abandon the most powerful and the best established party to attach herself to the princes of the blood who had no certain support she determined therefore to pursue her first plan but as she wished to prevent the horrors of a civil war she proposed to herself not entirely to take away all hopes from the princes but to make use of artifice and dissimulation to divert the king of navarre whose docility she knew from the designs which he had formed and to wait from time and conjunctures some expedient advantageous to the welfare of the state in consequence she received him with great demonstrations of friendship and amused him with the fairest hopes in the course of conversations which they had together she insinuated that the passions of the king were easily irritated that he must not be vexed with demands and complaints out of season that it was necessary to wait for opportunities more favorable that the king having passed his fourteenth year might govern by himself and without taking counsel of any one that when he should find an opportunity to manifest his benevolence for the princes of bourbon he would fulfil all that was required of him by the relations of blood and would prove to all the world the esteem and consideration which he entertained of their merit and fidelity that to change all at once in the beginning of a reign the order established in the government would be to give the king among his own subjects the reputation of an inconstant prince without prudence and without firmness that if any employment worthy of them should be vacant he would have a regard to the justice of their pretensions that in her own particular she offered herself voluntarily to manage  0  their interests with her son to engage him to grant them as soon as should be possible the satisfaction they desired that it was not decent that the king of navarre who had always evinced his wisdom and moderation should now suffer himself to be guided by counsels and drawn into rash measures which were neither consistent with his age nor character but by waiting with patience for what depended wholly on the benevolence and affection of the king he ought to teach others how to merit in their season the favor and beneficence of his majesty the queen having sounded him at several times by such general discourses and perceiving that he began to waver completely gained him at length by saying that they must immediately send into spain elizabeth the sister of the king who must be attended by some prince distinguished by his reputation and by his rank that she had cast her eyes on him as the personage the most proper to support the honor of the nation by the splendor of his virtues and of the majesty royal with which he was adorned that besides the satisfaction which the king her son would have in it he would find a great advantage for his private pretensions by the facility which he would have of conciliating the affections of the catholic king and at the same time of treating in person of the restitution or of the change of navarre finally she promised him to employ all her credit and all the power of the king her son to insure the success of this negotiation the king of navarre in analyzing the dispositions of the court had observed that all those who were employed by the government satisfied with the present situation of affairs troubled themselves very little about the pretensions of the princes of the blood and that those who had an interest to desire his grandeur and that of his brother either intimidated by the power of their enemies or disconcerted by his extreme delays despaired equally of the success of his enterprise he returned therefore easily to his first design of recovering his states and judged that he ought not to let slip an opportunity so favorable for renewing the negotiations of accommodation with the crown of spain and of quitting decently a court where he could no longer remain with honor he accepted cheerfully the commission of conducting the young queen into spain the queen mother continued to delude him with magnificent hopes and in spite of the discontent of the other princes of his  0  party he pressed his departure with as much ardor as even his enemies could have desired he suffered himself to be duped in spain with the same facility the queen mother had already informed philip ii of all this manœuvre this monarch who desired equally with her to see humiliated and excluded from the government the king of navarre so ardent to make good his pretensions to some part of his dominions instructed the duke of alva and the other grandees who were to receive the queen his consort not to reject the propositions of this prince but to lead him on and amuse him by receiving them seriously and offering to make report of them to his catholic majesty and the council of spain without whose advice they could not determine any affair of state as soon as the king of navarre was arrived on the frontiers and had presented the queen elizabeth to the spanish lords he began to speak to them of his interests and thought himself sure at first of success the spaniards conducted the negotiation with an address which served to nourish his hopes at the same time that they let him know that the effect could not be immediate they engaged him even to send ambassadors to madrid so that solely occupied with his first designs he retired to béarn fully resolved not to meddle in the affairs of france where negotiation appeared ineffectual and the project of arms as dangerous as it was dishonorable the prince of condé his brother had opposite views and took very different resolutions his fortune was not commensurate with his courage nor with the extent of his designs excited by the mediocrity of his circumstances by the hatred which he bore to the guises and incessantly stimulated by his motherinlaw and his wife one the sister and the other the niece of the constable both devoured by ambition he openly detested the government of the queen mother and the guises all his thoughts and actions tended to a revolution he figured to himself that if the war should be enkindled by his intrigues and for his interests not only he would become the chief of a numerous party but moreover he would procure to himself riches advantages and perhaps the sovereignty of several cities and provinces of the kingdom full of these high ideas he   0 assembled again at la ferté an estate of his inheritance situated on the frontiers of champagne the princes of his blood and the principal lords of his party and harangued them in this manner in vain have we hitherto employed the means of delicacy and moderation it is only hereafter by the most vigorous efforts that we can prevent the ruin of the royal family and of all those who have not been able to resolve to cringe servilely under the tyranny of the queen mother and the guises it is no longer seasonable to dissemble outrages of which no man can be ignorant and which we have suffered with too much patience we are banished from court and the government of picardie and the office of grandmaster is taken from us finances offices dignities are the prey of foreigners and persons unknown who hold the king in captivity the truth never reaches the throne the best part of the nation is oppressed to elevate traitors who fatten on the blood of the people and the treasures of the state it is on violence that the tyranny of these strangers is founded who persecute with so much ferocity the royal blood let us employ violence also to destroy this tyranny it will not be the first time that the princes of the blood have taken arms to maintain their rights peter duke of brittany robert earl of dreux and several other lords opposed during the minority of st louis the queen blanche his mother who had seized on the government philip earl of valois employed all his forces to exclude from the regency those who pretended to usurp it under charles viii louis duke of orleans took arms to cause himself to be elected regent instead of ann duchess of bourbon who in quality of eldest sister of the young king had taken into her hands the reins of the state let us imitate our wise ancestors let us follow such striking examples we find ourselves in the same case it is therefore our duty to employ the same means to save the nation let not the apparent pleasure of the king restrain us this prince buried in a lethargic dream and in his own imbecility perceives not the deplorable slavery to which they have reduced him he waits from the princes of the blood the assistance which is expected from an enlightened and skilful physician by patients who feel not their distempers and know not their danger the duties of our birth and the unanimous wishes of the nation authorize us to break the fetters with which this prince is loaded and to redress the     evil before it arrives at its last extremity a vigorous resolution must be taken without delay let us hasten to be beforehand with our enemies if we wish to surmount a thousand obstacles which will arrest us if we waste the time in deliberation and which a sudden execution alone can overcome sloth and timidity will only aggravate upon our necks the weight of a yoke equally shameful and fatal can we hesitate when our tranquillity our honor and our lives have no other resource than in the valor of our arms this discourse pronounced with a military tone had already agitated minds before disposed to take arms both from attachment to his house and their private interests but the admiral coligni who weighed more maturely all the consequences of such an enterprise alone ventured to oppose the opinion of the prince by advising to employ in the execution of his design a mean more proper to ensure the success of it it would be said coligni too desperate a resolution to expose so openly to the hazards of war the fortunes of the house of bourbon and of so great a number of persons allied to their blood or attached to their interests we are not supported by any forces at home or alliances abroad we have no fortified places and are without troops and without money in the impossibility to act with open force let us substitute policy in the stead of force let us endeavor without discovering ourselves to employ other arms to execute for us what we are not in a condition to undertake for ourselves the kingdom is filled with a multitude of people who have embraced the doctrine lately introduced by calvin the severity of the researches made for them and the rigor of their punishments reduce them to despair and to the desire as well as necessity of braving every danger to rescue themselves from a destiny so horrible they all know that the duke of guise and especially the cardinal of lorraine are the principal authors of the persecution that this last pursues ardently their destruction in the parliaments and in the kings councils and never ceases to rail at their doctrines in his public harangues and private conversations if the discontents of this multitude have not blazed out it has been merely for want of a leader capable of guiding it and of animating it by his example if     they should be stimulated ever so little they will blindly confront the greatest dangers in the hope of delivering themselves from the misfortunes which threaten them let us avail ourselves of this resource let us encourage this multitude already disposed to commotions let us give a form to their designs let us arm their hatred against the guises let us put them in a condition to attack these strangers in good order and with advantage our designs in this way will execute themselves without exposing or committing us without our appearing to have any part in them in augmenting our forces with all those of the calvinists we shall support ourselves by the protection of the protestant princes of germany and of elizabeth queen of england who patronize openly the new religion our cause will become better and our pretext more plausible we will reject upon the protestants the boldness of their enterprise and we shall convince the whole world that it is neither interest nor ambition but simply the difference in religion which has excited us to arms  it should be remembered here that davila was a catholic and coligni a protestant the latter one of the greatest although the most unfortunate men of his age was as sincere in religion as pure in morals and as honorable in the whole conduct of his life as any one of his contemporaries that he was desirous of engaging the bourbons and montmorencis to favor the calvinists and liberty of conscience is probable but he is represented by the best french historians as so much attached to the king as to have been even suspected by his party the harangue which davila puts into his mouth is too much like a mere politician and too little like a philosopher or a christian to be consistent with his character     xix mais lun et lautre guise ont eu moins de scrupule ces chefs ambitieux dun peuple trop crédule couvrant leurs intérêts de linterêt des cieux ont conduit dans le piége un peuple furieux voltaire the eloquence and authority of coligni prevailed with the others to embrace the party of the calvinists to whose doctrines several of the noblemen then present in the assembly were secretly devoted the common voice was in favor of this advice which affording hopes as near accomplishment and better founded diverted them from taking arms of a sudden and concealed for some time the view of dangers to which the most determined do not expose themselves but in the last extremity after martin luther had introduced into germany the liberty of thinking in matters of religion and erected the standard of reformation john calvin a native of noyon in picardie of a vast genius singular eloquence various erudition and polished taste embraced the cause of reformation in the books which he published and in the discourses which he held in the several cities of france he proposed one hundred and twentyeight articles in opposition to the creed of the roman catholic church these opinions were soon embraced with ardor and maintained with obstinacy by a great number of persons of all conditions the asylum and the centre of this new sect was geneva a city situated on the lake anciently called lemanus on the frontiers of savoy which had shaken off the yoke of its bishop and the duke of savoy and erected itself into a republic under the title of a free city for the sake of liberty of conscience from this city proceeded printed books and men distinguished for their wit and eloquence who spreading themselves in the neighboring provinces there sowed in secret the seeds of their doctrine almost all the cities and provinces of france began to be enlightened by it it began to introduce itself into the kingdom under francis i in opposition to all the vigorous resolutions which he took to suppress it henry ii ordained with inexorable severity the punishment of death against all who     should be convicted of calvinism the cardinal of lorraine was the high priest and the proud tyrant who counselled and stimulated the king to those cruelties and persecutions which by the shedding the blood of all the advocates of civil liberty might have wholly suppressed it if the unexpected death of henry ii which the calvinists regarded as a miracle wrought in their favor had not occasioned some relaxation under francis ii the duke of guise and the cardinal of lorraine persisted in their bloody persecuting resolutions but they did not find in the parliament nor in the other magistrates the same promptitude to execute the orders which they gave in the name of the king theodore beza a disciple of calvin celebrated for his eloquence and erudition had already converted several persons of both sexes and of the first nobility of the kingdom and it was no longer in the stables and cellars that the calvinists held their assemblies and preached their sermons but in the houses of gentlemen and in the palaces of the great the people called them huguenots or aignossen  confederates the admiral coligni and several other noblemen had indeed embraced the new doctrine as it was called but the calvinists restrained by the fear of punishment still held their assemblies in secret and the great dared not declare openly for them the bourbons finding france in a condition favorable to their present interests embraced greedily the proposition of coligni and they deputed dandelot and the vidâme de chartres to negotiate this affair with the calvinists these able agents who both had embraced calvinism easily found a multitude of persons disposed to communicate to others the project in contemplation and to make the necessary preparations for its execution the calvinists agitated without interruption by the terror of dangers and punishments served them with so much promptitude and concert that they placed things in a train in a short time to succeed the first measure advised by dandelot and the vidâme de chartres was that a large number of those who professed the protestant religion should assemble and present themselves without arms at court to petition the king for liberty of conscience the public exercise of their religion and permission to have temples for that purpose     davila the catholic and italian has recorded in this place all the party exaggerations of his mistress and the guises he says that if the petition of the protestants should be severely and haughtily rejected as it indubitably would be they were immediately to march troops assembled secretly from all the provinces that these should suddenly appear under different leaders who should be appointed for them that finding the king unguarded and the court without defence they were to massacre the duke of guise and the cardinal of lorraine with all their creatures and oblige the king to declare regent and lieutenantgeneral of the kingdom the prince of condé who should grant them a cessation of punishment and liberty of conscience it was believed at the time and published that the chiefs of the conspiracy had given secret orders if every thing succeeded to their wishes to put to the sword the queen mother the king himself and his brothers that the crown in this way might descend to the princes of bourbon but davila himself acquits them of this atrocious accusation by adding that none of the accomplices having avowed this horrible design neither when on the rack nor of their own accord but all on the contrary having formally denied it i cannot relate it as a fact we know very well that fame aided by the vain terrors of the people and the malignity of the great takes a pleasure in magnifying objects to infinity the plan being thus concerted among the conspirators they divided the provinces and employments among the principal calvinists that the execution might be attended with as much order and secrecy as possible la barre de la renaudie assumed the principal part and put himself at the head of the enterprise this was a person celebrated for his travels and adventures his wit and courage had acquired him credit among the huguenots he wanted neither spirit to undertake nor vivacity to execute the derangement of his fortune had reduced him to the alternative of procuring himself a better condition by some daring attempt or of terminating his misfortunes by a sudden death although issued from the first nobility of périgord he had wandered long in different countries and had at length taken refuge in geneva where by his subtilty he had acquired some consideration such was the birth and character of the principal leader of the conspiracy who was soon followed     by a great number of associates some excited by a zeal for religion others by the attractions of novelty and others simply by that natural inquietude which never permits the french to languish in idleness la renaudie confided to the chiefs among them the care of assembling their partisans and conducting them to the rendezvous the intelligence with which he distributed provinces introduced a kind of order into this confusion castelnau had the department of gascony mazeres that of béarn dumesnil that of limousin mirebeau that of saintonge coqueville picardie mouvans provence maligni champagne saintemarie normandy and montejean brittany all famous for courage distinguished by their nobility and considered in their cities and cantons as heads of the party these factionaries after having assembled at nantes a city of brittany some under the pretext of a lawsuit and others under that of a marriage repaired with great diligence to the posts which were assigned them in a few days and with admirable secrecy they there gained an infinite number of persons of all conditions ready to sacrifice their lives for an enterprise which their preachers assured them tended to the advantage and tranquillity of the state the prince of condé who secretly lighted up this conflagration advanced by moderate days journeys to the court he wished to be witness of the event and to take suddenly according to circumstances the part which should appear to him the most advantageous the admiral always circumspect feigned to remain neuter he retired to his estate at châtillon under the pretext of enjoying the sweets of private life without meddling with affairs of the public or of government but in reality it was as much to aid the conspiracy by his counsels and information as to avoid the accidents which might defeat an enterprise which he judged rash and dangerous the conspirators who were not agitated with similar anxieties but full of the most flattering hopes had begun their march in secrecy carrying their arms concealed under their clothes they advanced separately by different roads and in the order which had been marked out by their chiefs towards blois where the court resided at that time this city was open on all sides and without fortifications and the conspirators were to meet in its suburbs on the fifteenth day of march    0     but whatever might be the activity of their proceedings and the secrecy of their counsels they could not escape the penetration of the guises the favors pensions and employments they conferred and their great reputation had attached to them so many creatures in the different provinces of the kingdom that they were punctually informed of all the movements of the conspirators it was indeed impossible that the march of so numerous a multitude could remain unknown when conspiracies whose secrets are confined to a small number of persons of the most consummate discretion and fidelity are almost always discovered before their execution whether the secret was disclosed by la renaudie or avenelles or discovered by the spies employed by the ministry even in the houses of the principal conspirators or whether information of it came from germany as soon as the guises had received it they deliberated on the means of defeating it the cardinal of lorraine who was no soldier advised to assemble the nobility of the nearest provinces to draw from the neighboring cities all the garrisons to form a body of troops and to send orders to all the commanders and governors to take the field and put to the sword all the men whom they should find in arms he presumed that the conspirators perceiving themselves to be discovered and informed of the measures taken against them and which fame would not fail to exaggerate would disperse of themselves the duke of guise more familiar with danger and despising the transports of a multitude without discipline or order regarded the advice of the cardinal as more proper to palliate the distemper than to cure it adding that since it was so pernicious and had insinuated itself into the heart of the kingdom it was useless to temporize and give it opportunity to break out with more violence he thought it therefore more prudent to dissemble and affect ignorance of the enterprise to draw in the conspirators and give them time to discover themselves that in such a case their defeat and punishment would deliver france from a fatal contagion which as it discovered itself by symptoms so terrible demanded violent remedies and not simple lenitives he added that in punishing separately only a part of the conspirators they should furnish matter to the illintentioned to calumniate the authors of this severity that the people little accustomed     to such insurrections would regard this as a chimera and as a fable invented by the ministry to crush their enemies and establish their own power and authority whereas by overwhelming all the conspirators at once when upon the point of execution they should dissipate all false accusations and justify in the sight of all the world the rectitude and the sincerity of the intentions of those who were at the head of affairs catherine agreed with the duke no extraordinary preparation was made which could excite a suspicion that the conspiracy was known they only removed the king and the court to amboise ten leagues from blois this castle situated on the loire and in the midst of forests which fortify it naturally appeared to be a safer asylum as it was easy to place in security the king and the two queens in the castle while a small number of troops should defend the entrance of the village which was of difficult access eagleeyed highsouled ambition seldom misses its opportunity the guises resolved to profit of a conjuncture so advantageous to cement and increase their power by causing the fall of their rivals to promote their own elevation as poisons are sometimes by uncommon skill converted into remedies they entered the kings apartments without the knowledge of the queen affecting with terror to exaggerate the danger they described all that was reported to be plotted against the government his most faithful subjects and his royal person they explained to him that the danger was imminent that the conspirators were already at the gates of amboise with forces much more formidable and numerous than had been suspected finally they demanded orders the promptitude and energy of which should be proportioned to the grandeur and proximity of the danger the king naturally timid as well as weak and at this moment forcibly stricken with the greatness of the danger which threatened him ordered the queen and all his ministers to be called to consult on the means proper to repress the impetuosity of so violent a rebellion nothing was seen on all sides but subjects of terror every measure that was proposed appeared hazardous the cardinal of lorraine exhausted all his artifices and all his eloquence to exaggerate the danger and increase the irresolution the king incapable of deciding and of sustaining the weight of government in circumstances so     critical nominated of his own mere motion the duke of guise his lieutenantgeneral with full and complete authority he added that not feeling himself adequate to act he abandoned to the prudence and valor of the duke the conduct of his kingdom and the care of appeasing the troubles which agitated it catherine although she felt an indignation at this bold attempt could not oppose it without an open rupture with the guises in a moment when the safety of the state depended on their union she perceived the occasion there was for a chief whose experience and reputation might take the place of the imbecility and irresolution of the king as likely to enervate the courage of his own troops as to increase the insolence of his enemies monarchs the most absolute and even republics the most jealous of their liberty had often conferred the supreme authority on a single man when the greatness of dangers had appeared to require a resource so extraordinary besides these views which regarded the preservation of her son and his states she foresaw the carnage which could not fail to be made and that the hatred of the princes of the blood and the enmity of the people would fall necessarily on the duke of guise commanding alone and with an absolute authority the integrity of the chancellor olivier was still an obstacle little satisfied that an authority so unlimited should be granted to a subject he appeared to suspend his judgment his credit and firmness might have prolonged if not defeated the measure the queen mother however determined him by alleging that as soon as the storm should be dissipated they might restrain by new edicts and fresh declarations the excessive power to be given to the duke and confine him within the bounds of duty and reason that it was the interest of all that the effusion of blood should be done by the sole orders of the duke and that neither the king his relations or ministers should appear to dip their hands in it the chancellor persuaded by these reflections sealed the commission giving to the duke of guise the title and authority of lieutenantgeneral of the king in all the provinces and territories of his obedience with absolute power as well in civil as military affairs the duke as soon as he had obtained the dignity and authority which he had always desired turned his attention to suppress the conspiracy he made able and soldierlike arrangements   0 for defending the castle and village of amboise and sent out parties of cavalry as well as infantry to attack the insurgents a detail of their skirmishing would be as little interesting as it would be to the purpose we have in view la renaudie fought with a bravery which well became the protestant cause and fell with pardaillan his antagonist in the combat though his soldiers collected in haste could not stand against veteran troops a captain lignieres one of the conspirators terrified at the greatness of the danger in the moment of execution or stricken with remorse or desirous of making his court abandoned his accomplices and galloped by another road to amboise he detailed to the king and queen the quality and number of the conspirators the names of their chiefs and the roads by which they were approaching the prince de condé was immediately put under guard by order of the king to hinder him in any manner from favoring the enterprise of the insurgents as he promised them the conspirators in fine were defeated and dispersed some perished in the flames of the houses to which they fled others were hanged upon the trees in the neighborhood or on the battlements of the castle multitudes were massacred in the neighborhood of amboise the loire was covered with dead bodies the blood ran in streams in the street and the public places were filled with bodies hanging on gallowses the punishment of these miserable men tormented by the soldiers and butchered by executioners severities which the guises thought necessary became the source of carnage and of rivers of blood which deluged france for many years in a most tragical and deplorable manner xx faible enfant qui de guise adorait les caprices et dont on ignorait les vertus et les vices voltaire although the insurgents were dispersed and their leaders executed the bourbons and the other grandees of their party the secret authors of the conspiracy still lived the council of the king in examining into the motives of the late troubles agreed without difficulty that they were the work of the princes     of the blood and that to maintain the authority of the king and the ministry the only sure means would be to rid themselves of the chiefs and authors of the conspiracy as perturbators of the public repose as favorers of heresy and as rebels who attempting the person of their sovereign had violated the fundamental laws of the monarchy† but the princes of the blood were too nearly on a level with the king they had too much influence with the people they had too much power in the state the king indeed was furious the queen mother was anxious the guises afraid of losing their power but the constable montmorenci the king of navarre and the prince de condé all supposed to be at the bottom of the evil had so much consequence in the world that nothing but dissimulation and irresolution prevailed in the cabinet the council after disguising under a veil of deep dissimulation its real design resolved at length to convoke the assembly of the statesgeneral in whom resides the whole authority of the kingdom‡ two reasons determined them—first that to execute the important resolution of the king against the princes of his blood it would be useful to have it confirmed by the unanimous or at least the apparent consent of the nation the second reason was that by declaring that they meant to deliberate in this assembly on the measures necessary to compose the present troubles to regulate the affairs of religion and to adjust the administration of the state for the future the king would have a plausible pretext to summon about his person all the princes of the blood and all the officers of the crown without giving them umbrage and that they would be inexcusable not to come since they were promised that the deliberations should be concerning a reformation of government which they appeared so much to desire kings says davila never see with pleasure or indeed voluntarily these assemblies of the statesgeneral where their authority seems to be     eclipsed by the sovereign power of the nation whose deputies represent the whole body upon this passage the french writers cry out it is a stranger who speaks illinformed of the fundamental constitution of our monarchy this italian imagines that the royal authority was suspended during the session of the statesgeneral but it was the royal authority which called them together without it they could not have assembled and the same authority had a right to dismiss them at its pleasure it is therefore evident that their power was always subordinate to that of the monarch but this consequence does not follow the royal authority in england has the power of convoking proroguing and dissolving parliament yet parliament is not subordinate to the royal authority but superior to it as the whole is superior to a third part the sovereignty is in parliament or the legislative power not in the king or the executive so the sovereignty might be in the statesgeneral comprehending the king if there are twenty examples of the statesgeneral convening and separating by the simple orders of the king if the dauphin charles v during the detention of king john his father convoked several times the statesgeneral and dismissed them when he judged proper it will not follow from all this that the states were not a part of the sovereignty nor will it follow that they had no authority but to advise and remonstrate if the sentiments of the italian author were true add these writers it would follow that the authority of parliaments and courts or companies whose power is nothing but an emanation from the royal authority would be suspended during the session of the statesgeneral a pretension absolutely contrary to the usages and maxims of the kingdom but how does it appear that the power of the parliaments and courts or companies were emanations of the royal authority there is more probability that they were originally committees of the statesgeneral and in that case their power would not be suspended unless it were expressly suspended by a resolution or order of the states but if these tribunals were only a part of the executive power and constituted by the king it would not follow from this concession     that the statesgeneral were no part of the sovereignty or legislative power is there one national act upon record which acknowledges the king of france to be an unlimited sovereign if there is not the opinion of davila appears to be better founded than that of his critic there was always a rivalry between the royal authority and that of the states as there is now between the power of the king and that of the national assembly and as there ever was and will be in every legislature or sovereignty which consists of two branches only the proper remedy then would have been the same as it must be now to newmodel the legislature make it consist of three equiponderant independent branches and make the executive power one of them in this way and in no other can an equilibrium be formed the only antidote against rivalries the rivalry between the kings and statesgeneral in france proceeded in the struggle for superiority till the power of the former increasing and that of the latter diminishing the statesgeneral were laid aside after      and the crown on the head of louis xiv in fact but not of right became absolute in the same manner the rivalry between the popes and general councils proceeded till the latter were discontinued and his holiness became infallible in short every man and every body of men is and has a rival when the struggle is only between two whether individuals or bodies it continues till one is swallowed up or annihilated and the other becomes absolute master as all this is a necessary consequence and effect of the emulation which nature has implanted in our bosoms it is wonderful that mankind have so long been ignorant of the remedy when a third party for an umpire is one so easy and obvious francis ii in this year    0 issued a proclamation concerning the affairs of the nation and declared that he had     resolved to assemble at fontainebleau all the princes and the notables of his kingdom in order to take their advice concerning the urgent necessities of the state he granted to all his subjects full liberty to come there in person or by deputies or to send memorials to lay open their grievances with promise to give them a favorable hearing and to grant all their requests so far as equity and reason would permit the real intention of the guises at this time was to take vengeance of their rivals but to conceal this design under the most profound dissimulation until a favorable moment should arrive to carry it into execution a series of refinement in artifice was practised to put off their guard the prince de condé the constable de montmorenci the admiral coligni and all the others of their party at the same time that arrangements were made in all the provinces and troops were assembled about the court under commanders who were in its confidence about this time died the chancellor olivier destroyed as was reported by chagrin at the cruelties practised at amboise he was succeeded by michel de lhôpital who united to a profound erudition a consummate experience in business to show the universal prevalence of emulation and rivalry of jealousy and envy not only between opposite parties but among individuals of the same party it is necessary to observe here that de lhôpital notwithstanding his genius so penetrating and so fruitful in resources was elevated with great difficulty to this eminent dignity by the queen mother in opposition to the guises who insisted long for louis de morvilliers catherine began to dread the too great elevation of the guises and wished to confer this important office on a subject entirely devoted to her interests at the assembly of the notables at fontainebleau were found the chiefs of both parties excepting the princes of bourbon one of whom however the king of navarre sent his secretary la sague after the customary speeches of the king queen chancellor duke of guise and cardinal de lorraine coligni arose approached the king and presented him a paper saying that it was a petition of those of the reformed religion who had instructed him to present it to his majesty founded on the faith of edicts by which he had permitted all his subjects to lay open their grievances he added that although it was not signed by     any one yet if his majesty should order it one hundred and fifty thousand men were ready to subscribe it the petition demanded only liberty of conscience and to have churches for public worship in the cities the cardinal de lorraine with all that impetuosity which the natural vehemence of his temper added to the ardor of his spiritual zeal and temporal ambition inspired called it seditious insolent rash and heretical and added that if to intimidate the youth of the king coligni had advanced that it would be signed by one hundred and fifty thousand rebels he would be responsible for a million of good citizens ready to redress the impudence of the factions and compel respect to the royal authority as to the differences of religion those who inclined to calvinism proposed to demand of the pope a free general council where they might discuss and decide by common consent the matters of controversy that if the sovereign pontiff should refuse to grant one the king ought after the example of some of his wise predecessors to assemble a national council but the cardinal of lorraine answered that there was no occasion for any other council than that which the pope had already called at trent which had already reprehended and condemned the doctrines of the innovators opposed to the roman church as to the constitution and government of the state after an infinity of propositions and discussions suggested by the variety of interests montluc or marillac by the secret order of the queen proposed an assembly of the statesgeneral and the two parties with one voice consented the constable the admiral and their partisans with the hope of obtaining a change in the ministry the queen mother and the guises because they hoped to destroy their rivals an edict was accordingly passed at fontainebleau for holding the statesgeneral and the secretaries of state expedited letterspatents to all the provinces of the kingdom with orders to send in the month of october their deputies to orleans there to hold the statesgeneral la sague took the road to béarn charged with letters and commissions for the king of navarre from the constable the admiral and their adherents at etampes he was arrested     and all his papers seized and brought to court by order of the queen and the guises la sague interrogated on the rack confessed that the design of the prince of condé to which the king of navarre was privy and consenting was to march from béarn under pretext of repairing to court and to make himself master in his course of the principal cities of the kingdom to take possession of paris by means of the constable and marshal montmorenci his son who had the government of it in the next place to cause to revolt picardie by the intrigues of senarpont and bouchavannes brittany by those of the duke destampes who as governor had a powerful party there he declared that the prince was ready to come to court at the head of all the forces of the huguenots to oblige the statesgeneral to dismiss from the ministry the queen mother and the guises to declare that the king cannot be of age till twentytwo years old and finally to give him for tutors and regents of the kingdom the constable the prince de condé and the king of navarre la sague added that by moistening with water the covering of the letters of the vidâme de chartres they would see in writing all that he had revealed the plan of the enemies of the princes of lorraine was indeed found upon trial written upon the cover of the letters of the vidâme de chartres in the proper hand of fremindardoy secretary of the constable this revelation of the secret by la sague put the court upon a thousand manœuvres to strengthen their party in the provinces but still they continued to dissemble their designs of vengeance the protestants somewhat encouraged on one hand by hopes and still tormented with persecutions on the other broke out in arms in several places but the prince de condé whose anxiety must have been very great for his present safety if his ambition was not as insatiable and his natural inquietude as troublesome as is represented made an attempt to seize upon lyons as a stronghold and an asylum for himself and a place of arms for his party but he miscarried and many of his partisans the poor huguenots were executed as soon as the king was informed of this enterprise he resolved not to give the discontented leisure to form new ones he left fontainebleau accompanied with a thousand lances and two regiments of old infantry lately returned from piedmont     and scotland he took the road to orleans pressing the deputies of the provinces to repair to that city the french nation is divided into three orders or states—the clergy the nobility and the people these three orders are distributed into thirty districts or jurisdictions called bailliages or sénéchalsies when an assembly of the statesgeneral is to be held they resort to the capital of their respective provinces where they elect each one separately a deputy who assists in the name of his order at the general assembly and who enters into all the deliberations relative to the particular interests of each one of the three orders and to the general good of the state each bailliage furnishes three deputies—the first for the clergy the second for the nobility and the third for the people under the name which in france was then considered as more honorable of the third estate all these deputies assembled in presence of the king of the princes of the blood and of the officers of the crown form the body of the statesgeneral and act in the name of the nation whose power and authority they represent xxi —my soul aches to know when two authorities are up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other shakspeare when the king is of age and assists at the statesgeneral the deputies have the power to consent to his demands to propose what they judge necessary for the good of the different orders of the state to make their submissions in the name of the people to new imposts to establish and accept of new laws and new regulations but when the minority of the prince or some other incapacity hinders him to govern by himself the states have a right in case of contestation to elect the regent of the kingdom to nominate to the principal offices to form a council and if the masculine posterity have failed in the royal family they may elect a new monarch following however the dispositions of the salique law excepting these cases of necessity the kings were accustomed to assemble the statesgeneral     in urgent conjunctures and to determine according to their advice in affairs of most importance in effect says davila what energy may not the resolutions of the prince derive from the concurrence of his subjects what can be more conformable to the true spirit of monarchical government than this harmony between the sovereign and the people in truth davila though thou art a profound historian thou art but a superficial legislator history answers the question that no energy at all nor any thing but division distraction and extravagance were derived to the resolutions of the prince till the states were laid aside in the language of my motto two authorities were up neither supreme and confusion entered twixt the gap nothing can be more directly repugnant to monarchical government than such assemblies because they set up rivals to the king and excite doubts and questions in whom the sovereignty resides if a negative is given by them to the will of the prince they become a part of the sovereignty annihilate the monarchy and convert it into a republic if they are mere councils of advice they become scenes of cabal for aspiring grandees to force themselves into the ministry never indeed was it more necessary to newmodel the government and regenerate the nation than in the present conjuncture when the rivalries of the grandees employing as instruments the differences in religion disturbed the whole kingdom and demanded the promptest remedies upon the reiterated orders of the court the deputies of the provinces had resorted to orleans from the beginning of october    0 and the king having arrived in person accompanied by most of the lords and great officers of the crown they waited only for the discontented lords and princes to open the assembly the constable and his sons were as usual at chantilly the king of navarre and the prince of condé were still at béarn the king had written to them all to invite them to the states and although they had not explicitly refused they invented pretexts upon pretexts to excuse themselves and gain time these affected delays distressed the king and the ministry they apprehended with reason that the refusal of the princes of the blood arising from their own suspicions or upon some certain     information of what was intended against them would defeat all the projects and preparations founded only on the hope that they would assist at the statesgeneral the prince of condé could not be in doubt that they had drawn either from the prisoners of amboise or from la sague or from the conspirators arrested at lyons evidence sufficient to discover his designs no motive therefore could determine him to place himself a second time at the discretion of a court where his enemies were all powerful the king of navarre thought differently less culpable or more credulous than his brother he believed that by going to the states they should obtain without difficulty that reform in the government which had already cost them so much labor whereas by refusing to be present they would betray their own interests and leave the field open to the ambition and violence of the princes of lorraine he could not believe that under the eyes of the whole nation assembled a king scarcely out of his infancy an italian princess and two strangers would dare to imbrue their hands in the blood of the princes of the royal house which the monarchs the most absolute and the most vindictive had ever regarded as sacred all these motives determined him to venture to the states with the prince to whom he represented that they would infallibly condemn him unheard if he continued obstinately to absent himself from court whereas by appearing there and gaining to his interests the deputies in the states there was every reason to hope that if on judging him with rigor they should blame his proceedings the equity of his pretensions would afford him a favorable color and in the last extremity his birth would obtain him a pardon all the confidants and partisans of the princes supported this advice except the wife and motherinlaw of the prince of condé who constantly rejected it and judged that his life was aimed at and that of all the courses he could take that which was recommended to him was the most dangerous in the midst of these irresolutions the king sent them de crussol and saint andré to engage them to repair to orleans these lords remonstrated to them that an assembly so respectable and which occasioned so great an expense to the king and the nation had not been called but on their account and to satisfy their complaints and demands that they were there to deliberate on the means of reforming the government and appeasing   0 the disputes of religion matters of so high importance that they could not be decided without the presence and concurrence of the princes of the blood that if the princes of bourbon after having so often demanded the reformation of the government and an examination of the cause of the huguenots refused to assist at the states assembled for those purposes it would seem that they meant to trifle with the king and insult the majesty of an assembly which represented the body of the nation that they ought hereafter to impute to themselves alone their exclusion from dignities and governments since they had not deigned to come and receive the authority which the king appeared disposed to grant them with the concurrence of the states that this conduct proving their little attachment to the service of the king and the good of the kingdom they ought not to be surprised if the firmest resolutions should be taken to extirpate the seeds of discord and manifest designs to disturb the state that if the king was disposed to reward such as gave him proofs of their obedience and fidelity he was equally determined to reduce to a forced but necessary submission those who should attempt to resist his will and excite revolts in the cities and provinces of his kingdom a crime of which he would suspect the princes of bourbon as long as they should neglect to justify themselves and their absence and obstinacy should confirm the injurious reports which were spread concerning them that hitherto neither the king nor his council had given credit to them but that the king desired that for the honor of the royal blood the princes would give proofs of their fidelity and of their zeal for the good of the state and would justify the sincerity of their intentions in the eyes of france whose attention was attracted and fixed by the assembly of the states these representations made little impression on the prince of condé who was resolved not to risk his person in a place where enemies could do all things but his firmness was in the end constrained to bend under the necessity crussol returned to court with an account of the aversion of the prince to come to the states the guises advised to employ force to determine him the queen did not oppose it and the king took the resolution to constrain them by force of arms to this end they sent de thermes into gascony and began to form under his command an army composed     of gendarmerie and all the infantry distributed in the neighboring provinces the bourbons were without troops destitute of every thing shut up in béarn a little province at the foot of the pyrenees wedged in between france and spain they doubted not that if on the one hand the troops of the king assembled in gascony and on the other those of the king of spain who ardently wished to invade the feeble remains of navarre should attack them they should easily be subjugated and stripped of their dominions the insurrections which the prince of condé had excited in france had been attended with no success he was in béarn without troops and without money the king of navarre who would not expose the rest of his states nor his wife and children whom he had about him yielded to necessity more powerful than any counsels and finally determined his brother to make the journey to orleans in the general persuasion that especially during the session of the states the ministry would not take any violent resolution against them whereas by obstinately remaining at béarn they should expose themselves to the infamy which always accompanies the name of rebels and ruin themselves without resource the cardinal of bourbon their brother contributed not a little to hasten this resolution the softness and ductility of his character his aversion to troubles his tenderness for his brothers and the insinuations of the queen engaged him to ride post to béarn as soon as he learnt the intentions and preparations of the court to force the king of navarre and the prince of condé to appear at the states he exaggerated on one hand the number of troops destined against them and capable of crushing them and on the other he assured them that the king and the queen had discovered none but favorable dispositions and an earnest zeal to reëstablish concord and public tranquillity they left therefore the queen jane and her children at pau and with few attendants all three together took the road to orleans the constable whom the court affected to urge less because he was in a place where he might be more easily compelled had commenced his journey with more confidence in appearance but in reality with more precaution he had not abetted the discontented but with his counsels which only tended to demand justice of the states without plotting conspiracies or exciting     insurrections a refusal to go to court might fortify the suspicions conceived against him he therefore employed artifice and dissimulation to delay his arrival and regulate his proceedings by the example of the princes arrived at paris he pretended to be attacked with the gout and returned to chantilly to reëstablish his health he again attempted to proceed but under the pretext that the change of air and the motion of the carriage incommoded him which his advanced age rendered plausible enough he travelled by little days journeys frequently by cross ways at a distance from the great road where he made long delays to prolong the time till the arrival of the princes his sons in persuading him to hasten his march represented to him that neither the queen mother nor the guises would ever dare to attempt any thing against a man so respected as he was in the kingdom the constable instructed by experience answered them that the ministry could govern the state at its pleasure and without opposition though they seemed to be preparing for themselves a formidable one by calling the statesgeneral that this conduct enveloped some mysterious intrigue which he should be able to unveil with a little patience this judicious reflection abated the ardor of the young lords and the constable continued to temporize nevertheless the king of navarre and the prince of condé had been received on the frontiers by the marshal de thermes who under the pretext of paying them the honors due to their rank followed them with a large body of cavalry to make sure of the cities become suspected by the deposition of la sague at the same time he ordered possession to be taken by other troops both of cavalry and infantry of all the roads which the princes left behind them lest a change of their resolution should determine them to return as soon as it was known at court that the princes had entered the kingdom and were so well observed by de thermes they arrested all on a sudden jerome grollot bailiff of orleans accused of intelligence with the     huguenots to cause a revolt of that city in favor of the discontented princes and by order of the king they sent to prison the vidâme of chartres who had been imprudent enough to remain in the capital they had not the same success in attempting to seize dandelot as prudent and subtle in providing against dangers as ardent and daring in forming designs he retired suddenly to the coasts of brittany resolved to embark for england in case of necessity the admiral coligni whose address and dissimulation according to davila had hitherto conducted every thing without discovering or exposing himself was among the first in the statesgeneral with design there to labor in favor of his party the king and the queen had received him as usual with benevolence he employed himself in following with his eye all the measures of the court in order to give information of them secretly and with extreme precautions to the constable and the king of navarre all these delays were exhausted when the princes of the blood arrived at orleans the twentyninth of october without any persons going out to receive them except a small number of their most intimate friends they found not only the gates of the city guarded but bodies of guards placed and batteries erected in the strongest posts in the cross streets and public places precautions which the court had not usually taken in times of war they passed through the midst of this formidable apparatus and came to the kings lodge where they kept a more exact guard than at the headquarters of an army arrived at the gate they would have entered on horseback according to the right attached to their rank but they found only a wicket gate open and were obliged to alight in the open street and few persons appeared to receive or salute them they were conducted to the king whom they found sitting between the duke of guise and the cardinal of lorraine surrounded by the captains of his guards he received the king of navarre and the prince of condé with a coldness very different from that affability which the kings of france are accustomed to practise to all their subjects but above all to the princes of their blood he conducted them soon to the queen mother where the guises did not follow them catherine of medici who wished always to appear neuter and disinterested received them with ordinary demonstrations of friendship but     with an affected sorrow and artificial tears the king continued to treat them with the same coldness and addressing himself to the prince of condé he began to reproach him in that without having received from his majesty either displeasure or ill treatment he had in contempt of all laws divine and human excited several times his subjects enkindled a war in different parts of his kingdom attempted to seize on his principal cities and conspired against his life and that of his brothers the prince without emotion answered with firmness that these accusations were so many calumnies forged by his enemies we must proceed then replied the king by the ordinary ways of justice to discover the truth he went out of the apartment of the queen and commanded the captains of his guards to arrest the prince of condé the queen mother forced to consent to this measure but who had not forgotten that things might change from one moment to another exerted herself to console the king of navarre the prince complained of none but the cardinal of bourbon his brother who had deceived him and suffered himself to be conducted to a neighboring house destined for his prison they had walled up the windows doubled the doors and made it a kind of fortress defended by several pieces of artillery and a strong guard the king of navarre astonished at the detention of his brother breathed out his grief in complaints and reproaches to the queen who casting all the blame on the duke of guise as lieutenantgeneral of the kingdom endeavored only to exculpate herself to him they gave for a lodging a house at a little distance from that which the king occupied and guards to observe his motions so that excepting the liberty of seeing whom he pleased he was in all other respects treated and confined like a prisoner at the same time they arrested bouchart his secretary with all his letters and papers and madeleine de roye motherinlaw of the prince with all her letters and papers at her seat at anisi although they held the gates of orleans shut and suffered no person to go out the news of these transactions were announced to the constable who was still but a few leagues from paris he suspended his journey resolved to pass no further but to wait and observe the consequences of these events thus the mystery suspected by the constable was unriddled     the statesgeneral were summoned only as a net is laid artfully to be sprung upon game this game were the constable and princes and their principal friends they were a mere stalkinghorse behind which to shoot a woodcock and that woodcock was the prince of condé although of the two authorities which were up the court and the states neither was supreme yet the one we see might be taken by the other we shall soon see that confusion entered by the gap xxii intervenit deinde his cogitationibus avitum malum regni cupido atque inde fœdum certamen coörtum livy the queen mother and the guises delayed no longer the opening of the states they began by the profession of faith drawn up by the sorbonne conformably to the doctrine of the roman catholic church the cardinal de tournon president of the order of the clergy read it with a loud voice and each of the deputies approved and adhered to it upon oath a precaution which they judged necessary to assure themselves of the catholicity of those who were to have a deliberative voice in the general assembly after this solemn act the chancellor proposed in the presence of the king the matters which were to be taken into consideration at the instance of the provinces the three orders separated to examine the respective demands and make report of their resolutions but all this was merely theatrical it was nothing but farcical scenery the guises knew as well as the constable de montmorenci that the ministry could govern the kingdom and nation at its will as a court or hereditary supreme executive always will where it is checked only by a single representative assembly especially if that assembly have no authority but to advise unless it has recourse to violence nay if it have legislative authority the majority in that assembly can only govern by imposing its own men on the executive in other words by forcing the king to take their creatures into the ministry so that the ministry and the majority in the national assembly must     always act in concert and be agreed and they generally are so to the intolerable oppression of the minority as in this case until the minority rise in arms reformation of government and liberty of conscience and redress of grievances in religion were subjects which the court had too much cunning to bring before the assembly that would have been as the constable expressed it to have prepared a formidable opposition to themselves had the point been then settled that the states were a legislative assembly and had the question of religion been brought fairly into deliberation and discussion before them it is very probable that liberty of conscience to the huguenots might have been the result even in that age but these as davila says were the smallest objects they had in view all minds expected with much more solicitude the issue of the detention of the prince of condé their doubts were soon resolved by a declaration of council signed by the king the chancellor and all the grandees except the guises who as suspected of partiality affected not to appear in this affair a commission was established for the trial of the prince with authority to render a definitive sentence de thou president and faye and viole counsellors of the parliament of paris were the judges bourdin attorneygeneral tillet secretary all the interrogations and acts were done in the presence of the chancellor lhôpital they heard the depositions of the prisoners of amboise lyons and others they made preparations to interrogate the prince he refused to answer alleging that in quality of prince of the blood he acknowledged no other tribunal than the parliament of paris he demanded an assembly of all the chambers of parliament that the king should be present in person and that the twelve peers should have a voice as well as the great officers of the crown according to the ancient usage that he could not excuse himself for not remonstrating against a proceeding so unheard of and irregular and from appealing to the king this appeal was carried to council and appeared authorized by reason by the ordinary formalities and by the customs of the kingdom but the spirit of rivalry which is the spirit of party demanded a sudden vengeance a party at present triumphant but doubtful whether it were at bottom the most powerful were impelled by fear as well as hatred to wish a prompt decision     the appeal was declared null but the prince having renewed it and persisted in his protestations the council at the motion of the attorneygeneral pronounced that they ought to consider the prince as convicted since he refused to answer to commissioners named by the king in this manner they obliged him to submit to interrogatories and pursued the trial without loss of time to final judgment the princes of bourbon at the summit of misfortune were very near expiating with their blood the heinous crime of daring to stand in competition with the guises to patronize liberty of conscience and to shelter from persecution the distressed huguenots as manlius was precipitated from the tarpeian rock for being the friend of the oppressed debtors and the rival of camillus and the quinctian family both were accused it is true with crimes against the state the splendor of birth of the two bourbons and their personal merit interested all france even their enemies pitied their destiny the guises alone naturally enterprising pursued constantly their designs without regard to the merit or quality of those princes whether they judged such an act of severity absolutely necessary to the safety and tranquillity of the kingdom or whether as their enemies supposed they had nothing in view but the destruction of their rivals and the establishment of their own grandeur they declared openly that it was necessary by two strokes at the same time to strike off the heads of heresy and rebellion such is the spirit of sophistry and such is the spirit of party the queen mother although she consented secretly and wished that the resolution taken at amboise of destroying the princes should be executed desired nevertheless that all the odium of it should fall upon the guises as she had always had the address to accomplish she proposed to manage the two parties for fear of those unforeseen events which the inconstancy of fortune might produce and affected much grief and melancholy in her behavior and reserve in her discourse she had even frequent conferences with the two châtillons the admiral and cardinal in which she appeared disposed to seek some expedient to extricate from danger the princes of the blood she amused in the same manner the duchess of montpensier a     princess full of the best intentions an enemy of all dissimulation and who judged of the characters of others by the rectitude of her own her inclination to calvinism and her intimate connections with the king of navarre had enabled her to commence and continue between that prince and the queen a secret correspondence these intrigues although directly opposite to the conduct which the court held in public were disguised with so much artifice that the most clearsighted could not unravel their genuine design even when they reflected on the depths of the secrets of mankind and the diversity of interests and passions which serve as motives to their actions† already the commissioners had rendered their judgment against the prince of condé they had condemned him as convicted of high treason and rebellion to be beheaded before the palace of the king at the hour of the assembly of the statesgeneral they delayed the execution only to draw into the same snare the constable who in spite of the repeated instances of the court still delayed his journey to the states they wished to involve in the same proscription the king of navarre but they had not proofs against him sufficient to satisfy their own creatures when one morning the king in dressing himself fell all at once into a swoon so deep and violent that his officers believed him to be dead he recovered his senses it is true but his malady was judged to be mortal and his life was despaired of this fatal mischance terrified the guises they pressed the queen mother to execute the sentence against the prince of condé while the breath remained in the body of the king and to take the same resolution against the king of navarre to prevent all the revolutions which they might have to fear in case of the kings death they represented to her with warmth that this was the sole means of preserving the crown to her other infant children and of dissipating the storm which menaced france that although the constable was not arrested and in the present delicate circumstances it would not be prudent to seize him yet that when they should have no longer to fear either the credit or the pretensions of the princes of the blood the constable would be less formidable as he would neither have the nobility in his interests nor the     huguenots of his party that to deliberate in the moment of execution and suspend it in this critical situation of the king would be to lose the fruit of so many projects conducted to their end with so much artifice and patience that even the death of the king ought not to be an obstacle because that brothers succeeding him of right the same reasons and the same interests still subsisted both for them and their mother the queen who had known how to preserve herself neuter at least in appearance and who had no motives so urgent to precipitate measures considered that under a minority things might change their aspect and that the excessive grandeur of the guises remaining without opposition might become to her as formidable as the ambition of the princes of the blood thus sometimes by supposing the distemper of the king to be less dangerous sometimes by spreading favorable reports of a speedy cure she gained time delayed the execution of the prince and reserved the liberty of acting according to circumstances conformably to those views in which she was confirmed by the counsels of the chancellor de lhôpital as soon as she had known that the kings life was in danger she requested the son of the duke de montpensier to conduct her secretly one night into the apartment of the king of navarre and in a long conversation which she had with him she endeavored with her ordinary dissimulation to persuade him that she was very far from approving all that had passed and wished to act in concert with him to oppose the ambition of the guises the prince depended little on the sincerity of these protestations they had however an effect in the sequel on the fifth of december the king died charles ix second son of the queen succeeded to francis ii his brother he was but eleven years of age and must have a tutor and the kingdom a regent xxiii utrumque regem sua multitudo consalutaverat each party expected its own regent the ancient usage and laws often confirmed by the states called of right to the function the king of navarre but what a reverse what an appearance to confide the person of the young king and   0 the government of the kingdom to a prince suspected of a conspiracy against the state detained as a prisoner and the accomplice of a brother condemned to death the guises had governed with supreme authority under the late king and attempted the most violent measures by committing to them the same power it was easy to follow the same plan and execute the same designs but they were not of the royal blood how commit to them the tutorage of a young king contrary to all the laws of the monarchy what envy what jealousy what oppositions would they not have to contend with from the nobility and the grandees who would be discontented with their power and aspire to despoil them of it the states had sometimes confided the regency to the mothers of kings during their minority and in the present competition of so many interests and contending factions it was not prudent to place in other hands the life of the king and the conservation of the state but a woman a stranger without partisans and without support could she maintain her ground against two such powerful factions ready to support their pretensions by the force of arms the guises foreseeing what might easily happen leagued themselves with the cardinal de tournon the duke de nemours the marshals de brissac and saintandré sipierre governor of orleans and many other great lords with whose influence they reinforced their party to defend their lives and preserve their power the king of navarre conceiving happier hopes for the future united more strictly than ever with the châtillons the admiral and cardinal the prince de porcien jarnac and many others of their partisans he secretly armed his friends and despatched courier after courier to the constable the two parties having thus placed themselves in a posture of defence the whole court and the troops divided themselves among them and even the deputies of the states took their party each one following his passions his interests or his principles never did the necessity of a third mediating power or an umpire appear more plainly than in this case had there been a constitution in france and had that constitution provided as it ought to have done a third party whose interest and duty it should have been to do justice to the other two and every individual of each there would have been little danger to the peace     liberty or happiness of the people for such an intermediate authority by doing justice to all sides would have been joined and supported by the honest and virtuous of all sides and by this means would have controlled both parties by the laws but in this instance it seemed impossible to form a third party agitation and terror reigned everywhere it was dreaded every moment that the friends of the king of navarre and those of the guises would come to blows all their measures and devices tended mutually to destroy each other nature itself however without much aid from any constitution produced an effect although this unbridled ardor of ruling inflamed as it was by private animosities hindered not the two parties from rendering publicly their obedience to the king this submission had no other principle than a jealousy and mutual apprehension that the one party would snatch from the other the first place in the government this motive only and not any respect for a constitution had made both parties eager to appear to be the first to do homage to charles ix and on the day of the death of his brother he was unanimously recognized as lawful sovereign this step tended insensibly to reëstablish order and authority the queen mother saw that it would not be safe to trust the life of her young children nor the administration of the state to either of the parties one of which was extremely irritated and embittered and the other full of assurance and haughty pretensions both well supported and ready to proceed to the last extremities she desired to continue mistress of her children and of the government of the state she proposed to this end to remain as a mediatrix and thought that the two parties unable to agree among themselves and neither being able to triumph over the other they would both unite in her favor and abandon to her by concert an authority which the opposition of their competitors would hinder them from obtaining for themselves we see in this instance that the triple balance is so established by providence in the constitution of nature that order without it can never be brought out of anarchy and confusion the laws therefore should establish this equilibrium as the dictate of nature and the ordinance of providence catherine hoped that by conducting herself with ability the reins of the state would return to her hands she first thought of making sure of the princes of lorraine a negotiation so     delicate and thorny ought not to be confided to any but the ablest hands the queen after having cast her eyes on several persons fixed them at last on the marshal de saintandré as the man of the court the most proper to assure her success she sent for him and after several discourses the result was that it would be impossible to terminate the differences of the two parties without tumult and war but by relaxing somewhat of their pretensions by ceding a part on both sides and making the queen the arbitratrix of their interest that by this plan the two parties without yielding one to the other would appear from respect and for the peace of the public to give way to the mother of their king who should hold the equilibrium between the guises and the bourbons the queen was a politician refined enough to pretend that she was indebted for this counsel to the prudence of the marshal rather than that she had suggested it to him which was the fact the marshal judging without passion that this project would be very convenient to the slippery and perilous situation in which the guises stood undertook to negotiate with their party upon the proposition which he made of it to the duke and cardinal and which they brought into deliberation in an assembly of their confidants the opinions of these and even of the two brothers were divided the duke who had more caution and moderation than his brother yielded to the accommodation which was to leave him in possession of the governments and riches which he held from the liberality of the late kings but the cardinal more ambitious and more violent rejected all compromises and pretended that they would preserve their power in the same degree as they had exercised it under francis ii the sentiment of the duke was approved by the cardinal de tournon the marshals brissac and saintandré and above all by sipierre the advice of all which personages had a weight which accompanies a high reputation for prudence justly acquired all judged it sufficient for the guises to preserve their credit and honors and preserve themselves for circumstances more favorable and the result they communicated to the queen by saintandré and left to her the choice of means the most proper to treat with the king of navarre there remained still a greater obstacle to be overcome—it was to appease the faction of the discontented princes an     enterprise which many thought impossible and chimerical but the queen who perfectly knew the characters and dispositions of the persons with whom she had to treat did not despair of obtaining her end the king of navarre had for his principal confidants descars and lenoncourt bishop of auxerre descars had a contracted genius and little experience lenoncourt was a crafty politician but solely intent upon his own fortune the queen secretly gained both by approaching each on his weak side she dazzled descars with presents and amused him with specious reasonings and she excited in the bishop of auxerre hopes of ecclesiastical benefices and dignities which he could not easily obtain by the sole credit of the king of navarre they both promised under the pretext of giving faithful and sincere counsel to their master to favor the negotiations which tended to bring the two parties together and commit the regency to the queen mother the duchess of montpensier carried the first proposals of accommodation her candor and frankness had gained the confidence of the queen in the progress of things carrouges and lansac lords of consummate prudence entered insensibly into this negotiation by means of these persons the queen proposed to the king of navarre three conditions   to set at liberty all who had been arrested for the conspiracy of amboise the prince of condé madame de roye and the vidâme de chartres and to annul by the parliament of paris the sentence against the prince   to create the king of navarre lieutenantgeneral of the kingdom on condition that the queen had the title and authority of regent   to obtain of the king of spain the restitution of navarre the confidential friends of the king of navarre exaggerated to him these advantages they represented to him that the name of regent a title without reality was but an empty and specious sound for which he would be abundantly recompensed by the power and authority which would be given him over the provinces prerogatives in which consisted the effective government of the kingdom that the glory of delivering the prince of condé by the humiliation of his enemies joined to the hope of reëstablishing forever his house in its original splendor left him no room to hesitate it is not a time said they to contend with rigor against enemies so powerful you have to combat the prejudices     which your enterprises against the state have excited why upon the brink of a precipice do you indulge chimerical hopes the deputies of the states are almost all devoted to the queen and the guises who have chosen them at their pleasure and gained them to their interests if the affair is left to their decision it is to be feared that their partiality will incline them to exclude the princes from the government and commit it to the guises which would infallibly accomplish the final ruin of the house of bourbon these reasons shook the resolution of the king of navarre and disposed him to follow these counsels but he was still restrained by the prince of condé whose keen resentment and desire of vengeance rather than solid reasons excited to advise the contrary the duke de montpensier and the prince de la rochesuryon supported those who negotiated an accommodation both were of the house of bourbon but of a branch more distant from the royal stock and had not meddled in these troubles the king of navarre before he concluded with the queen demanded of her by the immediate negotiators two new conditions—  that they should take away from the guises all the employments they had at court   that liberty of conscience should be given to the huguenots from the time that calvin had begun to preach and to write the first seeds of his doctrines had been sown in the court of henry king of navarre and margaret of valois his consort father and mother of the queen jane and as the minds of these princes were indisposed to the see of rome which had stripped them of their states under pretext of an excommunication fulminated by the pope julius ii against france and its allies in the number of whom was the king of navarre they were easily persuaded of a doctrine contrary to the authority of the pope and which taught that the censures by which they had lost their states were null the calvinistic ministers frequenting the court of these princes there taught their opinions which had cast so deep roots into the mind of queen jane that she had abandoned the catholic faith to embrace calvinism since her marriage with antony of bourbon she persisted in the same sentiments she had nearly     converted her husband by the vehement eloquence of theodore beza peter martyr vermilly and other ministers who retired into béarn there to preach their opinions in full liberty the prince of condé the admiral and the other chiefs of the party of the princes of the blood having also embraced calvinism some with sincerity and others to disguise their political views under the pretext of religion the king of navarre persisted more constantly than ever to declare himself the protector of the huguenots for this reason he demanded that they should grant to the calvinists liberty of conscience as an essential condition of the treaty opened with the queen this princess answered that to deprive the guises of the dignities they held at court would be to go directly against the agreement which was in negotiation and the resolution taken to restore the tranquillity of the kingdom that these lords who were very powerful and actually armed would not endure an affront so public and outrageous but that supported by the catholics and the majority of the states they would exert all their forces and efforts to maintain their ground she promised however to employ in due time all her address to diminish their credit and power as to the liberty of conscience she convinced him that it was a point too delicate to be granted all at once that the parliaments and even the states would not fail to oppose it but she promised in secret that in governing with the king of navarre she would labor in concert with him by indirect and concealed ways to seize all favorable occasions to grant to the reformed all the liberty of conscience that might be possible the queen yielding to the necessity of the conjuncture gave these promises without any intention to observe them she therefore delayed the execution of them with all her address in fact she knew or at least believed that nothing was more contrary to the grandeur and interest of her children than totally to depress the guises who served admirably well the purpose of balancing the power of the princes of the blood on the other hand the liberty of conscience granted to the huguenots would have offended the see of rome and the other catholic princes and scattered forever as she pretended disorder and dissension in the kingdom the coalition was on the point of conclusion when the king of navarre declared that he would determine nothing     without the advice and consent of the constable who had cured all his gouts fluxions and rheums or in other words dismissed his pretexts and approached orleans it was therefore necessary to invent new projects to surmount this obstacle which many imagined the most difficult of all the queen knew to the bottom the character of the constable and that nothing flattered him more than the part of umpire or moderator in every thing that passed around him she thought that by restoring to him the supreme command of the army and by assuring him that it was from him that she wished to hold her own grandeur and the safety of her children she would fix him easily in her own interest and detach him equally from both parties thus with the advice of the king of navarre and the guises who were returning to pacific sentiments and seemed to submit all to her will she ordered the captains of the guards and the governor of orleans to surrender to the constable at his entrance into the city the command of the armies and to acknowledge him for their chief these marks of honor awakened in the breast of anne of montmorenci the ancient sentiments of devotion and fidelity which had attached him so many years to the father and grandfather of the king arrived at orleans he turned to the captains and said with his ordinary dignity that since the king had restored him his command they might dispense with guarding his majesty so exactly in full peace and that without employing the force of arms he would make his master respected through the whole kingdom and by all his subjects arrived at the palace where the queen loaded him with honors he rendered his homage to the young king and with tears in his eyes conjured him to fear nothing from the present troubles for that he and all good frenchmen were ready to sacrifice their lives for the support of his crown the queen encouraged by this discourse the first proof of the success of her contrivances entered without delay into secret conferences with the constable before others had time to entertain and to gain him she protested that she expected every thing from him both for her children and herself that the royal authority and the public good were no longer any thing but idle names for two factions embittered against each other to their mutual destruction that she despaired of preserving to her children under age a crown envied and attacked by such powerful enemies unless     his fidelity of which he had so long given such shining proofs should cause him to embrace the defence of the young monarch of a kingdom torn with divisions and of all the royal family these words in the mouth of a woman a mother a queen in affliction made so deep an impression on the mind of the constable that he consented to the accommodation ready to be concluded with the king of navarre flattered with the humiliation of the guises and reëstablished in the functions of the first trust in the kingdom he renounced all interests of faction and resolved to unite with the queen for the preservation of the state in which he aspired only to reassume the place which he had merited by his long services concord being thus established by the authority of the constable they assembled the council all the princes and officers of the crown assisted at it and the chancellor having according to custom made the propositions in presence of the king they concluded unanimously that the queen should be declared regent of the kingdom the king of navarre lieutenantgeneral in the provinces the constable generalissimo of the armies the duke of guise grand master of the kings household and the cardinal de lorraine superintendent of the finances the prince of condé was now discharged from prison and an arrêt of the parliament of paris conceived in honorable terms discharged him from all the accusations against him and the sentence was declared null and irregular as the work of judges incompetent in the cause of the princes of the blood the vidâme de chartres died of chagrin in the bastile before the coalition was finished thus ended the year    0 in the beginning of the year      the queen mother and the king of navarre dismissed the statesgeneral lest the guises should excite some fermentation there the formation of a constitution and the settlement of religion were never the real objects for which they had been called it appears not that they were even asked to ratify the regency in the queen mother so loose and uncertain was the sovereignty of that great nation that a confused agreement of the chiefs of the two factions was thought sufficient for its government without any forms or legal solemnities the stability of the government and the security of the lives liberties and properties of the people were proportionate to such a system the court was still agitated with divisions and dissensions     the guises who had obtained but a small part of their pretensions—that is to say much in appearance and little in reality—accustomed to rule and very discontented with the government and with the queen who failed to perform the promises she had made to them watched all opportunities to regain their first advantages the prince of condé more irritated than ever kept in view his ancient projects and burned with an implacable desire of vengeance the colignis were obstinate to protect the huguenots the two parties labored to gain the constable but he declared that he would remain neuter and attach himself only to the king and the queen he was confirmed in this resolution by the conduct of the king of navarre who satisfied with the present arrangement lived in good intelligence with the regent and thought of nothing but peace the admiral his brothers and the prince of condé flattered themselves that the connection of blood would draw the constable ultimately to their party the guises who knew his attachment to the catholic faith and his aversion to calvinism which he had cruelly persecuted under henry ii despaired not to gain him under the pretext of defending religion and exterminating the huguenots the zeal of the king of navarre in urging the queen to accomplish the promises she had made him in favor of the huguenots contributed not a little to keep up this fermentation this princess satisfied with having established a kind of equilibrium which secured her power and that of her children dreaded to interrupt it and avoided all occasions of displeasing the king of navarre she made use of delays and pretexts in hopes that the king would relax but that prince excited and transported beyond the bounds of his character by the continued instigations of his brother and the admiral and by the urgent solicitations of the queen his consort became the more ardent in demanding what had been promised him the chancellor de lhôpital whether he judged a liberty of conscience necessary to the good of the state or whether he had an inclination to calvinism favored underhand the solicitations of the king of navarre he restrained with all his authority the severity of the other magistrates and exhorted the queen to be sparing of blood to leave consciences in tranquillity and to avoid every thing which might interrupt a peace which had cost so much pains to establish     several of those who composed the council supported these instances of the king of navarre and protested that they ought to be weary of imbruing their hands in the blood of frenchmen and that it was time to put an end to punishments the fear of which forced so many good subjects to abandon their houses families and country the huguenots themselves among whom were many persons of sense and merit neglected no cares nor means proper to favor their cause and sometimes by writing composed with art and skilfully propagated sometimes by petitions presented in proper seasons and sometimes by persuasive discourses of their partisans endeavored to impress the great in their favor by pathetic paintings of the misfortunes with which they were oppressed the queen was at length obliged to give way to the sentiments and authority of so many persons perhaps she was convinced of the wisdom of relaxing a severity which she was in no condition to maintain and of abandoning laws which they could no longer execute with rigor she consented therefore to an edict rendered by the council on the twentyeighth of january this edict enjoined all magistrates to release all the prisoners arrested on account of religion to stop all prosecutions commenced for this cause to hinder disputes upon matters of faith forbidding individuals to give each other the odious appellations of heretics or papists finally to prevent unlawful assemblies commotions seditions and maintain concord and peace in all their departments thus with the design of putting an end to punishments and the effusion of blood a motive dictated by religion and humanity calvinism was if not permitted at least tolerated and indirectly authorized more lively contestations were expected concerning the promise which respected the guises the king of navarre recalling to the queen the secret promises which she had made to him pretended that in his quality of lieutenantgeneral of the kingdom they ought to deliver to him the keys of the palace which the duke of guise kept as grand master of the kings household the queen in truth no longer doubted the attachment of the king of navarre and of the constable but she was not   0 ignorant of the increasing coldness of the guises and delayed with all her artifice the moment of offending them she wished on one hand to manage the huguenots protected by the admiral and the prince of condé and on the other the catholics united under the duke of guise and the cardinal of lorraine these two factions were like two powerful dikes under the shelter of which she enjoyed a calm by weakening the catholics she was afraid of putting the huguenots in a condition to give her the law sometimes by temporizing therefore and sometimes by granting other favors to the king of navarre she endeavored to divert him from this pretension but the more she endeavored to make him lose sight of this object the more the prince pursued it with warmth finally the queen that she might not destroy the harmony she had taken so much pains to establish commanded the captains of the guards no longer to carry the keys of the palace to the grand master of the kings household but to the lieutenantgeneral of the kingdom to whom this prerogative belonged of right this proceeding irritated the duke of guise but infinitely more the cardinal of lorraine his brother less because they considered it as an affront from which the regulation of the council of regency should have screened them than because they saw clearly that with the consent of the queen the king of navarre aspired to depress and destroy them they knew very well that they were accused of listening to nothing but their interest and ambition and seeing themselves no longer able to prevail in this private quarrel with the princes of the blood who disposed of all the forces as well as of the royal authority they dissembled their resentments and complained of nothing but the liberty of conscience which had been tacitly granted to the huguenots covering thus with the specious veil and the pretext of religion their passions and personal interests thus the discords of the great confounded themselves insensibly with the differences of religion and the factions of the princes quitting the name of malcontents and guisards to assume the more imposing titles of catholics and huguenots they exerted themselves with the greater fury as they disguised it under the names of zeal and of piety the regent and the constable masters of the person and authority of the king held the balance in the middle the     constable was indeed much opposed to calvinism and attached to the catholic religion nevertheless his affection for his nephews and the love of peace induced him to consent to make use of management in matters of religion until the king should arrive at his majority but to corroborate more and more the authority of the young monarch though a minor those who held the reins of government thought proper to conduct him to rheims where they preserve with veneration the vial which a pigeon brought down from heaven full of holy oil with which clovis was anointed and consecrated during the ceremony of consecration there arose a new contest concerning precedency between the princes of the blood and the duke of guise the former pretended that it was due to their birth the duke on his side demanded it as first peer of france the council of state decided it in favor of the duke of guise because the presence of the peers of france who are twelve in number six ecclesiastical and six laical was necessary in this ceremony whereas the princes of the blood who have no function to discharge in it may dispense with their attendance this light spark served to enkindle and embitter more and more the spirits of all parties the admiral and the prince of condé had set every machine in motion to draw in the constable to their interest they were powerfully seconded by the marshal of montmorenci his eldest son who was strictly connected with them the constable always firm in his resolutions could not determine to dishonor his old age by placing himself at the head of a party nor by leaguing himself with those whom he thought the new enemies of religion the admiral always fruitful in resources and expedients imagined one at this time calculated to bring the constable into their views by ways more indirect there was then held at pontoise an assembly of some deputies of the provinces to deliberate upon the means of acquitting the immense debts which the crown had contracted in the last wars the marshal of montmorenci presided in it there were also some friends of the admiral he made use of them to bring upon the carpet whatever he thought proper the colignis and the prince of condé there demanded by the organ of their confidants that they     should oblige all those who had received benefits or gratifications from the kings francis i and henry ii to return them to the royal treasury pretending that a calculation being made without imposing new burdens they might extinguish the greatest part of the debt which both within and without the kingdom crushed the state and individuals those who had received the greatest benefactions from the late kings were the guises diana of valentinois the marshal saintandré and the constable they were desirous indeed of humbling the former but as to the last they meant only to inspire him with fears and jealousies and to force him to join the party of the princes that he might not expose himself to lose the fruit of so many years of services and toils the animosity of faction was so lively that the colignis were not afraid to excite in their uncle those chagrins and inquietudes but this step had the ordinary fortune of designs too subtle and too refined it produced an effect directly contrary to that which was intended the proposition amounted to nothing less than to take away from the constable and the guises the greatest part of their property diana of valentinois with whom both parties had formed alliances began to second the constable concerning this research which interested them equally she concerted her plan with art or a kind of prudence which is not uncommon in women of her character her aversion for the queen and her fears of losing all the gains of her trade made her think that the true means of her safety would be to allure the constable into the party of the catholic religion and a closer connection with the guises she launched out into invectives against the admiral and the prince of condé whom she considered as the authors of the proposition made at the assembly at pontoise she deplored the miseries of the state whose government in the hands of a child and a foreign woman was the instrument of pernicious councils to foment the ambition and gratify the passions of certain individuals to whom were sacrificed the safety and tranquillity of the kingdom into which they introduced without shame heresies condemned by the church and against which the late kings with just severity had employed fire and sword she added with the same vivacity     and sincerity that all france was astonished and enraged to see that a montmorenci whose house had been the first of the whole nation to embrace christianity that a man who for so long a time had filled the first office in the state should at present allow himself to be fascinated by the artifices of a woman and that a slave to her caprices and to the imperfect information of the king of navarre he consented to all their enterprises against religion she remonstrated with the constable that having the arms and the power in his hands he was indispensably obliged to oppose the pernicious designs of government and to watch still as he had done so many times before over the conservation of a tottering throne and a religion wholly forsaken she recalled to his recollection that ancient conduct which had procured him so much glory in opposing the aggrandizement of strangers she conjured him not to suffer two women one an italian the other of navarre to ruin the principal foundations of the french monarchy that is to say religion and piety to remember that the regent was the same catherine whose conduct he had always censured and whose character he detested that the huguenots were those same sectaries whom he had so eagerly persecuted under henry ii that neither the persons nor the nature of things were changed that the whole world would believe that enfeebled by age he let himself be guided either by the ambition or caprice of others since he appeared so different from what he had been such was the language of diana and who so proper as a harlot to prostitute religion to the purposes of ambition avarice and faction the only wonder is that these discourses of the duchess which she took care frequently to repeat began to make an impression on the constable sometimes an indignation against his nephews sometimes the apprehensions of losing his fortune and sometimes his hatred against calvinism so disposed him to listen to the duchess that at length her insinuations together with those of magdalen of savoy his wife succeeded to detach him from the party of the queen this magdalen saw with vexation the unbounded favors granted to the colignis which she wished might be conferred     on her brother honoré of savoy marquis of villars thus her jealousy neglected nothing to serve the latter and to hurt the nephews of her husband diana also engaged the marshal de saintandré to second her in this negotiation the fear of losing his fortune the violent hatred which he conceived against the colignis and the plausible pretext of preserving the catholic faith urged him to employ his influence with the constable in favor of the guises who as soon as they were informed of it omitted neither artifices submissions nor intrigues to complete the conquest hoping by this means to reëstablish their power or at least to recover a great part of it the marshal of montmorenci was the only one who could cross this negotiation but diana his wife having fallen sick at chantilly he was obliged to leave his father to attend her the guises disembarrassed of this obstacle put the last hand to their agreement with the constable for the preservation of the catholic religion and the mutual defence of their fortunes the queen informed of this union thought herself deprived of her firmest support and dreaded that the princes of lorraine supported by the credit of the constable and discontented with her might attempt to take from her the regency she thought it necessary therefore to connect herself more strictly with the king of navarre to counterbalance this new party she directed all her cares to maintain that equilibrium which assured her power and that of her son she entered into all the views of the king of navarre in favor of the huguenots under the pretext of maintaining peace during the minority of the king and of conciliating the hearts of the people by a reputation of clemency she published new declarations which enjoined upon all the parliaments and all the other magistrates of each province to molest no man on account of religion to restore the goods houses and possessions to all those who in times past had been deprived of them on suspicion of heresy the parliament of paris and some other magistrates refused to comply but the huguenots thinking themselves authorized by the will and orders of the king of the regent and the dispositions of the council assumed to themselves as they had a better right to do from god and nature a liberty of conscience and their numbers and forces augmented from day to day this was to fulfil the views of the queen if these religionists had known how to     restrain themselves within the bounds of moderation and reason but as it commonly happens to people who suffer themselves to be transported by their passions and will not conform to the restraints of authority as soon as they felt themselves tolerated protected and delivered from the fear of punishment their resentments of former ill usage arose they lost the respect due to the magistrates and sometimes by public assemblies and sometimes by injurious discourses or other violent proceedings they drew upon themselves the hatred and indignation of the catholics hence arose obstinate disputes which throwing the two parties into quarrels spread tumult and insurrections through all the provinces of the kingdom thus contrary to the intentions of government and the expectations of the public the remedy employed to save the state and maintain peace became at least as our historian represents contagious and prejudicial and occasioned precisely those troubles and dangers which they sought so carefully to prevent the guises we may be sure were not at all mortified at this turn of affairs it was precisely what they wished encouraged and fortified by their union with the constable they seized this occasion to oppose the queen and the king of navarre the cardinal of lorraine finding the moment favorable to explain himself in council without regard to the queen or the king of navarre who were present began to speak on the state of religion and to represent with all the vehemence of his character that it was to betray religion and to dishonor themselves in the eyes of the whole earth to grant in a most christian kingdom liberty of conscience to innovators already condemned by councils and the voice of the church that not satisfied with disseminating monstrous opinions with corrupting the rising generation and imposing on the simplicity of the weak they blow up the fire of rebellion in all the provinces of the kingdom that already the insolence and outrages of these heretics hindered the ministers of the church from celebrating mass and from appearing in their pulpits and left to the magistrates scarce a shadow of authority that every thing was a prey to the sword and flames by the imprudence and obstinacy of those who arrogated to themselves the license of believing and teaching at their pleasure that the first kingdom of christendom was upon the point of making a schism of shaking off     the yoke of obedience due to the holy see and of abandoning the catholic faith to satisfy the caprice of a handful of seditious men the cardinal enforced these arguments with so much energy with that confidence and natural eloquence which gave him such an ascendency even in the most problematical opinions that the protectors of the huguenots opposed nothing to him but silence the king of navarre and the queen replied not a word and even the chancellor appeared amazed and confounded the counsellors of state irritated against the huguenots were of opinion that they should assemble immediately all the princes and officers of the crown to the parliament of paris there to treat on this subject in the presence of the king and determine the means of curing these disorders this assembly was accordingly held on the thirteenth of july      in parliament the king of navarre dared not alone to make opposition openly this would have been to declare himself a calvinist the queen indeed desired that the catholic party should not prevail but she was not the less apprehensive that they would impute to her the establishment and progress of heresy the contests in parliament were however animated the partisans of the huguenots forgot nothing that would procure them liberty of conscience as the only means proper to appease all troubles and heal all divisions their efforts were useless there was some reason for saying that liberty of conscience was evidently opposed to the spirit and authority of the catholic church but none at all for pretending that it was contrary to the fundamental laws of the kingdom it was decided that the calvinistical preachers and ministers should be driven out of the kingdom and that they should conform in the public worship wholly to the customs and ceremonies authorized by the roman church all assemblies of every kind and in every place with arms or without except in the catholic churches there to hear divine service according to their usages were forbidden to grant however some mitigation to the huguenots they added in the same edict that the cognizance of the crime of heresy should be reserved to bishops and their grand vicars and if they had recourse to the secular arm they could not condemn the guilty but to banishment finally they gave a general amnesty for all disorders committed in times past on account of religion a declaration accordingly     was drawn signed by the king the queen and all the princes and lords of both parties the prince of condé and the admiral irritated to see a party suppressed upon whose number and forces they had founded all their hopes and unable to hinder the execution of the edict which all the parliaments and most of the inferior tribunals pressed into execution with great ardor imagined another expedient—it was to engage the ministers of the huguenots to demand a public conference in presence of the king with the catholic prelates upon the controverted points this indirect method appeared to them proper to obtain insensibly a liberty of conscience the cardinal de tournon and several other catholic prelates opposed this request they remonstrated that it was useless to dispute about religion with a people who were very obstinate and who persisted in a doctrine condemned by the church that if they wished to lay open their reasons they might address themselves to the council of trent the opinion of the cardinal of lorraine was in favor of the conference whether he flattered himself that he should confound the huguenots by his irresistible reasoning and convince those whom he thought seduced or whether as those who envied him gave out by making an ostentatious exhibition of his eloquence and erudition he wished still further to increase his reputation and glory in so celebrated an assembly whatever were his intentions it is certain that by not opposing the demand of the protestants he drew into his sentiment the other prelates who yielded to the solicitations of the king of navarre this prince who had long desired to hear a dispute in form between the catholics and huguenots to clear up his own doubts supported with warmth the demand of the protestants they sent therefore safe conducts to the ministers refugees at geneva and assigned for the place of conference poissy a little town five leagues from paris the king appeared at poissy with all his court accompanied by the cardinals of bourbon of lorraine of tournon of armagnac and of guise who were to assist at the conference on the part of the catholics the most distinguished bishops and prelates several doctors of the sorbonne and other theologians of the most celebrated universities of the kingdom were present there appeared on the side of the huguenots theodore     beza peter martyr vermilly francis de saint paul john raymond john viret with several others who came from geneva or germany beza explained his doctrines with great pomp of eloquence and the cardinal of lorraine answered him with what he called proofs and authorities drawn from the scriptures and the fathers of the church the council judged proper to withdraw the young king because the tenderness of his age not permitting him to discern the truth there was reason to fear that he might be surprised by some dangerous opinion contrary to the faith after several debates the assembly separated without deciding any thing the catholics gained only one advantage the king of navarre was not satisfied with the huguenots having observed some variations of their ministers in the doctrines which they maintained some followed literally the sentiments of calvin others inclined to the doctrine of luther these adhered to the profession of faith of the swiss those to the confession of augsburg shocked with this inconsistency as he thought it this weak prince began to be disgusted with the new opinions and to attach himself to the catholic religion but the huguenots drew from this conference all the fruit that they had promised themselves as soon as they came out of it they boasted loudly that they had demonstrated the truth of their belief convinced the catholic doctors confounded the cardinal of lorraine and obtained of the king permission to preach their doctrine in fact of their own private authority they began to assemble wherever they pleased to hold publicly their sermons with so great an affluence of people and so great a concourse of nobility as well as others that it was no longer possible to restrain them when the magistrates attempted to hinder their assemblies or the catholics attempted to drive them from the churches where they met the huguenots ran to arms and defended themselves the two parties attacked each other with fury under the names of huguenots and papists the whole kingdom was in a flame the power of the magistrates lost its energy the people were in continual terror and alarms the collection of the revenues was interrupted and in the bosom of peace an intestine and cruel war was seen to be enkindled the queen mother and the king of navarre moved with these excesses     seeing that the severity of the edict of july had only increased the disorders convoked another assembly of deputies from all the parliaments of the kingdom to be informed by them of the state of each province and to deliberate upon the most proper means of reëstablishing tranquillity the views of the ministry changing continually as the interests of ministers and the passions of the great varied it was not astonishing that after so many measures taken abandoned reassumed affairs should still remain in greater disorder and a more strange confusion it was indeed impossible that such frequent variations should restore good order which an equal and uniform conduct could alone maintain this assembly was holden at paris in the beginning of the year      the queen according to her ordinary maxims employed herself in holding the balance between the two parties and to hinder one from prevailing over the other for fear she should be the victim of the strongest the greatest part of the magistrates concurred in her views some persuaded that it was impossible to restrain so great a multitude animated by a furious zeal for religion and others seeing with regret so much blood shed to no good purpose they prepared that famous edict of january which granted to the huguenots the liberty of conscience and the liberty of holding their assemblies and preaching their sermons upon condition that they should meet without arms without the cities in the fields and in presence of the judges of the places the parliaments and other tribunals opposed at first the execution of this edict but it was finally registered upon repeated letters of jussion sealed commands to do a thing which they had refused to do of the king and council this was a thunderbolt to the chiefs of the catholic party to bring on a crisis to force all the catholics to join them and to hinder the execution of the edict the duke of guise the constable all the cardinals except de tournon who was lately dead the marshals de brissac and saintandré quitted the court to oppose themselves with all their forces to the calvinistical party so near was liberty of conscience at that time to a complete and final establishment in france that nothing but this violent measure could have prevented it even this retreat of all the catholics would not have succeeded without another artifice they sufficiently foresaw   0 that as long as the good intelligence subsisted between the queen mother and the king of navarre they should have no power to intermeddle in the government of the kingdom and that all their efforts would be in vain they proposed therefore to break it convinced that the queen mother would never change her plan or her conduct at least until the majority of her son they thought it would be more easy to gain upon the understanding of the king of navarre their retreat enabled them to conduct with more secrecy this negotiation which required time and address dest legate of the pope and manriquez ambassador of spain let into the secret and intrusted with the conduct of it easily commenced the conferences by the interposition of the confidants of the king of navarre this weak prince had or pretended to have no longer the same inclination for the huguenots since the colloquy at poissy where he had remarked their variations upon the contested points of faith and not having found in theodore beza nor in peter martyr the same confidence as he thought that they affected when they dogmatized without contradictors he had consulted doctor baudouin equally versed in scriptures and in controversy this theologian had decided the king of navarre to reunite himself to the faith of the church and to adopt neither the profession of faith of the swiss protestants nor the confession of augsburg his acquiescence in the edict of january was less from any inclination to the huguenots than from an opinion that consciences ought not to be restrained and that toleration was an infallible means of extinguishing the troubles of the kingdom as soon as his confidants already disposed to serve the catholic party had informed the legate and ambassador that he was in this temper these last failed not to take advantage of it to open the negotiation in order to unite to motives of conscience personal advantages and temporal interests they proposed to him to divorce his queen jane with a dispensation from the pope because she was a heretic and to marry mary queen of scots the niece of the guises and widow of francis ii a princess who united to the charms of youth and beauty the actual possession of a great kingdom the king of navarre attached to his children rejected firmly this proposition they then brought upon the carpet once more the exchange of sardinia so often proposed in vain this was the delicate point which touched     him the most sensibly his hopes indeed were not very strong but this negotiation not having been wholly broken off manriquez the spanish ambassador by his ordinary artifice renewed it with so much apparent seriousness as to reanimate the desires and the confidence of the king of navarre not content with giving him the strongest assurances of the good dispositions of the catholic king he proceeded so far as to treat of the means of exchange and of the quality of the rents and services which the king of navarre should render the crown of spain as acknowledgments of its sovereignty they debated these clauses and conditions as seriously as if they were upon the point of signing the treaty the character of the king of navarre and his inclination to embrace always the most honorable and plausible measures favored the designs of the catholics this prince began gravely to acknowledge that the huguenots disguised their passions and their interests under the veil of christian charity and the cloak of religion moreover he was made to apprehend that the admiral with his policy would persuade all france to believe that the king of navarre blindly followed his counsels they piqued his jealousy by representing to him that the calvinists highly blamed his sloth and indolence while all their affections and attachments were to the prince of condé whose courage prompitude and magnanimity they never ceased to exalt and celebrate a last consideration of extreme importance touched a nerve of exquisite sensibility the king of france and his brothers were of feeble and delicate complexions ill constituted subject to dangerous distempers and too young to have children the succession to the crown regarded him as the first prince of the blood and to declare himself the head and protector of the huguenots was to place between the throne and him an impenetrable barrier to smooth his way the more easily to the throne he inclined to reunite himself to the catholic party to attract the favor of the pope and the king of spain and to attach to himself the forces of the faction which was the best united and the most powerful he began to distrust the councils of the queen his wife blindly devoted to calvinism and naturally an enemy of pacific measures the magnificent promises and persuasive discourses of the legate and of manriquez joined to so many other motives     determined him finally to unite himself with the constable and the duke of guise they declared loudly in words and by writings that they were leagued only for the defence of the catholic religion but their views were in reality much more vast the king of navarre abandoned one party in which he found himself eclipsed by his brother to attach himself to another in which they offered him more brilliant hopes and the guises entered into this convention only to reëstablish their credit and ancient grandeur such was the union which taught the french the art of forming leagues and combinations without the knowledge of their sovereigns the huguenots represented it in the most odious colors and called it the triumvirate the queen jane conceived a lively resentment of this unexpected resolution of her husband full of indignation to see him become the most ardent persecutor of her favorite religion in which she flattered herself she had confirmed him she resolved to quit the court and retired into béarn with the prince henry and the princess catherine her children whom she instructed in the reformed religion declining all further society and commerce with her husband the queen mother was not less alarmed with a change so sudden and incredible the triumvirate destroyed all the projects of an equilibrium which she had founded on the distrusts and animosities which divided the grandees she feared as much for the safety of her children as for her own authority these reciprocal variations these combinations of interests totally opposite to each other announced clearly enough to her understanding that this union concealed high hopes and vast designs she knew that the guises had unravelled her artifices and that burning with ambition they sought every means of reëntering into the ministry moreover what probability was there that the king of navarre would renounce the friendship of his brother and of his most faithful partisans to unite with his most cruel enemies if he had not been assured of great advantages in such a change she was not ignorant of the empire which is held over human hearts even the most upright by ambition and the thirst of ruling finally considering every thing which threatened her she could not dissemble her own weakness nor that of her children forced by these reflections to trust no longer either the sincerity of the king of navarre     or the demonstrations made by the catholics of having no design of making any innovation in the government a prey to constant terrors alarms and suspicions nothing was capable of calming her inquietude she passed often whole nights in conference with her confidants and among others with the bishop of valence and the chancellor de lhôpital their counsels and above all the critical position in which she stood determined her to form a coalition with the prince of condé and the admiral to favor their designs and support herself with their forces in order to counterbalance as much as possible the power of the opposite faction alleging among other motives to her catholic confidants that god himself permits evil for the sake of good and since the huguenots had caused so many disorders it was but just to make use of them to cure the distempers which had infected the heart of the state the huguenots delivered from the fear of punishment by the publication of the edict of january had begun to recover courage and held frequently public assemblies their party appeared considerable both by their number and the quality of their members and their forces were not inconsiderable the prince of condé had openly declared himself their head he was in appearance reconciled with the guises in obedience to the orders of the king but in his heart he burnt with an impatient desire to revenge himself against his principal persecutors for the outrages which he had received the admiral who in the view to aggrandize himself as well as his brothers became more strictly united than ever to the party of the huguenots moderated the ardor and vehemence of the prince by the maturity of his counsels under these chiefs and in the same sentiments were engaged the prince of porcien the lords of genlis of grammont of duras the earls of rochefoucauld and of montgomery the barons of ardrets of bonchavannes soubize and several other great men of the kingdom with any the least authority from government they were in a condition to resist and oppose boldly the opposite party the queen forced as she thought to take advantage of a conjuncture so favorable for her own defence and that of her children and reduced to the necessity of embracing the first party which presented however dangerous it might be expected from time and events the unravelling of all this intrigue she     feigned to be staggered by the reasonings of the huguenots and disposed to embrace their opinions to confirm them the more in this opinion by exterior demonstrations she caused their ministers to come into her apartment and appeared to hear them with pleasure she manifested great confidence and benevolence to the admiral and the prince of condé in the frequent conversations she had with them she deceived the duchess of montpensier by her false confidences and made use of her to allure the principal huguenots the better to color the promises and hopes which she gave in secret with apparent measures she wrote even to the pope in equivocal terms sometimes she demanded a free and general council such as the calvinists desired sometimes permission to convoke a national council another time she solicited the use of the communion in both kinds a dispensation to priests to marry the liberty of praying in the vulgar language and other similar innovations as the catholics called them which the huguenots wished and introduced de lisle the french ambassador at rome seconded her so perfectly that by exciting doubts concerning her faith in the minds of the pope and the catholics she obliged them to observe great caution in their own conduct for fear they should irritate her and disgust her against the roman religion by the same artifice she deceived the penetration and gained the hearts of the huguenots by persuading them that she was wholly disposed in their favor to such a degree that the implacable hatred which they once bore her had given place to confidence and attachment it was not the people only that she amused by these appearances the admiral himself in spite of all his policy and penetration had suffered himself to be seduced he hesitated not to give the queen a circumstantial account of the number forces and designs of the calvinists of the correspondences which they maintained both within and without the kingdom and of all other particulars which concerned his party the moment she gave him to understand that she desired to have exact information before she declared herself assuring him that she would openly embrace that party as soon as it should be sufficiently powerful to place her out of the reach of the vengeance of the catholics and the triumvirate composed of the duke of guise the constable and the king of navarre thus by a change equally prompt and     incredible the king of navarre attached himself to the catholic party and queen catherine at least in appearance became favorable to the huguenots these variations were at the time attributed to the levity of mind of the king of navarre and the natural inconstancy of the sex of the queen and it is thus that some historians have since judged who were either not capable or had not opportunity like davila to unravel the secret springs of these resolutions is it possible to place an unbalanced government in a light more despicable or more contemptible can human nature be more disgraced than by this endless series of unions separations coalitions combinations and tergiversations and yet it is most obvious that such a series must forever be the effect of a constitution where there is no legal equilibrium xxiv affairs had now taken a new face it was easy to foresee that the animosities of the two factions would never be extinguished but by arms and that the tempest which had long grumbled in the air would soon pour upon their heads accident soon produced a favorable conjuncture for precipitating france into the greatest misfortunes the king of navarre having declared himself openly for the catholic party fixed his residence at paris this city situated in the centre of france is much more populous more rich more magnificent and more powerful than any other in the kingdom this prince believing that the other cities would easily conform to the example of the capital forgot nothing to hinder the huguenots from holding their assemblies and preaching their sermons there in which the parisians in general enemies of the reformation seconded him with zeal by this means he hoped in time insensibly to diminish the credit and the forces of the protestants and take away their liberty of conscience which alone supported their existence the prince of condé resided also at paris where he promoted and fomented the designs of the huguenot ministers under the pretext of causing to be observed the edict of january he extended from day to day the liberty of conscience and whether by power or by right arrogated to himself a great     authority in what respected the state the king of navarre equally animated against his brother by a love of repose and by jealousy resolved to compel him to go out of paris several other motives determined him to put an end to troubles and seditions as well as conventicles in a city which was the firmest support of the catholic party but whether he felt himself too weak to attempt such an enterprise alone or whether he wished to consult his confederates before he executed any thing he invited the duke of guise and the constable to come and join him with their partisans the duke of guise since his retirement from court resided at joinville one of his country seats upon the frontiers of champagne and picardie upon the invitation of the king of navarre he departed for paris accompanied by the cardinal his brother a numerous retinue of gentlemen attached to his interests and two companies of men in arms the first of march in the morning as he passed by vassi a little town in champagne his people heard an unusual ringing of bells and having asked the reason of it were told that it was the signal of a sermon at which the huguenots assembled the valets and footmen of the duke who were most in advance on the road excited by the singularity of the thing and by curiosity to see one of these assemblies which were but lately begun to be publicly holden advanced in a tumult uttering their coarse jokes towards the place where the huguenots were assembled to hear their ministers the calvinists understanding that the duke of guise whom they regarded as one of their most ardent persecutors was not far off and seeing a troop of his people coming directly to them whether they dreaded some insult or whether they were piqued at the rude railleries and scornful speeches of this servile mob answered by acts of violence pelting with stones the first who were advancing towards their congregation this is the account of davila and at this day it may be of as little consequence to inquire which side began to use force as to ascertain which party fired the first gun at our lexington when a nation is prepared for a civil war when parties are formed and passions inflamed which can be extinguished no other way it is only for the sake of popularity necessary to inquire which strikes the first blow but in our american revolution we know it was the party who were in the habit of domineering     who began and such is commonly the case most probably de thou is in the right for the same reason who asserts that the duke of guises servants threw the first stones and if this was done without the dukes orders it is certain that his mother a bigoted furious catholic had often entreated him to deliver her from the neighborhood of the protestants of vassi and very probably she had inflamed his whole family against them however this might be the catholics abandoned all their prudence and attacked the protestants sword in hand and the skirmish soon became furious the duke informed of the tumult and wishing to appease it ran in all haste and rushed into the midst of the combatants while he reprimanded his own people and exhorted the huguenots to retire he was slightly wounded by the stroke of a stone upon his left jaw the blood which he lost obliged him to retire from the uproar when his followers growing outrageous had recourse to firearms forced the house where the calvinists had barricaded themselves killed more than sixty of them and their minister dangerously wounded escaped with great difficulty over the roofs of the neighboring houses when the commotion was assuaged the duke of guise sent for the judge of the place and reprimanded him for tolerating such conventicles the judge excused himself because these assemblies were permitted by the edict of january the duke as much enraged at this answer as at the disorder which occasioned it laid his hand on the hilt of his sword and replied with great fury—the edge of this steel shall soon deliver us from the edict which they think so solidly established these words uttered in the ardor of his indignation did not escape the attention of those who heard them and in the sequel he was accused of being the boutefeu and the author of the civil wars the huguenots irritated by the massacre at vassi could no longer contain themselves within the bounds of moderation not content with the excesses committed by them in several cities of the kingdom and especially in paris where they had massacred several catholics and set fire to the church of st medard they listened only to their own rage and excited everywhere troubles and bloody seditions monasteries were pillaged images broken altars overturned and churches profaned these excesses on both sides embittered mens minds and they everywhere     rushed to arms the chiefs of the two parties agitated by the same motives assembled their forces and prepared openly for war but the leaders of both factions were not ignorant that in the actual state of things they could not take arms without rendering themselves guilty of rebellion and that there was neither pretext nor color which could authorize any measures which tended to war the catholics could not interrupt the execution of the edict of january without controverting openly the decisions of the council and wounding the royal authority from which this edict had issued the huguenots had no reasonable motive to revolt while they were protected and allowed to enjoy the liberty of conscience granted them by that edict the leaders of each party desired to draw the king to their side and to become masters of his person either to abolish the edict or to derive new advantages from it in order to prove that their cause was the most just and that it was the opposite party which erected the standard of revolt by opposing the apparent will of the sovereign and by attacking even his person xxv the queen perfectly informed of all these projects and wishing to preserve with all her power her own liberty and that of her children continued to play off her artifices to balance the power of the grandees and to prevent the ascendency of one party over the other from drawing after it the ruin of the state thus that she might not be obliged to favor one or the other party she quitted paris and retired to fontainebleau she thought that in this residence where she was more at liberty than in paris they could not compel her to declare herself and she still studied to support the confidence which she had earned with both factions whose chiefs she amused by equivocal discourses and ambiguous promises the prince of condé and coligni yielding to the superiority of the catholic party had quitted paris to take arms the queen gave them secretly to understand that she was disposed to join them as soon as she should see them supported by forces sufficient to make head against their enemies on the other hand she protested to the king of navarre the constable and the duke of guise that she     had no intention to separate herself from the catholics nor to consent to the new reform any further than necessity and the advice of good men should oblige her to grant to the huguenots a moderate liberty her letters were not less ambiguous than her words and she did not explain herself more clearly abroad than at home she continually gave new instructions to the ambassadors in foreign courts and especially to delisle who resided at rome sometimes she contracted and at other times she extended their powers and by these variations held all minds in suspense but this conduct began to be more difficult than ever the chiefs of the two parties were not less politicians than herself during the course of her regency they had found opportunities to unravel all her artifices and penetrate all her disguises the king advanced in age and that circumstance was to them a necessity to hasten the execution of their designs his minority might give to certain measures a color which would no longer exist when he would be of age when all ought to depend upon his will to which they could no longer oppose themselves without the guilt of rebellion at the present moment they could pretend that their opposition was only to a bad administration and the pernicious designs of those who governed under his authority already the duke of guise more enterprising and more alive than the others directed at his pleasure the resolutions of his party he had drawn into his sentiments the constable and the king of navarre by persuading them that if they would all resort to court they might bring off the king and the queen mother to the capital and reduce them to the necessity of taking measures and issuing edicts as the catholics should judge convenient to their interests without exposing themselves any longer to the danger of being anticipated and without permitting their enemies to seize on the king and avail themselves of his authority the prince of condé had formed the same design he had retired at first to meaux and from thence to his estate at la ferté where he intended to assemble the main body of his forces this resolution was the effect of the advice of the admiral suggested by the queen and the projects of the catholics which had not escaped his penetration nothing being more common in civil wars than to discover the designs of the   0 enemy either by the infidelity of some to the secret or by the multitude of spies who are employed the chiefs of the catholic party had occasion only for their ordinary retinue to execute their design the neighborhood of paris which was wholly devoted to them assured them of sufficient forces and offered them favorable opportunities on the contrary the prince of condé weaker than his enemies and followed by few troops was obliged to wait for the lords of his party and the nobility whom he had summoned from several provinces who assembled but slowly thus the catholics were beforehand by appearing all well attended at the court their unforeseen arrival did not disconcert the queen although she depended little on the success of her intrigues she exerted herself to persuade the king of navarre to depart from court with the princes and lords who had accompanied him no man is ignorant said she to him that the catholic lords desire to take advantage of my weakness and that of my son to compel us to regulate the state according to their inclinations by governing at the will of their ambition and private interests this conduct directly opposite to the principles of honor and of fidelity of which they boast is not less contrary to the tranquillity and the conservation of the state which they pretend to have alone in view to issue new edicts and revoke those which have been published is it not to put arms into the hands of the huguenots these sectaries already so audacious and so ready to revolt will complain aloud of injustice if we annul without reason an edict prepared and accepted with the consent of both parties during the minority of the king we ought to avoid war and the troubles inseparable from it to the utmost of our care and power to whom will the nation impute the disasters which will overwhelm it will not eternal infamy be the portion of those who have the principal share in government it was to avoid these dangers and to take away all pretexts from the incendiaries that i subscribed the edict of january and quitted the capital the most effectual means of aggravating the violence of an evil which as yet is only creeping on secretly would be to carry us into a suspected city and repeal an edict already published the king of navarre and the catholic princes ought to remember that it belongs only to the flagitious whose fortune is uncertain or desperate to     excite civil wars the prince commands without contradiction the lords of his party loaded with riches dignities employments and honors enjoy the most flourishing fortune can they envy the people an imaginary and momentary liberty let them suffer the king to arrive at his majority without seeing his kingdom distracted with war forced by necessity i have only pardoned faults which i could not punish nor have i granted to the huguenots other liberty than that which they had usurped it is only by management that we can cure the people of this frenzy let the catholic chiefs then arm themselves with patience for fear that by rash remedies they may envenom an evil which may draw after it fatal revolutions and the most melancholy events if however you are resolved to make any alteration in the edict it ought only to be done by insensible degrees and by the favor of suitable opportunities and conjunctures to employ violent means would be to furnish the seditious with pretexts which they seek with so much ardor  xxvi these reasons of the queen urged and repeated with energy would have staggered the king of navarre and perhaps the constable if the duke of guise would have listened to them but he wished for war by the favor of which he flattered himself he should recover and even increase his ancient power moreover in quality of chief and protector of the catholic party he wished to annul by any means whatever all that had been done against his inclination to the prejudice of the church and to arrogate to himself all the glory of such a revolution he combated therefore with vivacity all the reasons of the queen and remonstrated to his confederates that they would infallibly lose all their credit and reputation by suffering themselves to be so easily amused by a woman who had no other design than to throw herself into the arms of the opposite party as soon as they from a blind confidence in her words should depart from court nothing added the duke will be more prejudicial to our cause nor more infamous for us than to avow that it is neither the public good nor the maintenance of the royal authority but private passions and personal interests     which have put us in motion it will be believed that the remorse of our consciences has obstructed us in the pursuit of our enterprise the artificial discourses of the queen ought not to prevail with us to abandon a resolution maturely weighed and taken by concert nor to interrupt the execution of a project dictated by reason prescribed by honor and commanded by that attachment which we have professed to religion whose preservation and interest have chiefly determined us to this measure it is no longer the season to delay and to waste time in disputes already the prince of condé is advancing in arms the forces of the huguenots are assembled they are ready to seize on the person of the king if we do not hasten to place him in a situation of safety and since we cannot terminate this affair by persuasion let us not be intimidated from employing force let us take away the king and leave the queen to take the part which she shall judge most convenient the resolutions of this princess are of little moment to us as soon as we shall be supported by the presence of our lawful sovereign aided by the authority of the first prince of the blood to whom by right of birth belongs the government of the kingdom the prince of condé united with the colignis and other lords of his party approached the court the constable and the king of navarre persuaded by the duke of guise gave the queen to understand that it was necessary to take her resolution without loss of time that for themselves they had resolved to conduct the king and his brothers to paris for fear they should fall into the hands of the huguenots who according to intelligence were not far distant that they would not abandon their master to the mercy of heretics who intended to take him away in order to make an ill use of his name and undermine the foundations of the monarchy that there was no time to be lost or trifled away that they should conduct the king to paris as their own honor and the good of the state required that as to herself they pretended not to constrain her in any thing but should leave her with all the respect that was due to her at liberty to dispose of her person as she should think fit the queen was not astonished at this declaration bold and sudden as it was she had foreseen it and determined beforehand on her plan in such a situation forced to declare herself although she foresaw that the two parties would soon     come to blows she would not abandon the catholic party she pretended that her honor and her reason attached her to it she imagined she saw her safety and that of her children in it taking therefore in an instant her resolution she answered with her usual presence of mind that no person was more attached than herself to the catholic religion nor more zealous for the good of the state that she would upon this occasion give way to their sentiments and since they were all for quiting fontainebleau she would concur with them with the utmost promptitude she gave orders for their departure but at the same time she wrote to the prince of condé a letter in which she lamented that she could not commit herself and the person of the king into the hands of his partisans according to the promise she had made him that the catholics had prevented them by conducting them by force to paris that provided he did not lose his courage she exhorted him not to suffer his enemies to take possession of the whole authority of government she then commenced her journey with the king and her other children surrounded by the triumvirate and the other catholic lords who to console her treated her with great respect and honor she arrived that evening at melun the next day at vincennes and in the morning of the third day at paris many persons observed the young king in tears thinking the catholic lords had deprived him of his liberty the queen irritated by the ill success of her artifices and foreseeing the calamities of an inevitable war discovered during the whole journey a mournful and mortified air and countenance the duke of guise was so little affected with this that he said freely and openly that the public good was a public good whether it was obtained by consent or by force the prince of condé was informed upon his march of the departure of the king and perceiving himself either prevented by the catholics or deceived by the queen made a halt and remained some time undecided what course he should take the terrible picture of those dangers which threatened him presented itself in lively colors before his eyes but the admiral who had remained a little in the rear arriving they conferred together a few minutes and the prince with a profound sigh cried out the die is cast we are too far advanced to retreat     he took immediately another road and marched with rapidity towards orleans of which he had for some time resolved to take possession this city one of the principal of the kingdom about thirty leagues from paris is vast well built and very populous it is situated in the province of beauce almost in the middle of france upon the banks of the loire a large navigable river which after having watered several provinces falls into the ocean in brittany orleans by its navigation and its facility of communication with several other provinces appeared to the prince very proper for a place of arms and the centre of his party and to be opposed in some sort to paris for several months that he had meditated to make himself master of this city he had entertained a secret intelligence with some of the inhabitants inclined to the doctrines of calvin whom he employed to engage a great part of the young men who were restless seditious and greedy of novelties as it is not intended to relate in detail the whole of this history it is sufficient to say that he got possession of orleans that the two parties published manifestoes and that chicanery negotiations battles sieges conflagrations and assassinations succeeded in all their usual train of horrors in civil wars xxvii we shall now content ourselves with reciting the summary of this first civil war after the publication of declarations and manifestoes the two armies took the field the queen mother wishes to avoid a war and to procure peace she negotiates an interview for this purpose with the prince of condé but without success she continues however to negotiate an accommodation and obtains a conclusion of it the prince repents of it by the persuasion of his partisans and resumes his arms he attempts in the night to surprise the royal army his enterprise does not succeed the king receives powerful reinforcements from germany and switzerland the prince of condé is obliged to shut himself up in orleans and separate his army which he could not hold together in a body he sends to demand succors in germany and england and consents to deliver havre de grace to the english and receive their garrisons into     rouen and dieppe the queen irritated and afflicted at these resolutions joins the catholic party and declares the huguenots rebels the royal army takes blois tours poitiers and bourges the fifteenth of september      it lays siege to rouen in the course of which the king of navarre visiting the trenches to reconnoitre the state of the place was wounded in the left shoulder by a shot of an arquebuse which broke the bone wounded the nerves and felled him to the ground as if he was dead he was carried immediately to his quarters where all the other generals assembled the surgeons who dressed his wound in the presence of the king and queen judged it mortal because the ball had penetrated too far into the body the twentysixth of october      the city was carried by assault and the whole army entered making a horrible carnage of the garrison and inhabitants by putting to the sword without any quarter all who presented themselves armed or unarmed the city was delivered up to be plundered except the churches and consecrated things which the soldiers were made to respect by the vigilance and good discipline of the generals the king of navarre suffering under the pains of his wound and wounded in spirit almost as much as in body insisted on embarking on the seine to be transported to saintmaur a pleasurehouse near paris where he often went to take the air and enjoy the tranquillity of solitude he scarce arrived at andeli a few leagues from rouen when his fever was augmented by the agitation of the bàteau he lost his senses and died in a few hours he united to his high birth an elegant person and a softness of manner if he had lived in other times and under a better constitution of government he might have been reckoned among the greatest princes of his age but the candor and sincerity of his heart the sweetness and affability of his disposition in the midst of political troubles and civil dissensions served only to hold him in continual agitation and inquietude inconstant in his projects and uncertain in his resolutions drawn away on one side by the impetuous character of his brother and excited by the party of the calvinists in which he long held the first rank restrained on the other hand by motives of honor as he thought by his natural inclination for peace and aversion to civil wars he discovered on many occasions but little firmness or constancy in his designs placed     in the number of those who lay under the reputation of seeking to distrub the state he shared in their disgrace and he was seen afterwards at the head of the opposite party persecuting those whom he had formerly protected in point of religion sometimes allured to calvinism by the persuasions of his wife and the discourses of theodore beza and sometimes brought back to the catholic faith by the torrent of fashion and the eloquence of the cardinal of lorraine he gained the confidence of neither party and left in his dying moments suspicious and equivocal ideas of his creed many thought that though he was in his heart attached to calvinism or rather to the confession of augsburg he separated from the huguenots from secret views of ambition and suffering impatiently that the prince his brother by his valor and greatness of soul had acquired among them more esteem than himself he chose rather to hold the first rank among the catholics than the second among the calvinists he died at the age of fortytwo in a time when his prudence increasing with age he might perhaps have surpassed the opinion which had been conceived of him jane of albret his widow continued in possession of the title of queen and of what remained of navarre she had two children—henry prince of béarn then nine years of age and afterwards the allglorious henry iv of france and the princess catherine then very young their mother lived with them at pau and at nerac supervising their education in the new religion the prince of condé reinforced by the auxiliary forces from germany makes haste to attack paris the king and queen return thither with their army and after various negotiations the prince is constrained to depart the two armies march towards normandy a memorable battle is fought at dreux where the prince of condé is made prisoner by the catholics and the constable by the huguenots in the first onset of this action gabriel of montmorenci the son of the constable had been killed the comte of rochefort had been thrown from his horse and lost his life and the catholics in spite of all their bravery began to give way the german cavalry armed with pistols and divided into two large squadrons having joined the admiral in this critical moment made a fresh charge with such fury that they broke the catholics and forced     them to fly the constable who fought in this place with great bravery exerted himself in vain to stop and rally the fugitives his horse fell under him and he was wounded in the left arm surrounded by the germans and made prisoner after having seen perish at his side the duke of nevers and several other officers of distinction the prince of condé in charging the cavalry of the duke of guise was afterwards wounded in his right hand and covered over with blood and dust and sweat was made prisoner by damville who wishing to avenge the capture of his father fought with desperation the duke of guise remained master of the field of battle the baggage and artillery of his enemy the prince of condé was brought into the presence of his conqueror and it was a memorable scene to see those two famous men whom past events and especially the last battle had rendered implacable enemies reconciled at once by the caprice of fortune sup at the same table and for want of other lodgings and better accommodations pass the night in profound sleep on the same bed those who first fled from this action carried to paris the news of the defeat and captivity of the constable and threw the court into deep mourning and great inquietudes they were dissipated however a few hours afterwards by the captain of the kings guards being despatched by the duke of guise the news which he spread and the assurances which he gave of the victory gained by the catholics diminished the grief caused by the death of so many brave men whose loss had put all france in mourning besides the lords and knights of distinguished nobility and reputation they reckoned eight thousand men among the slain the duke of guise acquired a glory without bounds by this victory which gave a great check to the huguenots the king and queen declared him general of the army and he took the route to orleans that he might not leave his enemy the time to repair their losses xxviii the siege and defence of orleans may be a good lecture on the military art but is not directly to our purpose which at present     is only to relate the fortunes and catastrophe of the great actors in those scenes of emulation which have been before described there was in the party of the huguenots a gentleman named poltrot of an active mind and a designing character he had lived some years in spain and having afterwards embraced calvinism and resided some time at geneva he discovered so much zeal for his new faith and entered so earnestly into all the intrigues of the party that the calvinists in general considered him as a personage capable of attempting in their favor the most hazardous enterprises it is not one of the least evils of a civil war that no mans character is secure against suspicions and imputations of the most enormous crimes it is almost the universal practice for each party to charge the leaders of the other with every base action every sinister event and every highhanded wickedness without much consideration or inquiry whether there is truth or evidence or even color to support the accusation the catholics pretended that the admiral and theodore beza engaged poltrot to assassinate the duke of guise by promises of great rewards and by persuading him that he could do nothing more acceptable to god than to deliver his people from their most cruel persecutors poltrot yielding to their instigations pretended to have abandoned the calvinist party and threw himself into the royal army where having insinuated himself into the house of the duke of guise he watched for a favorable moment to execute his design the twentyfourth of february      the duke after having given his orders for an assault which he intended to make the next day at the bridge of orleans returned at night to his quarters about a league distant from the trenches poltrot mounted on a spanish horse very fleet waited for him on his passage and seeing him accompanied only by a gentleman of the queen with whom he was closely engaged in conversation he shot him in the back with an arquebuse loaded with three balls the duke was without arms the three balls struck him under the right shoulder and pierced him through the body he fell from his horse for dead his gentlemen who marched before that they might not interrupt his conversation returned at this accident and carried him to his lodgings where as soon as they had examined     his wound his life was despaired of the king the queen mother and all the lords in the army at the news of so fatal a disaster hastened to the dukes lodgings but all their cares and remedies were useless he died in three days with great sentiments says davila of piety and religion discovering in his discourses a greatness of soul and a most admirable moderation this prince united with the highest valor and singular abilities a consummate prudence as profound in council as active in execution he always saw his designs crowned with the happiest success these qualities had procured him the reputation of the first captain of his age and his exploits merited the title of the defender and protector of the catholic religion he left a name glorious and celebrated to posterity tarnished however to endless ages with the just imputation of intolerance poltrot had escaped into a neighboring forest but tortured by the remorse of his conscience and by the terror of being pursued on all sides he wandered all night in the woods without being able to find the road to orleans the next morning exhausted by fatigue he was arrested by some swiss guards and led to the queen and the principal officers of the army he alternately accused and acquitted both on the rack and at his execution the admiral and theodore beza who published declarations throughout all europe denying in the most solemn manner their knowledge of the design of poltrot the court hastened the execution of this monster by quartering him between four horses before an opportunity had been given to confront and examine him as the admiral requested the consequence was that the suspicion was fastened on these two austere and excellent characters in the minds of the catholic party though they have been uniformly acquitted by the whole impartial world in consequence of the prejudices of the catholics the children of the duke of guise preserved a cruel resentment and took a horrible revenge the death of the duke of guise was followed by a general peace and the royal army retakes havre de grace from the english the king arrives at his fourteenth year and is declared of age the queens inventive genius imagines various means of appeasing the discontented princes and to accomplish her designs travels with the king through all the   0 provinces of the kingdom in dauphiny they contrived an interview with the duke of savoy at avignon with the ministers of the pope and on the frontiers of guienne with the king and queen of spain to these princes they might communicate their secret designs without apprehension of their coming to the knowledge of the huguenots which would have been almost inevitable if they had employed ambassadors the queen with her usual dissimulation endeavored to prevent the public from suspecting her genuine design and secret views she pretended that it was a simple desire in the king to see his kingdom and show himself to his people the queen pretended to consent to it only to display before the eyes of the people the magnificence of her court and to see her daughter the queen of spain under the veil of these appearances so different from the truth nothing was seen but magnificent preparations and sumptuous liveries nothing was talked of but huntings balls comedies and feasts the interviews and intrigues in the course of their journey with the dukes of lorraine of wirtemberg and other chiefs of the protestants or catholics in germany the count palatine the duke of deux ponts the duke of saxony and marquis of baden the duke of savoy and the ministers of the pope we pass over in      at bayonne they met the queen of spain accompanied by the duke of alva and the count de benevento while they pretended to be there wholly employed in feasts and pleasures they held secret councils in concert to abolish the diversity of religion the duke of alva a man of a violent character whose very name as well as that of the cardinal de lorraine is associated in every mind with bloody bigotry and antichristian intolerance said boldly that to cut the root of all novelties in matters of religion it was necessary to cut off the heads of the poppies to angle for the large fish not amuse themselves with the frogs when the winds shall cease to blow the waves of the populace will soon be calmed  these are the miserable maxims of tyranny whether it be exercised by a single man or a multitude there is no difference according to aristotle and history and experience between a people governing by a majority in a single assembly and a monarch in a tyranny for their manners are the same     and they both hold a despotic power over better persons than themselves their decrees are like the others edicts their demagogues like the others flatterers old tarquin would not utter these maxims in words to the messenger of his son from gabii but walked out into his garden and struck off the heads of the tallest poppies with his staff with no better authority than these trite aphorisms of despotism did the duke of alva support his dogmatism that a sovereign could do nothing more shameful or contrary to his interests than to grant to his subjects liberty of conscience and his advice to employ fire and sword to exterminate the chiefs of the huguenots xxix the queen mother had either more hypocrisy more softness of temper or more cunning she was for essaying all means of alluring the chiefs of the huguenots to the bosom of the church and their obedience to the king the difference of circumstances of manners of interests and characters as usual divided their sentiments and causing them to look at things on different sides dictated opposite resolutions the two kings however take measures in concert to suppress rebellions the queen of navarre comes to court the king engages the family of the châtillons to a reconciliation with that of the guises their reciprocal hatreds soon rekindle and break out afresh the queen of navarre in discontent quits the court the advice of the duke of alva was conformable to the temper and character of this king he said he highly relished the sentiment of the duke that the heads of those rebels were too high in the state the four families of bourbon montmorenci guise and châtillon all stimulated by other subordinate families dependent on them continue their emulations fallacies hatreds envies oppositions intrigues manœuvres combinations decompositions tergiversations another civil war breaks out the history of which with its causes and events we shall leave the reader to read in detail     in      at the battle of st denis the constable de montmorenci in spite of five wounds he had received in the head and face fought with extreme valor and endeavored to rally his troops and lead them back to battle when robert stuart a scot came up to him and presented a pistol to him the constable said to him are you ignorant then that i am the constable it is because i know you said stuart that i present you this and at the same time shot him in the shoulder with his pistol although the violence of the blow struck down the constable he had strength enough left to strike stuart in the face with the hilt of his sword which remained in his hand though the blade was broken with such force as to break his jaw beat out three of his teeth and bring him down by his side half dead the huguenots were defeated however but the next day the constable died at the age of fourscore after having shown in the action as much enterprise bravery and vigor as if he had been in the full strength of his youth he preserved to his last moment an admirable firmness and presence of mind a priest approached his bed to prepare him for death the constable turned to him with a serene countenance and prayed to be left in repose adding it would be shameful for him to have lived eighty years without learning to die for half an hour his wisdom his rare prudence and long experience in affairs procured for him and his family immense riches and the first employments under the crown but he was always so unfortunate in the command of armies that in all the enterprises where he had the commandinchief he was either beaten or wounded or made prisoner the calvinistic army retired into champagne and afterwards into lorraine to meet the troops they expected from germany the queen whom the death of the constable had now delivered from the power and ambition of the grandees and who remained the single arbiter of the catholic party would no longer expose herself to the dangers of an unlimited power by advising the king to name another constable or general of the army she judged more proper to reserve to the disposition of the king and in her own power the whole authority of the command she therefore persuaded charles by many reasons to place at the head of his army the duke of anjou his brother a young prince of great hopes but who was not yet sixteen     years of age the army is reinforced by succors sent from flanders by the king of spain and from piedmont and many other places the duke of anjou follows the huguenots to give them battle before their junction with the germans he overtakes them near châlons but the misunderstandings and other obstacles excited in his council hinder him from hazarding a battle the calvinists pass the meuse and form a junction with the auxiliary troops commanded by the prince casimir they return into champagne the queen goes to the army to extinguish the divisions that reign there they take the resolution not to attack the huguenots now become too formidable but to draw out the war into length the two armies march off satisfied with observing each others motions this fabian system of the catholics disconcerts the prince of condé and the admiral unprovided with money to support for any length of time their army in order to draw the royal army to battle they form the siege of chartres the danger of that city gives occasion to new propositions of peace indeed a peace is concluded and the two armies are separated but the huguenots did not surrender all the places they were masters of nor did the king discharge his swiss or italian troops which occasion new quarrels the court seeing that the huguenots did not execute the conditions under which they had been promised an oblivion of the past attempts to take off the prince of condé and the admiral who had retired well accompanied to noyers in burgundy they are advertised of their danger and escape to la rochelle reassemble their forces and make themselves masters of saintonge poitou and touraine the king orders the duke of anjou to march against them the two armies meet at jaseneuil without engaging they meet again at loudun the rigor of the season prevents a battle the excessive cold obliges them to march at a distance from each other distempers break out in both armies and carry off vast numbers they open the next campaign in the month of march the huguenots pass the charente break down the bridges and guard all the passages the duke of anjou by the means of a stratagem passes the river the battle of jarnac ensues on the sixteenth of     march      this famous action so fatal to the protestant cause and to liberty of conscience in france as to have annihilated or at least to have oppressed both for two hundred and fifty years took place the young duke of guise distinguished himself on that day by attacking the left wing of the calvinists commanded by the admiral and dandelot at the head of the nobility of brittany and normandy and gave proofs of a courage and talents capable of performing as much good or committing as much evil as his father had done the prince of condé who commanded the main body opposed to the duke of anjou supported with intrepidity the shock of the enemy and when abandoned by his right and left charged on all sides by the conquerors and surrounded by a whole world of enemies he and those who accompanied him fought with desperation in arranging his squadrons he had been wounded in the leg by a kick of the duke de la rochefoucaulds horse and in the combat his own was killed and overthrown upon him this prince thus dangerously wounded put one knee to the ground and continued to fight until montesquiou captain of the guards of the duke of anjou shot him through the head with a pistol robert stuart who had killed the constable at the battle of st denis and almost all the gentlemen of poitou and saintonge were cut in pieces by the side of the prince the duke of anjou fought in the first ranks of his squadron with a valor above his years had a horse killed under him and ran great risks of his life the huguenots lost near seven hundred noblemen or knights of distinction the soldiers in derision with scoffs and insults brought the body of the prince of condé upon an ass or packhorse to the duke of anjou at jarnac   lan mil cinq cens soixante et neuf   entre jarnac et châteauneuf   fut porté mort sur une ânesse   le grand ennemi de la messe young henry prince of navarre begged the body of the duke of anjou who sent it to vendôme to the tombs of his ancestors thus lived and died louis of bourbon prince of condé whose valor constancy and greatness of soul distinguished him above all the greatest princes and most famous     captains of his age i shall reverse the reproaches of davila and say that he deserves to be canonized as one of the protomartyrs to liberty of conscience instead of that crowd of bloody tyrants with which the calendar has been disgraced the affairs of the huguenots were in a critical situation it was not doubted but that after the death of the prince the admiral would be chosen for their chief both because of the distinguished employments which he had held in the party and the reputation which his prudence had acquired after the battle of dreux when the prince was made prisoner the whole party with unanimous consent had deferred to coligni the honor of the command but at present there were several gentlemen who by their birth their riches or their other qualities thought themselves not his inferiors some of these tore his reputation with slanders some detested the austerity of his character manners and habits unhappy admiral thy fortune however is not singular merit talents virtues services of the most exalted kind have in all ages been forced to give way not to family pride for this alone would be impotent and ridiculous but to the popular prejudice the vulgar idolatry or the splendor of wealth and birth with which family pride is always fortified supported and defended the admiral had lost by malignant fevers his brother dandelot and his friend boucard deprived of these two the party which interested itself in the grandeur and elevation of the admiral was considerably weakened but coligni surmounted all obstacles by his address he began by renouncing in appearance those chimerical titles with which a vain ambition would have been satisfied proposing however in fact to preserve all the authority of the command he resolved to declare chiefs of the party and generals of the army henry prince of navarre and henry prince of condé son of the deceased prince during the childhood of these the admiral remained necessarily charged with the conduct and administration of all affairs of importance it was among protestants as well as catholics in the cause of liberty as well as that of tyranny the only means of repressing the ambition and pretensions the envy jealousy     malignity and perfidy of the grandees the only means of answering the expectations of the people and of uniting minds which the diversity of sentiment had already very much divided in this resolution without demanding what he felt he could not obtain the admiral entreated the queen of navarre to come to the army representing to her that the moment was arrived for elevating the prince her son to that degree of grandeur for which he was born and to which she had long aspired the queen was not wanting in courage or fortitude already resolved at all hazards to declare her son the head of the party she came with all the diligence which a stroke of so much importance required and appeared with the two princes at the camp at cognac discord reigned in the army notwithstanding the necessity of union and unanimity to such a degree that it was on the point of disbanding the queen of navarre after having approved the views of the admiral assembled the troops she spoke to them with a firmness above her sex and exhorted all those brave warriors to continue constant and united for the defence of their liberty and their religion she proposed to them for chiefs the two young princes who were present and whose noble air interested the spectators adding that under the auspices of these two young shoots from the royal blood they ought to hope for the most happy success to the just pretensions of the common cause this discourse animated the courage of the army who appeared to forget in an instant the chagrin caused by the loss of the battle and by the dissensions which had followed it the admiral and the earl of rochefoucauld were the first to submit and to take an oath of fidelity to the princes of bourbon the nobility and all the officers did the same and the soldiers with great acclamations applauded the choice which their generals had made of the princes for chiefs and protectors of the reformed religion this in human imaginations is considered and in human language is called dignity the greatest statesman and the greatest general of his age must resign the command of his own army even in the cause of religion virtue and liberty to two beardless boys because they had more wealth and better blood henry of bourbon prince of navarre aged fifteen had however a lively spirit a great and generous soul and discovered a decided inclination for war animated by the councils     of his mother he accepted without hesitation the command of the army and promised the huguenots in a concise military eloquence to protect their religion and to persevere in the common cause until death or victory should procure them liberty the prince of condé whose tender age did not permit him to express his sentiments marked his consent only by his gestures thus the prince of navarre who joined to the superiority of age the prerogative of first prince of the blood became really the head of the party in memory of this event the queen jane caused medals of gold to be struck which represented on one side her own bust on the other that of her son with this inscription—pax certa victoria integra mors honesta—a safe peace complete victory or honorable death coligni remains charged with the conduct of the war by reason of the youth of the princes he divides his troops and throws them into the cities which adhered to him the duke of anjou pursues his victory and forms the siege of cognac which he is obliged however to raise by the vigorous resistance of the besieged he takes several other cities a new army of germans commanded by the duke of deuxponts enters france to assist the huguenots wolfgang of bavaria duke of deuxponts excited by the money and the promises of the huguenots with the aid of the duke of saxony and the count palatine of the rhine and at the solicitation of the queen of england had raised an army of six thousand infantry and eight thousand horse in the same army was william of nassau prince of orange and louis and henry his brothers who after having quitted flanders to avoid the cruelty of the duke of alva supported the interests of the calvinists of france whose religion they professed this army marches towards the loire takes la charité and passes the river the duke of deuxponts dies of a fever and is succeeded in command by count mansfeld the princes and their mentor the admiral march to meet this succor the duke of anjou for fear of being surrounded by these two armies retires into limousin the huguenots combined with their allies follow the royal army a spirited action ensues at rocheabeille the sterility of the country forces the huguenots to retire the queen mother comes to the camp the resolution is taken to separate the royal army to leave the forces of the huguenots to consume by     time it is separated in fact and the duke of anjou retires to loches in touraine xxx the huguenots lay siege to poitiers the duke of guise resolves to throw himself into it to succor the garrison this young prince the object of the hopes of the catholics proposed to himself to become one day their chief by imitating thus at the beginning of his career by an illustrious and memorable example the glory of his father who by the defence of metz against the forces of the emperor charles v had prepared his way to the highest power and most brilliant reputation the duke of anjou proposes to raise the siege by a diversion he assembles his army and leads it to châtelleraud the admiral raises the siege of poitiers and obliges the duke of anjou to raise that of châtelleraud the duke of guise however by his activity in defence of poitiers and his frequent sallies came out of it covered with glory and applause the whole catholic party began to consider him as the support of religion and the worthy successor of the power of his father sansac in vain lays siege to la charité the earl of montgomeri defeats the royalists in béarn surrounds terride and takes him prisoner the duke of anjou came to tours to consult with the king his brother and the queen mother the duke of guise came there also shining with honor and glory for the great actions by which he had signalized himself at the defence of poitiers they all deliberated on the means of pushing the war and the duke of guise coming in the place of his father was then admitted for the first time into the secret council he owed this favor to the splendor of his birth to the services of his father to his own valor to the protection of the cardinal of lorraine his uncle but above all to the implacable hatred which the king had conceived against the admiral after the death of the prince of condé at the battle of jarnac charles had entertained hopes that the calvinistical party no longer supported by the authority of a prince of the blood nor of a general capable by his reputation and his valor of supporting the weight of so great an enterprise would separate and disperse or at least incline to submit but he saw on the contrary that the policy of the     admiral had reanimated the forces of his party that his valor and his ability by availing himself of the name of the two young princes of the blood royal had preserved union among the calvinists caused greater commotions and exposed the state to dangers more terrible than any which had been before experienced he therefore caused the admiral coligni to be declared a rebel by an arrêt of the parliament of paris which was published and translated into several languages they dragged him in effigy upon a hurdle and attached him to a gibbet in the place destined to the execution of malefactors they ordained that his houses should be razed to the foundations and his goods sold at auction from this time the king resolved to pursue the admiral to death began to elevate and favor the house of lorraine and above all the duke of guise who burning with ardor to avenge the death of his father did not dissimulate the implacable hatred he bore to coligni the admiral continues the war with vigor the duke of anjou whose army had been reinforced seeks a battle the admiral endeavors to avoid it at length he prepares for it forced by a mutiny of his own army who demand it he endeavors nevertheless to retire the duke of anjou pursues him and joins him near moncontour the two armies come to action on the plains of moncontour and a bloody battle ensues victory remains to the duke of anjou with a great carnage of the huguenots the party is discouraged but the admiral although dangerously wounded raises their spirits and persuades them to continue the war the princes and the admiral abandon the whole country except la rochelle angoulême and saintjean dangeli their design was to join the earl of montgomeri a resource which fortune seemed to have reserved to reëstablish their forces and repair their losses after that junction they intended to remain in the mountains until the princes of germany and the queen of england should send them succors they founded moreover some hopes on the marshal of damville governor of languedoc who for some time appeared inclined in their favor and with whom they maintained a secret intelligence while the constable lived damville had held a distinguished rank in the catholic party and had shown himself a declared enemy of the huguenots his jealousy against francis of montmorenci his   0 elder brother who was connected in friendship with the prince of condé and the colignis his relations had inspired him with this hatred of the calvinists which had been fomented by the esteem which the guises professed for him and the favors they procured him able and profound in dissimulation according to conjunctures they had employed all possible artifices to retain him in their party and by his intervention to attach to them indissolubly the constable who discovered much predilection and partiality for damville whom he believed superior in courage and abilities to his other children the queen mother made him the same demonstrations obliged during the minority of the king to manage the grandees she employed the marshal damville to preserve her the attachment of the constable but after his death all these motives and considerations ceased the queen who had no longer occasion for damville gave herself little trouble to reward his services the guises far from showing him the same regard employed the management and persuasions of the cardinal of lorraine who was now very high in favor with charles ix to depress and disserve the marshal as a sprout of a house which had been long the object of hatred and jealousy to that of lorraine damville soon perceived this change the death of his father put an end to his differences with his elder brother who was not less exasperated than himself at the refusal of the office of constable possessed so long by their father and which they had solicited more than once he began to make advances to the friends and relations of his family and sought to renew an intercourse with the admiral to whom he intimated secret though uncertain hopes this motive had hindered him from succoring terride in béarn and from taking from the huguenots the places which they held in gascony and languedoc he was the more inclined in favor of the calvinists as he saw the admiral already advanced in years and every day exposed to evident dangers if this nobleman should die before the princes were of an age to command damville hoped to succeed him in the command of the calvinistic party finally he dreaded that if the king and the guises should overbear the princes the admiral and all the huguenots they would then turn their efforts against the family of montmorenci which would remain alone of all the ancient rivals who had inspired     him with jealousy these dispositions did not escape the penetration of the admiral excited by such hopes he persuaded the princes to abandon the flat country and retire with a small number of troops into the mountains of gascony and languedoc the duke of anjou besieges and takes saintjean dangeli and loses much time and many soldiers he falls sick and retires first to angers and then to saint germain the princes join the earl of montgomeri and reinforce their troops in gascony they pass the winter in the mountains and descend into the plains in the spring they pass the rhône and extend themselves into provence and dauphiné they march towards noyers and la charité with the design to approach paris the king sends against them an army under the command of the marshal de cossé a general of little activity and who desired not the ruin of the huguenots from a fear of confiding his armies to noblemen whom their elevation their power and their animosities or the great number of their partisans had rendered suspected by him the king committed the conduct of it to a general who persisting in his ordinary inclination gave the huguenots a favorable opportunity to revive this resolution was also attributed to the policy of the duke of anjou who dreaded that some other general might take away the fruit of his labors and victories it is pretended that such motives engaged him to inspire the king with suspicions against all the other princes and generals and to prefer to them a man whom he considered as incapable of gaining any great advantages xxxi patrum interim animos certamen regni ac cupido versabat the two armies met in burgundy but the princes being inferior evaded an engagement the queen mother in    0 had too much penetration not to unravel the manœuvres of the marshals de cossé and damville she informed the king of them and persuaded him to listen to propositions of accommodation she perceived that the passions and the perfidy of these grandees might throw the state into the greatest dangers if the war was continued she was still more determined by the news which she received from     germany where the prince casimir began to raise troops in favor of the huguenots the finances were exhausted to such a degree that they knew not where to find funds to pay the swiss and italian troops to whom they owed large arrears in short they wished for peace and were weary of a war which held all mens minds in perpetual alarm which reduced a great part of the people to beggary and which cost the state so many men and so much money the king held with the queen mother the duke of anjou and the cardinal of lorraine councils in which they resolved to return to the project already so many times formed and abandoned to grant peace to the huguenots to deliver the kingdom from foreign troops and finally to employ artifice and take advantage of favorable conjunctures to take off the chiefs of the party which they thought would yield of itself infallibly as soon as it should see itself deprived of the support of its leaders it was thus that the court would have substituted craft instead of force to execute a design which the obstinacy of the huguenots or the want of fidelity in those who commanded armies had always defeated when recourse had been only to arms with such dark and horrid views were overtures of peace made and conditions concluded the princes and admiral still diffident and distrustful retire to rochelle the king endeavors to gain their confidence to this end he proposes to give his sister marguerite in marriage to the prince of navarre and to make war in flanders upon the spaniards the marriage is resolved on and all the chiefs of the huguenots come to court the queen of navarre is poisoned after her death the marriage is celebrated during the feasts of which admiral coligni is wounded by an assassin the king takes the resolution that as in extreme cases it is imprudence to do things by halves the huguenots should be exterminated the night between the twentythird and the twentyfourth of august      a sunday called saint bartholomews day the admiral is massacred and almost all the other calvinists are cut in pieces in paris and in several other cities in the kingdom such in nations where there is not a fixed and known constitution or where there is a constitution without an effectual balance are the tragical effects of emulation jealousies and rivalries—destruction to all the leaders poverty beggary and     ruin to the followers france after a century of such horrors found no remedy against them but in absolute monarchy nor did any nation ever find any remedy against the miseries of such rivalries among the gentlemen but in despotism monarchy or a balanced constitution it is not necessary to say that every despotism and monarchy that ever has existed among men arose out of such emulations among the principal men but it may be asserted with confidence that this cause alone is sufficient to account for the rise progress and establishment of every despotism and monarchy in the four quarters of the globe it is not intended at this time to pursue any further this instructive though melancholy history nor to make any comparisons in detail between the state of france in      and the condition it was in two or three centuries ago but if there are now differences of opinion in religion morals government and philosophy if there are parties and leaders of parties if there are emulations if there are rivalries and rivals—is there any better provision made by the constitution to balance them now than formerly if there is not what is the reason who is the cause all the thunders of heaven although a paratonnere     had never been invented would not in a thousand years have destroyed so many lives nor occasioned so much desolation among mankind as the majority of a legislature in one uncontrolled assembly may produce in a single saintbartholomews day saint bartholomews days are the natural necessary and unavoidable effect and consequence of diversities in opinion the spirit of party unchecked passions emulation and rivalry where there is not a power always ready and inclined to throw weights into the lightest scale to preserve or restore the equilibrium† with a view of vindicating republics commonwealths and free states from unmerited reproaches we have detailed these anecdotes from the history of france with equal propriety we might have resorted to the history of england which is full of contests and dissensions of the same sort there is a morsel of that history the life and actions of the protector somerset so remarkably apposite that it would be worth while to relate it for the present however it must be waved it is too fashionable with writers to impute such contentions to republican governments as if they were peculiar to them whereas nothing is further from reality republican writers themselves have been as often guilty of this mistake in whom it is an indiscretion as monarchical writers in whom it may be thought policy in both however it is an error we shall mention only two machiavel and de lolme in machiavels history of florence we read it is given from above that in all republics there should be fatal families who are born for the ruin of them to the end that in human affairs nothing should be perpetual or quiet‡ if indeed this were acknowledged to be the will of heaven as machiavel seems to assert why should we entertain resentments against such families they are but instruments and they cannot but answer their end if they are commissioned from above to be destroying angels why should we oppose or resist them as to the end there are other causes enough     which will forever prevent perpetuity or tranquillity in any great degree in human affairs animal life is a chemical process and is carried on by unceasing motion our bodies and minds like the heavens the earth and the sea like all animal vegetable and mineral nature like the elements of earth air fire and water are continually changing the mutability and mutations of matter and much more of the intellectual and moral world are the consequence of laws of nature not less without our power than beyond our comprehension while we are thus assured that in one sense nothing in human affairs will be perpetual or at rest we ought to remember at the same time that the duration of our lives the security of our property the existence of our conveniences comforts and pleasures the repose of private life and the tranquillity of society are placed in very great degrees in human power equal laws may be ordained and executed great families as well as little ones may be restrained and that policy is not less pernicious than that philosophy is false which represents such families as sent by heaven to be judgments it is not true in fact on the contrary they are sent to be blessings and they are blessings until by our own obstinate ignorance and imprudence in refusing to establish such institutions as will make them always blessings we turn them into curses there are evils it is true which attend them as well as other human blessings even government liberty virtue and religion it is the province of philosophy and policy to increase the good and lessen the evil that attends them as much as possible but it is not surely the way either to increase the good or lessen the evil which accompanies such families to represent them to the people as machines as rods as scourges as blind and mechanical instruments in the hands of divine vengeance unmixed with benevolence nor has it any good tendency or effect to endeavor to render them unpopular to make them objects of hatred malice jealousy envy or revenge to the common people the way of wisdom to happiness is to make mankind more friendly to each other the existence of such men or families is not their fault they created not themselves we the plebeians find them the workmanship of god and nature like ourselves the constitution of nature and the course of providence has produced them as well as us and     they and we must live together it depends on ourselves indeed whether it shall be in peace love and friendship or in war or hatred nor are they reasonably the objects of censure or aversion of resentment envy or hatred for the gifts of fortune any more than for those of nature conspicuous birth is no more in a mans power to avoid than to obtain hereditary riches are no more a reproach than they are a merit a paternal estate is neither a virtue nor a fault he must nevertheless be a novice in this world who does not know that these gifts of fortune are advantages in society and life which confer influence popularity and power the distinction that is made between the gifts of nature and those of fortune appears to be not well founded it is fortune which confers beauty and strength which are called qualities of nature as much as birth and hereditary wealth which are called accidents of fortune and on the other hand it is nature which confers these favors as really as stature and agility narrow and illiberal sentiments are not peculiar to the rich or the poor if the vulgar have found a machiavel to give countenance to their malignity by his contracted and illiberal exclamations against illustrious families as the curse of heaven the rich and the noble have not unfrequently produced sordid instances of individuals among themselves who have adopted and propagated an opinion that god hates the poor and that poverty and misery on earth are inflicted by providence in its wrath and displeasure this noble philosophy is surely as shallow and as execrable as the other plebeian philosophy of machiavel but it is countenanced by at least as many of the phenomena of the world let both be discarded as the reproach of human understanding and a disgrace to human nature let the rich and the poor unite in the bands of mutual affection be mutually sensible of each others ignorance weakness and error and unite in concerting measures for their mutual defence against each others vices and follies by supporting an impartial mediator that ingenious genevan to whom the english nation is indebted for a more intelligible explanation of their own constitution than any that has been ever published by their own acherly or bacon bolingbroke or blackstone has quoted this passage of machiavel and applied it like him to the dishonor of republican     governments de lolme says i cannot avoid transcribing a part of the speech which a citizen of florence addressed once to the senate the reader will find in it a kind of abridged story of all republics  he then quotes the passage before cited from machiavel why should so grave an accusation be brought against republics if it were well founded it would be a very serious argument not only against such forms of government but against human nature families and competitions are the unavoidable consequence of that emulation which god and nature have implanted in the human heart for the wisest and best purposes and which the public good instead of cooling or extinguishing requires to be directed to honor and virtue and then nourished cherished and cultivated if such contentions appeared only in republican governments there would be some color for charging them as a reproach to these forms but they appear as frequent and as violent in despotisms and monarchies as they do in commonwealths in all the despotisms of asia and africa in all the monarchies of europe there are constant successions of emulation and rivalry and consequently of contests and dissensions among families despotism which crushes and decapitates sometimes interrupts their progress and prevents some of their tragical effects monarchies with their spies lettres de cachet dungeons and inquisitions may do almost as well but the balance of a free government is more effectual than either without any of their injustice caprice or cruelty the foregoing examples from the history of france and a thousand others equally striking which might be added show that bourbons and montmorencis guises and colignis were as fatal families in that kingdom as the buondelmonti and alberti the donati and cerchi the ricci and albizzi or medici at florence instead of throwing false imputations on republican governments instead of exciting or fomenting a vulgar malignity against the most respectable men and families let us draw the proper inferences from history and experience let us lay it down for a certain fact first that emulation between individuals and rivalries among families never can be prevented second let us adopt it as a certain principle that they ought not to be     prevented but directed to virtue and then stimulated and encouraged by generous applause and honorable rewards and from these premises let the conclusion be as it ought to be that an effectual control be provided in the constitution to check their excesses and balance their weights if this conclusion is not drawn another will follow of itself the people will be the dupes and the leaders will worry each other and the people too till both are weary and ashamed and from feeling not from reasoning set up a master and a despot for a protector what kind of a protector he will be may be learned hereafter from stephen boetius postscript if any one wish to see more of the spirit of rivalry without reading the great historians of france he may consult lesprit de la ligue lesprit de la fronde and the memoirs of de retz and his contemporaries the history of england is more familiar to americans but without reading many volumes he may find enough of rivalries in those chapters of henrys history of great britain which treat of civil and military affairs if even this study be too grave he may find in shakspeares historical plays especially henry iv v and vi and richard iii enough to satisfy him if the gayety of falstaff and his associates excite not so much of his laughter as to divert his attention from all serious reflections he will find in the efforts of ambition and avarice to obtain their objects enough of the everlasting pretexts of religion liberty love of country and public good to disguise them the unblushing applications to foreign powers to france germany the pope holland scotland wales and jack cade to increase their parties and assist their strength will excite his indignation while the blood of the poor cheated people flowing in torrents on all sides will afflict his humanity the english constitution in that period was not formed the house of commons was not settled the authority of the peers was not defined the prerogatives of the crown were not     limited magna charta with all its confirmations and solemnities was violated at pleasure by kings nobles and commons too the judges held their offices at pleasure the habeas corpus was unknown and that balance of passions and interests which alone can give authority to reason from which results all the security to liberty and the rights of man was not yet wrought into the english constitution nor much better understood in england than in france the unity of the executive power was not established the national force in men and money was not in the king but in the landholders with whom the kings were obliged to make alliances in order to form their armies and fight their enemies foreign and domestic their enemies were generally able to procure an equal number of powerful landholders with their forces to assist them so that all depended on the chance of war it has been said that it is extremely difficult to preserve a balance this is no more than to say that it is extremely difficult to preserve liberty to this truth all ages and nations attest it is so difficult that the very appearance of it is lost over the whole earth excepting one island and north america how long it will be before she returns to her native skies and leaves the whole human race in slavery will depend on the intelligence and virtue of the people a balance with all its difficulty must be preserved or liberty is lost forever perhaps a perfect balance if it ever existed has not been long maintained in its perfection yet such a balance as has been sufficient to liberty has been supported in some nations for many centuries together and we must come as near as we can to a perfect equilibrium or all is lost when it is once widely departed from the departure increases rapidly till the whole is lost if the people have not understanding and public virtue enough and will not be persuaded of the necessity of supporting an independent executive authority an independent senate and an independent judiciary power as well as an independent house of representatives all pretensions to a balance are lost and with them all hopes of security to our dearest interests all hopes of liberty  00 notes a page     from the boston sentinel of february         paris  0 december      about midnight of the eighteenth instant his majesty the emperor arrived in this city and on sunday the twentieth at noon being on his throne surrounded by the imperial princes the princes grand dignitaries the cardinals the ministers the grand eagles of the legion of honor c he received the conservative senate composed of about one hundred members who are all counts of the empire except a few who are princes and dukes and are all appointed by the emperor who were introduced by his excellency the grand marshal duroc and presented by his serene highness the prince vicegrand elector talleyrand his excellency the count de lacépède president of the senate addressed his majesty in these terms— sire—the senate hastens to present at the foot of the throne of your imperial and royal majesty the homage of its felicitations upon the happy arrival of your majesty in the midst of your people the absence of your majesty sire is always a national calamity your presence is a benefit which fills with joy and confidence the whole french nation your imperial and royal majesty has laid all the basis of the organization of your vast empire but there still remain many things for your majesty to consolidate or to conclude and the smallest delay in the completion of our institutions is a national calamity while your majesty sire was distant eight hundred leagues from your capital at the head of your victorious armies some men who had escaped from the prisons where your imperial clemency had saved them from the death that they had merited by their past crimes endeavored to disturb the public order in this great city they have suffered the penalty of their new attempts happy france sire whose monarchical constitution protects her from the fatal effects of civil discords from the sanguinary dissensions which party spirit produces and from the horrible disorders with which revolutions are attended the senate the first council of the emperor and whose authority exists only while the monarch requires and puts it in motion is established for the preservation  0  of that monarchy and of the hereditary succession to your throne in our fourth dynasty france and posterity will find it under all circumstances faithful to this sacred duty and all its members will ever be ready to perish in defence of this palladium of the national safety and prosperity in the commencement of our ancient dynasties sire we find on more than one occasion the monarch directing that a solemn oath should by anticipation bind the french of every rank to the heir to the throne and sometimes when the age of the young prince permitted a crown was placed upon his head as the emblem of his future authority and the symbol of the perpetuity of the government the affection that the whole nation entertains for the king of rome proves sire both the attachment of the french to the blood of your majesty and that internal sentiment which encourages every citizen and which shows him in that august infant the security of his family the safeguard of his property and an invincible obstacle to the intestine divisions those civil commotions and those political disorders which are the greatest scourges that can afflict nations sire your majesty has planted the french eagles upon the towers of moscow the enemy was unable to put a stop to your success and to counteract your projects otherwise than by resorting to the terrific resources of despotic governments by creating deserts upon the whole of his frontiers by carrying conflagrations into his provinces and by delivering to the flames his capital the centre of his riches and the product of so many ages they little knew your majestys heart who thus renewed the barbarous tactics of their savage ancestors your majesty would have willingly renounced trophies that were to cost so much blood and so many miseries to humanity the hasty arrival that we witness from all the departments of the empire to join your majestys standard of the numerous soldiers called upon by the senatus consultum of september last is an example of what your majesty may expect from the zeal the patriotism and the warlike ardor of the french to snatch from the influence of our enemies the different parts of the continent and to conquer an honorable and solid peace may your imperial and royal majesty sire accept the tribute of acknowledgments of the love and inviolable fidelity of the senate and of the french people the emperors answer senators—what you tell me is very agreeable to me i have at heart the glory and the power of france my first wishes are for every thing that can perpetuate interior tranquillity and forever secure my people from the lacerations of factions and the horrors of anarchy it is upon those enemies of the welfare of nations that i have founded with the consent and love of the french this throne to which are henceforth attached the destinies of the country timid and cowardly soldiers lose the independence of nations but pusillanimous magistrates destroy the empire of the laws the rights of the throne and social order itself the noblest death would be that of a soldier who perishes in the field of  0  honor if the death of a magistrate perishing in the defence of the sovereign of the throne and of the laws were not still more glorious when i undertook the regeneration of france i asked of providence a determinate number of years we can destroy in a moment but we cannot rebuild without the assistance of time what a state most wants is courageous magistrates our fathers had for a rallying word the king is dead long live the king these few words contain the principal advantages of monarchy i believe that i have well studied the disposition that my people have exhibited during the differentages i have reflected upon what has taken place in the different epochs of our history i shall continue to do so the war that i am carrying on against russia is a political war i have made it without animosity i wished to spare her the calamities that she has inflicted upon herself i might have armed the greater part of her population against herself by proclaiming liberty to the slaves a great number of villages requested me to do so but knowing the debasement of that numerous class of the russian people i refused to take that measure which would have devoted many families to death and to the most horrible torments my army has suffered losses but it is owing to the premature inclemency of the season i accept of the sentiments that you express to me b page       march      the contents of the foregoing volume are summarily comprehended in a few sentences in the following comment by napoleon emperor of france— on the twentieth of december      the council of state were conducted into the imperial presence and presented by his serene highness the prince archchancellor of the empire cambacères his excellency count de fermon minister of state president of the section of finance made an address to which the emperor made the following answer— it is to ideology to that obscure metaphysics which searching with subtlety after first causes wishes to found upon them the legislation of nations instead of adapting the laws to the knowledge of the human heart and to the lessons of history that we are to attribute all the calamities that our beloved france has experienced those errors necessarily produced the government of the men of blood indeed who proclaimed the principle of insurrection as a duty who flattered the people by proclaiming for them a sovereignty which they were incapable of exercising who destroyed the sanctity and the respect to the laws by making them to depend not upon the sacred principles of justice upon  0  the nature of things and upon civil justice but only upon the will of an assembly of men composed of men strangers to the knowledge of the civil criminal administrative political and military laws when we are called to regenerate a state we must act upon opposite principles history paints the human heart it is in history that we are to seek for the advantages and disadvantages of different systems of law these are the principles of which the council of state of a great empire ought never to lose sight it ought to add to them a courage equal to every emergency and like the presidents harlay and molé be ready to perish in defence of the sovereign the throne and the laws comment on the comment napoleon mutato nomine de te fabula narratur this book is a prophecy of your empire before your name was heard the political and literary world are much indebted for the invention of the new word ideology our english words idiocy or idiotism express not the force or meaning of it it is presumed its proper definition is the science of idiocy and a very profound abstruse and mysterious science it is you must descend deeper than the divers in the dunciad to make any discoveries and after all you will find no bottom it is the bathos the theory the art the skill of diving and sinking in government it was taught in the school of folly but alas franklin turgot rochefoucauld and condorcet under tom paine were the great masters of that academy it may be modestly suggested to the emperor to coin another word in his new mint in conformity or analogy with ideology and call every constitution of government in france from      to      an ideocracy quincy   december      this volume was yesterday returned from mr c who has had it almost a year the events in europe since   march      are

correspondence between those eminently distinguished characters john adams late president of the united states and samuel adams late governor of massachusetts on the important subject of government  0   0  editors preface the four following letters were collected in   0  and published in boston in a small pamphlet of thirtytwo pages with a titlepage and advertisement by an unknown hand which are here retained they are all included in this work as well because they form a part of the published opinions on government of john adams as because they show the nature of the difference of sentiment that existed between him and his friend and namesake this difference is more or less perceptible in the action of the two from the date of the formation of the constitution of massachusetts to the end of their career yet it must be after all conceded that it here makes itself felt rather than understood a few words seem necessary in order to place it in a clear light before the reader the real point of division appears to rest in the views taken of sovereignty samuel adams by confounding the right conceded always to belong to a people of changing or overturning an existing form of civil government with that more limited one reserved und the form itself of changing the administering officers has the air of supposing both equally to mean an everpresent unlimited and absolute control of the majority in which the sovereignty resides hence it is that all elective officers from the highest to the lowest are considered as holding only delegated powers subject to the direction or control of their principals whenever these choose to signify their wishes and the form of government is made equivalent to a qualified democracy this view has been always entertained by numbers in the united states and is probably gaining rather than losing ground with the passage of time john adams on his side whilst equally ready to admit the right of revolution considers the adoption of any mixed form known in america as at once limiting the exercise of the popular sovereignty within a few specified channels hence his definition of a republic as a government in which the people have collectively or by representation an essential share in the sovereignty whilst his friend contends that they retain it all it follows from the former idea that the officers constituted to administer the system are not indiscriminately regarded as representatives solely because they are elected by the people and not at all as mere delegates to do their will  a wide distinction is preserved by him between an executive chief and a senate in whom certain defined powers are vested for a term of years and vested absolutely subject only to penalties for  0  abuse and a house of representatives possessing the essence of the legislative or organic power in which sovereignty is maintained to exist  and intended by the frequent recurrence of elections to reflect accurately the will of the majority of numbers there can be no doubt that john adams regarded the constitution of the united states as forming a government more properly to be classed among monarchical than among democratic republics an idea suggested at the outset by patrick henry in america and by godwin in england which has reappeared in some essays of late years and the truth or falsity of this construction cannot be said by any means to be established by the mere half centurys experience yet had of the system for although in practice the action of the chief magistrate has thus far conformed with tolerable steadiness to the popular wishes this does not seem to have arisen from any power retained by the people to prevent him had he inclined otherwise so much as from the moderate desires of the men who have been elected to the post it is a remark of m de tocqueville respecting the united states that there are multitudes who have a limited ambition but none who cherish one on a very great scale this may be true now in the infancy of the country and yet time may finally bring it under the influence of the general law of human experience elsewhere assuming the main check which existed for forty years the chance of reelection to be definitively laid aside it is not easy to put the finger upon any clause of the constitution which can prevent an evildisposed president for four years from using the powers vested in him in what way he pleases without regard to the peoples wishes at all indeed it is possible to go a step further and to venture a doubt whether an adequate restraint can be found against the corrupt as well as despotic use of his authority—the sale of his patronage as well as the perversion of his policy the only tangible remedy—that by impeachment—is obviously insufficient from the absence of all motive to wield a ponderous system of investigation after the offender has lost his power and when he is no longer of consequence to the state of the sluggish nature of this process experience in cases of inferior magnitude has already furnished enough proof the evidence necessary to convict an offender would not be likely to accumulate until a large part of his four years of service had expired and the remainder would probably elapse before it could be obtained then would come the election of a successor with a system in no wise responsible for that which preceded it and around which new interests would immediately concentrate what probability is there of the ultimate infliction upon the guilty man now become a private individual removed from observation of any penalty adequate to his crime but if this reasoning as to the absence of responsibility be only partially true it becomes perfectly plain that at least in the case of a president confining himself to the use of his legitimate powers in office however unpalatable that may be there can be little of sovereignty exercised by the people during his term or of punishment inflicted afterwards the same course of remark may be applied though with modified force to the senate in its original conception it cannot be regarded as having been strictly  0  a representative body or subject to much restraint of the popular will it is indeed true that the course of things has introduced modifications which render it somewhat sensitive to the condition of public opinion but the cause is to be found in the aspirations of its members to higher distinction than is given by a place in that assembly and not in the constitution of the body itself if we could suppose that no individual had any other object in view than to serve out his six years of public life it is not easy to see any hold the popular sovereignty has retained upon the senate which would prevent them from acting precisely as they chose so strongly has this been felt in practice already that an effort has been made attended with partial success to introduce a point of honor as a counterpoise to the constitutional provision but the scrupulous senator who resigns his post because he will not obey the popular voice which instructs him to do what he disapproves follows a law which is nowhere to be found laid down for him in the constitution he could not have been held to any legal or moral responsibility had he chosen to remain where he was for the rest of his term and defied the instructing power that such were the notions of the limitation of the popular sovereignty entertained by john adams there can be no doubt for they are still further illustrated in a series of three letters written in      to roger sherman of connecticut which have not before seen the light for the sake of completing his own exposition of his system they are appended to the following correspondence in these papers the provisions inserted by him in the constitution of massachusetts which were stricken out in the convention are more particularly defended they will be found to contain a curious commentary upon the federal constitution written at the moment of its formation and a singular mixture of accuracy and error thus far in the predictions made of its operation   0 advertisement in fulfilling our engagement we have the pleasure of presenting to the public the following letters from persons who have been eminently distinguished in the course of the american revolution at the time they were written mr john adams was vicepresident of the united states and mr samuel adams the lieutenantgovernor of massachusetts they will then naturally be considered as expressing the opinions of public men on a great and public question deeply interesting to every citizen had they been earlier communicated the uncommon agitation of the intervening time at certain periods might have given their contents a degree of importance which the returning tranquillity of the country at this moment may in some measure prevent we must still believe notwithstanding that but few publications can be more attractive of general notice as well from the elevated station which the authors of them have long maintained in the world as from the nature and importance of the principles now brought into view on the merits of which they so widely differ we shall not presume to anticipate the judgment of our fellowcitizens throughout the union on these important letters by interposing any comments of our own the names hitherto omitted are supplied and we trust that no exception will be taken to their being now published as the spirit of the correspondence would be evidently defective without them we shall only remark in justice to mr samuel adams that in the composition of his answers he was obliged to use the hand of a friend as he had been long incapable of using his own with facility and that his replies must be viewed as the extemporaneous production of the moment in which they were written without his having had an opportunity of giving them a second inspection this circumstance will no doubt be duly appreciated the letters now appear in their proper order what will be the public sense respecting them we will not pretend to calculate we must at least hope for the honor of the community that the sentiments they contain will not be received with a torpid insensibility or a disgraceful indifference     letters john adams    september    0 new york samuel adams i new york    september    0 dear sir— upon my return from philadelphia to which beloved city i have been for the purpose of getting a house to put my head in next winter i had the pleasure of receiving your favor of the second of this month the sight of our old liberty hall and of several of our old friends had brought your venerable idea to my mind and continued it there a great part of the last week so that a letter from you on my arrival seemed but in continuation i am much obliged to the confidential friend for writing the short letter you dictated and shall beg a continuance of similar good offices captain nathaniel byfield lyde whom i know very well has my hearty good wishes i shall give your letter and his to the secretary of the treasury the duty of whose department it is to receive and examine all applications of the kind applications will probably be made in behalf of the officers who served the last war in the navy and they will be likely to have the preference to all others but captain lydes application shall nevertheless be presented and have a fair chance my family as well as myself are i thank god in good health and as good spirits as the prospect of a troublesome removal will admit mrs adams desires her particular regards to your lady and yourself what my old friend is this world about to become is the millennium commencing are the kingdoms of it about to be governed by reason your boston town meetings and our harvard college have set the universe in motion every thing will be pulled down so much seems certain but what will be built up are there any principles of political architecture     what are they were voltaire and rousseau masters of them are their disciples acquainted with them locke taught them principles of liberty but i doubt whether they have not yet to learn the principles of government will the struggle in europe be any thing more than a change of impostors and impositions with great esteem and sincere affection i am my dear sir your friend and servant john adams his honor samuel adams esq lieutgovernor of mass samuel adams   october    0 boston ii boston   october    0 dear sir— with pleasure i received your letter of september   th and as our good friend to whom i dictated our last is yet in town i have requested of him a second favor you ask—what the world is about to become and—is the millennium commencing i have not studied the prophecies and cannot even conjecture the golden age so finely pictured by poets i believe has never as yet existed but in their own imaginations in the earliest periods when for the honor of human nature one should have thought that man had not learnt to be cruel what scenes of horror have been exhibited in families of some of the best instructors in piety and morals even the heart of our first father was grievously wounded at the sight of the murder of one of his sons perpetrated by the hand of the other has mankind since seen the happy age no my friend the same tragedies have been acted on the theatre of the world the same arts of tormenting have been studied and practised to this day and even religion and reason united have never succeeded to establish the permanent foundations of political freedom and happiness in the most enlightened countries on the earth after a compliment to boston town meetings and our harvard college as having set the universe in motion you tell me—every thing will be pulled down i think with you so much seems certain but what say you will be built up     hay wood and stubble may probably be the materials till men shall be yet more enlightened and more friendly to each other are there any principles of political architecture undoubtedly what are they philosophers ancient and modern have laid down different plans and all have thought themselves masters of the true principles their disciples have followed them probably with a blind prejudice which is always an enemy to truth and have thereby added fresh fuel to the fire of contention and increased the political disorder kings have been deposed by aspiring nobles whose pride could not brook restraint these have waged everlasting war against the common rights of men the love of liberty is interwoven in the soul of man and can never be totally extinguished and there are certain periods when human patience can no longer endure indignity and oppression the spark of liberty then kindles into a flame when the injured people attentive to the feelings of their just rights magnanimously contend for their complete restoration but such contests have too often ended in nothing more than a change of impostors and impositions the patriots of rome put an end to the life of cæsar and rome submitted to a race of tyrants in his stead were the people of england free after they had obliged king john to concede to them their ancient rights and liberties and promise to govern them according to the old law of the land were they free after they had wantonly deposed their henrys edwards and richards to gratify family pride or after they had brought their first charles to the block and banished his family they were not the nation was then governed by king lords and commons and its liberties were lost by a strife among three powers soberly intended to check each other and keep the scales even but while we daily see the violence of the human passions controlling the laws of reason and religion and stifling the very feelings of humanity can we wonder that in such tumults little or no regard is had to political checks and balances and such tumults have always happened within as well as without doors the best formed constitutions that have yet been contrived by the wit of man have and will come to an end because the kingdoms of the earth have not been governed by reason the pride of kings of nobles and leaders of the people who have     all governed in their turns have disadjusted the delicate frame and thrown all into confusion what then is to be done let divines and philosophers statesmen and patriots unite their endeavors to renovate the age by impressing the minds of men with the importance of educating their little boys and girls of inculcating in the minds of youth the fear and love of the deity and universal philanthroby and in subordination to these great principles the love of their country of instructing them in the art of selfgovernment without which they never can act a wise part in the government of societies great or small in short of leading them in the study and practice of the exalted virtues of the christian system which will happily tend to subdue the turbulent passions of men and introduce that golden age beautifully described in figurative language—when the wolf shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard lie down with the kid the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox none shall then hurt or destroy for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord when this millennium shall commence if there shall be any need of civil government indulge me in the fancy that it will be in the republican form or something better i thank you for your countenance to our friend lyde mrs adams tells me to remember her to yourself lady and connections and be assured that i am sincerely your friend samuel adams the vicepresident of the united states john adams    october    0 new york samuel adams iii new york    october    0 dear sir— i am thankful to our common friend as well as to you for your favor of the fourth which i received last night my fears are in unison with yours that hay wood and stubble will be the materials of the new political buildings in europe till men shall be more enlightened and friendly to each other you agree that there are undoubtedly principles of political architecture but instead of particularizing any of them you seem to place all your hopes in the universal or at least     more general prevalence of knowledge and benevolence i think with you that knowledge and benevolence ought to be promoted as much as possible but despairing of ever seeing them sufficiently general for the security of society i am for seeking institutions which may supply in some degree the defect if there were no ignorance error or vice there would be neither principles nor systems of civil or political government i am not often satisfied with the opinions of hume but in this he seems well founded that all projects of government founded in the supposition or expectation of extraordinary degrees of virtue are evidently chimerical nor do i believe it possible humanly speaking that men should ever be greatly improved in knowledge or benevolence without assistance from the principles and system of government i am very willing to agree with you in fancying that in the greatest improvements of society government will be in the republican form it is a fixed principle with me that all good government is and must be republican but at the same time your candor will agree with me that there is not in lexicography a more fraudulent word whenever i use the word republic with approbation i mean a government in which the people have collectively or by representation an essential share in the sovereignty the republican forms of poland and venice are much worse and those of holland and bern very little better than the monarchical form in france before the late revolution by the republican form i know you do not mean the plan of milton nedham or turgot for after a fair trial of its miseries the simple monarchical form will ever be as it has ever been preferred to it by mankind are we not my friend in danger of rendering the word republican unpopular in this country by an indiscreet indeterminate and equivocal use of it the people of england have been obliged to wean themselves from the use of it by making it unpopular and unfashionable because they found it was artfully used by some and simply understood by others to mean the government of their interregnum parliament they found they could not wean themselves from that destructive form of government so entirely as that a mischievous party would not still remain in favor of it by any other means than by making the words republic and republican     unpopular they have succeeded to such a degree that with a vast majority of that nation a republican is as unamiable as a witch a blasphemer a rebel or a tyrant if in this country the word republic should be generally understood as it is by some to mean a form of government inconsistent with a mixture of three powers forming a mutual balance we may depend upon it that such mischievous effects will be produced by the use of it as will compel the people of america to renounce detest and execrate it as the english do with these explanations restrictions and limitations i agree with you in your love of republican governments but in no other sense with you i have also the honor most perfectly to harmonize in your sentiments of the humanity and wisdom of promoting education in knowledge virtue and benevolence but i think that these will confirm mankind in the opinion of the necessity of preserving and strengthening the dikes against the ocean its tides and storms human appetites passions prejudices and selflove will never be conquered by benevolence and knowledge alone introduced by human means the millennium itself neither supposes nor implies it all civil government is then to cease and the messiah is to reign that happy and holy state is therefore wholly out of this question you and i agree in the utility of universal education but will nations agree in it as fully and extensively as we do and be at the expense of it we know with as much certainty as attends any human knowledge that they will not we cannot therefore advise the people to depend for their safety liberty and security upon hopes and blessings which we know will not fall to their lot if we do our duty then to the people we shall not deceive them but advise them to depend upon what is in their power and will relieve them philosophers ancient and modern do not appear to me to have studied nature the whole of nature and nothing but nature lycurguss principle was war and family pride solons was what the people would bear c the best writings of antiquity upon government those i mean of aristotle zeno and cicero are lost we have human nature society and universal history to observe and study and from these we may draw all the real principles which ought to be regarded disciples     will follow their masters and interested partisans their chieftains let us like it or not we cannot help it but if the true principles can be discovered and fairly fully and impartially laid before the people the more light increases the more the reason of them will be seen and the more disciples they will have prejudice passion and private interest which will always mingle in human inquiries one would think might be enlisted on the side of truth at least in the greatest number for certainly the majority are interested in the truth if they could see to the end of all its consequences kings have been deposed by aspiring nobles true and never by any other these the nobles i suppose have waged everlasting war against the common rights of men true when they have been possessed of the summa imperii in one body without a check so have the plebeians so have the people so have kings so has human nature in every shape and combination and so it ever will but on the other hand the nobles have been essential parties in the preservation of liberty whenever and wherever it has existed in europe they alone have preserved it against kings and people wherever it has been preserved or at least with very little assistance from the people one hideous despotism as horrid as that of turkey would have been the lot of every nation of europe if the nobles had not made stands by nobles i mean not peculiarly an hereditary nobility or any particular modification but the natural and actual aristocracy among mankind the existence of this you will not deny you and i have seen four noble families rise up in boston—the crafts gores dawes and austins these are as really a nobility in our town as the howards somersets berties c in england blind undistinguishing reproaches against the aristocratical part of mankind a division which nature has made and we cannot abolish are neither pious nor benevolent they are as pernicious as they are false they serve only to foment prejudice jealousy envy animosity and malevolence they serve no ends but those of sophistry fraud and the spirit of party it would not be true but it would not be more egregiously false to say that the people have waged everlasting war against the rights of men the love of liberty you say is interwoven in the soul of man so it is according to la fontaine in that of a wolf     and i doubt whether it be much more rational generous or social in one than in the other until in man it is enlightened by experience reflection education and civil and political institutions which are at first produced and constantly supported and improved by a few that is by the nobility the wolf in the fable who preferred running in the forest lean and hungry to the sleek plump and round sides of the dog because he found the latter was sometimes restrained had more love of liberty than most men the numbers of men in all ages have preferred ease slumber and good cheer to liberty when they have been in competition we must not then depend alone upon the love of liberty in the soul of man for its preservation some political institutions must be prepared to assist this love against its enemies without these the struggle will ever end only in a change of impostors when the people who have no property feel the power in their own hands to determine all questions by a majority they ever attack those who have property till the injured men of property lose all patience and recur to finesse trick and stratagem to outwit those who have too much strength because they have too many hands to be resisted any other way let us be impartial then and speak the whole truth till we do we shall never discover all the true principles that are necessary the multitude therefore as well as the nobles must have a check this is one principle were the people of england free after they had obliged king john to concede to them their ancient rights the people never did this there was no people who pretended to any thing it was the nobles alone the people pretended to nothing but to be villains vassals and retainers to the king or the nobles the nobles i agree were not free because all was determined by a majority of their votes or by arms not by law their feuds deposed their henrys edwards and richards to gratify lordly ambition patrician rivalry and family pride but if they had not been deposed those kings would have become despots because the people would not and could not join the nobles in any regular and constitutional opposition to them they would have become despots i repeat it and that by means of the villains vassals and retainers aforesaid it is not family pride my friend but family popularity that does the great mischief as well as the great good pride in the heart of     man is an evil fruit and concomitant of every advantage of riches of knowledge of genius of talents of beauty of strength of virtue and even of piety it is sometimes ridiculous and often pernicious but it is even sometimes and in some degree useful but the pride of families would be always and only ridiculous if it had not family popularity to work with the attachment and devotion of the people to some families inspires them with pride as long as gratitude or interest ambition or avarice love hope or fear shall be human motives of action so long will numbers attach themselves to particular families when the people will in spite of all that can be said or done cry a man or a family up to the skies exaggerate all his talents and virtues not hear a word of his weakness or faults follow implicitly his advice detest every man he hates adore every man he loves and knock down all who will not swim down the stream with them where is your remedy when a man or family are thus popular how can you prevent them from being proud you and i know of instances in which popularity has been a wind a tide a whirlwind the history of all ages and nations is full of such examples popularity that has great fortune to dazzle splendid largesses to excite warm gratitude sublime beautiful and uncommon genius or talents to produce deep admiration or any thing to support high hopes and strong fears will be proud and its power will be employed to mortify enemies gratify friends procure votes emoluments and power such family popularity ever did and ever will govern in every nation in every climate hot and cold wet and dry among civilized and savage people christians and mahometans jews and heathens declamation against family pride is a pretty juvenile exercise but unworthy of statesmen they know the evil and danger is too serious to be sported with the only way god knows is to put these families into a hole by themselves and set two watches upon them a superior to them all on one side and the people on the other there are a few popular men in the massachusetts my friend who have i fear less honor sincerity and virtue than they ought to have these if they are not guarded against may do another mischief they may excite a party spirit and a mobbish spirit instead of the spirit of liberty and produce another   0 wat tylers rebellion they can do no more but i really think their party language ought not to be countenanced nor their shibboleths pronounced the miserable stuff that they utter about the wellborn is as despicable as themselves the ὲυγενεῖς of the greeks the bien nées of the french the welgebohren of the germans and dutch the beloved families of the creeks are but a few samples of national expressions of the same thing for which every nation on earth has a similar expression one would think that our scribblers were all the sons of redemptioners or transported convicts they think with tarquin in novo populo ubi omnis repentina atque ex virtute nobilitas fit futurum locum forti ac strenuo viro let us be impartial there is not more of family pride on one side than of vulgar malignity and popular envy on the other popularity in one family raises envy in others but the popularity of the least deserving will triumph over envy and malignity while that which is acquired by real merit will very often be overborne and oppressed by it let us do justice to the people and to the nobles for nobles there are as i have before proved in boston as well as in madrid but to do justice to both you must establish an arbitrator between them this is another principle it is time that you and i should have some sweet communion together i do not believe that we who have preserved for more than thirty years an uninterrupted friendship and have so long thought and acted harmoniously together in the worst of times are now so far asunder in sentiment as some people pretend in full confidence of which i have used this freedom being ever your warm friend john adams his honor samuel adams esq lieutgovernor of mass samuel adams  0 november    0 boston iv boston  0 november    0 my dear sir— i lately received your letter of the eighteenth of october the sentiments and observations contained in it demand my attention a republic you tell me is a government in which the people     have an essential share in the sovereignty is not the whole sovereignty my friend essentially in the people is not government designed for the welfare and happiness of all the people and is it not the uncontrollable essential right of the people to amend and alter or annul their constitution and frame a new one whenever they shall think it will better promote their own welfare and happiness to do it that the sovereignty resides in the people is a political doctrine which i have never heard an american politician seriously deny the constitutions of the american states reserve to the people the exercise of the rights of sovereignty by the annual or biennial elections of their governors senators and representatives and by empowering their own representatives to impeach the greatest officers of the state before the senators who are also chosen by themselves we the people is the style of the federal constitution they adopted it and conformably to it they delegate the exercise of the powers of government to particular persons who after short intervals resign their powers to the people and they will reëect them or appoint others as they think fit the american legislatures are nicely balanced they consist of two branches each having a check upon the determinations of the other they sit in different chambers and probably often reason differently in their respective chambers on the same question if they disagree in their decisions by a conference their reasons and arguments are mutually communicated to each other candid explanations tend to bring them to agreement and then according to the massachusetts constitution the matter is laid before the first magistrate for his revision he states objections if he has any with his reasons and returns them to the legislators who by larger majorities ultimately decide here is a mixture of three powers founded in the nature of man calculated to call forth the rational faculties in the great points of legislation into exertion to cultivate mutual friendship and good humor and finally to enable them to decide not by the impulse of passion or party prejudice but by the calm voice of reason which is the voice of god in this mixture you may see your natural and actual aristocracy among mankind operating among the several powers in legislation and producing the most happy effects but the son of an excellent man may never inherit the great qualities of his     father this is a common observation and there are many instances of its truth should we not therefore conclude that hereditary nobility is a solecism in government their lordships sons or grandsons may be destitute of the faintest feelings of honor or honesty and yet retain an essential share in the government by right of inheritance from ancestors who may have been the minions of ministers the favorites of mistresses or men of real and distinguished merit the same may be said of hereditary kings their successors may also become so degenerated and corrupt as to have neither inclination nor capacity to know the extent and limits of their own powers nor consequently those of others such kind of political beings nobles or kings possessing hereditary right to essential shares in an equipoised government are very unfit persons to hold the scales having no just conception of the principles of the government nor of the part which they and their copartners bear in the administration they run a wild career destroy the checks and balances by interfering in each others departments till the nation is involved in confusion and reduced to the danger at least of bloodshed to remove a tyranny which may ensue much safer is it and much more does it tend to promote the welfare and happiness of society to fill up the offices of government after the mode prescribed in the american constitutions by frequent elections of the people they may indeed be deceived in their choice they sometimes are but the evil is not incurable the remedy is always near they will feel their mistakes and correct them i am very willing to agree with you in thinking that improvements in knowledge and benevolence receive much assistance from the principles and systems of good government but is it not as true that without knowledge and benevolence men would neither have been capable nor disposed to search for the principles or form the system should we not my friend bear a grateful remembrance of our pious and benevolent ancestors who early laid plans of education by which means wisdom knowledge and virtue have been generally diffused among the body of the people and they have been enabled to form and establish a civil constitution calculated for the preservation of their rights and liberties this constitution was evidently founded in the expectation of the further progress and extraordinary     degrees of virtue it enjoins the encouragement of all seminaries of literature which are the nurseries of virtue depending upon these for the support of government rather than titles splendor or force mr hume may call this a chimerical project i am far from thinking the people can be deceived by urging upon them a dependence on the more general prevalence of knowledge and virtue it is one of the most essential means of further and still further improvements in society and of correcting and amending moral sentiments and habits and political institutions till by human means directed by divine influence men shall be prepared for that happy and holy state when the messiah is to reign it is a fixed principle that all good government is and must be republican you have my hearty concurrence and i believe we are well enough acquainted with each others ideas to understand what we respectively mean when we use the word with approbation the body of the people in this country are not so ignorant as those in england were in the time of the interregnum parliament they are better educated they will not easily be prevailed upon to believe that a republican is as unamiable as a witch a blasphemer a rebel or a tyrant they are charmed with their own forms of government in which are admitted a mixture of powers to check the human passions and control them from rushing into exorbitances so well assured are they that their liberties are best secured by their own frequent and free election of fit persons to be the essential sharers in the administration of their government and that this form of government is truly republican that the body of the people will not be persuaded nor compelled to renounce detest and execrate the very word republican as the english do their education has confirmed them in the opinion of the necessity of preserving and strengthening the dikes against the ocean its tides and storms and i think they have made more safe and more durable dikes than the english have done we agree in the utility of universal education but will nations agree in it as fully and extensively as we do why should they not it would not be fair to conclude that because they have not yet been disposed to agree in it they never will it is allowed that the present age is more enlightened than former ones freedom of inquiry is certainly more encouraged     the feelings of humanity have softened the heart the true principles of civil and religious liberty are better understood tyranny in all its shapes is more detested and bigotry if not still blind must be mortified to see that she is despised such an age may afford at least a flattering expectation that nations as well as individuals will view the utility of universal education in so strong a light as to induce sufficient national patronage and support future ages will probably be more enlightened than this the love of liberty is interwoven in the soul of man so it is in that of a wolf however irrational ungenerous and unsocial the love of liberty may be in a rude savage he is capable of being enlightened by experience reflection education and civil and political institutions but the nature of the wolf is and ever will be confined to running in the forest to satisfy his hunger and his brutal appetites the dog is inclined in a very easy way to seek his living and fattens his sides from what comes from his masters kitchen the comparison of la fontaine is in my opinion ungenerous unnatural and unjust among the numbers of men my friend are to be found not only those who have preferred ease slumber and good cheer to liberty but others who have eagerly sought after thrones and sceptres hereditary shares in sovereignty riches and splendor titles stars garters crosses eagles and many other childish playthings at the expense of real nobility without one thought or care for the liberty and happiness of the rest of mankind the people who have no property feel the power of governing by a majority and ever attack those who have property the injured men of property recur to finesse trick and stratagem to outwit them true these may proceed from a lust of domination in some of both parties be this as it may it has been known that such deceitful tricks have been practised by some of the rich upon their unsuspecting fellowcitizens to turn the determination of questions so as to answer their own selfish purposes to plunder or filch the rights of men are crimes equally immoral and nefarious though committed in different manners neither of them is confined to the rich or the poor they are too common among both the lords as well as the commons of great britain by continued large majorities endeavored by finesse tricks and stratagems as well as threats to     prevail on the american colonies to surrender their liberty and property to their disposal these failing they attempted to plunder our rights by force of arms we feared their arts more than their arms did the members of that hereditary house of lords who constituted those repeated majorities then possess the spirit of nobility not so i think that spirit resided in the illustrious minorities in both houses but by nobles who have prevented one hideous despotism as horrid as that of turkey from falling to the lot of every nation of europe you mean not peculiarly an hereditary nobility or any particular modification but the natural and actual aristocracy among mankind the existence of which i am not disposed to deny where is this aristocracy found among men of all ranks and conditions the cottager may beget a wise son the noble a fool the one is capable of great improvement the other not education is within the power of men and societies of men wise and judicious modes of education patronized and supported by communities will draw together the sons of the rich and the poor among whom it makes no distinction it will cultivate the natural genius elevate the soul excite laudable emulation to excel in knowledge piety and benevolence and finally it will reward its patrons and benefactors by shedding its benign influence on the public mind education inures men to thinking and reflection to reasoning and demonstration it discovers to them the moral and religious duties they owe to god their country and to all mankind even savages might by the means of education be instructed to frame the best civil and political institutions with as much skill and ingenuity as they now shape their arrows education leads youth to the study of human nature society and universal history from whence they may draw all the principles of political architecture which ought to be regarded all men are interested in the truth education by showing them the end of all its consequences would induce at least the greatest numbers to enlist on its side the man of good understanding who has been welleducated and improves these advantages as far as his circumstances will allow in promoting the happiness of mankind in my opinion and i am inclined to think in yours is indeed wellborn it may be puerile and unworthy of statesmen to declaim     against family pride but there is and always has been such a ridiculous kind of vanity among men statesmen know the evil and danger is too serious to be sported with i am content they should be put into one hole as you propose but i have some fears that your watchmen on each side will not well agree when a man can recollect the virtues of his ancestors he certainly has abundantly more solid satisfaction than another who boasts that he sprang from those who were rich or noble but never discovers the least degree of virtue or true worth of any kind family popularity if i mistake not has its source in family pride it is by all means sought after that homage may be paid to the name of the title or estate to supply the want in the possessor of any great or good quality whatsoever there are individuals among men who study the art of making themselves popular for the purpose of getting into places of honor and emoluments and by these means of gratifying hereafter the noble passion family pride others are so enchanted with the music of the sound that they conceive it to be supreme felicity this is indeed vanity of vanities and if such deluded men ever come to their senses they will find it to be vexation of spirit when they reflect on their own folly and injustice in having swallowed the breath of applause with avidity and great delight for merit which they are conscious they never had and that many who have been the loudest in sounding their praises had nothing in view but their own private and selfish interests it will excite in them the feelings of shame remorse and selfcontempt the truly virtuous man and real patriot is satisfied with the approbation of the wise and discerning he rejoices in the contemplation of the purity of his own intentions and waits in humble hope for the plaudit of his final judge i shall not venture again to trespass on the benevolence of our confidential friend you will not be sorry it will afford you relief for in common civility you must be at the trouble of reading ones epistles i hope there will be a time when we may have sweet communion together in the interim let me not lose the benefit of your valuable letters adieu believe me your sincere friend samuel adams the vicepresident of the united states     three letters to roger sherman on the constitution of the united states john adams    july      new york roger sherman i richmond hill new york    july      dear sir— i read over with pleasure your observations on the new federal constitution and am glad to find an opportunity to communicate to you my opinion of some parts of them it is by a free and amicable intercourse of sentiments that the friends of our country may hope for such a unanimity of opinion and such a concert of exertions as may sooner or later produce the blessings of good government you say it is by some objected that the executive is blended with the legislature and that those powers ought to be entirely distinct and unconnected but is not that a gross error in politics the united wisdom and various interests of a nation should be combined in framing the laws by which all are to be governed and protected though it should not be convenient to have them executed by the whole legislature the supreme executive in great britain is one branch of the legislature and has a negative on all the laws perhaps that is an extreme not to be imitated by a republic but the negative vested in the president by the new constitution on the acts of congress and the consequent revision may be very useful to prevent laws being passed without mature deliberation and to preserve stability     in the administration of government and the concurrence of the senate in the appointment to office will strengthen the hands of the executive and secure the confidence of the people much better than a select council and will be less expensive is it then an extreme not to be imitated by a republic to make the supreme executive a branch of the legislature and give it a negative on all the laws if you please we will examine this position and see whether it is well founded in the first place what is your definition of a republic mine is this a government whose sovereignty is vested in more than one person governments are divided into despotisms monarchies and republics a despotism is a government in which the three divisions of power the legislative executive and judicial are all vested in one man a monarchy is a government where the legislative and executive are vested in one man but the judicial in other men in all governments the sovereignty is vested in that man or body of men who have the legislative power in despotisms and monarchies therefore the legislative authority being in one man the sovereignty is in one man in republics as the sovereignty that is the legislative is always vested in more than one it may be vested in as many more as you please in the united states it might be vested in two persons or in three millions or in any other intermediate number and in every such supposable case the government would be a republic in conformity to these ideas republics have been divided into three species monarchical aristocratical and democratical republics england is a republic a monarchical republic it is true but a republic still because the sovereignty which is the legislative power is vested in more than one man it is equally divided indeed between the one the few and the many or in other words between the natural division of mankind in society—the monarchical the aristocratical and democratical it is essential to a monarchical republic that the supreme executive should be a branch of the legislature and have a negative on all the laws i say essential because if monarchy were not an essential part of the sovereignty the government would not be a monarchical republic your position is therefore clearly and certainly an error because the practice of great britain in making the supreme executive a branch of the legislature and giving it a negative on all the laws must be imitated by every monarchical republic     i will pause here if you please but if you will give me leave i will write another letter or two upon this subject meantime i am with unalterable friendship yours john adams roger sherman ii dear sir— in my letter of yesterday i think it was demonstrated that the english government is a republic and that the regal negative upon the laws is essential to that republic because without it that government would not be what it is a monarchical republic and consequently could not preserve the balance of power between the executive and legislative powers nor that other balance which is in the legislature—between the one the few and the many in which two balances the excellence of that form of government must consist let us now inquire whether the new constitution of the united states is or is not a monarchical republic like that of great britain the monarchical and the aristocratical power in our constitution it is true are not hereditary but this makes no difference in the nature of the power in the nature of the balance or in the name of the species of government it would make no difference in the power of a judge or justice or general or admiral whether his commission were for life or years his authority during the time it lasted would be the same whether it were for one year or twenty or for life or descendible to his eldest son the people the nation in whom all power resides originally may delegate their power for one year or for ten years for years or for life or may delegate it in fee simple or fee tail if i may so express myself or during good behavior or at will or till further orders a nation might unanimously create a dictator or a despot for one year or more or for life or for perpetuity with hereditary descent in such a case the dictator for one year would as really be a dictator for the time his power lasted as the other would be whose power was perpetual and descendible a nation in the same manner might create a simple monarchy for years life or perpetuity and in either case the creature would be equally a simple monarch during the continuance of his power so the people of england might create king lords and   0 commons for a year or for several years or for life and in any of these cases their government would be a monarchical republic or if you will a limited monarchy during its continuance as much as it is now when the king and nobles are hereditary they might make their house of commons hereditary too what the consequence of this would be it is easy to foresee but it would not in the first moment make any change in the legal power nor in the name of the government let us now consider what our constitution is and see whether any other name can with propriety be given it than that of a monarchical republic or if you will a limited monarchy the duration of our president is neither perpetual nor for life it is only for four years but his power during those four years is much greater than that of an avoyer a consul a podestà a doge a stadtholder nay than a king of poland nay than a king of sparta i know of no first magistrate in any republican government excepting england and neuchatel who possesses a constitutional dignity authority and power comparable to his the power of sending and receiving ambassadors of raising and commanding armies and navies of nominating and appointing and commissioning all officers of managing the treasures the internal and external affairs of the nation nay the whole executive power coextensive with the legislative power is vested in him and he has the right and his is the duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed these rights and duties these prerogatives and dignities are so transcendent that they must naturally and necessarily excite in the nation all the jealousy envy fears apprehensions and opposition that are so constantly observed in england against the crown  that these powers are necessary i readily admit that the laws cannot be executed without them that the lives liberties properties and characters of the citizens cannot be secure without their protection is most clear but it is equally certain i think that they ought to have been still greater or much less the limitations upon them in the cases of war treaties and appointments to office and especially the limitation on the presidents     independence as a branch of the legislative will be the destruction of this constitution and involve us in anarchy if not amended i shall pass over all particulars for the present except the last because that is now the point in dispute between you and me longitude and the philosophers stone have not been sought with more earnestness by philosophers than a guardian of the laws has been studied by legislators from plato to montesquieu but every project has been found to be no better than committing the lamb to the custody of the wolf except that one which is called a balance of power a simple sovereignty in one a few or many has no balance and therefore no laws a divided sovereignty without a balance or in other words where the division is unequal is always at war and consequently has no laws in our constitution the sovereignty—that is the legislative power—is divided into three branches the house and senate are equal but the third branch though essential is not equal the president must pass judgment upon every law but in some cases his judgment may be overruled these cases will be such as attack his constitutional power it is therefore certain he has not equal power to defend himself or the constitution or the judicial power as the senate and house have power naturally grows why because human passions are insatiable but that power alone can grow which already is too great that which is unchecked that which has no equal power to control it the legislative power in our constitution is greater than the executive it will therefore encroach because both aristocratical and democratical passions are insatiable the legislative power will increase the executive will diminish in the legislature the monarchical power is not equal either to the aristocratical or democratical it will therefore decrease while the other will increase indeed i think the aristocratical power is greater than either the monarchical or democratical that will therefore swallow up the other two in my letter of yesterday i think it was proved that a republic might make the supreme executive an integral part of the legislature in this it is equally demonstrated as i think that our constitution ought to be amended by a decisive adoption of that expedient if you do not forbid me i shall write to you again     john adams roger sherman iii dear sir— there is a sense and degree in which the executive in our constitution is blended with the legislature the president has the power of suspending a law of giving the two houses an opportunity to pause to think to collect themselves to reconsider a rash step of a majority he has a right to urge all his reasons against it by speech or message which becoming public is an appeal to the nation but the rational objection here is not that the executive is blended with the legislature but that it is not enough blended that it is not incorporated with it and made an essential part of it if it were an integral part of it it might negative a law without much noise speculation or confusion among the people but as it now stands i beg you to consider it is almost impossible that a president should ever have the courage to make use of his partial negative what a situation would a president be in to maintain a controversy against a majority of both houses before a tribunal of the public to put a stop to a law that more than half the senate and house and consequently we may suppose more than half the nation have set their hearts upon  it is moreover possible that more than two thirds of the nation the senate and house may in times of calamity distress misfortune and ill success of the measures of government from the momentary passion and enthusiasm demand a law which will wholly subvert the constitution the constitution of athens was overturned in such a manner by aristides himself the constitution should guard against a possibility of its subversion but we may take stronger ground and assert that it is probable such cases will happen and that the constitution will in fact be subverted in this way nay i go further and say that from the constitution of human nature and the constant course of human affairs it is certain that our constitution will be subverted if not amended and that in a very short time merely for want of a decisive negative in the executive there is another sense and another degree in which the executive     is blended with the legislature which is liable to great and just objection which excites alarms jealousies and apprehensions in a very great degree i mean  st the negative of the senate upon appointments to office  d the negative of the senate upon treaties and  d the negative of the two houses upon war i shall confine myself at present to the first the negative of the senate upon appointments is liable to the following objections—   it takes away or at least it lessens the responsibility of the executive our constitution obliges me to say that it lessens the responsibility of the president the blame of an injudicious weak or wicked appointment is shared so much between him and the senate that his part of it will be too small who can censure him without censuring the senate and the legislatures who appoint them all their friends will be interested to vindicate the president in order to screen them from censure besides if an impeachment against an officer is brought before them are they not interested to acquit him lest some part of the odium of his guilt should fall upon them who advised to his appointment   it turns the minds and attention of the people to the senate a branch of the legislature in executive matters it interests another branch of the legislature in the management of the executive it divides the people between the executive and the senate whereas all the people ought to be united to watch the executive to oppose its encroachments and resist its ambition senators and representatives and their constituents in short the aristocratical and democratical divisions of society ought to be united on all occasions to oppose the executive or the monarchical branch when it attempts to overleap its limits but how can this union be effected when the aristocratical branch has pledged its reputation to the executive by consenting to an appointment   it has a natural tendency to excite ambition in the senate an active ardent spirit who is rich and able and has a great reputation and influence will be solicited by candidates for office not to introduce the idea of bribery because though it certainly would force itself in in other countries and will probably here when we grow populous and rich it is not yet to be dreaded i hope ambition must come in already a senator of great influence     will be naturally ambitious and desirous of increasing his influence will he not be under a temptation to use his influence with the president as well as his brother senators to appoint persons to office in the several states who will exert themselves in elections to get out his enemies or opposers both in senate and house of representatives and to get in his friends perhaps his instruments suppose a senator to aim at the treasury office for himself his brother father or son suppose him to aim at the presidents chair or vicepresidents at the next election or at the office of war foreign or domestic affairs will he not naturally be tempted to make use of his whole patronage his whole influence in advising to appointments both with president and senators to get such persons nominated as will exert themselves in elections of president vicepresident senators and house of representatives to increase his interest and promote his views in this point of view i am very apprehensive that this defect in our constitution will have an unhappy tendency to introduce corruption of the grossest kinds both of ambition and avarice into all our elections and this will be the worst of poisons to our constitution it will not only destroy the present form of government but render it almost impossible to substitute in its place any free government even a better limitedmonarchy or any other than a despotism or a simple monarchy   to avoid the evil under the last head it will be in danger of dividing the continent into two or three nations a case that presents no prospect but of perpetual war   this negative on appointments is in danger of involving the senate in reproach censure obloquy and suspicion without doing any good will the senate use their negative or not if not why should they have it many will censure them for not using it many will ridicule them and call them servile c if they do use it the very first instance of it will expose the senators to the resentment of not only the disappointed candidate and all his friends but of the president and all his friends and these will be most of the officers of government through the nation   we shall very soon have parties formed a court and country party and these parties will have names given them one party in the house of representatives will support the president     and his measures and ministers the other will oppose them a similar party will be in the senate these parties will study with all their arts perhaps with intrigue perhaps with corruption at every election to increase their own friends and diminish their opposers suppose such parties formed in the senate and then consider what factious divisions we shall have there upon every nomination   the senate have not time the convention and indian treaties  you are of opinion that the concurrence of the senate in the appointments to office will strengthen the hands of the executive and secure the confidence of the people much better than a select council and will be less expensive but in every one of these ideas i have the misfortune to differ from you it will weaken the hands of the executive by lessening the obligation gratitude and attachment of the candidate to the president by dividing his attachment between the executive and legislative which are natural enemies officers of government instead of having a single eye and undivided attachment to the executive branch as they ought to have consistent with law and the constitution will be constantly tempted to be factious with their factious patrons in the senate the presidents own officers in a thousand instances will oppose his just and constitutional exertions and screen themselves under the wings of their patrons and party in the legislature  nor will it secure the confidence of the people the people will have more confidence in the executive in executive matters than in the senate the people will be constantly jealous of factious schemes in the senators to unduly influence the executive to serve each others private views the people will also be jealous that the influence of the senate will be employed to conceal connive at and defend guilt in executive officers instead of being a guard and watch upon them and a terror to them a council selected by the president himself at his pleasure from among the senators representatives and nation at large would be purely responsible in that case the senate would be a terror to privy counsellors     its honor would never be pledged to support any measure or instrument of the executive beyond justice law and the constitution nor would a privy council be more expensive the whole senate must now deliberate on every appointment and if they ever find time for it you will find that a great deal of time will be required and consumed in this service then the president might have a constant executive council now he has none i said under the seventh head that the senate would not have time you will find that the whole business of this government will be infinitely delayed by this negative of the senate on treaties and appointments indian treaties and consular conventions have been already waiting for months and the senate have not been able to find a moment of time to attend to them and this evil must constantly increase so that the senate must be constantly sitting and must be paid as long as they sit   but i have tired your patience is there any truth in these broken hints and crude surmises or not to me they appear well founded and very important i am with usual affection yours john adams     roger sherman to john adams the first letter of roger sherman which occasioned this correspondence has not been found but his replies giving the views entertained on his side of the disputed provisions of the constitution are sufficiently interesting to merit insertion roger sherman  0 july      new york john adams i new york  0 july      sir— i was honored with your letters of the seventeenth and eighteenth instant and am much obliged to you for the observations they contain the subject of government is an important one and necessary to be well understood by the citizens and especially by the legislators of these states i shall be happy to receive further light on the subject and to have any errors that i may have entertained corrected i find that writers on government differ in their definition of a republic enticks dictionary defines it—a commonwealth without a king i find you do not agree to the negative part of his definition what i meant by it was a government under the authority of the people consisting of legislative executive and judiciary powers the legislative powers vested in an assembly consisting of one or more branches who together with the executive are appointed by the people and dependent on them for continuance by periodical elections agreeably to an established constitution and that what especially denominates it a republic is its dependence on the public or people at large without any hereditary powers but it is not of so much importance by what appellation the government is distinguished as to have it well constituted to secure the rights and advance the happiness of the community i fully agree with you sir that it is optional with the people of a state to establish any form of government they please to vest the powers in one a few or many and for a limited or unlimited     time and the individuals of the state will be bound to yield obedience to such government while it continues but i am also of opinion that they may alter their frame of government when they please any former act of theirs however explicit to the contrary notwithstanding but what i principally have in view is to submit to your consideration the reasons that have inclined me to think that the qualified negative given to the executive by our constitution is better than an absolute negative in great britain where there are the rights of the nobility as well as the rights of the common people to support it may be necessary that the crown should have a complete negative to preserve the balance but in a republic like ours wherein is no higher rank than that of common citizens unless distinguished by appointments to office what occasion can there be for such a balance it is true that some men in every society have natural and acquired abilities superior to others and greater wealth yet these give them no legal claim to offices in preference to others but will doubtless give them some degree of influence and justly when they are men of integrity and may procure them appointments to places of trust in the government yet they having only the same common rights with the other citizens what competition of interests can there be to require a balance besides while the real estates are divisible among all the children or other kindred in equal degree and entails are not admitted it will operate as an agrarian law and the influence arising from great estates in a few hands or families will not exist to such a degree of extent or duration as to form a system or have any great effect in order to trace moral effects to their causes and vice versa it is necessary to attend to principles as they operate on mens minds can it be expected that a chief magistrate of a free and enlightened people on whom he depends for his election and continuance in office would give his negative to a law passed by the other two branches of the legislature if he had power but the qualified negative given to the executive by our constitution which is only to produce a revision will probably be exercised on proper occasions and the legislature have the benefit of the presidents reasons in their further deliberations on the subject and if a sufficient number of the members     of either house should be convinced by them to put a negative upon the bill it would add weight to the presidents opinion and render it more satisfactory to the people but if two thirds of the members of each house after considering the reasons offered by the president should adhere to their former opinion will not that be the most safe foundation to rest the decision upon on the whole it appears to me that the power of a complete negative if given would be a dormant and useless one and that the provision in the constitution is calculated to operate with proper weight and will produce beneficial effects the negative vested in the crown of great britain has never been exercised since the revolution and the great influence of the crown in the legislature of that nation is derived from another source that of appointment to all offices of honor and profit which has rendered the power of the crown nearly absolute so that the nation is in fact governed by the cabinet council who are the creatures of the crown  the consent of parliament is necessary to give sanction to their measures and this they easily obtain by the influence aforesaid if they should carry their points so far as directly to affect personal liberty or private property the people would be alarmed and oppose their progress but this forms no part of their system the principal object of which is revenue which they have carried to an enormous height wherever the chief magistrate may appoint to offices without control his government may become absolute or at least aggressive therefore the concurrence of the senate is made requisite by our constitution i have not time or room to add or apologize   0 roger sherman john adams ii i received your letter of the twentieth instant i had in mine of the same date communicated to you my ideas on that part of the constitution limiting the presidents power of negativing the acts of the legislature and just hinted some thoughts on the propriety of the provision made for the appointment to offices which i esteem to be a power nearly as important as legislation if that was vested in the president alone he might were it not for his periodical election by the people render himself despotic it was a saying of one of the kings of england that while the king could appoint the bishops and judges he might have what religion and law he pleased it appears to me the senate is the most important branch in the government for aiding and supporting the executive securing the rights of the individual states the government of the united states and the liberties of the people the executive magistrate is to execute the laws the senate being a branch of the legislature will naturally incline to have them duly executed and therefore will advise to such appointments as will best attain that end from the knowledge of the people in the several states they can give the best information as to who are qualified for office and though they will as you justly observe in some degree lessen his responsibility yet their advice may enable him to make such judicious appointments as to render responsibility less necessary the senators being eligible by the legislatures of the several states and dependent on them for reëlection will be vigilant in supporting their rights against infringement by the legislature or executive of the united states and the government of the union being federal and instituted by the several states for the advancement of their interests they may be considered as so many pillars to support it and by the exercise of the state governments peace and good order may be preserved in places most remote from the seat of the federal government as well as at the centre and the municipal and federal rights of the people at large will be regarded by the senate they being elected by the immediate representatives of the people and their rights will be best secured by a due execution of the laws what temptation can     the senate be under to partiality in the trial of officers of whom they had a voice in the appointment can they be disposed to favor a person who has violated his trust and their confidence the other evils you mention that may result from this power appear to me but barely possible the senators will doubtless be in general some of the most respectable citizens in the states for wisdom and probity superior to mean and unworthy conduct and instead of undue influence to procure appointments for themselves or their friends they will consider that a fair and upright conduct will have the best tendency to preserve the confidence of the people and of the states they will be disposed to be diffident in recommending their friends and kindred lest they should be suspected of partiality and the other members will feel the same kind of reluctance lest they should be thought unduly to favor a person because related to a member of their body so that their friends and relations would not stand so good a chance for appointment to offices according to their merit as others the senate is a convenient body to advise the president from the smallness of its numbers and i think the laws would be better framed and more duly administered if the executive and judiciary officers were in general members of the legislature in case there should be no interference as to the time of attending to their several duties this i have learned by experience in the government in which i live and by observation of others differently constituted i see no principles in our constitution that have any tendency to aristocracy which if i understand the term is a government by nobles independent of the people which cannot take place in either respect without a total subversion of the constitution as both branches of congress are eligible from the citizens at large and wealth is not a requisite qualification both will commonly be composed of members of similar circumstances in life and i see no reason why the several branches of the government should not maintain the most perfect harmony their powers being all directed to one end the advancement of the public good if the president alone was vested with the power of appointing all officers and was left to select a council for himself he would be liable to be deceived by flatterers and pretenders to     patriotism who would have no motive but their own emolument they would wish to extend the powers of the executive to increase their own importance and however upright he might be in his intentions there would be great danger of his being misled even to the subversion of the constitution or at least to introduce such evils as to interrupt the harmony of the government and deprive him of the confidence of the people but i have said enough upon these speculative points which nothing but experience can reduce to a certainty i am with great respect your obliged humble servant roger sherman     letters to john taylor of caroline virginia in reply to his strictures on some parts of the defence of the american constitutions j a         editors preface the treatises on the principles of government written by mr adams appeared at a time of great popular agitation in europe and the united states and furnished ready materials for use in the political contentions of the day they were immediately attacked in the american newspapers and in pamphlets as intended to subvert instead of sustaining the republican forms already established and to introduce the english system of hereditary orders—a monarch and a house of lords although there is no just foundation for this charge yet there can be no doubt that the tendency of the reasoning was all of it calculated to resist the current setting at the moment with great force towards unlimited democracy the french revolution first roused this power nor did it seriously decline until the popular excesses to which it led awakened the minds of men to a sense of the dangers of the one not less than of the other extreme the writings of mr adams which had been directed to the same end were then tacitly admitted to have force in them even by many whose feelings and sympathies led them to regret that it was not otherwise the popular impression had been made from his opposition to the new theory of liberty that he favored the old one of absolutism and it became fixed by the circumstances attending the struggle at the close of the century in which mr adamss position identified him with the success or failure of that party in the country supposed to hold the only conservative opinions it was perfectly natural that in violent party times the sentiments and the language of the author seldom guardedly expressed should be subjected to all sorts of perversion and misrepresentation though fully sensible of this and keenly alive to it it does not appear that he ever took any steps to correct the impressions sought to be produced in the public mind it was not until the publication in      by john taylor of caroline virginia of an elaborate volume of six hundred and fifty pages entitled an inquiry into the principles and policy of the government of the united states and containing a running commentary upon the defence that he was roused to make any reply mr taylor had been in the senate at the time he presided over that body had subsequently led the opposition in the virginia house of delegates to his administration by moving the celebrated resolutions of      drawn up by mr madison and had always shown himself a conscientious and manly though an earnest opponent of his theories of government and system of policy it was mr taylors book then though he frankly admitted his own disbelief that anybody ever would read it through that mr adams selected as the medium of a general reply to the strictures which had been made upon his own mr taylors work the     result of the reflections of twenty years is marked with the characteristics of the virginia school to which he belonged the tendency to metaphysical niceties of speculation the absence of a broad logical grasp of statesmanship and the love for technical distinctions without the corrective of extensive generalization occasionally he deals forcibly with a single proposition but his conclusions are seldom the logical sequence of his premises especially does he fail as a controversialist from his loose manner of performing an obligation of the first necessity to an adversary the full and fair exposition of each doctrine which he means to contest that this error proceeds from no evil intention is clear enough from the perfectly unexceptionable temper in which he conducts his cause it seems rather to be attributed to a want of early moral and intellectual discipline the only broad foundation of accuracy of reasoning in later life this defect makes itself frequently apparent in his ascription to mr adams of propositions which are rather the result of violent inference than of his language the object of the reply seems to be to expose this which it does with success these letters appear to have been sent to mr taylor as they were written they were copied not into the general letterbook but upon separate sheets of paper and stitched together as one work either they terminated abruptly or the copy was not completed the former is the most probable as the writer shows signs of fatigue towards the end evidently intended as his last explanations of his meaning in the most disputed portions of his system they seem necessary to the completeness of the present collection and are therefore inserted at first blush it would not seem difficult for any one to comprehend the distinction between the equality of mankind in natural and moral rights at the moment of birth and the inequality of condition apart from the agency of positive law always developed wherever any advanced form of civilization is attained and in some regular proportion to the degree of advancement there can be little doubt that this inequality of external condition is much more marked in the old states now than it was at the beginning of the revolution notwithstanding the general acknowledgment of the equality of natural rights which was procured through that struggle yet the reluctance to admit this distinction as sound seems to have been the cause of much of the misconception of the authors meaning it must be conceded that he shares perhaps too little in that hopefulness in the rapid improvement of the human race which makes so striking and so agreeable a feature in the speculations of writers of the present age he deals with the realities of life as he finds them depicted in history and in his own experience yet it is to be observed that the latest advocates of speculative democracy assuming them to be what he describes them seek refuge from them in the doctrines of socialism the only resource which would seem to be left open and it yet remains to be seen how far these doctrines will recommend themselves to the judgment of the nations in the nineteenth century the relations between mr taylor and the author seem rather to have become more intimate than to have relaxed by reason of this correspondence until they terminated in the remarkable letter of the eighth of april      which will be found in its place in the general correspondence     letters to john taylor john adams    april      quincy john taylor i quincy    april      sir— i have received your inquiry in a large volume neatly bound though i have not read it in course yet upon an application to it of the sortes virgiliancæ scarce a page has been found in which my name is not mentioned and some public sentiment or expression of mine examined revived as these subjects are in this manner in the recollection of the public after an oblivion of so many years by a gentleman of your high rank ample fortune learned education and powerful connections i flatter myself it will not be thought improper in me to solicit your attention to a few explanations and justifications of a book that has been misunderstood misrepresented and abused more than any other except the bible that i have ever read in the first words of the first section you say mr adamss political system deduces government from a natural fate the policy of the united states deduces it from moral liberty this sentence i must acknowledge passes all my understanding i know not what is meant by fate nor what distinction there is or may be made or conceived between a natural and artificial or unnatural fate nor do i well know what moral liberty signifies i have read a great deal about the words fate and chance but though i close my eyes to abstract my meditations i never could conceive any idea of either when an action or event happens or occurs without a cause some say it happens by chance this is equivalent to saying that chance is no cause at all it is nothing fate too is no     cause no agent no power it has neither understanding will affections liberty nor choice it has no existence it is not even a figment of imagination it is a mere invention of a word without a meaning it is a nonentity it is nothing mr adams most certainly never deduced any system from chance or fate natural artificial or unnatural liberty according to my metaphysics is an intellectual quality an attribute that belongs not to fate nor chance neither possesses it neither is capable of it there is nothing moral or immoral in the idea of it the definition of it is a selfdetermining power in an intellectual agent it implies thought and choice and power it can elect between objects indifferent in point of morality neither morally good nor morally evil if the substance in which this quality attribute adjective call it what you will exists has a moral sense a conscience a moral faculty if it can distinguish between moral good and moral evil and has power to choose the former and refuse the latter it can if it will choose the evil and reject the good as we see in experience it very often does mr adamss system and the policy of the united states are drawn from the same sources deduced from the same principles wrought into the same frame indeed they are the same and ought never to have been divided or separated much less set in opposition to each other as they have been that we may more clearly see how these hints apply certain technical terms must be defined   despotism a sovereignty unlimited that is—the suprema lex the summa potestatis in one this has rarely if ever existed but in theory   monarchy sovereignty in one variously limited   aristocracy sovereignty in a few   democracy sovereignty in the many that is in the whole nation the whole body assemblage congregation or if you are an episcopalian you may call it if you please church of the whole people this sovereignty must in all cases be exerted or exercised by the whole people assembled together this form of government has seldom if ever existed but in theory as rarely at least as an unlimited despotism in one individual   the infinite variety of mixed governments are all so many     different combinations modifications and intermixtures of the second third and fourth species or divisions now every one of these sovereigns possesses intellectual liberty to act for the public good or not being men they have all what dr rush calls a moral faculty dr hutcheson a moral sense and the bible and the generality of the world a conscience they are all therefore under moral obligations to do to others as they would have others do to them to consider themselves born authorized empowered for the good of society as well as their own good despots monarchs aristocrats democrats holding such high trusts are under the most solemn and the most sacred moral obligations to consider their trusts and their power to be instituted for the benefit and happiness of their nations not their nations as servants to them or their friends or parties in other words to exert all their intellectual liberty to employ all their faculties talents and power for the public general universal good of their nations not for their own separate good or the interest of any party in this point of view there is no difference in forms of government all of them and all men concerned in them—all are under equal moral obligations the intellectual liberty of aristocracies and democracies can be exerted only by votes and ascertained only by ayes and noes the sovereign judgment and will can be determined known and declared only by majorities this will this decision is sometimes determined by a single vote often by two or three very rarely by a large majority scarcely ever by a unanimous suffrage and from the impossibility of keeping together at all times the same number of voters the majorities are apt to waver from day to day and swing like a pendulum from side to side nevertheless the minorities have in all cases the same intellectual liberty and are under the same moral obligations as the majorities in what manner these theoretical intellectual liberties have been exercised and these moral obligations fulfilled by despots monarchs aristocrats and democrats is obvious enough in history and in experience they have all in general conducted themselves alike but this investigation is not at present before us   0 john adams john taylor ii it is unnecessary to discuss the nice distinctions which follow in the first page of your respectable volume between mind body and morals the essence and substance of mind and body of soul and body of spirit and matter are wholly withheld as yet from our knowledge from the penetration of our sharpest faculties from the keenest of our incision knives the most amplifying of our microscopes with some of the attributes or qualities of each and of both we are well acquainted we cannot pretend to improve the essence of either till we know it mr adams has never thought of limiting the improvements or amelioration of the properties or qualities of either the definition of matter is—a dead inactive inert substance that of spirit is—a living active substance sometimes if not always intelligent morals are no qualities of matter nor as far as we know of simple spirit or simple intelligence morals are attributes of spirits only when those spirits are free as well as intelligent agents and have consciences or a moral sense a faculty of discrimination not only between right and wrong but between good and evil happiness and misery pleasure and pain this freedom of choice and action united with conscience necessarily implies a responsibility to a lawgiver and to a law and has a necessary relation to right and wrong to happiness and misery it is unnecessary for mr adams to allow or disallow the distinctions in this first page to be applicable to his theory but if he speaks of natural political systems he certainly comprehends not only all the intellectual and physical powers and qualities of man but all his moral powers and faculties all his duties and obligations as a man and a citizen of this world as well as of the state in which he lives and every interest thing or concern that belongs to him from his cradle to his grave this comprehension of all the perfections and imperfections all the powers and wants of man is certainly not for the purpose of circumscribing the powers of mind but it is to enlarge them to give them free scope to run expand and be glorified if you should speak of a natural system of geography would you not comprehend the whole globe and even its relations to the sun moon and stars of astronomy all that the telescope     has discovered of chemistry or natural history all that the microscope has found of architecture every thing that can make a building commodious useful elegant graceful and ornamental in the second page mr adams is totally misunderstood or misrepresented he has never said written or thought that the human mind is able to circumscribe its own powers nor has he ever asserted or believed that man can ascertain his own moral capacity nor has he ever deduced any consequences from such postulata or erected any scheme of government upon them or either of them if mankind have not agreed upon any form of government does it follow that there is no natural form of government and that all forms are equally natural it might as well be contended that all are equally good and that the constitution of the ottoman empire is as natural as free and as good as that of the united states if men have not agreed in any system of architecture will you infer that there are no natural principles of that noble art if some prefer the gothic and others the grecian models will you say that both are equally natural convenient and elegant if some prefer the doric and others the corinthian pillars are the five orders equally beautiful if human nature has been perpetually escaping from all forms will it be inferred that all forms are equally natural equal for the preservation of liberty there is no necessity of confronting mr adamss opinion that aristocracy is natural and therefore unavoidable with the other that it is artificial or factitious and therefore avoidable because the opinions are both true and perfectly consistent with each other by natural aristocracy in general may be understood those superiorities of influence in society which grow out of the constitution of human nature by artificial aristocracy those inequalities of weight and superiorities of influence which are created and established by civil laws terms must be defined before we can reason by aristocracy i understand all those men who can command influence or procure more than an average of votes by an aristocrat every man who can and will influence one man to vote besides himself few men will deny that there is a natural aristocracy of virtues and talents in every     nation and in every party in every city and village inequalities are a part of the natural history of man john adams john taylor iii i believe that none but helvetius will affirm that all children are born with equal genius none will pretend that all are born of dispositions exactly alike—of equal weight equal strength equal length equal delicacy of nerves equal elasticity of muscles equal complexions equal figure grace or beauty i have seen in the hospital of foundlings the enfans trouvés at paris fifty babes in one room—all under four days old all in cradles alike all nursed and attended alike all dressed alike all equally neat i went from one end to the other of the whole row and attentively observed all their countenances and i never saw a greater variety or more striking inequalities in the streets of paris or london some had every sign of grief sorrow and despair others had joy and gayety in their faces some were sinking in the arms of death others looked as if they might live to fourscore some were as ugly and others as beautiful as children or adults ever are these were stupid those sensible these were all born to equal rights but to very different fortunes to very different success and influence in life the world would not contain the books if one should produce all the examples that reading and experience would furnish one or two permit me to hint will any man say would helvetius say that all men are born equal in strength was hercules no stronger than his neighbors how many nations for how many ages have been governed by his strength and by the reputation and renown of it by his posterity if you have lately read hume robertson or the scottish chiefs let me ask you if sir william wallace was no more than equal in strength to the average of scotchmen and whether wallace could have done what he did without that extraordinary strength will helvetius or rousseau say that all men and women are born equal in beauty will any philosopher say that beauty     has no influence in human society if he does let him read the histories of eve judith helen the fair gabrielle diana of poitiers pompadour du barry susanna abigail lady hamilton mrs clark and a million others are not despots monarchs aristocrats and democrats equally liable to be seduced by beauty to confer favors and influence suffrages socrates calls beauty a shortlived tyranny plato the privilege of nature theophrastus a mute eloquence diogenes the best letter of recommendation carneades a queen without soldiers theocritus a serpent covered with flowers bion a good that does not belong to the possessor because it is impossible to give ourselves beauty or to preserve it madame du barry expressed the philosophy of carneades in more laconic language when she said la véritable royauté cest la beauté—the genuine royalty is beauty and she might have said with equal truth that it is genuine aristocracy for it has as much influence in one form of government as in any other and produces aristocracy in the deepest democracy that ever was known or imagined as infallibly as in any other form of government what shall we say to all these philosophers male and female is not beauty a privilege granted by nature according to plato and to truth often more influential in society and even upon laws and government than stars garters crosses eagles golden fleeces or any hereditary titles or other distinctions the grave elders were not proof against the charms of susanna the grecian sages wondered not at the trojan war when they saw helen holoferness guards when they saw judith said one such woman let go would deceive the whole earth can you believe mr taylor that the brother of such a sister the father of such a daughter the husband of such a wife or even the gallant of such a mistress would have but one vote in your moral republic ingenious—but not historical philosophical or political—learned classical poetical barlow i mourn over thy life and thy death had truth instead of popularity and party been thy object your pamphlet on privileged orders would have been a very different thing that all men are born to equal rights is true every being has a right to his own as clear as moral as sacred as any other being has this is as indubitable as a moral government in the universe but to teach that all men are born with equal     powers and faculties to equal influence in society to equal property and advantages through life is as gross a fraud as glaring an imposition on the credulity of the people as ever was practised by monks by druids by brahmins by priests of the immortal lama or by the selfstyled philosophers of the french revolution for honors sake mr taylor for truth and virtues sake let american philosophers and politicians despise it mr adams leaves to homer and virgil to tacitus and quintilian to mahomet and calvin to edwards and priestley or if you will to miltons angels reasoning high in pandemonium all their acute speculations about fate destiny foreknowledge absolute necessity and predestination he thinks it problematical whether there is or ever will be more than one being capable of understanding this vast subject in his principles of legislation he has nothing to do with these interminable controversies he considers men as free moral and accountable agents and he takes men as god has made them and will mr taylor deny that god has made some men deaf and some blind or will he affirm that these will infallibly have as much influence in society and be able to procure as many votes as any who can see and hear honor the day  and believe me no enemy john adams john taylor iv that aristocracies both ancient and modern have been variable and artificial as well as natural and unchangeable mr adams knows as well as mr taylor and has never denied or doubted that they have all proceeded from moral causes is not so clear since many of them appear to proceed from physical causes many from immoral causes many from pharisaical jesuitical and machiavelian villany many from sacerdotal and despotic fraud and as many as all the rest from democratical dupery credulity adulation corruption adoration superstition and enthusiasm if all these cannot be regulated by political laws and controlled checked or balanced by constitutional energies i am willing mr taylor should say of them what     bishop burnet said of the hierarchy or the severest things he can express or imagine that nature makes kingbees or queenbees i have heard and read but i never read in any philosopher or political writer as i remember that nature makes statekings and lords of state though even this for aught i know might be sometimes pretended i have read of hereditary rights from adam to noah and the divine right of nobility derived from the dukes of edom but those divine rights did not make kings till holy oil was poured upon their heads from the vial brought down from heaven in her beak by the holy ghost in the person of a dove if we consult books mr taylor we shall find that nonsense absurdity and impiety are infinite whether the policy of the united states has been wisdom or folly is not the question at present but it is confidently asserted without fear of contradiction that every page and every line mr adams has ever written was intended to illustrate to prove to exhibit and to demonstrate its wisdom the association of mr adams with filmer in the third page may excite a smile i give you full credit mr taylor for the wit and shrewdness of this remark it is droll and goodhumored but if ever policy was in diametrical opposition to filmer it is that of the united states if ever writings were opposed to his principles mr adamss are so opposed they are as much so as those of sidney or locke mr adams thanks mr taylor for proposing in the third page to analyze and ascertain the ideas intended to be expressed by the word aristocracy this is one of those words which have been abused it has been employed to signify any thing every thing and nothing mr taylor has read mr lockes chapter on the abuse of words which though it contains nothing but what daily experience exhibits to all mankind ought nevertheless if he had never written any thing else to secure him immortal gratitude and renown without the learning of luzac vanderkemp jefferson or parsons mr adams recollects enough of greek to remember that aristocracy originally signified the government of the best men but who are to be judges of the best men who is to make the selection of the best men from the second best and the third and the fourth and so on ad infinitum for good and     bad are infinitely divisible like matter ay theres the rub despots monarchs aristocrats and democrats have in all ages hit at times upon the best men in the best sense of the word but at other times and much more frequently they have all chosen the very worst men the men who have the most devotedly and the most slavishly flattered their vanity gratified their most extravagant passions and promoted their selfish and private views without searching volumes mr taylor i will tell you in a few words what i mean by an aristocrat and consequently what i mean by aristocracy by an aristocrat i mean every man who can command or influence two votes one besides his own take the first hundred men you meet in the streets of a city or on a turnpike road in the country and constitute them a democratical republic in my next you may have some conjectures of what will appear in your new democracy john adams john taylor v when your new democratical republic meets you will find half a dozen men of independent fortunes half a dozen of more eloquence half a dozen with more learning half a dozen with eloquence learning and fortune let me see we have now fourandtwenty to these we may add six more who will have more art cunning and intrigue than learning eloquence or fortune these will infallibly soon unite with the twentyfour thus we make thirty the remaining seventy are composed of farmers shopkeepers merchants tradesmen and laborers now if each of these thirty can by any means influence one vote besides his own the whole thirty can carry sixty votes—a decided and uncontrolled majority of the hundred these thirty i mean by aristocrats and they will instantly convert your democracy of one hundred into an aristocracy of thirty take at random or select with your utmost prudence one hundred of your most faithful and capable domestics from your own numerous plantations and make them a democratical republic you will immediately perceive the same inequalities and the same democratical republic in a very few of the first     sessions transformed into an aristocratical republic as complete and perfect an aristocracy as the senate of rome and much more so some will be beloved and followed others hated and avoided by their fellows it would be easy to quote greek and latin to produce a hundred authorities to show the original signification of the word aristocracy and its infinite variations and application in the history of ages but this would be all waste water once for all i give you notice that whenever i use the word aristocrat i mean a citizen who can command or govern two votes or more in society whether by his virtues his talents his learning his loquacity his taciturnity his frankness his reserve his face figure eloquence grace air attitude movements wealth birth art address intrigue good fellowship drunkenness debauchery fraud perjury violence treachery pyrrhonism deism or atheism for by every one of these instruments have votes been obtained and will be obtained you seem to think aristocracy consists altogether in artificial titles tinsel decorations of stars garters ribbons golden eagles and golden fleeces crosses and roses and lilies exclusive privileges hereditary descents established by kings or by positive laws of society no such thing aristocracy was from the beginning now is and ever will be world without end independent of all these artificial regulations as really and as efficaciously as with them let me say a word more your democratical republic picked in the streets and your democratical african republic or your domestic republic call it which you will in its first session will become an aristocratical republic in the second session it will become an oligarchical republic because the seventyfour democrats and the twentysix aristocrats will by this time discover that thirteen of the aristocrats can command four votes each these thirteen will now command the majority and consequently will be sovereign the thirteen will then be an oligarchy in the third session it will be found that among these thirteen oligarchs there are seven each of whom can command eight votes equal in all to fiftysix a decided majority in the fourth session it will be found that there are among these seven oligarchs four who can command thirteen votes apiece the republic then becomes an oligarchy whose sovereignty is in four individuals in the fifth session it will be discovered that two     of the four can command sixandtwenty votes each then two will have the command of the sovereign oligarchy in the sixth session there will be a sharp contention between the two which shall have the command of the fiftytwo votes here will commence the squabble of danton and robespierre of julius and pompey of anthony and augustus of the white rose and the red rose of jefferson and adams of burr and jefferson of clinton and madison or if you will of napoleon and alexander this my dear sir is the history of mankind past present and to come john adams john taylor vi in the third page of your inquiry is an assertion which mr adams has a right to regret as a gross and egregious misrepresentation he cannot believe it to have been intentional he imputes it to haste to ardor of temper to defect of memory to any thing rather than design it is in these words—mr adams asserts that every society naturally produces an order of men which it is impossible to confine to an equality of rights  this pretended quotation marked as it is by inverted commas is totally and absolutely unfounded no such expression ever fell from his lips no such language was ever written by his pen no such principle was ever approved or credited by his understanding no such sentiment was ever felt without abhorrence in his heart on the contrary he has through life asserted the moral equality of all mankind his system of government which is the system of massachusetts as well as the system of the united states which are the same as much as an original and a copy are the same was calculated and framed for the express purpose of securing to all men equal laws and equal rights physical inequalities are proclaimed aloud by god almighty through all his works mr adams must have been destitute of senses not to have perceived them in men from their births to their deaths and at the same time not to have perceived that they were incurable and inevitable by human wisdom goodness or power all that men can do is to modify organize and arrange the powers of human society that is to say the physical strength and force of men in the best manner to protect secure and cherish the moral which are all the natural rights of mankind     the french are very fond of the phrase social order the english commonly hear it or read it with a broad grin i am not englishman enough to join in this ridicule a social order there must be unless we would return to the forests and assert individual independence in a more absolute sense than tartars or arabs african negroes or north american indians or samoyedes or hottentots have ever conceived a beggar said at my fathers house full seventy years ago the world is very unequally divided but i do not wonder at it nor think much of it because i know that if it were equally divided today in one month there would be as great odds as ever the beggars proverb contained as certain and as important truths as any that was ever uttered by the wise men of greece will mr taylor profess himself a downright leveller will he vote for a community of property or an equal division of property and a community of wives and women he must introduce and establish both before he can reduce all men to an equality of influence it is indeed questionable whether such laws would not produce greater inequalities than ever were seen in the world these are not new projects mr taylor they are not original inventions or discoveries of philosophers of the eighteenth century they were as familiar to plato as they were to helvetius or condorcet if i were a young man i should like to write a romance and send a hero upon his travels through such a levelling community of wives and wealth it would be very edifying to record his observations on the opinions principles customs institutions and manners of this democratical republic and such a virtuous and happy age but a gentleman whose mind is so active studious and contemplative as mr taylors must easily foresee that some men must take care of the property of others or it must perish with its owners and that some men would have as many wives as solomon and others none at all see what is no uncommon sight a family of six sons four of them are prudent discreet frugal and industrious men the other two are idle and profligate the father leaves equal portions of his estate to all the six how long will it be before the two will request the four to purchase their shares and how long before the purchase money will be spent in sports gambled   0 away at races or cards or dice or billiards or dissipated at taverns or worse houses when the two are thus reduced to beggars will they have as much influence in society as any one of the four john adams john taylor vii suppose another case which is not without examples—a family of six daughters four of them are not only beautiful but serious and discreet women two of them are not only ugly but ill tempered and immodest will either of the two have an equal chance with any one of the four to attract the attention of a suitor and obtain a husband of worth respectability and consideration in the world such and many other natural and acquired and habitual inequalities are visible and palpable and audible every day in every village and in every family in the whole world the imagination therefore of a government of a democratical republic in which every man and every woman shall have an equal weight in society is a chimera they have all equal rights but cannot and ought not to have equal power unhappily the cases before stated are too often reversed and four or five out of six sons are unwise and only one or two praiseworthy and four or five out of six daughters are mere triflers and only one or two whose price is above rubies and may i not ask whether there are no instances in which the whole of six sons and daughters are found wanting and instead of maintaining their single vote and their independence become all dependent on others nay there are examples of whole families wasted and totally lost by vice and folly can these while any of them existed have maintained an equality of consideration in society with other families of equal numbers but of virtuous and considerate characters matrimony then mr taylor i have a right to consider as another source of natural aristocracy will you give me leave to ask you mr taylor why you employ the phrase political power in this third page instead of sovereign power—the summa potestatis the supreme power the legislative power the power from which there is no appeal but to heaven and the ratio ultima regum et rerumpublicarum     this language would be understood by readers by scientific people and by the vulgar but political power is so indefinite that it belongs to every man who has a vote and every woman who has a charm what mr taylor is the resemblance of a president or a governor to a monarch it is the resemblance of mount vernon to the andes of the tiber at washington to the ganges or mississippi a president has the executive power only and that under severe restrictions jealous restrictions and as i am too old to court popularity i will venture to say in my opinion very pernicious restrictions restrictions that will destroy this constitution before its time a president has no legislative power a monarch has it all what resemblance has an american senate to a hereditary order it has a negative upon the laws in this it resembles the house of lords in england but in nothing else it has no resemblance to any hereditary order it has no resemblance even to the hereditary descent of lands tenements and hereditaments there is nothing hereditary in it and here mr taylor permit me to ask you whether the descent of lands and goods and chattels does not constitute a hereditary order as decidedly as the descent of stars and garters i will be still bolder has not this law of descents constituted the honorable john randolph one of a hereditary order for a time as clearly as any montmorenci or howard any julius any of the heraclides or any of the blood of mahomet or any of his connections by marriage you must allow me twenty years to answer a book that cost you twenty years of meditation to compose you must allow me also to ask you a question still nearer home you had the honor and felicity to marry the only child of my honest and sincere friend the honorable john penn of north carolina from this marriage you derived with an amiable consort a handsome fortune if you complain that this is personal i confess it and intend it should be personal that it might be more striking to you and to all others who may ever see or hear of our controversy in return i give you full leave to ask me any questions relative to myself my ancestors my posterity my natural or political friends i will answer every question you can ask with the same frankness candor and sincerity     i will be bolder still mr taylor would washington have ever been commander of the revolutionary army or president of the united states if he had not married the rich widow of mr custis would jefferson ever have been president of the united states if he had not married the daughter of mr wales i am weary and so are you ceremonies avaunt john adams john taylor viii what shall i say of the resemblance of our house of representatives to a legislating nation it is perhaps a miniature which resembles the original as much as a larger picture would or could but sir let me say once for all that as no picture great or small no statue no bust in brass or marble gold or silver ever yet perfectly resembled the original so no representative government ever perfectly represented or resembled the original nation or people is not representation an essential and fundamental departure from democracy is not every representative government in the universe an aristocracy call it despotism call it oligarchy call it aristocracy call it democracy call it a mixture ever so complicated still is it not an aristocracy in the strictest sense of the word according to any rational definition of it that can be given that is a government of a few who have the command of two votes or more than two over the many who have only one representation and democracy are a contradiction in terms pursue your principles then sir demolish all aristocratical and representative government divide our continent from st croix to mississippi into districts not of geographical miles yards or feet but of voters of one hundred men in each i will not stay to make a mathematical calculation but put a certain for an uncertain number suppose the number of free sovereign independent democracies to be eighty thousand in these assemblies all questions of war and peace commerce c c c are to be discussed and decided and when and how and what would be the national result i dare not comment upon your book sir without quoting your words you say in this third page—     upon this threefold resemblance mr adams has seized to bring the political system of america within the pale of the english system of checks and balances by following the analysis of antiquity and in obedience to that authority by modifying our temporary elective responsible governors into monarchs our senates into aristocratical orders and our representatives into a nation personally exercising the functions of government i fear i shall fatigue you with my observations but it is of no great importance since this correspondence is intended for your amusement and mine you are not obliged to read my letters any longer than they amuse you and i am confident that if my letters were printed there would not be found six people in the world who would read them with attention we will then amuse ourselves a little with a few of my remarks   mr adams has seized upon a threefold resemblance to bring the political system of america within the pale of the english system figurative language is as dangerous in legislation and jurisprudence as in mathematics this word pale is a figure a metaphor an emblem a hieroglyphic what is a pale a slice of wood sunk in the ground at one end to inclose a plat here is another figure a pale or the pale is used to express many pales enough in number and measure to inclose a very spacious plat—the english system of checks and balances now sir have i brought the system of america within the pale of the english system what indeed had i to do with the system of america america when my three volumes were printed had no system but the old confederation my volumes had nothing in view but the state governments and in strict truth nothing in view but the state constitution of massachusetts—a child of which i was right or wrong the putative father how then is the system of america brought within the english system in the english system the executive power is universal unlimited in all affairs foreign and domestic and hereditary to all generations in the system of america the executive power is limited shackled in most matters foreign and domestic and so far from being hereditary it is limited to four years the cereus once in its life blooms at midnight and for one two three or four hours glows with transcendent splendor then fades and dies a poet might     bring this flower within the pale of the sun which shines with equal glory through all ages seen or unseen by the little animals whose sight is often obscured by clouds fogs and vapors or within the pale of american policy   by following the analysis of antiquity what is this analysis of antiquity the one the few and the many and why is this called the analysis of antiquity rather than the analysis of modernity is there a nation at this hour of this sixteenth day of june      on this globe in which this analysis is not as obvious and undeniable as it ever was in any age or any nation of antiquity is there a state in this union is there a district a parish a party a faction a sedition a rebellion in the world in which this analysis is not glaring should you detect a conspiracy among your domestics which i hope you will if it should exist while i devoutly pray it may never exist you would find this analysis in its perfection a one a few and a many why then sir do you throw all the odium of this eternal unchangeable truth upon poor antiquity an ancient might say to a modern as nathan said unto david thou art the man   and in obedience to that authority what authority the authority of antiquity and why not the authority of st domingo of the spanish colonies in america of the british colonies in america before and since the revolution of the french revolution and counterrevolutions from marat and robespierre nay from rochefoucauld condorcet and turgot to bonaparte talleyrand and sieyes in the last scene of the last act of the tragedy and why not the authority of every tribe of indians in america every nation or tribe of negroes in africa why not in every horde of arabs tartars hottentots icelanders samoyedes or kamtschatkans these are all among my authorities as well as all antiquity over the whole globe where men have existed these authorities are modern enough and ancient enough to prove the analysis of the one the three and the many to be universal and proceeding from natural causes which of these authorities sir will you deny contradict or explain away     john adams john taylor ix observation fourth by modifying our temporary elective responsible governors into monarchs how have i modified our governors into monarchs my three volumes were written in defence of the constitution of massachusetts against a rude and insolent attack of m turgot this constitution which existed in my handwriting made the governor annually elective gave him the executive power shackled with a council that i now wish was annihilated and made him as responsible as any executive power in the united states or any one of the separate states is to this day how then are my annual governors modified into hereditary monarchs my annual elective governors limited and shackled even in the exercise of the executive authority and responsible for all things modified into hereditary monarchs possessed of unlimited legislative and executive power or even only of unlimited executive power and responsible for nothing observation fifth by modifying our senates into aristocratical orders what is meant by our senates my books had not in contemplation any senate of the united states for no such senate existed or was expected by me m turgots attack was in reality on the senate of massachusetts that senate was annually elective had no executive power positive or negative was merely an independent branch of the legislative power how then did mr adams modify our senates into aristocratical orders what is the meaning the definition the analysis of aristocratical orders my anomalistical friend and friend of mankind horne tooke has said mankind are not sufficiently aware that words without meaning or of equivocal meaning are the everlasting engines of fraud and injustice this wise saying of my learned friend is no more than every attentive thinking and reflecting mind sees feels and laments every day yet mankind are not sufficiently aware you will charge me here with an aristocratical distinction with erecting an aristocratical order of thinking men in contradiction to the democratical order of unthinking men well is there not such a distinction in nature are not some children thoughtful and others thoughtless from their earliest years among the thoughtful indeed there is a distinction     some think for good and others for evil and this distinction is manifest through life and shows itself in all the prosperities and all the adversities of human life recollect the history of our own dear country for the last fifty years and the principal prominent characters in our political drama and then tell me whether there has not been a very glaring distinction between thoughtful and thoughtless characters both good and evil our governors resemble monarchs in nothing but in holding for short periods the executive power of the laws under shackles and trammels that destroy the efficacy of the constitution our senates resemble aristocratical orders in nothing but holding for short periods a negative upon the laws with the addition of a participation in the executive power in some instances which mixes the legislative and executive power together in such a manner as to destroy the efficacy of the constitution our national representatives have no more nor less power that i recollect than they ought to have john adams john taylor x whether the terms monarchy aristocracy and democracy or the one the few and the many are only numerical or characteristic like the calyx petal and stamina of plants or complicated with the idea of a balance they have never yet singly or collectively been used to describe a government deduced from good moral principles linnæus is upon my shelf very near me but i will not take him down to consult him about calyx petal and stamina because we are not now upon gardening agriculture or natural history politics and legislation are our present subjects i have no clear idea of your distinction between numerical and characteristic you say if i understand you that no simple or mixed or balanced form of government has ever yet singly or collectively been used to describe a government deduced from good moral principles what government then ever was deduced from good moral principles certainly none for simple or mixed or complicated with a balance surely comprehend every species of government that ever had a being or that ever will exist because     imagination cannot conceive of any government besides those of the one the few or the many or such as are compounded of them whether complicated with the idea of a balance or not the whole is equal to all its parts and all the parts are equal to the whole in a rightangled triangle the hypothenuse and the two legs comprehend the whole diagram again how are the united states distinguished from all other governments or from any other government what are the good moral principles from which the governments of the united states are deduced which are not common to many other governments in all that great number and variety of constitutions which the last twentyfive years have produced in france in holland in geneva in spain we find the most excellent moral principles precepts and maxims and all of them complicated with the idea of a balance we make ourselves popular mr taylor by telling our fellowcitizens that we have made discoveries conceived inventions and made improvements we may boast that we are the chosen people we may even thank god that we are not like other men but after all it will be but flattery and the delusion the selfdeceit of the pharisee is not the constitution of the united states complicated with the idea of a balance is there a constitution upon record more complicated with balances than ours in the first place eighteen states and some territories are balanced against the national government whether judiciously or injudiciously i will not presume at present to conjecture we have seen some effects of it in some of the middle and some of the southern and western states under the two first administrations and we now behold some similar effects of it under the two last some genius more prompt and fertile than mine may infer from a little what a great deal means in the second place the house of representatives is balanced against the senate and the senate against the house in the third place the executive authority is in some degree balanced against the legislative in the fourth place the judiciary power is balanced against the house the senate the executive power and the state governments in the fifth place the senate is balanced against the president in all appointments to office and in all treaties this in my opinion is not merely a useless but a very pernicious balance in the     sixth place the people hold in their own hands the balance against their own representatives by biennial which i wish had been annual elections in the seventh place the legislatures of the several states are balanced against the senate by sextennial elections in the eighth place the electors are balanced against the people in the choice of the president and here is a complication and refinement of balances which for any thing i recollect is an invention of our own and peculiar to us the state legislatures can direct the choice of electors by the people at large or by the people in what districts they please or by themselves without consulting the people at all however all this complication of machinery all these wheels within wheels these imperia within imperiis have not been sufficient to satisfy the people they have invented a balance to all balances in their caucuses we have congressional caucuses state caucuses county caucuses city caucuses district caucuses town caucuses parish caucuses and sunday caucuses at church doors and in these aristocratical caucuses elections are decided do you not tremble mr taylor with fear that another balance to all these balances an over balance of all moral liberty and to every moral principle and feeling may soon be invented and introduced i mean the balance of corruption corruption be not surprised sir if the spirit of party is corruption have we not seen much of it already if the spirit of faction is corruption have we seen none of that evil spirit if the spirit of banking is corruption as you have uniformly proclaimed it to be ever since i had the honor of your acquaintance and as your arator and your inquiry everywhere sufficiently demonstrate have you ever heard or read of any country in which this spirit prevailed to a greater degree than in this are you informed of any aristocratical institution by which the property of the many is more manifestly sacrificed to the profit of the few are all these impure spirits deduced from moral liberty or are any of them reconcilable to moral principle     john adams john taylor xi in your fourth page you are unable to discover in our form of government any resemblance of monarchy aristocracy or democracy as defined by ancient writers and by mr adams himself as these words are technical terms whose meaning is as well defined both by ancients and moderns as the words point line surface or solid in geometry i shall not turn over volumes to quote authorities in a question of so easy a solution to avoid misrepresentation however i shall explicitly premise that all intelligence all power all force all authority originally inherently necessarily inseparably and inalienably resides in the people in the language of civilians the summa potestatis the supreme sovereign absolute and uncontrollable power is placed by god and nature in the people and they never can divest themselves of it all this was truth before the people themselves by their own sagacity or their moral sentiments or if you had rather say by their own simplicity credulity and imbecility began to distinguish the one and the few from their own average and level for you may depend upon it the people themselves by their own observation and experience and feelings their own sensations and reflections made these distinctions before kingcraft priestcraft or noblecraft had any thing to do with them an inevitable consequence of this great truth is another namely—that all government except the simplest and most perfect democracy is representative government the simplest despotism monarchy or aristocracy and all the most complicated mixtures of them that ever existed or can be imagined are mere representatives of the people and can exist no longer than the people will to support them à bas le tyran à bas le gouvernement bon ou mauvais—good bad or indifferent whenever the people decree and proclaim its downfall it falls is this explicit concession democratical enough i beg your pardon i had forgotten for a moment that you do not allow democracy to be deduced from moral liberty let me vary my question then do you admit those two great truths to be consistent with moral liberty and the constitution of the united states   0 but to return and approach the question if peradventure we can find it scientific definitions are commonly in the abstract merely ideal and intellectual and theoretical for example—point has no parts a line is longitude without latitude a superficies is length and breadth without thickness yet in practice we can neither see nor feel these points lines or surfaces thus monarchy is defined to be a sovereignty in one that is to say all the rights powers and authorities of a whole nation committed in trust to a single man without limitation or restriction aristocracy the same ample and unlimited power vested in a small number of men democracy reserves all these rights prerogatives and privileges to the whole nation and every act of its volition must be determined by a vote now it is manifest that no such simple government as either of these ever existed in any nation no nor in any city town village nor scarcely in any private social club to say then that a mixed balanced government can be formed of monarchy aristocracy and democracy in this sense of the words would be as absurd as for a hindoo to say that the best government would be that of three omniscient and almighty brahmins mixed or commixed together and reciprocally balancing each other thus far for what i know we may be pretty well agreed but when you say that in our form of government no resemblance can be discovered of monarchy aristocracy or democracy i beg leave to differ from you the prince of orange william v in a conversation with which he honored me in      was pleased to say that he had read our new constitution and he added monsieur vous allez avoir un roi sous le titre de président which may be translated sir you have given yourselves a king under the title of president turgot rochefoucauld and condorcet brissot and robespierre and mazzei were all offended that we had given too much eclat to our governors and presidents it is true and i rejoice in it that our presidents limited as they are have more power that is more executive power than the stadtholders the doges the podestàs the avoyers or the archons or the kings of lacedæmon or of poland to be brief the general sense of mankind differs from you in opinion and clearly sees and fully believes that our presidents office has some resemblance of monarchy and god forbid that it should ever be diminished     all these monarchical powers however are deduced in your judgment from moral liberty i agree that they are deduced from morality and liberty but if they had been more deliberately considered and better digested the morality and liberty would have been better secured and of longer duration if the senatorial limitation of them had been omitted in my next we will see if we can discover any resemblance of aristocracy in our form of government john adams john taylor xii you are unable to discover in our form of government any resemblance of aristocracy as every branch of executive authority committed or intrusted exclusively to one resembles and is properly called a monarchical power and a government in proportion as its powers legislative or executive are lodged in one resembles monarchy so whatever authority or power of making or executing laws is exclusively vested in a few is properly called aristocratical and a government in proportion as it is constituted with such powers resembles aristocracy now sir let me ask you whether you can discover no resemblance of aristocracy in our form of government are not great very great important and essential powers intrusted to a few a very few thirtyfour senators composed of two senators from each state are an integral part of the legislature which is the representative sovereignty of seven or eight millions of the people in the united states these thirtyfour men possess an absolute negative on all the laws of the nation nor is this all these few these very few thirtyfour citizens only in seven or eight millions have an absolute negative upon the executive authority in the appointment of all officers in the diplomacy in the navy the army the customs excises and revenues they have moreover an absolute negative on all treaties with foreign powers even with the aboriginal indians they are also an absolute judicature in all impeachments even of the judges such are the powers in legislation in execution and in judicature which in our form of government are committed to thirtyfour men if in all these mighty powers and exclusive privileges you     can discover no resemblance of aristocracy when and where did any resemblance of aristocracy exist the trigintivirs of athens and the decemvirs of rome i acknowledge resembled aristocracy still more but the lords of parliament in england do not resemble it so much nor did the nobility in prussia germany russia france or spain possess such powers the palatines in poland indeed how are these thirtyfour senators appointed are they appointed by the people is the constitution of them democratical they are chosen by the legislatures of the several states and who are the legislatures of these separate states are they the people no they are a selection of the best men among the people made by the people themselves that is they are the very ἄϱιστοι of the greeks yet there is something more these legislatures are composed of two bodies a senate and a house of representatives each assembly differently constituted the senate more nearly resembling aristocracy than the house senators of the united states are chosen in some states by a convention of both houses in others by separate independent but concurrent votes the senates in the former have great influence and often turn the vote in the latter they have an absolute negative in the choice here are refinements upon refinements of resemblances of aristocracy a complication of checks and balances evidently extended beyond any constitution of government that i can at present recollect whether an exact balance has been hit or whether an exact balance will ever be hit are different questions but in this i am clear that the nearer we approach to an exact balance the nearer we shall approach to moral liberty if i understand the phrase we have agreed to be civil and free in my number thirteen i will very modestly hint to you my humble opinion of the point where your principal mistake lies john adams john taylor xiii in my last i ventured to say that i would hint in this at a principal misconception that had misled you or me i shall     submit the question to yourself and to the world if you or i please to be decided between us with candor you appear to me in all your writings to consider hereditary descent as essential to monarchy and aristocracy when you mention monarchy monarch or king you seem to understand an office and an officer unlimited in authority power and duration but is this correct in speculation or in language everybody knows that the word monarchy has its etymology in the greek words μόνος and ἄϱχη and signifies single rule or authority in one this authority may be limited or unlimited of temporary or perpetual duration it may be hereditary or it may be for life or it may be for years or only for one year or for months or for one month or for days or only for one day nevertheless as far as it extends and as long as it lasts it may be called a monarchical authority with great propriety by any man who is not afraid of a popular clamor and a scurrilous abuse of words monarchy in this view of it resembles property a landed estate may be for years a year a half a year or it may be for life or for two or three or any number of lives or it may be an inheritance to him his heirs and assigns forever and ever an estate in an office may be given by law for years for life or forever as well as an estate in land you or i may possess our houses for years for life or in tail or in fee simple and where is our title our security for the possession of our firesides but in the laws of society and these laws of society have secured and will secure to monarchs to aristocrats and to democrats such as you and i are their estates in their offices as well as in their houses their lands or their horses in the same manner as they protect us asleep in our beds or when at supper with our families mr madison has as clear a title to his estate in his office of president for four years as you have to hazelwood to yourself your heirs and assigns forever and by the same laws marshall has as good a right as either to his estate for life in his office of chief justice of the united states the romans often conferred on the consuls in very delicate terms unlimited power to take care that the republic should suffer no injury they conferred on cincinnatus on sylla and on cæsar the office of dictator and the same power on many others some for limited periods some without limitation and on cæsar i believe for perpetuity were not the senates in such     cases aristocrats or rather oligarchs for their several periods were not the dictators monarchs some for years some for life were they not made by law in the strictest sense monarchs or if you will despots what were the kings of crete or of sparta monarchs indeed but how limited though hereditary what were the kings of poland how limited and yet for life from these hints i think it is clear that the idea of hereditary descent is not an essential ingredient in the definition of monarchy or aristocracy and that to employ those words in all cases or in any case as implying hereditary descent is an abuse of words and an imposition on vulgar popularity i know not how when or where you discovered that mr adams supposed that monarchy aristocracy and democracy or mixtures of them constituted all the elements of government this language is not mine there is but one element of government and that is the people from this element spring all governments for a nation to be free it is only necessary that she wills it for a nation to be slave it is only necessary that she wills it the governments of hindostan and china of caffraria and kamtschatka the empires of alexander the macedonian of zingis khan and napoleon of tecumseh and nimrod hughes all have grown out of this element—the people this fertile element however has never yet produced any other government than monarchy aristocracy democracy and mixtures of them and pray tell me how it can produce any other you say by moral liberty will you be so good as to give me a logical mathematical or moral or any other definition of this phrase moral liberty and to tell me who is to exercise this liberty and by what principle or system of morality it is to be exercised is not this liberty and morality to reside in the great and universal element the people have they not always resided there and will they not always reside there this moral liberty resides in hindoos and mahometans as well as in christians in cappadocian monarchists as well as in athenian democrats in shaking quakers as well as in the general assembly of the presbyterian clergy in tartars and arabs negroes and indians as well as in the people of the united states of america     john adams john taylor xiv in your fourth page you give us your opinion that the moral efforts of mankind towards political improvement have been restrained and disappointed by the erroneous opinion that monarchy aristocracy and democracy or mixtures of them constitute all the elements of government and you proceed to state that it will be an effort of your essay to prove that the united states have refuted the ancient maxim that monarchy aristocracy and democracy are the only elements of government this phraseology is by no means familiar to me i know not any writer or speaker who has asserted such a doctrine or advanced such a maxim the words monarchy aristocracy and democracy are technical terms invented by learned men to express three different species of government so they have invented many others—oligarchy ochlocracy mobocracy anarchy jacobinism sans culottism federalism republicanism quiddism or gunarkism any one of these hard words may be called an element of government with as much propriety as any other the word element as you employ it here is a figure of rhetoric can you give—i acknowledge i have not ingenuity enough to invent—a logical or mathematical definition of it by elements do you mean principles if principles—physical or moral if physical—i know of no physical principle of government but the bones and sinews the timbers and ropes of the human body that is the mere strength force and power of constables sheriffs posse comitatus armies and navies soldiers and sailors these elements or principles are applied in all the species of government that have been named and must be the last resort of all that can be named or conceived these elements or principles are not peculiar to the united states by elements do you mean moral principles if so i know but one principle or element of government and that is constans et perpetua voluntas jus suum cuique tribuendi that is a constant and perpetual disposition and determination to render to every one his right or in other words a constant and perpetual disposition and determination to do to others as we would have others do to us this is a perfect principle applicable at     all times in all places among all persons in all circumstances justice therefore is the only moral principle or element of government but how shall justice be done in human society it can be done only by general laws these can never comprehend or foresee all the circumstances attending every particular case and therefore it has been found necessary to introduce another principle or element mercy in strictness perfect justice includes mercy and perfect mercy includes justice both together make but one principle or moral element of government have you read heard or discovered any other moral principle or element of the government of god angels or men than justice and benevolence united this principle has been professed by all governments and all governors throughout all time and space with which we are acquainted by king theodore and the emperor napoleon by the prince regent and tecumseh how then is the government of the united states planted in moral principles more than other governments that we have conformed our practice to our principles as well or better upon the whole than the majority or if you will than any other nation hitherto i will not dispute because the question decide it as you will makes no alteration in the argument john adams john taylor xv in this fourth page you say that mr adamss system tells us that the art of government can never change i have said no such thing mr taylor i know the art of government has changed and probably will change as often as the arts of architecture painting sculpture music poetry agriculture horticulture medicine and that is to say almost as often as the weather or the fashion in dress but all these arts are founded in certain general principles of nature which have never been known to change and it is the duty of philosophers legislators and artists to study these principles and the nearer they approach to them the greater perfection will they attain in their arts there may be principles in nature not yet observed that will improve all these arts and nothing hinders any man from making experiments and pursuing     researches to investigate such principles and make such improvements but america has made no discoveries of principles of government that have not been long known morality and liberty and moral liberty too whatever it may mean have been known from the creation cain knew it when he killed abel and knew that he violated it you say sir that i have gravely counted up several victims of popular rage as proofs that democracy is more pernicious than monarchy or aristocracy this is not my doctrine mr taylor my opinion is and always has been that absolute power intoxicates alike despots monarchs aristocrats and democrats and jacobins and sans culottes i cannot say that democracy has been more pernicious on the whole than any of the others its atrocities have been more transient those of the others have been more permanent the history of all ages shows that the caprice cruelties and horrors of democracy have soon disgusted alarmed and terrified themselves they soon cry this will not do we have gone too far we are all in the wrong we are none of us safe we must unite in some clever fellow who can protect us all—cæsar bonaparte who you will though we distrust hate and abhor them all yet we must submit to one or another of them stand by him cry him up to the skies and swear that he is the greatest best and finest man that ever lived it has been my fortune good or bad to live in europe ten years from      to      in a public character this destiny singular in america forced upon my attention the course of events in france holland geneva and switzerland among many other nations and this has irresistibly attracted my thoughts more than has been for my interest the subject cannot have escaped you what has been the conduct of the democratic parties in all those nations how horribly bloody in some has it been steady consistent uniform in any has it not leaped from democracy to aristocracy to oligarchy to military despotism and back again to monarchy as often and as easily as the birds fly to the lower the middle or the upper limbs of a tree or leap from branch to branch or hop from spray to spray democracy nevertheless must not be disgraced democracy must not be despised democracy must be respected democracy must be honored democracy must be cherished democracy     must be an essential an integral part of the sovereignty and have a control over the whole government or moral liberty cannot exist or any other liberty i have been always grieved by the gross abuses of this respectable word one party speak of it as the most amiable venerable indeed as the sole object of its adoration the other as the sole object of its scorn abhorrence and execration neither party in my opinion know what they say some of them care not what they say provided they can accomplish their own selfish purposes these ought not to be forgiven you triumphantly demand what motives of preference between forms of government remain is there no difference between a government of laws and a government of men between a government according to fixed laws concerted by three branches of the legislature composed of the most experienced men of a nation established recorded promulgated to every individual as the rule of his conduct and a government according to the will of one man or to a vote of a few men or to a vote of a single assembly whether of a nation or its representatives it is not mr adamss system which can arrest our efforts or appall our hopes in pursuit of political good other causes have obstructed and still embarrass the progress of the science of legislation john adams john taylor xvi in this number i have to hint at some causes which impede the course of investigation in civil and political knowledge religion however has been so universally associated with government that it is impossible to separate them in this inquiry and where shall i begin and where end shall i begin with the library at alexandria and finish with that at washington the latter saracens more ferocious than the former in proportion as they lived in a more civilized age where are the languages of antiquity all the dialects of the chaldean tongue where is aristotles history of eighteen hundred republics that had existed before his time where are ciceros writings upon     government what havoc has been made of books through every century of the christian era where are fifty gospels condemned as spurious by the bull of pope gelasius where are the forty wagonloads of hebrew manuscripts burned in france by order of another pope because suspected of heresy remember the index expurgatorius the inquisition the stake the axe the halter and the guillotine and oh horrible the rack this is as bad if not worse than a slow fire nor should the lions mouth be forgotten have you considered that system of holy lies and pious frauds that has raged and triumphed for fifteen hundred years and which chateaubriand appears at this day to believe as sincerely as st austin did upon this system depend the royalty loyalty and allegiance of europe the vial of holy oil with which the kings of france and england are anointed is one of the most splendid and important events in all the legends do you think that mr adamss system arrests our efforts and appalls our hopes in pursuit of political good his maxim is study government as you do astronomy by facts observations and experiments not by the dogmas of lying priests or knavish politicians the causes that impede political knowledge would fill a hundred volumes how can i crowd a few hints at them in a single volume much less in a single letter give me leave to select one attempt to improve civil political and ecclesiastical knowledge or at least to arrest and retard the progress of ignorance hypocrisy and knavery and the reception it met in the world tending to arrest our efforts and appall our hopes can you believe that jesuits conceived this design yet true it is about the year      bollandus a jesuit began the great work the acta sanctorum even jesuits were convinced that impositions upon mankind had gone too far henschenius another jesuit assisted him and papebrock in the labor the design was to give the lives of the saints and to distinguish the miracles into the true the false and the dubious they produced fortyseven volumes in folio an immense work which i believe has never appeared in america it was not i am confident in the library consumed by ross the savage damned to   0 everlasting fame  and i fear it is not in the noble collection of mr jefferson i wish it was this was a great effort in favor of truth and to arrest imposture though made by jesuits but what was their reward among the miracles pronounced by these able men to be true there are probably millions which you and i should believe no more than we do those related by paulinus athanasius basil jerome or chrysostom as of their own knowledge now let us see how this generous effort in favor of truth was received and rewarded libels in abundance were printed against it the authors were cited before the inquisition in spain and the pope in italy as authors of gross errors the inquisition pronounced its anathema in      all europe was in anxious suspense the pope himself was embarrassed by the interminable controversies excited and without deciding any thing had no way to escape but by prohibiting all writings on the subject and what were the errors they were only doubts   is it certain that the face of jesus christ was painted on the handkerchief of saint veronica   had the carmelites the prophet elias for their founder these questions set europe in a flame and might have roasted papebrock at an autodafé had he been in spain such dangers as these might arrest efforts and appall hopes of political good but mr adamss system cannot that gaping timid animal man dares not read or think the prejudices passions habits associations and interests of his fellowcreatures surround him on every side and if his reading or his thoughts interfere with any of these he dares not acknowledge it if he is hardy enough to venture even a hint persecution in some form or other is his certain portion party spirit—lesprit du corps—sects factions which threaten our existence in america at this moment both in church and state have arrested all efforts and appalled all hopes of political good have the protestants accomplished a thorough reformation is there a nation in europe whose government is purified from monkish knavery even in england is not the vial of holy oil still shown to travellers     how long will it be before the head of the prince regent or the head of his daughter will be anointed with this oil and the right of impressing seamen from american ships deduced from it john adams john taylor xvii mr adamss system is that of pope in his essay on criticism—   first follow nature and your judgment frame   by her just standard which is still the same this rule surely cannot arrest our efforts or appall our hopes study government as you build ships or construct steamengines the steam frigate will not defend new york if nature has not been studied and her principles regarded and how is the nature of man and of society and of government to be studied or known but in the history and by the experience of human nature in its terrestrial existence but to come nearer home in search of causes which arrest our efforts here i am like the woodcutter on mount ida who could not see wood for trees mariana wrote a book de regno in which he had the temerity to insinuate that kings were instituted for good and might be deposed if they did nothing but evil of course the book was prohibited and the writer prosecuted harrington wrote his oceana and other learned and ingenious works for which he was committed to prison where he became delirious and died sidney wrote discourses on government for which he was beheaded though they were only in manuscript and robbed from his desk montesquieu was obliged to fly his country and wander about europe for many years was compelled by the sorbonne after his return to sign a recantation as humiliating and as sincere as that of galileo  the chagrin produced by the criticisms and misrepresentations of his writings and the persecutions he suffered destroyed his health and he died in          these instances among others without number are the discouragements which arrest our efforts and appall our hopes nor are these all mankind do not love to read any thing upon any theory of government very few read any thing but libels theoretical books upon government will not sell booksellers and printers far from purchasing the manuscript will not accept it as a gift for example no printer would publish these remarks at his own risk and if i should print them at mine they would fall dead from the press i should never sell ten copies of them i cannot learn that your inquiry has had a rapid sale i fear that you or your printer will be a loser which i shall regret because i really wish it could be read by every one who can read to you who are rich this loss is of little moment but to me who am poor such losses would be a dangerous arrest of efforts and a melancholy appall of hopes writers in general are poor and hungry few write for fame even the great religionist moralist and literator johnson could not compose a sermon for a priest from simple charity he must have the pleasing hope the animating contemplation of a guinea before he could write by all that i can learn few rich men ever wrote any thing from the beginning of the world to this day you sir are a rara avis in terris much to your honor but i have not yet enumerated all the discouragements which arrest our efforts and appall our hopes i already feel all the ridicule of hinting at my poor four volumes of defence and discourses on davila after quoting mariana harrington sidney and montesquieu but i must submit to the imputation of vanity arrogance presumption dotage or insanity or what you will how have my feeble efforts been arrested and faint hopes appalled look back upon the pamphlets the newspapers the handbills and above all upon the circular letters of members of congress to their constituents for fourandtwenty years past and consider in what manner my writings and myself have been treated has it not been enough to arrest efforts and appall hopes is it not a damper to any ardor in search of truth to read the absurd criticism the stupid observations the jesuitical subtleties the studied lies that have been printed concerning my writings in this my dear native country for fiveandtwenty years to     read the ribaldry of markoe and brown paine and callender four vagabonds from great britain and to see their most profligate effusions applauded and sanctioned by a nation in fine is it not humiliating to see a volume of six or seven hundred pages written by a gentleman of your rank fortune learning genius and eloquence in which my system my sentiments and my writings from beginning to end are totally misunderstood and misrepresented after all i am not dead like harrington and secondat i have read in a frenchman je nai jamais trop bien compris ce que cétoit que de mourir de chagrin and i can say as confidently as he did i have never yet very well understood what it was to die of chagrin yet i am daily not out of danger of griefs that might put an end to me in a few hours nevertheless i will wait if i can for distempers—the messenger of nature because i have still much curiosity to see what turn will be taken by public affairs in this country and others where can we rationally look for the theory or practice of government but to nature and experiment unless you appeal to revelation if you do i am ready and willing to follow you to that tribunal i find nothing there inconsistent with my system john adams john taylor xviii in your fifth page you say mr adams calls our attention to hundreds of wise and virtuous patricians mangled and bleeding victims of popular fury and gravely counts up several victims of democratic rage as proofs that democracy is more pernicious than monarchy or aristocracy is this fair sir do you deny any one of my facts i do not say that democracy has been more pernicious on the whole and in the long run than monarchy or aristocracy democracy has never been and never can be so durable as aristocracy or monarchy but while it lasts it is more bloody than either i beseech you sir to recollect the time when my three volumes of defence were written and printed in           and      the history of the universe had not then furnished me with a document i have since seen—an alphabetical dictionary of the names and qualities of persons mangled and bleeding     victims of democratic rage and popular fury in france during the despotism of democracy in that country which napoleon ought to be immortalized for calling ideology this work is in two printed volumes in octavo as large as johnsons dictionary and is in the library of our late and excellent vicepresident elbridge gerry where i hope it will be preserved with anxious care an edition of it ought to be printed in america otherwise it will be forever suppressed france will never dare look at it the democrats themselves could not bear the sight of it they prohibited and suppressed it as far as they could it contains an immense number of as great and good men as france ever produced we curse the inquisition and the jesuits and yet the inquisition and the jesuits are restored we curse religiously the memory of mary for burning good men in smithfield when if england had then been democratical she would have burned many more and we murder many more by the guillotine in the latter years of the eighteenth century we curse guy fawkes for thinking of blowing up westminster hall yet ross blows up the capitol the palace and the library at washington and would have done it with the same sang froid had congress and the presidents family been within the walls o my soul i am weary of these dismal contemplations when will mankind listen to reason to nature or to revelation you say i might have exhibited millions of plebeians sacrificed to the pride folly and ambition of monarcy and aristocracy this is very true and i might have exhibited as many millions of plebeians sacrificed by the pride folly and ambition of their fellowplebeians and their own in proportion to the extent and duration of their power remember democracy never lasts long it soon wastes exhausts and murders itself there never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide it is in vain to say that democracy is less vain less proud less selfish less ambitious or less avaricious than aristocracy or monarchy it is not true in fact and nowhere appears in history those passions are the same in all men under all forms of simple government and when unchecked produce the same effects of fraud violence and cruelty when clear prospects are opened before vanity pride avarice or ambition for their easy gratification it is hard for the     most considerate philosophers and the most conscientious moralists to resist the temptation individuals have conquered themselves nations and large bodies of men never when solons balance was destroyed by aristides and the preponderance given to the multitude for which he was rewarded with the title of just when he ought to have been punished with the ostracism the athenians grew more and more democratic i need not enumerate to you the foolish wars into which the people forced their wisest men and ablest generals against their own judgments by which the state was finally ruined and philip and alexander became their masters in proportion as the balance imperfect and unskilful as it was originally here as in athens inclined more and more to the dominatio plebis the carthaginians became more and more restless impatient enterprising ambitious avaricious and rash till hannibal swore eternal hostility to the romans and the romans were compelled to pronounce delenda est carthago what can i say of the democracy of france i dare not write what i think and what i know were brissot condorcet danton robespierre and monseigneur egalité less ambitious than cæsar alexander or napoleon were dumouriez pichegru moreau less generals less conquerors or in the end less fortunate than the last was what was the ambition of this democracy nothing less than to propagate itself its principles its system through the world to decapitate all the kings destroy all the nobles and priests in europe and who were the instruments employed by the mountebanks behind the scene to accomplish these sublime purposes the firewomen the badauds the stage players the atheists the deists the scribblers for any cause at three livres a day the jews and oh that i could erase from my memory the learned divines—profound students in the prophecies—real philosophers and sincere christians in amazing numbers over all europe and america who were hurried away by the torrent of contagious enthusiasm democracy is chargeable with all the blood that has been spilled for fiveandtwenty years napoleon and all his generals were but creatures of democracy as really as rienzi theodore massaniello jack cade or wat tyler this democratical hurricane inundation earthquake pestilence call it which you will at last aroused and     alarmed all the world and produced a combination unexampled to prevent its further progress john adams john taylor xix i hope my last convinced you that democracy is as restless as ambitious as warlike and bloody as aristocracy or monarchy you proceed to say that i ought to have placed right before us the effects of these three principles namely—democracy aristocracy and monarchy commixed in the wars rebellions persecutions and oppressions of the english form pray sir what was the object of my book i was not writing a history of england nor of the world inattention to this circumstance has been the cause of all the honest misapprehensions misconstructions and misrepresentations of the whole work to see at one glance the design of the three volumes you need only to look at the first page m turgot was not satisfied with the constitutions which had been formed for the different states of america by most of them the customs of england were imitated without any particular motive instead of collecting all authority into one centre that of the nation they have established different bodies—a body of representatives a council and a governor—because there is in england a house of commons a house of lords and a king they endeavor to balance these different powers this solemn opinion of m turgot is the object of the whole of the three volumes m turgot had seen only the constitutions of new york massachusetts and maryland and the first constitution of pennsylvania his principal intention was to censure the three former from these three the constitution of the united states was afterwards almost entirely drawn the drift of my whole work was to vindicate these three constitutions against the reproaches of that great statesman philosopher and really excellent man whom i well knew and to defend them against his attacks and only upon those points on which he had assaulted them if this fact had been considered it would have prevented a thousand witticisms and criticisms about the misnomer c     the points i had to illustrate and to prove were—   that the people of massachusetts new york and maryland were not to blame for instituting governors councils or senates and houses of representatives   that they were not reprehensible for endeavoring to balance those different powers   that they were to be applauded not reproached for not collecting all authority into one centre that of the nation in whatever sense those dark obscure and incomprehensible words could be understood   construing these phrases as it is believed they were intended to recommend a sovereignty in a single assembly of representatives that is a representative of democracy it was my duty to show that democracy was as unsteady equally envious ambitious avaricious vain proud cruel and bloody as aristocracy or monarchy   that an equilibrium of those different powers was indispensably necessary to guard and defend the rights liberties and happiness of the people against the deleterious contagious and pestilential effects of those passions of vanity pride ambition envy revenge lust and cruelty which domineer more or less in every government that has no balance or an imperfect balance   that it was not an affected imitation of the english government so much as an attachment to their old colonial forms in every one of which there had been three branches—a governor a council and a house of representatives—which added to the eternal reason and unalterable nature of things induced the legislators of those three states to adopt their new constitutions the design of the three volumes pursued from the first page of the first to the last page of the last was to illustrate elucidate and demonstrate those six important truths to illustrate and prove these truths or to show them to be falsehoods where can we look but into the heart of man and the history of his heart in the heart were found those appetites passions prejudices and selfish interests which ought always to be controlled by reason conscience and social affections but which are never perfectly so controlled even by any individual still less by nations and large bodies of men and less and less as communities grow larger and larger more populous more commercial     more wealthy and more luxurious in the history of his heart a transient glance of the eye was cast over the most conspicuous remarkable and celebrated of those nations who had preserved any share of authority to the people or who had approached the nearest to preserving all authority to the people or who had mixed the authority of the people with that of patricians or senates or councils or where the executive power had been separated from or united with the legislative or where the judicial power had been complicated with either or separate from both and it was endeavored to be shown that those nations had been the happiest who had separated the legislative from the executive power the judicial from both and divided the legislative power itself into three branches thereby producing a balance between the legislative and executive authority a balance between the branches of the legislature and a salutary check upon all these powers in the judicial as had been done in the constitutions of maryland new york and massachusetts i had nothing to do with despotisms or simple monarchies unless it were incidentally and by way of illustration i know not that any one of my facts has ever been denied or disputed or doubted do you deny any of them are they not a sufficient apology for the people of massachusetts new york and maryland against the accusations of m turgot as well as against sharp and his followers who taught the same dogmas john adams john taylor xx in my apology if you like that word better than defence i passed over england for more reasons than one i very well knew that there had been no nation that had produced so many materials for the illustration of my system and confirmation of my principles as that in which i wrote there was anciently no people but serfs no house of commons the struggle between kings barons and priests from thomas à kempis to cardinal wolsey and from him to archbishop laud and from him to king william would have been instructive enough and it would not have been difficult to show that the wars rebellions persecutions and oppressions of the english form     arose the frenzy of superstition apart from the want of that limitation of power in the king the lords the commons and the judges and of the balances between them for which i contended i had nothing to do with the ecclesiastical establishment in england my observations related exclusively to the civil and political arrangement of powers these powers were never accurately defined and consequently balanced till the revolution nor the judges completely independent till the present reign nor had i any thing to do with the hereditary quality superadded to the monarchical and aristocratical powers in england the three great powers may be separated for some purposes united for others as clearly defined limited and balanced for one two or three years as in the constitutions of maryland new york and massachusetts as they can be for an age or as they are in england for endless ages a large proportion of the wars rebellions persecutions and oppressions in england have arisen from ecclesiastical artifices and the intoxication of religious enthusiasm are you sure that any form of government can at all times secure the people from fanaticism although this country has done much are you confident that our moral civil or political liberties are perfectly safe on this quarter is a democracy less liable to this evil than a mixed government it is true that in my apology i expressed in strong terms my admiration of the english constitution but i meant no more of it than was to the purpose of my argument that is the division and union of powers in our american constitutions which were indeed so far imitations of it my argument had no more to do with hereditary descent than it had with the church or the bank of england my mind i acknowledge was deeply impressed with apprehensions from the accounts of the dangerous and irregular proceedings in several counties in massachusetts and the alarming extent of similar discontents in all the other states and more than all this the fountains of the great deep were broken up in france and the proud wave of democracy was spreading and swelling and rolling not only through that kingdom but into england holland geneva and switzerland and indeed threatened an inundation all over europe innovation was making bold and large strides in every direction i had great doubts of   0 the success of the leaders in any useful degree but of one thing i was fully convinced—that if they aimed at any constitution of civil government more popular than the english they would ruin themselves after setting europe on fire and shedding oceans of blood the rise progress and termination to this time need only be hinted are you now convinced that france must have a more permanent executive than she had in the time of barrère the constitutions in france spain and holland have at last approached nearer to such a division and balance of powers as are contended for than ever was attempted before but these constitutions of      are all essentially defective and cannot endure as to rebellions in england there was one in      another in      i recollect no more unless you claim for one lord george gordons insanity and that of his stupid bigoted followers after all our discoveries of new principles of moral liberty we have had shayss friess and i know not whose rebellion in the western counties of pennsylvania how near did virginia and kentucky approach in the last years of the last century and how near is new england approaching at this hour in hartford must you and i humble ourselves in dust and ashes to acknowledge that the united states have had more rebellions and quasi rebellions in thirty years than england has had in one hundred and twenty john wilkes said to a confidential friend who broke in unexpectedly to his closet when he was writing his northbriton number fiftyfive i have been studying these four hours to see how near i could come to treason without committing it this study mr taylor has become a fashionable study in the south the middle and the north of america you admit that man is physically always the same but deny that he is so morally i have not admitted that he is physically always the same nor have i asserted that he is so morally on the contrary some are born strong others weak some tall others short some agile others clumsy some handsome others ugly some black others white these physical qualities too may be and are both improved and depraved by education practice exercise and nourishment they are all born alike morally innocent but do not all remain so they soon become as different     and unlike and unequal in morals as virtue and vice merit and guilt in their intellects they are never equal nor the same perception is more quick memory more retentive judgment more mature reason more correct thoughts better arranged in some than in others and these inequalities are the sources of the natural aristocracy among mankind according to my express words quoted by you john adams john taylor xxi the corporeal inequalities among mankind from the cradle and from the womb to the age of oglethorpe and parr the intellectual inequalities from blackmore to milton from crocker to newton and from behmen to locke are so obvious and notorious that i could not expect they would have been doubted the moral equality that is the innocence is only at the birth as soon as they can walk or speak you may discern a moral inequality these inequalities physical intellectual and moral i have called sources of a natural aristocracy and such they are have been and will be and it would not be dangerous to say they are sources of all the artificial aristocracies that have been are or will be can you say that these physical intellectual and moral inequalities produce no inequalities of influence consideration and power in society you say upon the truth or error of this distinction the truth or error of mr adamss mode of reasoning and of this essay will somewhat depend i know not whether i ought not to join issue with you upon this point state the question or questions then fairly and candidly between us   are there or are there not physical corporeal material inequalities among mankind from the embryo to the tomb   are there or are there not intellectual inequalities from the first opening of the senses the sight the hearing the taste the smell and the touch to the final loss of all sense   are there not moral inequalities discernible almost if not quite from the original innocence to the last stage of guilt and depravity   from these inequalities physical intellectual and moral does there or does there not arise a natural aristocracy among     mankind or in other words some men who have greater capacities and advantages to acquire the love esteem and respect of their fellow men more wealth fame consideration honor influence and power in society than other men when where have i said that men were always morally the same never in word or writing i have said—   there is an inequality of wealth    there is an inequality of birth    there are great inequalities of merit talents virtues services and reputations    there are a few in whom all these advantages of birth fortune and fame are united  i then go on to say these sources of inequality common to every people founded in the constitution of nature a natural aristocracy c c now sir let me modestly and civilly request of you a direct and simple answer to the three foregoing questions ay or no yea or nay you and i have been so drilled to such answers that we can have as little difficulty in promising them as in understanding them at least unless we have become greater proficients in pyrrhonism than we were when we lived together when i shall be honored with your yea or nay to those three questions i hope i shall know the real questions between us and be enabled to confess my error express my doubts or state my replication but sir let me ask you why you direct your artillery at me alone at me a simple individual in town obscure of humble parents born i had fortified myself behind the intrenchments of aristotle livy sidney harrington dr price machiavel montesquieu swift c you should have battered down these strong outworks before you could demolish me the word crown which you have quoted from me in your eighth page was used merely to signify the executive authority you sir who are a lawyer know that this figure signifies nothing more nor less the prince is used by j j rousseau and by other writers on the social compact for the same thing had i been blessed with time to revise a work which is full of errors     of the press i should have noted this as an erratum especially if i had thought of guarding against malevolent criticism in america i now request a formal erratum page      at the bottom dele crown and insert executive authority in your eighth page you begin to consider my natural causes of aristocracy   superior abilities let us keep to nature and experience is there no such thing as genius had raphael no more genius than the common signpost painters had newton no more genius than even his great master that learned profound and most excellent man dr barrow had alexander no more genius than darius had cæsar no more than catiline or even than pompey had napoleon no more than santerre has the honorable john randolph no more than nimrod hughes and christopher macpherson has every clerk in a countinghouse as great a genius for numbers as zerah colburne who at six years of age demonstrated faculties which sanderson and newton never possessed in their ripest days is there in the world a father of a family who has not perceived diversities in the natural capacities of his children these questions deserve direct answers if you allow that there are natural inequalities of abilities consider the effects that the genius of alexander produced they are visible to this day and what effect has the genius of napoleon produced they will be felt for three thousand years to come what effect have the genius of washington and franklin produced had these men no more influence in society than the ordinary average of other men genius is sometimes long lived and it has accumulated fame wealth and power greater than can be commanded by millions of ordinary citizens these advantages are sometimes applied to good purposes and sometimes to bad john adams john taylor xxii when superior genius gives greater influence in society than is possessed by inferior genius or a mediocrity of genius that is than by the ordinary level of men this superior influence i     call natural aristocracy this cause you say is fluctuating what then it is aristocracy still while it exists and is not democracy fluctuating too are the waves of the sea or the winds of the air or the gossamer that idles in the wanton summer air more fluctuating than democracy while i admit the existence of democracy notwithstanding its instability you must acknowledge the existence of natural aristocracy notwithstanding its fluctuations i find it difficult to understand you when you say that knowledge and ignorance are fluctuating knowledge is unchangeable and ignorance cannot change because it is nothing it is a nonentity truth is one uniform and eternal knowledge of it cannot fluctuate any more than itself ignorance of truth being a nonentity cannot surely become entity and fluctuate and change like proteus or wind or water you sport away so merrily upon this topic that i will have the pleasure of transcribing you you say the aristocracy of superior abilities will be regulated by the extent of the space between knowledge and ignorance as the space contracts or widens it will be diminished or increased and if aristocracy may be thus diminished it follows that it may be thus destroyed what is the amount of this argument ignorance may be destroyed and knowledge increased ad infinitum and do you expect that all men are to become omniscient like the almighty and omniscient hindoo perfect brahmins are your hopes founded upon an expectation that knowledge will one day be equally divided will women have as much knowledge as men will children have as much as their parents if the time will never come when all men will have equal knowledge it seems to follow that some will know more than others and that those who know most will have more influence than those who know least or than those who know half way between the two extremes and consequently will be aristocrats superior abilities comprehend abilities acquired by education and study as well as genius and natural parts and what a source of inequality and aristocracy is here suffer me to dilate a little in this place massachusetts has probably educated as many sons to letters in proportion to her numbers as any state in the union perhaps as any nation ancient or modern what proportion do the scholars bear to the whole number of people     i wish i had a catalogue of our harvard university that i might state exact numbers say that in almost two hundred years there have been three or four thousand educated from perhaps two or three millions of people are not these aristocrats or in other words have they not had more influence than any equal number of uneducated men in fact these men governed the province from its first settlement these men have governed and still govern the state these men in schools academies colleges and universities these men in the shape of ministers lawyers and physicians these men in academies of arts and sciences in agricultural societies in historical societies in medical societies and in antiquarian societies in banking institutions and in washington benevolent societies govern the state at this twentysixth of december      the more you educate without a balance in the government the more aristocratical will the people and the government be there never can be in any nation more than one fifth—no not one tenth of the men regularly educated to science and letters i hope then you will acknowledge that abilities form a distinction and confer a privilege in fact though they give no peculiar rights in society   you appear sir to have overlooked or forgotten one great source of natural aristocracy mentioned by me in my apology and dilated on in subsequent pages i mean birth i should be obliged to you for your candid sentiments upon this important subject exceptions have been taken to the phrase well born but i can see no more impropriety in it than in the epithets well bred well educated well brought up well taught well informed well read well to live well dressed well fed well clothed well armed well accoutred well furnished well made well fought well aimed well meant well mounted well fortified well tempered well fatted well spoken well argued well reasoned well decked well ducked well trimmed well wrought or any other well in common parlance and here sir permit me by way of digression to remark another discouragement to honest political literature and the progress of real political science if a wellmeant publication appears it is instantly searched for an unpopular word or one that can be made so by misconstruction misrepresentation or by any credible and imposing deception some ambitious popular demagogue gives the alarm—heresy holy democratical     church has decreed that word to be heresy down with him and if there was no check to their passions and no balance to their government they would say à la lanterne à la guillotine roast him bake him boil him fry him the inquisition in spain would not celebrate more joyfully an autodafé some years ago more than forty a writer unfortunately made use of the term better sort instantly a popular clamor was raised and an odium excited which remains to this day to such a degree that no man dares to employ that expression at the bar in conversation in a newspaper or pamphlet no nor in the pulpit though the baser sort are sufficiently marked and distinguished in the new testament to prove that there is no wrong in believing a better sort and if there is any difference between virtue and vice there is a better sort and a worse sort in every human society with sincere reverence let me here quote one of the most profound philosophical moral and religious sentiments that ever was expressed—we know not what spirit we are of john adams john taylor xxiii i have not yet finished what the poets call an episode and prosemen a digression can you account for a caprice in the public opinion burkes swinish multitude has not been half so unpopular nor excited half the irritation odium resentment or indignation that well born and better sort have produced burkes phrase nevertheless must be allowed to be infinitely more unphilosophical immoral irreligious uncivil impolitic inhuman and insolent than either or both the other impudent libeller of your species whom do you mean by your multitude the multitude in your country means the people of england scotland and ireland and all the rest of your dominions the multitude in this country means the people of the united states the multitude means mankind make your exceptions and then say after an attention whether they are not upon an average as swinish as the rest all the delicacy of your classical criticism all the subtilty of your     metaphysical discrimination cannot devise a justifiable limitation of your words but to return from this digression till i meet another our present subject is birth it is acknowledged that we are all children of the same benevolent parent all born under the same moral law of our nature all equally free and all entitled to the same equal rights thus far i hope we are agreed but not to repeat the physical inequalities and the intellectual inequalities of capacity before enumerated and perhaps more than once is there not a distinction made in society between children of different parents and is it not produced by natural causes if you deny that such distinctions are made in fact and practice how shall i prove it   the general sense and still more the universal consent of mankind is allowed to be a strong argument to prove the truth of any fact or any opinion is there any practice custom or sentiment in which mankind have more universally agreed than in making distinctions of nativity and manifesting more respect for the children of some parents than for those of others not only all civilized cultivated and polished societies but all pastoral nations and savage hordes the negroes of africa and our indian tribes all concur in this usage if in all your reading conversation or experience you have found an exception i pray you to communicate it to me i know none   look over our states which i pray may be sometime or other truly called united is no distinction made here it might be thought invidious to mention names and indeed it would be endless but are there not names almost as much revered as those of patriarchs prophets or apostles have names no influence in governing men had the word gueux no influence in the dutch revolution had the word sans culotte none in the french have the words jacobin democrat no influence have the words federalist and republican no effect if these transient momentary cant words of faction or at best of party have such effects what must be the more permanent influence of names that have been revered for ages and never heard but like music   in this argument i have a right to state cases as strong as any that occur in human life suppose ten thousand people     assembled to see the execution of a man for burglary robbery arson fratricide patricide or the meanest most treacherous perfidious and cruel crime that can be committed or imagined suppose the next day the same ten thousand people should attend the funeral obsequies of washington hamilton or ames is it possible that these ten thousand people should have the same feelings for the children of the criminal that they have for the hero and the sages   is there not a presumption in favor of some children at least a probable presumption if not a violent presumption here again i have a right to put strong cases here are two families in the same neighborhood the parents in one are ignorant intemperate idle thievish lying and consequently destitute in the other they are sober prudent honest decent frugal industrious possessed of comfortable property studious inquisitive well informed and if you will literary and scientific is there not a violent presumption in favor of the children of the latter family and against those of the former exceptions there are but exceptions prove the general rule   is there not a prejudice in favor of some children and against others prejudices associations habits customs usages manners must in some cases and in some degree be studied respected and indulged by legislators even the most wise virtuous pious learned and profound here sir i will appeal to yourself a young man appears you ask of the bystanders who he is the answer is i do not know no matter let him go another appears—who is he the answer is the son of a b i do not know a b a third appears—who is this the son of c d c d my friend he has been dead these fifty years but i love his memory and should be glad to be acquainted with any of his posterity please to walk in sir and favor me with your company for a few weeks or months you will be always welcome to my house and will always oblige me with your company   theognis a greek poet twentyfour hundred years ago complains that although mankind were very anxious to purchase stallions bulls and rams of the best breed yet in some instances men would marry wives of mean extraction for the sake of their fortunes and ladies of high birth would marry men of low descent     because they were rich  and i believe there has not been a poet orator historian or philosopher from his age to this who has not in his writings expressed or implied some distinction of nativities nor has there been one of either sex who in choosing a companion for life between two rivals of equal youth beauty fortune talents and accomplishments would not prefer the one of respectable parentage to the other of meaner and lower original john adams john taylor xxiv i am still upon birth and my seventh argument is—   it was a custom among the greeks and romans—probably in all civilized nations—to give names to the castles palaces and mansions of their consuls dictators and other magistrates senators c this practice is still followed in england france c among the ancients the distinctions of extraction were most constantly marked by the spots on which they were born illustri loco natus claro loco natus clarissimo loco natus illustrissimo loco natus were common expressions of conspicuous origin on the contrary obscuro loco nati vili loco nati designated low original base extraction sordid descent and were expressions however unjustly of odium or at least contempt i perceive sir that you gentlemen of virginia who are good classical scholars have not suffered this observation to escape you you have taken the modest name of hazlewood my friend richard lee the superb name chantilly mr madison the beautiful name of montpelier and mr jefferson the lofty name of monticello and mr washington the very humble name of a british sea captain mount vernon the hon john randolph that of roanoke i would advise the present proprietor of mount vernon to change the name to mount talbot truxton decatur rodgers bainbridge or hull and i  00 would advise our boston gentlemen who have given this name of the british sea captain to the most beautiful hill on the globe to change it to mount hancock or mount perry or mount macdonough   i wish i could take a walk with you in all the churchyards and burying grounds in virginia—episcopalian presbyterian methodist or what you will are there not tombs monuments gravestones and inscriptions ancient and modern is there no distinction made among these memorials are they all seen with equal eyes with equal indifference is there no peculiar attachment no particular veneration for any of them are they all beheld by the whole people and by every individual with similar sensations and reflections how many hundreds of thousands of men women and children have lived and died in virginia to whom no monument has been erected whose posterity know not and cannot conjecture where their ancestors were deposited do all these cemeteries which are found all over the world exhibit no distinctions of names and families and persons are not these distinctions natural produced by natural and inevitable causes   i should be highly honored and vastly delighted to visit with you every great planter in virginia i should be pleased to look into their parlors banqueting rooms bedchambers and great halls as mr jefferson and i once did together the most celebrated of the gentlemens country seats in england should we there see no statues no busts no pictures no portraits of their ancestors no trinkets no garments no pieces of furniture carefully preserved because they belonged to great grandfathers and estimated at ten times the value of similar articles of superior quality that might be bought at any shop or store what are ancestors or their little or great elegance or conveniences to the present planter more than those of the fiftyacre man his neighbor who perhaps never knew the name of his grandfather or father are there no natural feelings and consequently no natural distinctions here i think i have been impartial and have suspected no vanity or weakness in virginians which i have not recognized in massachusettensians and i could enumerate many more i will go farther it seems to be generally agreed and settled among men that john adams is a weak and vain man i fall down  0  under the public opinion the general sense and frankly and penitently acknowledge that i have been all my lifetime and still am a weak and vain man one instance of my vanity and weakness i will distinguish within two or three years i have followed to the tomb the nearest the dearest the tenderest connections relations and friends of my life from almost ninety years of age to eighteen months this has made me contemplate much among the tombs—a gloomy region to which i had been much a stranger in this churchyard i found the monumental stones of my father and mother my grandfather and grandmother my great grandfather and great grandmother and my great great grandfather my great great grandmother died in england if you will do me the favor sir to come to quincy and spend a few weeks with me i will take a walk with you and show you all these monuments and inscriptions and will confess to you i would not exchange this line of ancestors for that of guelphs or bowdoins or carters or winthrops such is my vanity imbecility and dotage and i suspect that you are not a whit wiser than i am in this respect open your soul sir and disclose your natural feelings and frankly say whether you would exchange ancestors with any man living i believe you would not is there a human being who would if these feelings for ancestors are universal how shall any legislator prevent the rich the great the powerful the learned the ingenious from distinguishing by durable costly and permanent memorials their own ancestors and consequently their children and remote posterity from the descendants of the vast the immense majority who lie mingled with the dust totally forgotten and how shall he prevent these names and families from being more noted and respected by nations as well as smaller communities than names never before heard john adams john taylor xxv a word or two more upon birth  0 birth is naturally and necessarily and inevitably so connected and blended with property fame power education genius strength beauty learning science taste figure air attitudes movements c c c that it is often impossible and  0  always difficult to separate them two children are born on the same day of equal genius—one the son of mr jefferson the other of nimrod hughes which will meet with most favor in the world would a child of anthony benezet good creature as he was have an equal chance in life with a son of robert morris when the wealth of nations was believed to be in his power would a son of the good rutherford the predecessor of general morgan have an equal favor in the world with a son of the great general and president washington would a son of sir isaac newton have no more favor in the sight of the whole human race than a son of mr rittenhouse the worthy president of the philosophical society of philadelphia beau nash meet no more complaisance than one of the hercules du roi whom i have seen leap at sadlers wells and turn his heels over his head at a height of ten or twelve feet and come down on the other side of the stage erect i leave sir to your fertile genius ample reading and long experience to pursue the inquiries i could continue to enumerate examples through sheets of paper    have you not observed in life and have you not remarked in history that the common people—and by common people i here mean all mankind despots emperors kings princes nobles presidents senators representatives lawyers divines physicians merchants farmers shopkeepers mechanics tradesmen day laborers tavern haunters dramshop frequenters mob rabble and canaille that is to say all human kind—have you not observed that all these feel more respect more real respect for birth than even for wealth may i not say than for genius fame talents or power though they follow and hosanna for the loaves and fishes you will often hear them say proud as he is i knew his father who was only a blacksmith his grandfather who was only a carpenter or his great grandfather who was only a shoemaker he need not be so topping    has not the experience of six thousand years shown that the common people submit more easily and quietly to birth than to wealth genius fame or any other talents whence the prejudices against upstarts parvenus c whence the general respect reverence and submission in all ages and nations of plebeians to patricians of sieurs to monsieurs of juffrouws to mevrouws if a man of high birth is promoted little or nothing  0  is said by the plebeians if one of their own level the son of a tradesman or common farmer is advanced all the envy and bile of his equals is excited he is abused and belittled if not reviled by all his former equals as they thought themselves whatever may have been the superiority of his genius education services experience or other talents there is nothing mr taylor to which the vulgar in general so quietly and patiently and cordially submit as to birth    what in all ages has been the source of the submission of nobility to royalty every nobleman envies his sovereign and would pull him down if he could get into his throne and wear his crown but when nobles and ignobles have torn one another to pieces for years or ages in their eternal squabbles of jealousy envy rivalry hatred and revenge and all are convinced that this anarchy will not do that the world will be depopulated that a head must be set up and all the members must be guided by it then and not till then will nobles submit to kings as of superior birth what subjects all the nobility of europe to all the kings of europe but birth though some of them cannot well make out their pretensions particularly the proudest of them all—the house of austria    what has excited a universal insurrection of all europe against bonaparte if we dive to the bottom of this awful gulf and recollect the succession of coalitions against him and against republican france but because he was obscuro loco natus the son of a simple gentillâtre of corsica    such and so universal are the manifest distinctions of birth in every village and every city so tremendous are their effects on nations and governments that one might almost pronounce them selfevident i may justly be ridiculed for laboring to demonstrate in re non dubià testibus non necessariis can you discern no good in this eternal ordinance of nature the varieties of birth if you cannot as the facts are indisputable you must assert that so far as you can see the world is ill made and that the whole of mankind are miscreants for there are no two of them born alike in any thing but divine right and moral liberty    please to remember that birth confers no right on one more than another but birth naturally and unavoidably produces more influence in society in some more than in others  0  and the superiority of influence in society in some more than in others and the superiority of influence is aristocracy    when birth genius beauty strength wealth education fame services heroism experience unite in an individual they produce inequality of influence that is aristocracy with a witness so that one can chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight in any political conflict and without any hereditary descent or any artificial marks titles or decorations whatever john adams john taylor xxvi in page  0 you say mr adams has omitted a cause of aristocracy in the quotation which he forgets not to urge in other places namely—exclusive wealth this is your omission sir not mine in page  0  vol i  i expressly enumerated inequality of wealth as one of the causes of aristocracy and as having a natural and inevitable influence in society i said nothing about exclusive wealth the word exclusive is an interpolation of your own this you acknowledge to be by much the most formidable with which mankind have to contend that is as i understand you superior wealth is the most formidable cause of aristocracy or of superior influence in society there may be some difficulty in determining the question whether distinctions of birth or distinctions of property have the greatest influence in the world both have very great influence much too great when not restrained by something besides the passions or the consciences of the possessors were i required to give an answer to the question my answer would be with some diffidence that in my opinion taking into consideration history and experience birth has had and still has most power and the greatest effects because conspicuous birth is hereditary it is derived from ancestors descends to posterity and is inalienable titles and ribbons and stars and garters and crosses and legal establishments are by no means essential or necessary to the preservation of it the evidences of it are in history and records and in the memories and hearts they remain and it never fails to descend to posterity as long as that  0  posterity furnishes any one or more whose talents and virtues can support the reputation of the name birth and wealth are commonly so entangled together from an emperor down to a constable or tithingman that it is difficult to separate them so distinctly as to place one in one scale and the other in an opposite scale to ascertain in grains and scruples the preponderance the complaint of theognis that pelf is sometimes preferred to blood was and is true and it is also true that beauty wit art disposition and winning ways are more successful than descent yet in general i believe this prevails oftener than any of the others i may be mistaken in this opinion but of this i am certain that it always has the same weight when it is at all considered you must recur mr taylor to platos republic and the french republic destroy all marriages introduce a perfect community of women render it impossible to know or suspect or conjecture ones own father or mother son or daughter brother or sister uncle or aunt before you can annihilate all distinctions of birth i conclude therefore that birth has naturally and necessarily and unavoidably some influence more or less in human society will you say it has none i have a right sir to an answer to this question yea or nay you have summoned me before the world and posterity in my last hours by your voluminous criticisms and ratiocinations which gives me a right to demand fair play on my part i promise to answer any question you can state by an affirmative negative or doubt without equivocation property wealth riches although you allow them to be a cause of aristocracy in your tenth page yet you will not permit this cause to be ascribed to nature but why not if as i have heard the shortest road to mens hearts is down their throats this is surely a natural route hunger and thirst are natural wants and the supplies of them are natural nature has settled the point that wood and stones shall not invigorate and enliven them like wine suppose one of your southern gentlemen to have only one hundred thousand acres of land he settles one thousand tenants with families upon it if he is a humane easy generous landlord will not his tenants feel an attachment to him will he not have influence among them will they not naturally think and vote as he votes if on the contrary he is an austere griping racking rackrenting tyrant will not his tenants be afraid to offend him  0  will not some if not all of them pretend to think with him and vote as he would have them upon the same principle as some nations have worshipped the devil because they knew not into whose hands they might fall now sir my argument is this if either the generous landlord or the selfish landlord can obtain by gratitude or fear only one vote more than his own from his tenants in general he is an aristocrat whether his vote and those of his dependents be beneficial or maleficial salutary or pestilential or fatal to the community i remember the time mr taylor when one thousand families depended on mr hancock for their daily bread perhaps more all men allowed him to be punctual humane generous how many of the heads of these families would naturally be inclined to vote with and for mr hancock could not mr hancock command or at least influence one vote besides his own if he could he was an aristocrat according to my definition and conscientious opinion let me appeal now to your own experience are there not in your own caroline county in virginia two or three or four five or six eight or ten great planters who if united can carry any point in your elections these are every one of them aristocrats and you who are the first of them are the most eminent aristocrat of them all john adams john taylor xxvii give me leave to add a few words on this topic i remember the time when three gentlemen—thomas hancock charles apthorp and thomas green the three most opulent merchants in boston all honorable virtuous and humane men—if united could have carried any election almost unanimously in the town of boston harrington whom i read forty or fifty years ago and shall quote from memory being too old to hunt for books and fumble over the leaves of folios has been called the newton in politics and is supposed to have made a great discovery namely—that mankind are governed by the teeth and that dominion is founded on property in land mr locke and the french economists countenance this opinion landed gentlemen are generally not only aristocrats but tories what but commerce  0  manufactures navigation and naval power supported by a moneyed interest restrains them from establishing aristocracies or oligarchies as absolute arbitrary oppressive and cruel as any monarchy ever was what has annihilated the astonishing commerce and naval power of holland but the influence of the landed gentlemen in the inland provinces overbearing and outvoting the maritime provinces what is it that prevents france from reducing and restraining if not annihilating the commerce manufactures and naval power of great britain but the landed gentry—the proprietors of lands in france who never would suffer commerce manufactures or naval power to grow in that kingdom who would never permit colbert or necker to hold power or even enjoy popularity but with the moneyed interest yet these gentlemen could never be satisfied with the number of soldiers and land armies no expense no exertion to increase the number of officers and soldiers in the army could be too much what has prevented our beloved country to the astonishment of all europe from having at this hour a naval force amply sufficient to burn sink or destroy or bring captive into our harbors all the men of war that britain has sent or can send to our coasts but the landed gentlemen the great and little planters the yeomen and farmers of the united states such it was in the beginning is now and i fear ever will be world without end all these considerations prove the mighty influence of property in human affairs they prove the influence of birth too for landed property is hereditary generally all over the world truth mr taylor cannot be ridiculed into error aristophanes could laugh socrates out of his life but not out of his merit or his fame you seem to admit that aristocracy is created by wealth but you seem to think it is artificially not naturally so created but if superior genius birth strength and activity naturally obtain superior wealth and if superior wealth has naturally influence in society where is the impropriety in calling the influence of wealth natural i am not however bigoted to the epithet natural and you may substitute the epithet actual in the place of it if you think it worth while alienation you say is the remedy for an aristocracy founded on landed wealth but alienation only transfers the  0  aristocracy from one hand to another the aristocracy remains the same if brutus transfers to cassius a villa or a principality purchased by the unrighteous profits of usury cassius becomes as influential an aristocrat as brutus was before if john randolph should manumit one of his negroes and alienate to him his plantation that negro would become as great an aristocrat as john randolph and the negro john randolph brutus and cassius were and are and would be aristocrats of a scarlet color and a crimson dye if they could alienation therefore is no remedy against an aristocracy founded on landed wealth you say sir that inhibitions upon monopoly and incorporation are remedies for aristocracy founded on paper wealth here sir once for all let me say that you can write nothing too severe for me against paper wealth you may say if you please as swift says of party that it is the madness of the many for the profit of the few you may call a swindler a pickpocket a pirate a thief or a robber and i will not contradict you nor dispute with you but sir how will you obtain your inhibitions upon monopoly and incorporation when the few are craving and the many mad for the same thing when democrats and aristocrats all unite with perhaps only two or three exceptions in urging these monopolies and incorporations to the last extremity and when every man who opposes them is sure to be ruined paper wealth has been a source of aristocracy in this country as well as landed wealth with a vengeance witness the immense fortunes made per saltum by aristocratical speculations both in land and paper in human affairs sir we must consider what is practicable as well as what is theoretical but sir land and paper are not the only sources of aristocracy there are master shipwrights housewrights masons c c who have each of them from twenty to a hundred families in their employment and can carry a posse to the polls when they will these are not only aristocrats but a species of feudal barons what are demagogues and popular orators but aristocrats john cade and wat tyler were aristocrats callender and paine were aristocrats shays and fries were aristocrats mobs never follow any but aristocrats  0  john adams john taylor xxviii knowledge you say invented alienation and became the natural enemy of aristocracy this invention of knowledge was not very profound or ingenious there are hundreds in the patent office more brilliant the right power and authority of alienation are essential to property if i own a snuffbox i can burn it in the fire cast it in a salt pond crush it in atoms under a wagon wheel or make a present of it to you—which last alienation i should prefer to all the others—or i could sell it to a peddler or give it to a beggar but in either case of gift or sale would the aristocratical power of the snuffbox be lessened by alienation should a palatinate of poland or a prince of russia alienate his palatinate or his principality with all the serfs attached to them would not the buyer derive all the aristocratical influence from the purchase which the latter alienated by the sale should a planter in virginia sell his clarissimum et illustrissimum et celeberrimum locum with his thousand negroes to a merchant would not the merchant gain the aristocratical influence which the planter lost by his transfer run down sir through all the ranks of society or if you are shocked at the word rank say all the classes degrees the ladder the theatrical benches of society from the first planter and the first merchant to the hog driver the whiskey dramseller or the scottish peddler and consider whether the alienation of lands wharves stores houses funded stock bank stock bridge stock canal stock turnpike stock or even lottery tickets does not transfer the aristocracy as well as the property when the thirsty soul of a hundred acre man carries him to the whiskey shop till he has mortgaged all his acres has he not transferred his aristocracy with them i hope these hints sir have convinced you that alienation is not an adequate remedy against the aristocracy of property inhibitions upon monopoly and incorporation you say are remedies for an aristocracy founded on paper wealth and are such inhibitions your only hope against such an aristocracy have those principles of government which we have discovered and those institutions which we have invented which have established a moral liberty undiscovered and universal uninvented   0 by all nations before us inhibited monopolies and incorporations is not every bank a monopoly are there not more banks in the united states than ever before existed in any nation under heaven are not these banks established by law upon a more aristocratical principle than any others under the sun are there not more legal corporations—literary scientifical sacerdotal medical academical scholastic mercantile manufactural marine insurance fire bridge canal turnpike c c c—than are to be found in any known country of the whole world political conventions caucuses and washington benevolent societies biblical societies and missionary societies may be added—and are not all these nurseries of aristocracy if alienations and inhibitions fail us where shall we look next for a remedy against aristocracy shall we have recourse as you have done page   to the art of printing but this has not destroyed property or aristocracy or corporations or paper wealth in europe or america or diminished the influence of either on the contrary it has multiplied aristocracy and diminished democracy i pray you not to think this a paradox you may hereafter be convinced that it is a serious a solemn and melancholy truth admit that the press transferred the pontificate of rome to henry viii and to all the subsequent kings of england even if you will down to his present royal highness the prince regent admit that the press demolished in some sort the feudal system and set the serfs and villains free admit that the press demolished the monasteries nunneries and religious houses into whose hands did all these alienated baronies monasteries and religious houses and lands fall into the hands of the democracy into the hands of serfs and villains serfs and villains were the only real democracy in those times no they fell into the hands of other aristocrats and there remain to this day notwithstanding all the innumerable alienations and transfers from aristocrat to aristocrat to this hour admit sir that the press produced the reformation as well as the dissolution of the feudal system and the tenures in mortmain what was the consequence two hundred years at least of thefts larcenies burglaries robberies murders assassinations such as no period of human history had before exhibited the civil wars in england the massacres in ireland the civil wars in france and the     massacre of saint bartholomews day all proceed from the same source and so did the late french revolution and the consequences are not ended and cannot yet be foreseen the real democracy of mankind has found very little alteration for the better or the worse through all these changes the serfs of the barons or the church lands lived as well and were as humanely treated as the manufacturers or laborers are in england france germany or spain at this day these are the real democracy of every nation and every age these who have either no vote at all or at best but one vote are the most numerous class in every society property in land they have none property in goods besides their clothes they have very little when the national convention in france voted all the negroes in st domingo martinique guadaloupe st lucia c free at a breath did the poor democracy among the negroes gain any thing by the change did they not immediately fall into the power of aristocrats of their own color are they more free from toussaint to petion and christophe do they live better bananas and water they still enjoy and a whole regiment would follow a leader who should hold a saltfish to their noses john adams john taylor xxix suppose congress should at one vote or by one act declare all the negroes in the united states free in imitation of that great authority the french sovereign legislature what would follow would the democracy nine in ten among the negroes be gainers would not the most shiftless among them be in danger of perishing for want would not nine in ten perhaps ninetynine in a hundred of the rest petition their old aristocratical masters to receive them again to protect them to feed them to clothe them and to lodge and shelter them as usual would not some of the most thinking and philosophical among the aristocratical negroes ramble into distant states seeking a poor and precarious subsistence by daily labor would not some of the most enterprising aristocrats allure a few followers into the wilderness and become squatters or perhaps incorporate with indians would not others who have the courage of crimes—le courage du crime—as     well as of enterprise collect little parties of followers hide themselves in caves behind rocks and mountains in deep forests or thick and boggy swamps and commit inroads depredations and brigandages as the villains did in europe for ages after the dissolution of fiefs and monasteries will the poor simple democratical part of the people gain any happiness by such a rash revolution i hope sir that all these considerations will convince you—   that property has been is and everlastingly will be a natural and unavoidable cause of aristocracy and that god almighty has made it such by the constitution of human nature and the globe the land the sea the air the water and the fire among which he has placed it   that the advice which was given to me by a good deacon in a quotation from an ancient divine in the spring of      after i was chosen to go to congress—in all cases of difficulty and danger when you know not what to do be very careful that you do not do you know not what—was good advice you and i have had to see the rise and progress perfection decline and termination of hot rash blind headlong furious efforts to ameliorate the condition of society to establish liberty equality fraternity and the rights of man and in what have they ended festina lente sobrius esto property makes a permanent distinction between aristocrats and democrats there are many more persons in the world who have no property than there are who have any and therefore the democracy is and will be more numerous than the aristocracy but we must remember that the art of printing to which you appeal to level aristocracy is almost entirely in the hands of the aristocracy you resort to the press for the protection of democracy and the suppression of aristocracy this sir in my humble opinion is committere agnum lupo it is to commit the lamb to the kind guardianship and protection of the wolf a hungry wolf a starving wolf emperors and kings and princes know the power of the press at least as well perhaps better than you and i do it is known to nobles and aristocrats of all shades colors and denominations much better than to democrats it is known to domestic ministers and to foreign ambassadors quite as well as to duane benjamin austin or john randolph oxenstiern bid his son go among the ambassadors     and ministers of state to see by what sort of men this world is governed that sensible man might as sensibly have recommended to his son to go among the booksellers the hireling scribblers printers and printers devils he might have more easily found how this lower world is governed half the expense would have let him into the secret the gazettes the journals the newspapers and fugitive pamphlets govern mankind at this day and have governed at least since the art of printing has become universal or even general and what governors are these here mr taylor give me leave to relate an anecdote which upon honor and if you doubt i will attest upon oath there were times when i had the honor to be in high favor with the count de vergennes and to enjoy his confidence i had found means to convey into english newspapers paragraphs and little essays which he knew could come only from me at his office one morning upon some particular business with him he received me alone and walked with me backwards and forwards in the most familiar conversation mr adams said the count the gazettes the journals govern the world it is necessary that we should attend to them in all parts and in england and i should be glad to communicate with you on this plan you cannot conceive the impression these few words made upon me i was dumb but i said in my heart monsieur le comte your spies have informed you that i daily read the foreign gazettes and that i have communicated some trifles in england and i doubt not you know my channels of conveyance the truth was i daily read the foreign gazettes from holland germany england and daily saw the hand of the count de vergennes and his office of interpreters of three hundred clerks as i was told skilled in the languages of all nations i give you but a sketch or rather a hint of what would require volumes to explain at large and i give you this hint merely to convince you that ministers of state know the press as well as john randolph or any other democrat aristocrat or mongrel     john adams john taylor xxx you remember i have reserved a right of employing twenty years to answer your book because you consumed that number in writing it i have now written you thirty letters and have not advanced beyond a dozen pages of your work at this rate i must ask your indulgence for forty or fifty years more you know that your amusement and my own are the principal objects that i have in view my last was upon the power of the press and the influence of the art of printing and i endeavored to convince you that the great cause of democracy would not be exclusively promoted by that noble invention it is certain that property is aristocracy and that property commands the press think of this sir the types the machinery the office the apprentices the journeymen require a capital and that capital is aristocracy it does not appear that democracy has ever distinguished itself more than aristocracy in zeal or exertion for the promotion of science literature the fine arts or mechanic arts not even the art of printing in ancient days when all learning was in manuscript it required a fortune to procure a small library books were in the hands of the rich the roman knights with their gold rings might have some knowledge but the plebeians had none but such as they acquired from the actors on their theatres and their popular orators in town meetings all of whom were as proudly and vainly aristocratic and nearly as flashy and as superficial as your baron of roanoke will you call terence and epictetus and other greek slaves or the wandering sophists the græci esurientes rambling about the world like strolling players to beg or earn a pitiful subsistence democrats will you quote the rambling french dancingmasters drawingmasters fencingmasters and grammarians as democrats have democrats been the promoters of science arts and literature the aristocrat monarchist or tyrant pisistratus his sons c who assembled all the learned men of greece to form a system of religion and government by the compilation of homer were not democrats alexander and pericles themistocles and the ptolemies were not democrats augustus nor scipio nor lælius were democrats the medici who raised popes     emperors queens and kings by the machinery of banks were not democrats elizabeth anne louis xiv charles i george iii catherine were not democrats you may call napoleon a democrat if you will these have been the great encouragers of arts and sciences and literature but perhaps sir i have rambled a little from the point the question then is concerning the influence of the art of printing in diminishing aristocracy and protecting encouraging supporting increasing and multiplying democracy this subject will require volumes my great misfortune through a pretty long life has been that i have never had time to make my poor productions shorter and i am more embarrassed now than ever for i have neither eyes nor fingers nor clerks nor secretaries nor aidsdecamp nor amanuenses any more than time at my command to abridge and condense or arrange and methodize any thing correction revision—nonumque prematur in annum—have all been forbidden fruit to me has the art of printing increased democracy it has humiliated kings it has humiliated popes it has demolished in some degree feudality and chivalry it has promoted commerce and manufactures agreed if you will and sing io triumphe if you will but is democracy increased or bettered remember always as we go along that by democrats i mean exclusively those who are simple units who have but one vote in society how shall we decide this question have these simple units acquired property have they acquired knowledge do they live better are they become more temperate more industrious more frugal more considerate run over all europe and see in france    00000 who can neither read nor write in england protestant as it is not much less in proportion nor in holland nor germany nor russia nor italy nor the peninsula of spain and portugal knowledge in france i may acknowledge has been more spread and divided among the aristocracy of five hundred thousand aristocrats but the democratical twentyfour million five hundred thousand have gained nothing bread and water oatmeal and potatoes are still their rations the benevolence of henry iv and all his successors have never procured so much as a chicken in the pot once a week for the poor democrats depend upon it unless you give a share in the sovereignty to the democrats the     more you increase knowledge in the nation the more you will grind and gripe the democrats till you reduce them to the calculations concerning west india negroes scottish and english coalheavers dutch turflifters and the streetwalking girls of the night in paris and london for knowledge will forever be monopolized by the aristocracy the moment you give knowledge to a democrat you make him an aristocrat if you give more than a share in the sovereignty to the democrats that is if you give them the command or preponderance in the sovereignty that is the legislature they will vote all property out of the hands of you aristocrats and if they let you escape with your lives it will be more humanity consideration and generosity than any triumphant democracy ever displayed since the creation and what will follow the aristocracy among the democrats will take your places and treat their fellows as severely and sternly as you have treated them for every democracy and portion of democracy has an aristocracy in it as distinct as that of rome france or england john adams john taylor xxxi that the first want of man is his dinner and the second his girl were truths well known to every democrat and aristocrat long before the great philosopher malthus arose to think he enlightened the world by the discovery it has been equally well known that the second want is frequently so impetuous as to make men and women forget the first and rush into rash marriages leaving both the first and second wants their own as well as those of their children and grandchildren to the chapter of accidents the most religious very often leave the consideration of these wants to him who supplies the young ravens when they cry the natural necessary and unavoidable consequence of all this is that the multiplication of the population so far transcends the multiplication of the means of subsistence that the constant labor of nine tenths of our species will forever be necessary to prevent all of them from starving with hunger cold and pestilence make all men newtons or if you will jeffersons or taylors or randolphs and they would all perish in a heap     knowledge therefore sir can never be equally divided among mankind any more than property real or personal any more than wives or women   in pride in reasoning pride our error lies   all quit their sphere and rush into the skies   pride still is aiming at the blest abodes   men would be angels angels would be gods   aspiring to be gods if angels fell   aspiring to be angels men rebel the modern improvers of society—ameliorators of the condition of mankind instructors of the human species—have assumed too much they have not only condemned all the philosophy and policy of all ages of men but they have undertaken to build a new universe to ameliorate the system of eternal wisdom and benevolence i wish sir that you would agree with me and my and i hope your friends pope and horace   this vault of air this congregated ball   selfcentred sun and stars that rise and fall   there are my friend whose philosophic eyes   look through and trust the ruler with his skies   hunc solem et stellas et decedentia certis   tempora momentis sunt qui formidine nullâ   imbuti spectent turn our thoughts in the next place to the characters of learned men the priesthood have in all ancient nations nearly monopolized learning read over again all the accounts we have of hindoos chaldeans persians greeks romans celts teutons we shall find that priests had all the knowledge and really governed all mankind examine mahometanism trace christianity from its first promulgation knowledge has been almost exclusively confined to the clergy and even since the reformation when or where has existed a protestant or dissenting sect who would tolerate a free inquiry the blackest billingsgate the most ungentlemanly insolence the most yahooish brutality is patiently endured countenanced propagated and applauded but touch a solemn truth in collision with a dogma of a sect though capable of the clearest proof and you will soon find you have disturbed a nest and the hornets will swarm about your legs and hands and fly into your face and eyes     when we are weary of looking at religion we will if you please turn our eyes to government is there toleration in politics where shall we find it if not in virginia the honorable john randolph informs us that in consequence of the independence of his soul he is on bad terms with the world that his nerves are of too weak a fibre to bear the questions ordinary and extraordinary from our political inquisitors talks of the rancorous hatred of the numerous enemies he has made in his course and says that the avenue to the public ear is shut against him in virginia where the press is under a virtual imprimatur and where it would be easier to force into circulation the treasurers notes than opinions militating against the administration through the press if these things are so in virginia sir where callender was applauded nourished cherished and paid where the great historian wood who wrote and printed the elegant and classical history of the administration of john adams was kindly received and employed and where the sedition act the gag law was so unpopular where can we look with any prospect or hope of finding a candid freedom of the press the truth is party opinions interests passions and prejudices may be as decisive an imprimatur as that of a monarch and the public opinion which is not always right until it is too late is sometimes as arbitrary a prohibition as an index expurgatorius i hope it will be no offence to say that public opinion is often formed upon imperfect partial and false information from the press public information cannot keep pace with facts knowledge cannot always accompany events how many days intervene between a victory or a defeat and the universal knowledge of it how long do we wait for the result of a negotiation how many erroneous public opinions are formed in the intervals how long is a law enacted before the proclamation of it can reach the extremities of the nation john adams john taylor xxxii a few words more concerning the characters of literary men what sort of men have had the conduct of the presses in the united states for the last thirty years in germany in england in france in holland the presses even the newspapers     have been under the direction of learned men how has it been in america how many presses how many newspapers have been directed by vagabonds fugitives from a bailiff a pillory or a halter in europe you know it is one of the sublimest and profoundest discoveries of the eighteenth century that knowledge is corruption that arts sciences and taste have deformed the beauty and destroyed the felicity of human nature which appears only in perfection in the savage state—the children of nature one writer gravely tells us that the first man who fenced a tobacco yard and said this is mine ought instantly to have been put to death another as solemnly says the first man who pronounced the word dieu ought to have been despatched on the spot yet these are advocates of toleration and enemies of the inquisition  i never had enough of the ethereal spirit to rise to these heights my humble opinion is that knowledge upon the whole promotes virtue and happiness i therefore hope that you and all other gentlemen of property education and reputation will exert your utmost influence in establishing schools colleges academies and universities and employ every means and opportunity to spread information even to the lowest dregs of the people if any such there are even among your own domestics and john randolphs serfs i fear not the propagation and dissemination of knowledge the conditions of humanity will be improved and ameliorated by its expansion and diffusion in every direction may every human being—man woman and child—be as well informed as possible but after all did you ever see a rose without a briar a convenience without an inconvenience a good without an evil in this mingled world knowledge is applied to bad purposes as well as to good ones knaves and hypocrites can acquire it as well as honest candid and sincere men it is employed as an engine and a vehicle to propagate error and falsehood treason and vice as well as truth honor virtue and patriotism it composes and pronounces both panegyrics and philippics with exquisite art to confound all distinctions in society between right and wrong and if i admit as i do that truth generally   0 prevails and virtue is or will be triumphant in the end you must allow that honesty has a hard struggle and must prevail by many a wellfought and fortunate battle and after all must often look to another world for justice if not for pardon there is no necessary connection between knowledge and virtue simple intelligence has no association with morality what connection is there between the mechanism of a clock or watch and the feeling of moral good and evil right or wrong a faculty or a quality of distinguishing between moral good and evil as well as physical happiness and misery that is pleasure and pain or in other words a conscience—an old word almost out of fashion—is essential to morality now how far does simple theoretical knowledge quicken or sharpen conscience la harpe in some part of his great work his course of literature has given us an account of a tribe of learned men and elegant writers who kept a kind of office in paris for selling at all prices down to three livres essays or paragraphs upon any subject good or evil for or against any party any cause or any person one of the most conspicuous and popular booksellers in england both with the courtiers and the citizens who employed many printers and supported many writers has said to me the men of learning in this country are stark mad there are in this city a hundred men gentlemen of liberal education men of science classical scholars fine writers whom i can hire at any time at a guinea a day to write for me for or against any man any party or any cause can we wonder then at any thing we read in british journals magazines newspapers or reviews where are and where have been the greatest masses of science of literature or of taste shall we look for them in the church or the state in the universities or the academies among greek or roman philosophers hindoos brahmins chinese mandarins chaldean magi british druids indian prophets or christian monks has it not been the invariable maxim of them all to deceive the people by any lies however gross bonus populus vult decipi ergo decipiatur and after all that can be done to disseminate knowledge you never can equalize it the number of laborers must and will forever be so much more multitudinous than that of the students that there will always be giants as well as pygmies the     former of which will have more influence than the latter man for man and head for head and therefore the former will be aristocrats and the latter democrats if not jacobins or sans culottes these morsels and a million others analogous to them which will easily occur to you if you will be pleased to give them a careful mastication and rumination must i think convince you that no practicable or possible advancement of learning can ever equalize knowledge among men to such a degree that some will not have more influence in society than others and consequently that some will always be aristocrats and others democrats you may read the history of all the universities academies monasteries of the world and see whether learning extinguishes human passions or corrects human vices you will find in them as many parties and factions as much jealousy and envy hatred and malice revenge and intrigue as you will in any legislative assembly or executive council the most ignorant city or village are not the men of letters—philosophers divines physicians lawyers orators and poets—all over the world at perpetual strife with one another knowledge therefore as well as genius strength activity industry beauty and twenty other things will forever be a natural cause of aristocracy         review of the propositions for amending the constitution submitted by mr hillhouse to the senate of the united states in   0  j a         review among the manuscripts of mr adams was found the following review of a pamphlet published in   0  entitled propositions for amending the constitution of the united states submitted by mr hillhouse to the senate on the twelfth day of april   0  with his explanatory remarks it seems to have been prepared for publication though no trace of it has been found in print for the better understanding of the strictures it is necessary to give in the first place the amendments as they were proposed by mr hillhouse article the first after the

senate or of the senate and house of representatives shall be necessary to a removal the president during the recess of congress may suspend the officer and make a temporary appointment of a person to exercise the office until the next meeting of congress and until a decision can be had by the senate or by the senate and house of representatives as the case may be on a question for the removal of the officer suspended all proceedings respecting removal from office shall be had without debate upon the information and reasons which shall be communicated by the president and with closed doors these radical propositions coming as they did from a leading member of the party originally formed for the purpose of sustaining the federal constitution and supported by him in an elaborate speech were well calculated to fix the attention of mr adams it is not unlikely that he gave to the plan more importance as a political movement than it merited for it does not appear to have been followed up either by the originator or any one else this may be the reason why the review was never published the general argument is however of a permanent nature and deserves to be placed among the memorials of the author when a speech or a pamphlet appears in public from the press the most rational course would be to read it and judge of its merits without prejudice but republican jealousy is so much the spirit of the times that the first question is who is the author of what party is he what are his motives and whose election is he aiming to promote this inquisitive temper has been sufficiently alive concerning the publication of mr hillhouse some have conjectured that his design was to throw the nation into confusion in hopes that a better order than prevails at present might arise out of it others have suggested that this work is a burlesque on the crude projects of amendment which appear in such numbers one set of men have suspected that this gentleman has been so long in public     business and has been so much disappointed becoming yearly of less and less influence and at present finding himself in a minority consisting at most of three or four in the senate that he is grown impatient and determined at any rate to make himself a name and increase his importance i shall leave these uncandid insinuations to those who delight in them and take it for granted that mr hillhouse is sincere that he honestly believes what he says and proposes his amendments for the public good it shall be my endeavor to be as concise as possible in a few observations which i hope may show in a clear light the merit of his work in pages five and six mr hillhouse defines his terms—monarchy aristocracy and democracy federalists and republicans i shall make no objection to any thing here but his idea of aristocracy but before i come to that i must take notice of what he says at the bottom of page six some of the important features of our constitution were borrowed from a model which did not very well suit our condition i mean the constitution and government of england—a mixed monarchy—in which monarchy aristocracy and democracy are so combined as to form a check on each other one important and indispensable requisite of such a government is that the first two branches should be hereditary would it not have been more conformable to the fact to have said that those important features of our constitution were borrowed from our colonial constitutions every colony on the continent except pennsylvania had a governor a council or senate and a house of representatives the governors were not hereditary the counsellors were not hereditary some of the governors were chosen by the people and so were some of the councils some were appointed by the king but commonly changed upon an average of less than seven years there is little difference between our present governments and those under which our ancestors emigrated lived and after having founded a respectable and flourishing nation died excepting that their governors were appointed from abroad and our presidents and governors are chosen by ourselves i am sorry to add that we show the executives of our own choice and own blood infinitely less respect than our ancestors did those who were foreigners and appointed by a king governments therefore     may be mixed and compounded of monarchical aristocratical and democratical ingredients without one particle of hereditary power or privilege in them except the common privileges of the people such as their hereditary lands goods and liberties say if you will that in such an empire as the british it is necessary that the executive and senate should be hereditary because elections to these powers would totally corrupt the nation produce a civil war and raise a military despotism at the first trial but in an experiment of twenty years we have not yet found such dangers among us mr hillhouse further observes that to form an aristocracy hereditary succession is indispensable but mr hillhouse is mistaken holland was an aristocracy but the burgomasters pensionaries counsellors and schepens in whom the sovereignty resided were not hereditary there is a small number of nobles in the legislature of each state but this body has but one vote every city has an equal vote with the whole body of nobles and in critical times they have no influence bern was an aristocracy but the members of the grand council were not hereditary but elective there were six noble families but they had no prerogatives but mere precedency and these were not counsellors unless elected into a legislature of two hundred and ninetynine members—counsellors and assessors in short hereditary powers and peculiar privileges enter in no degree into the definition of aristocracy there may be an aristocracy for life or for years or for half a year or a month or a day infinite art and chicanery have been employed in this country to deceive the people in their understanding of this term aristocracy as well as of that of wellborn as if aristocracy could not exist without hereditary power and exclusive privileges and as if a man could not be wellborn without being a hereditary nobleman and a peer of the realm chancellor livingston inherited a name numerous and wealthy family connections and a fine manor these are all hereditary privileges and have given him more influence in this country than all the titles and immense landed estates of the duke of norfolk with all the hereditary rank and seat in the house of lords have given him in england mr john randolph inherited his name family connections his fine plantations and thousand negroes which have given him more power in this   0 country than the duke of bedford has in england and more than he would have if he possessed all the brilliant wit fine imagination and flowing eloquence of that celebrated virginian were not then mr livingston and mr randolph wellborn the state of connecticut has always been governed by an aristocracy more decisively than the empire of great britain is half a dozen or at most a dozen families have controlled that country when a colony as well as since it has been a state an aristocracy can govern the elections of the people without hereditary legal dignities privileges and powers better than with them in the massachusetts many of our prime quality were banished in the revolution most of our present rulers are new men but these have been promoted by an aristocracy mr hillhouse says the united states do not possess the materials for forming an aristocracy but we do possess one material which actually constitutes an aristocracy that governs the nation that material is wealth talents birth virtues services sacrifices are of little consideration with us the greatest talents the highest virtues the most important services are thrown aside as useless unless they are supported by riches or parties and the object of both parties is chiefly wealth when the rich observe a young man and see he has talents to serve their party they court and employ him but if he deviates from their line let him have a care he will soon be discarded in the roman history we see a constant struggle between the rich and the poor from romulus to cæsar the great division was not so much between patricians and plebeians as between debtor and creditor speculation and usury kept the state in perpetual broils the patricians usurped the lands and the plebeians demanded agrarian laws the patricians lent money at exorbitant interest and the plebeians were sometimes unable and always unwilling to pay it these were the causes of dividing the people into two parties as distinct and jealous and almost as hostile to each other as two nations let mr hillhouse say whether we have not two parties in this country springing from the same sources whether a spirit for speculation in land has not always existed in this country from the days of william penn and even long before whether this spirit has not become a rage from georgia to new hampshire     within the last thirty years whether foundations have not been laid for immense fortunes in a few families for their posterity whether the variations of a fluctuating medium and an unsteady public faith have not raised vast fortunes in personal property in banks in commerce in roads bridges c whether there are not distinctions arising from corporations and societies of all kinds even those of religion science and literature and whether the professions of law physic and divinity are not distinctions whether all these are not materials for forming an aristocracy whether they do not in fact constitute an aristocracy that governs the country on the other side the common people by which appellation i designate the farmers tradesmen and laborers many of the smaller merchants and shopkeepers and even the unfortunate and necessitous who are obliged to fly into the wilderness for a subsistence and all the debtors cannot see these inequalities without grief and jealousy and resentment a farmer or a tradesman who cannot by his utmost industry and frugality in a life of seventy years do more than support a moderate family and lay up four or five thousand dollars must think it very hard when he sees these vast fortunes made per saltum these mushrooms growing up in a night and they throw themselves naturally into the arms of a party whose professed object is to oppose the other party two such parties therefore always will exist as they always have existed in all nations especially in such as have property and most of all in commercial countries each of these parties must be represented in the legislature and the two must be checks on each other but without a mediator between them they will oppose each other in all things and go to war till one subjugates the other the executive authority is the only mediator that can maintain peace between them mr hillhouse thinks we have not the means of making an aristocratical branch to our government i think we have the means and that we have in fact an aristocratical branch to our government and that is the senate and a very useful honorable and necessary branch it is but it would be more useful and more safe if every particle of executive power was taken away from it there are materials in great plenty out of which to form this aristocratical branch mercuries ought not indeed to     be sculptured out of every kind of wood but there are gentlemen of fortune talents experience and integrity in every state out of whom the legislatures may select the most eminent and so they might if the number of senators were doubled as i wish it was and hope it will be these would compose an aristocratical branch as respectable as any in the world our senate for twenty years has been very well chosen and has abounded with able and excellent men how mr hillhouse can be at a loss for means of making an aristocratical branch i know not our senators are not hereditary nor have they any exclusive privileges nor are these necessary so long as we have not a hereditary executive nor is a hereditary executive necessary so long as we have not a hereditary senate when one is so the other must be or it will be no check it is to no purpose to declaim against demagogues there are as many and as dangerous aristocratical demagogues as there are democratical neither party will get any thing by such invectives sylla and pompey were as arrant aristocratical demagogues as marius and cæsar or even catiline were democratical ones sylla was more cruel than marius and pompey had less humanity than cæsar even cicero and brutus the honestest men in rome were but aristocratical demagogues and milo was as much an agitator for the patricians as clodius for the plebeians and hamilton was as much a demagogue as burr an independent executive to mediate between the two parties was wanting and this defect was the ruin of the roman republic and will be ours if mr hillhouses motion prevails when mr hillhouse declares that when a citizen claims to be an exclusive patriot and is very officious in proclaiming his own merit it is time for the people to be alarmed i agree with him but i must add when a senator declaims against executive influence under our constitution it is time for the people to be upon their guard against an aristocratical spirit and preponderance further mr hillhouse says there is always such a spirit of jealousy existing between aristocracy and democracy and between monarchy and democracy they cannot long exist together without a third balancing power mr hillhouse should have added an equal jealousy between aristocracy and monarchy and then i should have agreed with him but this last jealousy     it was not convenient for mr h to acknowledge he says as well might a man take up his abode in a tigers den as aristocracy with democracy unless protected by the strong arm of monarchy and i say as well might a man take up his abode with shadrach meshech and abednego in the fiery furnace as democracy with aristocracy without the strong arm of monarchy to protect it witness the thirty tyrants of athens and the decemvirs at rome and every other instance since the creation in which democracy has been in the power of aristocracy i say further that as well might a man take up his abode with daniel in the lions den as monarchy with aristocracy without the million arms of democracy to defend it all these jealousies exist in some degree but the greatest jealousy of all is that of aristocracy against monarchy aristocracy is the natural enemy of monarchy and monarchy and democracy are the natural allies against it and they have always felt the necessity of uniting against it sooner or later hence the ultimate destruction of all republics the aristocracy would not suffer the executive to have power to defend the constitution to defend itself or to defend the people the aristocracy has oppressed the people and the executive till the people out of all patience have given the aristocracy and themselves too a master as to surrounding the throne by a powerful aristocracy they have always proved to be prætorian guards and cut off the head of their general when the discipline of the laws has by any calamity been weakened it is true when the people have been seditious and rebellious against them their property privileges and distinctions they have united with the executive to defend themselves like fire they are good servants but allconsuming masters little need be said on shortening the period of the elections of the two houses this instead of diminishing the spirit of party will only increase and inflame it there will be no time for it to cool the causes of the two parties i have already shown to be permanent and unchangeable both must be represented in the legislature and there must be a mediator between them in the executive this mediator must have power for the purpose he must calm and restrain the ardor of both and be more impartial between them than any president ever     yet has been  and the senators themselves must not constrain him to be partial as they so often have done their power to do so instead of being increased as mr hillhouse proposes ought to be wholly taken from them they ought to have nothing to do with executive power if mr hillhouse however should carry this point and the people instead of being glutted and satiated with elections should wish to double the number i hope he will introduce that admirable aristocratical invention of connecticut—a nomination list—that every thing may not depend upon the election fever—the ictus febrilis of one election day the sixth article of mr hillhouses amendments reduces the presidents office to that of a mere doge of venice a mere head of wood a mere tool of the aristocracy of the country he is to be appointed by chance from the most aristocratic branch—the senate although the senators in general have been respectable men and some of them illustrious for virtues talents experience and services yet it must be confessed that there have been very weak men in that body these will have as good a chance as the best a blount or a burr as good a chance as an ellsworth or a strong or a richard henry lee but this is of less importance than the proposal to submit all nominations and removals to the senate and house of representatives there never was and never can be a project more perfectly aristocratical than this mr hillhouse informs us that man is fond of power true but is not man in the shape of a senator or a representative as fond of power as a president mr h also admonishes us that ambition and favoritism and he should have added avarice jealousy envy hatred love and lust are evils to be guarded against in a republican government true again but are not ambition and favoritism and all other vicious passions and sinister interests as strong and active in a senator or a representative as in a president cannot indeed the members of the legislature conceal their private views and improper motives more easily than a president every senator and every representative     has in his own district friends and favorites to whose esteem affection activity and influence he has been indebted for his election is it not natural that his mutual esteem affection and gratitude to these friends should excite him to exert himself in obtaining favors offices and employments for them mr hillhouse probably knows that great pains have sometimes been taken by senators and representatives too to obtain nominations to offices sometimes for themselves and sometimes for their favorites sometimes with success and sometimes without again has mr hillhouse never known combinations and consultations between general officers heads of department leading members of the senate and house of representatives i will not say to overawe but to influence the president in favor of some appointments and against others has he never known such combinations resisted and nominations made in opposition to them all i say such instances have been and such nominations have proved the most fortunate important and successful of any that were ever made under the constitution has mr hillhouse never known combinations and committees of senators sent to the president to remonstrate privately against nominations and when they could not prevail have they not obtained majorities in senate to negative such nominations mr hillhouse has known favoritisms and antifavoritisms enough in both houses i should think to be convinced that favoritism would be increased by his project at least one hundred and fiftyfold let us now consider how mr hillhouses project would operate the president sends a nomination to the senate probably the person named has been selected by the president out of twenty candidates who have been previously recommended to him by some senator and some representative nineteen senators are of course disappointed because their favorites have been set aside these nineteen will then combine together to negative the present nomination in hopes that their favorites will have a better chance at the next time there is to be no debate how is this possible members are to give information and information may be sent in from abroad by petition or remonstrance vices follies crimes incapacity may be alleged and contradicted how can these questions be determined     but by witnesses and how can false witnesses be counteracted but by confrontation and after all the favorite member of the senate by intrigue artifice or eloquence out of doors will carry his candidate after this it must go down to the house of representatives and what will happen there the member who has previously recommended him to the president will rise and give him a character twenty other members perhaps a hundred who have recommended another man or other men will be disappointed sins and crimes and disqualifications may be alleged against the nomination the subject will be postponed for days or weeks in the mean time caucuses will be held of evenings combinations will be formed and the favorite members of the house will carry their favorites but removals from office too must be laid before both houses the mischiefs and inconveniences of this would be greater if possible than of the other the officers of the army navy and revenue are necessarily numerous complaints and accusations often occur these must be laid before congress witnesses must be summoned examined and crossexamined counsel would be humbly requested it would be inhumanity to refuse it parties cabals and caucuses would be formed and corruption introduced in a thousand shapes those who had favorites gaping for the place would be tempted too slightly to vote for removal and those who had no such favorites to gratify would be too tender the year would be too short for both houses to go through with all these appointments and removals again how is military discipline to be maintained in your army and navy how is the subordination of the military to the civil power to be supported give your general an estate for life in his office defeasible only on the vote of the two houses and he will soon be master of your president he will soon have ten times as much influence in the nation to illustrate this subject still further recollect the instances already recorded in the case of blount a conspiracy was fully proved—to dismember the empire and carry off an immense portion of it to a foreign dominion yet how much time was consumed and how much debate excited before that important subject could be decided and the accused person with all his guilt upon his head was finally suffered to escape with     impunity in the case of judge pickering—although his incapacity to discharge the functions of his office was indisputable and although incapacity and nonuser are a legal forfeiture of a judicial office yet it is well remembered how much time was necessarily employed in the investigation of the law and the evidence and how much the house and the senate were divided in opinions on the final decision in the case of judge chase—the time the expense and the public anxiety of his impeachment and trial are well known and how much exertion of the ablest and best men in the legislature as well as of the counsel were requisite to save a great and upright judge from unmerited ignominy disgrace and ruin in the more recent case of mr john smith of ohio—what a vast expense of time and money and travel what numbers of witnesses what intricate questions of law as well as collisions of testimony occurred and how critical was the final determination upon his innocence in the case of general wilkinson—the complication of law and facts the length of time through the whole of which his conduct is to be examined the number of witnesses the various parts of the union from whence they must be collected the conflicts of parties the great legal and political questions which arise and the vast importance to the public as well as the individual are all to be taken into consideration the time already passed in this inquiry is very great and how much longer it will continue to irritate and inflame the public and divide the nation no man can conjecture the case of colonel burr is the most remarkable of all if this was to be tried first in the senate and then in the house of representatives when would it have an end and who can pretend to divine what would be the decision now every customhouse officer every judge and every marshal every attorneygeneral and districtattorney every secretary of state treasury war or navy and every officer of the army or navy every postmaster general or particular would have as fair a right to a public and impartial trial as a judge of the supreme court upon an impeachment in trials at law the jurors cannot be solicited but the solicitations of members of congress from culprits and their friends would be infinite and where guilt or innocence is to be determined by a single vote in one hundred and fifty as would often happen if a corrupt     member could be found a bribe would not seldom be offered especially in cases where foreign interests and intrigues could intervene this is the system mr hillhouse would introduce it may without scruple be pronounced though mr hillhouse certainly did not see it in that light the most corrupt project that ever was conceived by a man of sense and virtue the endless confusion and distraction that would arise from it would be as certain as its injustice inhumanity and corruption the appointment and removal of ambassadors and foreign ministers and consuls as well as judges and general officers and admirals would take the whole year and convulse the continent take away from the president the nominations to those offices and give it to every member of the senate and house and how many nominations would there be to every vacancy the disputes would be endless between the north and the south the east and the west one state would have more than its proportion and others less the question would be more concerning the abode of the candidate and less concerning the talents qualifications and merits than ever it has been yet and it has already and always been more so than it ought to have been for the public good the members of the house of representatives are so numerous and often so young and inexperienced that they must vote for men nine times in ten of whom they know nothing not even by common fame and as often will be incompetent to judge of the appropriate qualifications for the office the old congress was a small body of men in comparison of the present two branches and their deliberations were always in secret yet if there is anybody living who was present and knew the contests on the appointments of general officers and foreign ministers let him recollect the disputes about dr franklin silas deane and arthur and william lee mr izard mr williams mr morris commodore jones captain landais and lieutenant simpson general lincoln general arnold general wooster commodore hopkins and many others nay even concerning general washington general ward general lee general schuyler and general gates c and he must remember that congress was torn to pieces by these disputes and that days and months and years were wasted in such controversies to the inexpressible injury of the service     to these causes are to be attributed the wants of the army the distresses of general washington the loss of canada after we had conquered all but quebec the loss of the penobscot enterprise and almost all the disasters of the war the complaints against general officers the financier and his agents and especially against foreign ministers were as perpetual and endless as the debates in congress not to say intrigues to the delay and neglect of the most essential measures for the support and supply of the army and navy no the real fault is that the president has not influence enough and is not independent enough parties will not allow him to act himself for twelve years one party prevailed and that party would not allow their presidents to be impartial the other party has now prevailed eight years and they have not permitted their president in many instances to act his own judgment the power of removal was never abused in the first twelve years except perhaps in two instances and those removals were made at the earnest and repeated solicitations of all the members of the house and one of the members of the senate from new hampshire much against the inclination of the president representations of misconduct in office were made to the president and probably credited by those members of congress but there is now reason to suspect that they were dictated by too much of a party spirit in short presidents must break asunder their leading strings and the people must support them in it they must unite the two parties instead of inflaming their divisions they must look out for merit wherever they can find it and talent and integrity must be a recommendation to office wherever they are seen though differing in sentiments from the president and in an opposite party to that whose little predominance brought him into power people of the united states—you know not half the solicitude of your presidents for your happiness and welfare nor a hundredth part of the obstructions and embarrassments they endure from intrigues of individuals of both parties you must support them in their independence and turn a deaf ear to all the false charges against them but if you suffer them to be overawed and shackled in the exercise of their constitutional powers either by aristocratical or democratical manœuvres you   0 will soon repent of it in bitter anguish anarchy and civil war cannot be far off whereas by a steady support of the independence of the presidents office your liberties and happiness will be safe in defiance of all foreign influence french or english and of all popular commotion and aristocratical intrigue the proposal of diminishing the presidents salary to fifteen thousand dollars is so mean a thought that it scarcely deserves to be mentioned if the present compensation is too high for seven or eight millions of industrious people possessing a very fertile and productive agricultural country and the second commerce in the universe to support a president who represents their majesty and must support their dignity in the eyes of all nations and people let it be diminished by an amendment of the constitution as it is without making the president a mere painted head of a ship made of wood and incapable of being helmsman or pilot in several passages mr hillhouse is very anxious and with great reason about party spirit he calls it a demon and a fiend by a figure which is natural enough for indeed it is   a monster of so frightful mien   as to be hated needs but to be seen but how shall this monster be chained how shall this foul fiend be exorcised sermons orations speeches pamphlets odes hymns and heroic poems have been long enough tried to no purpose homer milton and spenser whose immortal poems were all written expressly to show the dreadful effects of party spirit and discord among aristocratic chiefs and the passions of envy jealousy ambition and revenge from whence they sprung have been as little heeded as mr hillhouse and his humble reviewer will be it is a devil i believe that will not be cast out even by fasting and prayer it was turned out of paradise with the first pair immediately made a division in their family and produced a duel or an assassination between their first two sons from that family it has descended through all successive generations to the present most enlightened and virtuous age and still produces assassinations and duels as frequently as ever it inhabits all climes and is found under all forms of government it prevails in turkey and persia morocco and tripoli as well as in france and england and in every     tribe of savages in africa and america as well as among the most enlightened people on earth there never existed three men together two of whom did not love one another better than either of them loved the third and better than the third loved either of the other two if this fact be indubitable as i believe it is it will necessarily follow that three men never lived together without a party spirit among them in despotisms and simple monarchies it is well known by what means the monster is quelled but in limited monarchies and free republics the conquest is attended with more difficulty if mr hillhouse will run over in his thoughts all his researches into history and the science of government he will oblige the public by pointing out one instance in which party spirit has been confined within any bounds compatible with public good and national happiness but by a counterpoise of interests passions and parties party spirit confounds the distinctions between truth and falsehood right and wrong and it corrupts the moral sense there can be therefore no ultimate remedy in any moral principle or political maxim against its final and fatal excesses nothing but power lodged somewhere in impartial hands can ever moderate soften or control it when mr hillhouse says that state or local parties will have but a feeble influence on the general government i cannot comprehend him will not a state party avail itself of the influence of the general government to increase its own influence at home and to diminish that of its rival will not a local party request mr pickering mr hillhouse and mr ely to write public and private letters to stimulate their own friends and disgrace their antagonists and will not the opposite party avail themselves of even a letter from a man of no party whose conscience is not yet seared with the red hot iron of faction to support itself if it can will not both parties cut off at a blow at present and after some time perhaps by a proscription or a guillotine or a banishment to cayenne or to botany bay every man who dares to vote or speak or write from his conscience and his honor curse ye meroz curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof because they came not up to the help of the lord to the help of the lord against the mighty is the language of all parties and when it is infallibly known to be the cause of the lord it is just but when it is the cause of     mere faction the language should be changed to cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel the time is well remembered when mr madison mr giles and several other members of congress finding themselves unable to elevate their party in the great council of the nation resigned their seats and became members of their state legislatures in order to revolutionize the primary assemblies influence the elections to the general government and overawe the national measures mr hillhouse no doubt remembered the great efforts and among many others the representations and legislative pamphlets against the alien law and sedition law he must clearly see and readily acknowledge that his amendments will be no remedy against such party spirit and party contrivances senators and representatives of the national government and ministers of state too will continue to resign in order to increase their fame to be made governors at home and promote the views of their party and on the other hand governors c of states will resign to be made senators vicepresidents secretaries of state judges and presidents as long as the state governments retain their sovereignty that is their legislatures or in other words as long as the national government is in any sense a federative republic mutual sympathies or mutual antipathies will subsist between them and the national government and there can never exist the smallest spirit of party in one without producing a similar spirit of party in the other that there are regular organized parties extending from the northern to the southern extremity and from the atlantic to the western limits of the united states is very true and it is equally certain that there ever have been such and that there ever will be such unless you lay an embargo on all printing presses private letters private clubs and on all travelling from one state to another a standing army of a hundred thousand infantry and another hundred thousand cavalry and twenty thousand gunboats will not effect it caucuses of patricians and caucuses of plebeians always prevailed in rome and in all other free countries our revolution was effected by caucuses the federal constitution was formed by caucuses and the federal administrations for twenty years have been supported or subverted by caucuses there is little more of the     kind now than there was twenty years ago alexander hamilton was the greatest organist that ever played upon this instrument he made all the use he could of these bodies of cincinnati and others to prevent mr adams from being chosen vicepresident the reason of his antipathy i know not for he had never seen him he caused it to be propagated in the northern states that virginia would not vote for washington and in the southern states that new england would not vote for washington or at least that their votes would not be unanimous at the same time that there was a great probability there would be a unanimous vote for adams that therefore the electors must throw away so many of their votes that adams could not have a majority and consequently could not be president if he believed one word of the apprehensions he propagated it is very unaccountable for there was a very great certainty in the public opinion that washington would have a unanimous vote  at the second election he was pleased to permit mr adams to have a considerable majority as vicepresident  at the third election he intrigued with all his might to get major thomas pinckney chosen president he dared not attempt to exclude mr adams because he knew that such a project would defeat his plan but his scheme was to get a vote or two more for pinckney than for adams or at least an equal number for each in hopes that his intrigues in the house might prevail to have pinckney preferred to adams  at the fourth election his caucuses were more bold open and decided not only a caucus of members of congress was     assembled at philadelphia to exclude mr jefferson and turn him out but to bring in general pinckney with an equal vote with mr adams this was given out as a point determined and the whole continent pledged to it upon their sacred honor in the mean time hamilton prepared his famous pamphlet intending to keep it secret till the election was passed and then put it into the hands of the members of the house to decide the election there in favor of pinckney besides all this a caucus of the cincinnati was called at new york in which he was chosen president of that society but it was determined to sacrifice adams and even the two clergymen president dwight and dr hitchcock were found explicit in the pious opinion of sacrificing adams not satisfied with all this he made a journey through new england to boston and to providence in prosecution of this patriotic design in boston i doubt not he found some as patriotic as himself in rhode island he was less successful he labored with governor fenner to no purpose fenner would not sacrifice adams  the opposite party had their caucuses too and burr made as many journeys and reasoned to greater effect than hamilton the republican party had a caucus in boston in      and wrote to mr jefferson upon his resignation of the office of secretary of state that if he would place himself at their head they would choose him at the next election and they organized their party by their correspondences through the states this detail sufficiently shows that caucuses have been from the beginning there is no doubt some regard to public good in the prosecution of these measures they are considered as necessary there is also ambition avarice envy jealousy and revenge as these causes good and bad have hitherto produced such combinations and as these causes will continue to the end of the world we may presume the combinations will continue too they have been perhaps too openly avowed and published in too dictatorial a style but they will continue with more or less reserve you cannot prevent them any more than you can prevent gentlemen from conversing at their lodgings     the question now is whether mr hillhouses amendments of the constitution will remedy or qualify the evil i think not on the contrary they will aggravate the distemper and make it mortal as the government vibrates at present between parties about once in twelve years if you make the elections annual there will be a chance of its vibrating every year and you will have no stability in government at all if that prince of the power of the air that fiend party spirit can now invade every sphere if that demon can pass the bounds of every state will he be   hurld headlong flaming from the ethereal sky   to bottomless perdition there to dwell   in adamantine chains when elections become annual will hamilton be prohibited from visiting boston and rhode island and burr from travelling in new jersey and pennsylvania the communication by letters in the post offices and by private hands will be as easy as ever and mercenary emissaries from the british and french courts may write speak and hold caucuses as well as federalists and republicans when elections are annual as well as at this time when they are for two years for six years and for four years the monster who now fremit ore cruento but cannot gorge himself more than once in six years will then have his appetite increased by being annually feasted he will then be monthly and daily employed all the year round in sowing discord and divisions destroying social harmony overturning the most valuable institutions and endangering the liberties of our country it is true that parties have commenced in this country but that they are progressing with more gigantic strides than usual i know not at every election of representatives senators and presidents they have appeared and the nation was as much divided in           and      as it is now it was united in nothing but in the choice of washington when mr benson moved that the blank in the bill directing what officer should hold the office of president in case of the death of the president and vicepresident should be filled with the chief justice meaning mr jay mr madison instantly moved that it should be filled with the secretary of state meaning mr jefferson so     fierce a spirit of party between the friends of the two rivals appeared all at once that neither side had the courage to engage in the debate the blank was never filled and the bill was dropped and both parties have ever had a successor in view from that time to this notwithstanding all the ardor of popular affection for washington and the great i will not say unlimited confidence in him congress and the nation were more divided during the eight years of his administration than they ever have been since the senate in constitutional questions and subjects of foreign relations were in most instances divided half and half the federal majority in the house of representatives was very small during the administration of his immediate successor the federalists had a majority of two thirds in the senate and a larger majority in the house than at any period of the first eight years this appearance of strength made them or at least their great leader hamilton presumptuous and proved their ruin during the whole administration of mr jefferson the nation has been more united and the majorities in both houses have been uniformly much greater than under either of his predecessors how then can it be said that parties are progressing with gigantic strides it should rather seem that the nation is advancing towards greater unanimity the next election however of president will show whether party spirit or unanimity is increasing the belligerent powers have indeed driven us by their intemperate measures into circumstances of danger and distress which have increased the anxiety of all men of all parties but it does not yet appear that the parties are more dangerous or alarming than they have been a little time may decide but however this may be the question still remains whether mr hillhouses amendment will quell one monster or propagate more and fiercer mr h is for cutting off the head of the demon i think he will find it the head of a hydra and that a hundred heads will sprout from the blood of the one exscinded without a head no dangerous party can be formed no such party can exist says mr h indeed is it so perhaps it is but parties will find heads enough an oligarchy of heads an aristocracy of heads a democracy of heads for the deepest democracies always have heads one would think that the ancient experiment of cutting off the heads of the tallest     poppies had been tried often enough go into your field and strike off the heads of all the tallest and when you have gone over the whole turn round and survey the whole ground you will find as many taller than others as ever and you must cut off every plant but one before you can say there is no poppy taller than another one would think that the recent example of france could not be so soon forgotten mirabeau marat brissot danton robespierre were all heads cut off in succession and all succeeding heads were saved only by having recourse to one head and one arm in the emperor napoleon the common sense and common feeling of mankind operated in france after beholding the horrible massacres of aristocracy and democracy as they have done in all other nations where these frantic parties have not been balanced if you cut off one head three other heads at least will spring up in its stead the aristocratical party will have one head the democratic party another and the quids a third but the last will always be a small feeble and insignificant party they will be men of candor impartiality and equity who will have no view but the public good and this party has unhappily in all times been very small and feeble in comparison with the other two parties that i may be more clearly understood—the federal party will have their head their leader their aristocracy and democracy the republican party will have their head and leader their aristocracy and democracy the quids will probably be too feeble and timid finding themselves unsupported by either of the other great parties and discountenanced by both to fix upon any head but if they should ever become a numerous party as has seldom if ever happened they must have a head an aristocracy and democracy too for no party ever can exist without these three divisions we will suppose then mr hillhouses amendment adopted the divisions of rich and poor debtor and creditor will still continue and produce a federal and a republican party in every state all appointments to office and removals from it will be in the senate and house of the united states these two parties then in every state will live in a constant struggle which shall send the representatives to the senate and house of the united states and each will strive to send its head that he may have the greatest influence in determining national measures     and especially in appointing officers and bestowing favors to favorites the senate and house of the united states will thus be divided into federal and republican parties as much as they are now and as all offices will be in their gift their whole time will be consumed in eternal intrigues and furious conflicts for the loaves and fishes each party will have its head in each house and even the quids once in an age may have their leader too mr hillhouse will find two or three heads in the senate as many in the house and thus have six heads to cut off after he has cut off one and then he will instantly find six more shoot up in their stead in the persons next esteemed in their respective parties the caucuses in each state and correspondences between different states will not be lessened there will still be central committees and committees of correspondence from the north to the south and from the east to the west so long as education talents property or even beauty stature or color shall make inequalities among mankind there will be an aristocratical and a democratical party in every country especially in opulent commercial countries mr hillhouses amendment instead of diminishing will increase them instead of moderating will inflame them instead of reducing them to order will throw them into greater confusion exasperate their passions and multiply their intrigues without end for example—an eminent judge or a learned lawyer in connecticut or massachusetts or any other state may wish to be a judge or a chief justice of the united states or his friends and admirers may desire to promote him if he is of the federal party the leading members of the senate and house of the united states will be solicited by letters throughout the union to exert their influence to obtain his election if he is of the republican party the heads of that party in congress will be instigated in the same manner to obtain his election and there will be always a federal judge and a republican judge and perhaps such a pair in every state contending intriguing and lying perhaps in the newspapers and how shall congress judge if federalism has a majority in the senate and house a federalist will be chosen if republicanism predominates a republican will undoubtedly be elected but what if republicanism should prevail in the house and federalism in the senate     a case that may often happen what is to be done then why no appointment can be made again—a gentleman of talents education fortune family aspires to visit foreign countries in the capacity of an ambassador he will certainly have one name or another he must be either federalist republican or quid if the first he will have all the federalists in his state for him if the second all the republicans if the third he must stay at home at his farm merchandise or books central committees and organized correspondences will be at work in recommending him to their respective parties through the union when the choice comes before congress perhaps a candidate or two of each party in each state will be nominated and after weeks of debate in public and intrigues and caucuses in private an ambassador may be chosen unless either house should be equally divided as they were between jefferson and burr and then no ambassador can be sent though peace or war may depend upon the mission but in every case the ambassador will be of the party that outnumbers the other in congress but of all party contentions the choice of a commanderinchief of the army will be the sharpest because a commanderinchief of the army in time of war will be a more popular and powerful man than a president is now what will become of your comebychance president if he presumes to dispute any point with your general who has ten thousand officers and twenty thousand soldiers under him drawn from all parts attached to his person and trumpeting his fame through the union and all espousing his opinions and reputation against the president when such an office is to be filled all the militia officers all the old soldiers all the societies of the cincinnati will be set in motion and for what i know all the religious sects—the catholics the protestant episcopalians the anabaptists the presbyterian assemblies and conventions and even the quaker meetings—may interest themselves in the choice and after all it must be a federalist or a republican who will carry the day as one party will always rather lean to france and the other to england foreign emissaries will certainly not be idle and if a hand can be found to receive a bribe we certainly know that both courts are in the habit of employing money in other countries   0 we might go through the list of all offices under the general government

nobility without honors without merit to open for him a way to the monarchy claudius indeed and cassius had their souls elevated to ambition by their consulships and decemvirates by the honors of their ancestors and the splendor of their families is there an old maiden aunt eleanor of seventy years of age in any family whose brain is more replete with the haughty ideas of blood than that of the magnanimous cincinnatus appears in this speech riches are held in vast contempt the equestrian order is no honor nor nobility that too is held in sovereign disdain beneficence and charity in a most exalted degree at a time when his brother aristocrats were griping the people to death by the most cruel severities and the most sordid and avaricious usury were no merit in mælius but consulships decemvirates honors and the splendor of family have his most profound admiration and veneration every circumstance of this appears in this speech and such was the real character of the man and whoever celebrates or commemorates cincinnatus as a patron of liberty either knows not his character or understands not the nature of liberty this judgment passed upon cincinnatus is entirely confirmed by niebuhr as follows— it is obvious that cincinnatus has undeservedly been deified by posterity in the time of the decemvirs and tyrants he did nothing and twenty years after this occurrence he acted completely in the interest of a faction and shed the innocent blood of mælius lectures on the history of rome edited by dr l schmitz vol i p     † livii hist lib iv cc      it is a melancholy reflection that a man like cincinnatus a hoary veteran now at the goal of a virtuous and illustrious life should have lent himself as is probable to the commission of a murder in the service of a faction yet such we must deem to have been his conduct nowhere have characters been more cruel nowhere has the voice of conscience against the views of faction been so defied and yet consistently with great virtues as in aristocratic republics and not those of antiquity only men otherwise of spotless conduct have frequently shed the purest and noblest blood influenced by fanaticism and often without any resentment in the service of party the seditious demagogue was often less sanguinary but usually if he murdered he was less purely a fanatic than the former because he acted more for his own and less for the interests of his order yet the former were only the nobler beasts of prey niebuhr roman history translated by f a walter vol ii p       this seems to be a

was something unheard of with the exception of p valerius poplicola no one had been so often invested with the consulship the manner in which cassius concluded his treaties affords proof of a great soul it is therefore very possible that he had the purest intentions of wisdom and justice a great man unquestionably he was whether he was guilty or not guilty and the faction which condemned him was

sold in a single year has been many times republished in the original and has been repeatedly translated into french spanish and english the french translation in the library of mr adams which judging from numerous marginal notes he seems to have used in composing these discourses was made by the abbé mallet and printed in three volumes quarto in      nominally at amsterdam but really at paris an english translation by w aylesbury esq printed in folio and published in london in the year      is also in his library but it does not seem to have been much consulted davila is a courtly and catholic historian but lord bolingbroke in his fifth letter on the study of history recommends him very strongly as a writer equal in many respects to livy a recommendation which would have more

wealth nor birth nor dignities nor merit nor all of these together it is not surprising then that it should have been once more completely wiped out of existence by the revolution of      never having enjoyed much of the national respect its fall excited little observation and few regrets yet the brief experience already had of the constitution of      once more attempted to be founded upon that notion of m turgot all his life combated by mr adams of a simple government organized in a single legislative chamber and an executive head again illustrates the everreviving nature of the difficulties growing out of unbalanced systems the statesmen of france have not yet ventured to claim durability for any form of government that has thus far been adopted after their favorite theory of simplicity and unity and centralization  upon franklins authority the french adopted their government in one assembly † the reign of the men of blood soon followed the writing of this and produced

some observations on this subject have been already made in a note to volume iv of this work pp          for a confirmation of this view look back to page     of this volume in the discourses on davila written at the same time with these letters also to page   0 in the first letter to roger sherman   m de tocqueville has taken a similar view of the presidents powers— le président des étatsunis possède des prérogatives presque royales dont il na pas loccasion de se servir et les droits dont jusquà présent il peut user sont très circonscrits les lois lui permettent dêtre fort les circonstances le maintiennent foible de la démocratie en amérique vol i chap     thus far this has not been found so difficult as was here predicted but it must be admitted that the occasions in which the negative has been exercised were not of a kind in which the popular passions are greatly excited   this seems to be an imperfect sentence the sense is explained at the close of the letter   a singular prediction of what actually happened afterwards to himself   this seems but a superficial view at best the negative of the crown has gone out of use because the custom has grown up of conceding the control of the administrative power to the majority which controls the legislature so long as this construction shall prevail there can never be a serious collision but in america there is no such connection between the executive and the legislative departments as to render harmony certain or even likely always to happen the negative therefore seems an indispensable instrument of selfprotection in cases of conflict practically however the qualified negative of the president has thus far proved equivalent to an absolute veto      april the anniversary of the action at lexington

elevation and see in the other all his enemies   you know the constitution has not provided the means of distinguishing in certain cases and it would be disagreeable even to have a man treading close upon the person we wish as president may not the malignity of the opposition be in some instances exhibited even against him of all this we shall best judge when we know who are our electors and we
