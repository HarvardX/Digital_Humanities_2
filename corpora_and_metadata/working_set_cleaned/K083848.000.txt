rebellion extinguished a thanksgivingsermon preached at barton underneewood in the county of stafford october the  th       on account of the deliverance of these kingdoms from the calamities of an intestine war  by thomas vaughan a m vicar of eccles in lancashire  the king shall rejoice in thy strength o lord exceeding glad shall he be of thy salvation psalm xxi   london printed for the author and are to be sold by william sandby at the ship opposite to st dunstans church in fleetstreet       price sixpence  to the right honorable earl gower viscount trentham and lord privy seal etc the following discourse is most humbly dedicated by his lordships most dutiful most obedient and much obliged humble servant  thomas vaughan    samuel xii    only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he has done for you if all the affairs of this lower world were either whirled about by the giddiness of chance or entirely governed by the sullenness of fate it would strike a damp upon all our spirits and this world to all rational beings that can fear and estimate all future contingencies would be a most gloomy and melancholy place  and if all the wonderful and surprising revolutions in this life depended upon the policy and wisdom of those that are the agents in bringing mighty things to pass since the greatest weights many times are supported by the most slender wires and success in all extraordinary undertakings depends upon the happy concurrences of innumerable acdidents upon favorable seasons and a thousand circumstances as various and uncertain as the weather the nicest politicians would be lost and disappointed and they in the psalmists phrase would reel to and fro and be at their wits end  but how wise soever vain men would be this world is no more governed than it was created by chance and he that made it is only able to govern it we are neither under the power of chance nor determined by positive and inexorable fate we do not depend upon politic institutions but are now assembled to give glory unto the great god who rules the armies of heaven and the inhabitants of the lower regions whose power is infinite and whose mercy is over all his works who is the hope of all that dwell on the earth and of them that remain in the broad sea ps lxv   the lord is king the earth may be glad thereof yea the multitude of the isles may be glad thereof ps xcvii   we will rejoice in thy salvation and triumph in the name of the lord our god we will offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving and tell out his works with gladness ps cvii    and no nation under heaven had ever more reason to do so than we have upon this present solemnity  and the signal instances of gods providence are so illustriously visible that we cannot but with the deepest gratitude adore him that sits above the water floods and remains a king for ever ps xxix   oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and declare the wonders that he does for the children of men ps cvii     in order to this i would earnestly recommend the advice of samuel a wise an experienced a faithful governor who scorned to be bribed or to raise his fortunes upon the ruins of the people who abhorred all artifices to enrich himself and solemnly appeals to all the people as witnesses of his integrity here i am produce your evidences i offer myself to a public trial before the lord and before his anointed ver   whose ox have i taken or whose ass have i taken or whom have i defrauded whom have i oppressed or at whose hand have i received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith and i will restore it you and he received this public testimony thou have not defrauded us neither have thou taken ought of any mans hand and they ratify the sentence the lord is witness  this admirable person who had long governed them with such courage and fidelity that the worst of his enemies could in no case charge him with maladministration yet all his merits were ungratefully slighted and the people that never want occasion to pick quarrels with their governor whilst they acquit the judge yet murmur at his age for that had disabled him to travel his usual circuits and they charged his sons for perverting judgment and he must resign the government to please the people but these high provocations had no ill effect upon him oh the vast difference betwixt those that have no aims but the public good and those that have private interests of their own to serve he cheerfully resigns it but with unparalleled condescending goodness after he showed them that he was still the favorite of heaven how ungratefully soever they used him upon earth at his powerful prayers god terrified them with thunder and softened them with rain and prepared them for the most concerning advice  notwithstanding the highest ingratitude and barbarity to his person and family the brave aged judge thus addresses himself to all the people as for me god forbid that i should sin against the lord in ceasing to pray for you ver     all the injuries that they had done him could not raise the least thought of revenge he would not offend almighty god by any thing that looked like resentment let them despise his council if they pleased yet he who was very well acquainted with what would most contribute to a national prosperity after he had excellently reasoned before the lord of the righteous acts that he did to them and to their fathers leaves this advice with them only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all your hearts for consider how great things he has done for you  permit me therefore to reflect upon these several parts which are expressed in the text  first the great things god has done for us secondly the duty of considering how great they are thirdly the obligation that lies upon us to fear and serve him in truth with all our hearts that has wrought such wonderful works should i look back to former generations and peruse the histories of our church and nation both the one and the other have subsisted by miracles and the indications of god almightys goodness have been writ in the brightest and the clearest characters writ as it were with a sunbeam with equal perspicuity and certainty that we have not been left to guesses and conjectures but we might upon sure grounds take up the expressions of the royal prophet ps xxxi    thou have o god showed us mavelous kindness in a strong city in thy holy church and that church may apply those words to itself the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my shield the horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge my savior every thing that can imply security and protection ps xviii    for first if this be a character of the divine aid that god lets things come to the utmost extremity before he makes bare his arm and so the psalmist in a very pathetical but unusual address seems instead of petitioning to dictate and prescribe thou shall arise and have mercy upon sion for why the time is come to favor her yea the set time is come and why thy servants think upon her stones and it pities them to see her in the dust ps cii        and if it be a very good reason why god should then appear that they may know that this is thy hand and thou lord have done it i need not look abroad for foreign instances since we have so many flagrant ones at home  we cannot forget how miserably we were distressed on every side without were fightings and within were fears we all lay trembling under ambiguous expectations impatiently waiting the event of the enemies attack by sea or land and when vast armies were ready to invade us and our never enough to be lamented divisions gave force and spirit to their enterprises all their sanguine hopes were wonderfully disappointed by him that has the secret springs of nature in his hands and can turn and manage them as he pleases the winds kept the formidable navies in their harbors and they could not move without his permission whom the winds and the sea obey  secondly it is another evident character of god almightys appearing for a nation when several events that are managed by different persons and in different places do happily conspire to complete a national joy  when the illustrious young hero duke william generalissimo of his majestys forces in northbritain had spent the season of the year so far that he had been fatigued with long marches and the people were faint and weary that then he should have the courage to attempt and be successful in so difficult an enterprise as to storm strong garrisons and take fortified towns and slay and take prisoners at the battle of straghallenmoor near cullodenhouse above three thousand rebels and six hundred prisoners and put the rest to flight when the rebels were superior in number to us was a grateful surprise to all that heard it blessed be the lord who did not give us as a prey unto their teeth this is the lords doings and it is mavelous in our eyes for which we will rejoice and give thanks and we cannot but break out in the famous epinikion of the celebrated deborah judges v    so let all thy enemies perish o lord but let them that love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might  what an amazing though joyful sight must it be to the kings army to see the robust highland rebels those gygantick sons of anach fall before the british fire like sturdy oaks reft before a sheet of irresistible lightening thanks be to god who has given us the victory over the enemies of his true religion established amongst us enemies whose wicked designs were to set up superstition and popery idolatry and arbitrary power in its stead for they intended mischief against thee and imagined such a device as they were not able to perform therefore did thou put them to flight and the strings of thy bow have thou made ready against them be thou exalted lord in thy own strength so will we sing and praise thy power ps xxi          but as if europe was not a theater wide enough for the english triumphs they are extended to the remotest regions capebreton in north america has seen and felt the the english courage and those vessels of the french which were looked on as invincible have been taken  thirdly another character of god almightys appearing for a people is when some of the nimrods some of the successful troublers of the world that come up to the prophet isaiahs elegant description chap xiv    thou said in thy heart i will ascend into heaven and i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high that resolve to extend their empires and aim at universal monarchy by fraud and violence by blood and rapine that are swelled with panegyricks and flattered by devices whilst they are compared to the vast luminaries of heaven and are told that they can no more be interrupted in their victories and triumphs than the course of the sun can be arrested when such a prince as this feels the weight of that omnipotence which he has defied when his powerful navies are disabled and his treasures exhausted and he restrained from his bloody persecutions it is natural to apply in the prophets words how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer sun of the morning is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof for if the lord of hosts do purpose who shall disannul it and if his hand be stretched out who shall turn it back isa xiv        so that if the seasonableness of events when things are almost at a crisis if the concurrence of various prosperous events in distant places and countries and nations and the preservation of persons of that figure and eminency that the success does depend very much upon them as the proper instruments to procure it if the stemming the impetuous torrent and putting a check to the overflowing of ungodliness rebellion and oppression and reducing these extravagant and exorbitant plunderers and rebels if these be employments worthy of providence not unto us o lord not unto us but to thy great name be ascribed the glory and praise psalm cxv   we have reason to conclude that god has done great things for us which was the first part i proposed to speak to  i now proceed to the second  the duty of considering how great they are  how great are the calamities we are freed from how great is the happiness that we enjoy both the one and the other require our calm and serious reflections as we would escape the prophet isaiahs severe but just reproof isa v    the harp and the viol the tabret and the pipe and wine are in their feasts but they regard not the work of the lord neither consider the operations of his hands  is it nothing in our eyes that god has showed a more distinguishing care of us than of any nation in the whole world besides that he has so frequently interposed and snatched us from between the very teeth and jaws of the destroyer  i need not lead you into ancient history i must prescribe some limits for i would not launch into a sea of matter  be pleased to consider how lamentable our case had been if the united powers of france and spain had as much disabled our naval forces as we have done theirs since the war first broke out had their success been equal to ours how miserable beyond expression had our condition been a powerful navy are the best walls that can encompass an island it is an illustrious and a terrible defense it is our glory at home it is our honor and security abroad it looks in our channel like a lovely valley of tall cedars it has a sweet and awful and majestic presence  and if this which god of his infinite mercy forbid should ever be destroyed how wretched how contemptible how weak how poor and inconsiderable a nation should we be how would our neighboring kingdoms clap their hands and hiss at us how should we become a byword and a proverb of reproach to all that are round about us  is it nothing to us that our restless our powerful our implacable enemies have not yet been able to extirpate the northern heresy as they style it that is the protestant religion neither by open violence nor insidious and treacherous attempts that with all their art they have not been able to root up our foundations and introduce superstition and idolatry and destroy the products of the blessed reformation which consists in rejecting what for many years had been superadded to the christian religion and received its glorious finishing from an immortal queen whose memory grows every year more illustrious and whose name at so great a distance is poured out like precious ointment and sheds a refreshing fragrancy upon all the people  is it nothing that our civil rights are inviolably secured that we enjoy the fruit of our ancestors labors and the effects of our own industry that our admirable constitution and our excellent laws render us happy to the envy of our neighbors as happy as good men could desire to be and as secure from bad as the justice and the wisdom of the laws can make us  is it nothing that the seasons of the year which were lately so strangely altered that the heavenly bodies seemed angry and displeased and refused their favorable aspects ill news and bad weather made men restless and uneasy and the great reviver of mankind the sun looked sullenly and was generally wrapped up in dismal clouds is it nothing that our scarcity fresh in all your memories is turned into plenty that some men begin to repine at it as their burden and complain as vehemently for the cheapness of the fruits of the earth as they did not long since for the scarcity and dearness of them o consider this and lay it close to your hearts and improve it in your most devout and grateful acknowledgments  and let it always be remembered for the honor of this day when characters engraved in brass shall disappear as if they were written in dust when elogies committed to the trust of marbles shall be illegible as whispered accents when pyramids dissolved shall want themselves a monument to evidence they were once so much as ruin i say let it be recorded for the honor of this day let it be wrote with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever job xix    that the battle near cullodenhouse april         was terrible and decisive that the highland rebels were conquered that the french who joined them were taken prisoners that those to whom quarter was given were ungrateful and that his royal highness william duke of cumberland generalissimo of the british forces at that battle behaved with the conduct and bravery of an hero vid life of scipio africanus by photius p       it is observable that our church in her benedicete calls upon darkness itself to praise the lord the recollection therefore of our former disasters is not inconsistent with a thanksgiving god grant it may fix and settle the strong and lasting obligations that lie upon us devoutly to fear him who has wrought such wonderful works for us which is the last part of this present undertaking  although the omnipotent power and the infinite justice of god seem to be the only objects of our fear yet there is an expression in hosea iii   they shall fear the lord and his goodness tremble at the undeserved and stupendous emanations of it and dread the abuse of it in any kind for the transports of success have sometimes more terrible effects than the desolations of war and may that never be said of us which the prophet jeremy upbraids the jews with chap vii ver  0 we are delivered to do all these abominations good god delivered to steal to murder to commit adultery to swear falsely to burn incense to baal and walk after other gods for these are the flaming guilts that the prophet charges home upon them why the saws and harrows the engines of slavery and captivity had been much more eligible than a deliverance thus employed god almighty planted fear in all our natures with a gracious design to make us wise he has placed that passion as a wakeful sentinel to discern at a distance the approaches of our enemies to see when and which way they come and give us cautions to avoid them or to prepare for their attacks only fear the lord therefore as the text directs and serve him in truth with all your hearts for consider how great things he has done for you  let it never be said of us that we blemish our festival by intemperance and excess by lewdness and profaneness let us observe it with all imaginable decency as those that fear their god and honor their prince let not our extravagant behavior at our feasting kindle gods wrath against us these joyful days should engage us in all charitable offices let us open both our hands and our hearts and send portions to the poor that there may be no heart sad when god has given us such a triumphant occasion for our public joy and the sincerest expressions of it are discovered in serving him in truth with all our hearts  to him our most gracious and merciful god our shield and our rock and our mighty deliverer who has set us free from the northern rebels and we hope and trust from french tyranny and popish superstition a yoke which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear who has frustrated the counsels and blasted the designs of wicked and unreasonable men and made their mischievous councils and devices to be of none effect who brings to light the hidden things of darkness and has hitherto preserved our religion and civil interests in despite of all the malicious and restless designs of our adversaries  unto god who has saved us with so great salvation let us give thanks from the ground of the heart and that he may accept this sacrifice of praise i shall once more entreat you to comply with the advice in the text for fear of the judgments threatened in the following verse  only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all your hearts for consider how great things he has done for you but if ye shall still do wickedly ye shall be destroyed both ye and your king  finis the following sermons printed for and sold by william sandby at the
