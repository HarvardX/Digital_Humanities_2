southamptonstreet in the strand mdcclx  price one shilling and six pence  advertisement a poem strephon and chloe of dr swifts with all due deference to the ladies that poem is mentioned gave the author the first idea of a comedy on this subject he had not thought sufficiently of it to form any regular plan when la nouvelle ecole de femmes of monsieur de moissy fell into his hands there were circumstances and sentiments in that piece which coincided with his design and he also had some objections the husbands visiting a lady of fashion under his own name and passing upon her for an unmarried man the chevaliers attempt upon his friends honor without a proper detection of either of them the wife singing and dancing about the stage through the whole last act in order to reclaim her husband and his approbation of it without any other denouement and without any situations of embarassment which the story so naturally tended to were in his opinion palpable deficiencies to substitute other materials to form a last act entirely new and to work the whole into an english comedy was the employment of some vacant hours in the last summer whether he has been able to do it with any tolerable spirit either in the dialogue characters or fable he now submits to the decision of the candid reader he acknowledges the public candor and he returns his thanks to mr garrick for his

husband that will enlarge the circle of my innocent pleasures  but a husband now a days maam is no such a thing  a husband now  as i hope for mercy is nothing at all but a scarecrow to show you the

makes him so then for certain he is a monster indeed  and if one does not make him so then he behaves like a monster and of the two evils by my troth  maam was you ever at the play of catharine and mercutio  the vile man calls his wife his goods and his cattles and his household stuff  there you may see maam what a husband is  a husband is  but here comes one will tell you  here comes sir brilliant fashion  ask his advice maam   mrs love his advice  ask advice of the man who has estranged mr lovemores affections from me   muslin well i protect and vow maam i think sir brilliant a very pretty gentleman  he is the very pink of the fashion  he dresses fashionably lives fashionably wins your money fashionably loses his own fashionably and does every thing fashionably and then he is so lively and talks so lively and so much to say and so never at a loss  but here he comes   enter sir brilliant singing sir brill mrs lovemore your most obedient very humble servant  but my dear madam what always in a visavis party with your suivante  you will afford me your pardon my dear maam if i avow that this does a little wear the appearance of misanthropy   mrs love far from it sir brilliant  we were engaged in your panegyric    sir brill my panegyric  then am i come most apropos to give a helping hand toward making it complete  mr lovemore will kiss your hand presently maam  he has not as yet entirely adjusted his dress  in the mean time i can if you please help you to some anecdotes which will perhaps enable you to color your canvass a little higher   mrs love i hope you will be sure among those anecdotes not to omit the egregious exploit of seducing mr lovemore entirely from his wife she makes a sign to muslin to go   sir brill i maam  let me perish madam    mrs love oh sir i am no stranger to    sir brill may fortune eternally forsake me and beauty frown on me if ever    mrs love dont protest too strongly sir brilliant    sir brill may i never hold four by honors    mrs love nay but sir    sir brill maam i am altogether struck with amazement  may i never taste the dear delight of breaking a pharaoh bank or bullying the whole room at a bragparty if ever i was in thought word or deed accessory to his infidelity  i deny all unlawful confederacy    mrs love oh sir it is in vain to deny   sir brill nay but my dear mrs lovemore give me leave  i alienate the affections of mr lovemore  consider madam how would this tell in westminster hall  sir brilliant fashion how say you guilty of this indictment or not guilty  not guilty poss  thus issue is joined  you enter the court and in sober sadness charge the whole plump upon me without a word as to the how when and where  no proof positive  there ends the prosecution   mrs love but sir your stating of the case    sir brill dear maam dont interrupt    mrs love let me explain this matter    sir brill nay mrs lovemore allow me fair play  i am now upon my defense  you will please to consider gentlemen of the jury that mr lovemore is not a ward nor i a guardian that he is his own master to do as he pleases that mr lovemore is fond of gaiety pleasure and enjoyment that he knows how to live and if he does not like the bill of fare that is catered for him at home he very naturally goes abroad to seek for something more palatable  how say ye  gentlemen of the jury  not guilty  there maam you see not guilty   mrs love you run on finely sir brilliant  but dont imagine that this bantering way    sir brill acquitted by my country maam you see  fairly acquitted    mrs love be it so then  but you hinted something about mr lovemores not liking his bill of fare at home  i should be glad you would explain that matter sir    sir brill right madam very right  i did touch upon that head  it was but slightly  i did not care in an open court to enlarge further upon that mattter  but to be plain upon my word mrs lovemore for a fine woman like you to be the dupe of your own false delicacy an old fashioned kind of sentiment a vulgar prejudice proscribed by custom long ago an antiquated principle of i know not what  renounce it altogether  vivez maam  do like other people of condition mix with other amiable ladies who know how to use the senses nature has given them pluck the fruit that grows around ye and bid adieu to the reign of the melancholy pleasures for ever   mrs love after the very edifying counsel you give mr lovemore this loose strain of yours sir brilliant is not at all surprising  and sir your late project    sir brill my late project    mrs love yes sir not content with leading mr lovemore into a thousand dissipations from all conjugal affection and domestic happiness you have lately introduced him to your mrs bellmour    sir brill maam he does not so much as know mrs bellmour   mrs love fie upon it sir brilliant  falsehood is but a poor    sir brill falsehood i disdain maam  and i sir brilliant fashion declare that mr lovemore your husband is not acquainted with the widow bellmour  and if he was acquainted  what then  no ill consequence could from thence redound to you  you dont know that lady maam  but i will let you into her whole history  her whole history maam  pray be seated the widow bellmours history is this  she is one of those ladies   lovemore speaks within  william is the chariot at the door   sir brill we are interrupted    enter lovemore love very well  let the chariot be brought round directly  how do you do this morning my dear sir brilliant i beg your pardon  how do you do my dear   with an air of cold civility mrs love only a little indisposed in mind and indisposition of the mind is of no sort of consequence not worth a cure    love i beg your pardon mrs lovemore indisposition of the mind  sir brilliant that is really a mighty pretty ring you have on your finger    sir brill a bauble will you look at it   mrs love though i have but few obligations to sir brilliant yet i fancy i may ascribe to him the favor of this visit mr lovemore   love looking at the ring  nay now positively you wrong me  i was obliged to you for your civil enquiries concerning me this morning and so on my part i came to return the compliment before i go abroad  upon my word it is very prettily set  gives it   mrs love are you going abroad sir    love a matter of business  i hate business  but business must be done  examining his ruffles  pray is there any news  any news my dear    mrs love it would be news to me sir if you would be kind enough to let me know whether i may expect the favor of your company to dinner   love it would be impertinent in me to answer such a question because i can give no direct positive answer to it  as things happen  perhaps i may  perhaps may not  but dont let me be of any inconvenience to you  it is not material where a body eats  can i set you down any where sir brilliant   sir brill i thank you no  my chariots in waiting  i have some visits to make and shall rattle half the town over presently   love as you will  a ca your servant  mrs lovemore  my dear drawing his gloves on  i kiss your hand  who waits there  going returns apropos you have heard what happened  to sir brilliant   sir brill when and where   love a word in your ear  maam with your permission    mrs love that cold contemptuous civility mr lovemore    love pshaw  prithee now  how can you my dear  that is very peevish now and illnatured  it is but about a mere trifle  hark ye whispers i lost every thing i played for after you went  the foreigner and he understand one another  i beg pardon maam it was only about an affair at the opera   mrs love the opera mr lovemore or any thing is more agreeable than my company   love you wrong me now i declare you wrong me  and if it will give you any pleasure i will sup at home  cannot we meet at the st albans to night   aside to sir brilliant   mrs love i believe i need not tell you what pleasure that would give me but unless the pleasure is mutual mr lovemore    love maam i  i  i perceive all the delicacy of that sentiment  but  a  a i shall incommode you  you possibly may have some private party  and it would be very impolite in me to obstruct your sehemes of pleasure  would it not sir brilliant laughs   sir brill it would be gothic to the last degree  ha ha   love ha ha  to be sure for me to be of the party would look as if we lived together like our friend sir jealous hotbrain and his scolding wife who are for ever like two gamecocks ready armed to goad and wound one another most heartily  ha ha   sir brill the very thing  ha ha   love so it is  so it is both stand laughing   mrs love very well gentlemen you have it all to yourselves   love odso looking at his watch i shall be beyond my time  any commands into the city madam    mrs love commands  i have no commands sir   love i have an appointment there at my bankers  sir brilliant you know old discount    sir brill what he that was in parliament    love the same   entire butt i think was the name of the borough  ha ha ha  maam your most obedient  sir brilliant yours  who waits there  no ceremony  your servant exit singing   sir brill bon voyage    enter muslin muslin did you call maam   mrs love come hither muslin  whispers her mind what i say    muslin i will do it madam i will do it exit   mrs love he is gone to visit this mrs bellmour i suppose    sir brill dear maam how can you take such a notion in your head  but apropos  that brings us back to the little history i was just going to give you of the widow bellmour    mrs love proceed sir   sir brill the widow bellmour maam is a lady who to all the charms of external beauty has added such an elegance of understanding and such a vivacity of wit that it is no wonder all the pretty fellows are on their knees to her  her person youthful blooming and graceful  and then her manner  and so entertaining  such quickness in her transition from one thing to another and every thing she does does so become her  does she sit still it is an indolent venus before ye  does she move it is beauty walking in conscious triumph to see her smile and hear her talk  i shall glow up into rapture and fall a raving if i talk a moment longer about her    mrs love pray finish your picture sir    sir brill it is from the real life i assure ye  in short maam she is a lady that has been abroad has ever kept the best company and has such a variety of talents that upon my soul she knows the whole theory of agreeable sensations better than all the philosophers in europe    mrs love and to this theory she has joined the practice i presume    sir brill she has    mrs love i imagined as much    sir brill maam    mrs love you need not affect to be surprised sir  there is no mighty secret in the affair  my accounts of the lady inform me that she is as you say young and handsome has lived a great deal abroad buried her husband there is lately come to town has taken a house  lives at great expense receives all the men of rank and fortune  we all know what the world is apt to infer from these appearances    sir brill i am no stranger to the way of the world  every object has its different aspects its sidelights and the world is generally goodnatured enough to fix upon the most unfavourable points of view   mrs love so then this is another antiquated prejudice of mine   sir brill nothing more certain    mrs love oh mighty well sir  she is a very vestal  come exhibit your portrait  a vestal from your school of painting will no doubt be very curious    sir brill my dear madam consider what you are saying  what is your charge against this lady that she is amiable  surely mrs lovemore should be the last person in the world to reproach her with a quality which so eminently possesses herself   mrs love the gallantry of that compliment sir brilliant added to your other favors    sir brill what next  that she has agreeable talents  what then as nature is liberal of talents to but very few she makes a kind of recompense to those who have none by conducing to their entertainment  but she is young and handsome  so perishable a quality might methinks be suffered to bloom without reproach  ay but she has taken a house and sees company  it is what she is entitled to and a fine picture should be seen by people of rank and taste  and surely madam your sex entrenches upon your own happiness by not allowing that a woman may partake of the innocent pleasures of life unless she has resigned her person to a man and parted with her liberty    mrs love and so you would persuade me that mr lovemore is not acquainted with her    sir brill absolutely ignorant of him  and i will tell you further she has such a generosity of temper and such a feeling heart that were she to know him and to know that his visits gave you pain she would never be at home for him again    mrs love then give me leave sir  if you have so exalted an opinion of the lady how comes it that you desist from paying your addresses in that quarter    sir brill compulsion maam  it is not voluntary  the garrison i thought was upon the point of surrendering but up came my lord etheridge with his honorable forces to relieve the town  i thought he was out of the kingdom but it seems he is returned  i bribed the chambermaid yesterday and i find he has supplanted me and so all that remains for me is to do justice to the lady and console myself in the best way i can for my demerits and the insufficiency of my pretensions    mrs love and am i really to believe all this    sir brill may the first woman i put the question to strike me to the center with a supercilious eyebrow if every syllable is not minutely true  so that you see maam i am not the cause of your inquietude  there is not on earth a man that could be more averse from such a thing  nor a person in the world who more earnestly aspires to prove the tender esteem he bears ye  and maam  i have long panted for an opportunity  by all that is soft she hears me aside  i have long panted maam for a tender moment like this  with all the ardor of love which charms like yours alone could kindle  she rises disconcerted were it even at the expense of my life  she walks about uneasy  you see my dear maam we both have cause of discontent we are both disappointed  both crossed in love  and so maam the least we can do is both heartily to join to sweeten each others cares   mrs love sir brilliant i dont understand angrily   sir brill if you will pour the balm of love on this poor wounded heart you may have the most delicious revenge against a husband  who  from his own perverse inclination his own inhumanity of temper  has for a long time  i have seen it madam  with vexation seen it  yes  he has long been false to honor love and you    mrs love this usage sir  you take my wrongs too much to heart sir  walking about  i myself sir can remedy my own afflictions  but this presumption of yours  upon my word  this is the most unparallelled  walks about and flutters her fan   sir brill pray maam dont break your fan  dont break it maam  i beg you will not    mrs love this is the most affronting  come to a fine pass indeed  she stands looking at her fan  intolerable assurance    sir brill now am i in a sweet condition  the poet has touched it most exquisitely    she views the sorry with attentive eyes and pities procris while her lover dies mrs love sir i must desire you will quit my house immediately    sir brill dont overheat yourself  consider my dear madam    mrs love sir i desire  was ever such rudeness  rings the bell   sir brill maam i desist  i have done  but when youre in a better humor pray recollect    mrs love will no body answer there   sir brill i retire   those eyes that tell us what the sun is made of  those hills of driven snow   enter muslin hastily sir brill maam your most obedient  exit   muslin did you call maam   mrs love to show the gentleman out  walking angrily   muslin the servants are all in the hall   mrs love to be insulted thus by his loose confident carriage    muslin as i live and breathe maam if i was as you i would not flutter myself about it    mrs love about what   muslin la  what signifies mincing matters  i overheard it all   mrs love you did  did you angrily   muslin maam    mrs love it does not signify at present    muslin no maam it does not signify and revenge is sweet i think and by my troth i dont see why you should stand on ceremony with a husband that stands upon none with you   mrs love again  prithee mrs malapert none of your advice  how dare yon talk in this manner to me  let me hear no more of this impertinent freedom  walks about   muslin no maam  its very well maam  i have done maam  disconcerted and then she speaks aside  what the devil is here to do  an unmannerly thing to go for to huss me in this manner    mrs love still walking about to make his character public and render him the subject of every teatable throughout this town would only serve to widen the breach and instead of his neglect might call forth his anger and settle at last into a fixed aversion  lawyers parting and separate maintenance would ensue  no  i must avoid that  if possible i will avoid that  what must be done    muslin what can she be thinking of now  the sulky thing not to be communicative with such a friend as i am  what can she mean  did you speak to me maam    mrs love suppose i were to try that  muslin   muslin maam  now for it    mrs love did john follow your masters chariot as i ordered   muslin he did maam   mrs love where is he   muslin he is below maam  he followed it as far as the chocolate house in st jamessstreet   mrs love are you sure of that   muslin you may rely upon it   mrs love you heard sir brilliant deny that mr lovemore visits at this widow bellmours   muslin lard maam he is as full of fibs as a french milliner  he does visit there  i know it all from william  i will be hanged in my own garters if he does not   mrs love i know not what to do  heigho  i think i will venture  let my chair be got ready instantly   muslin your chair maam  are you going out maam   mrs love dont teaze me with your talk but do as i bid you  and bring my capuchin down to the parlour immediately  exit muslin what is in the wind now  an illnatured puss not to tell me what she is about  it is no matter  she does not know what she is about  before i would lead such a life i would take a lovers leap into rosamonds pond  i love to see company for my part  but lord bless me i had like to have forgot  mrs sugarkey comes to my rout tonight  i had as live she had staid away  she is nothing but mere lumber  so formal that she will not play above a shillingwhist  how the devil does she think i am to make a shilling party for her  there is no

has a heart  has he a heart  yes i think he has  and then he is such an observer of the manners  and shows the ridiculous of them with so much humor    mig i will be whipped if you dont get into the noose before the long nights are over  without doubt maam my lord is a pretty man enough  but lackaday what othat  you know but very little of him  your acquaintance is but very short  mrs bellmour hums a tune do pray my dear madam mind what i say  for i am at times i assure you very speculative  very speculative indeed  and i see very plainly  lord maam what am i doing  i am talking to you for your own good and youre all in the air and no more mind one no no more than if i was nothing at all   mrs bell hums a tune still why indeed you talk wonderfully well upon the subject but as i know how the cards lie and can play the game myself and as i dont know my song  why abody is inclined to give that the preference sings   mig maam i assure you i am none of those servants that bargain for their mistresss inclinations  but i see you are going to take a leap in the dark  i dont know what to make of his manner of coming here with his chair always brought into the hall and the curtains drawn close about his ears as if  may i never be married if i dont believe there is something amiss in the affair  dear heart maam if you will not listen to me what signifies my living with you  i am of no service to you    mrs bell i believe i have conquered the song  runs to her glass how do i look today  well enough i think  do you think i shall play the fool mignionet and marry my lord   mig you have it maam through the very heart of you  i see that   mrs bell do you think so  may be i may marry and may be not  poor sir brilliant fashion  what will become of him but i will not think about it   enter pompey mrs bell what is the matter pompey   pom there is a lady below in a chair that desires to know if you are at home madam   mrs bell has the lady no name   pom she did not tell her name   mrs bell how awkward you are  well show her up  exit pompey mig had not you better receive the lady in the dining room maam  things here are in such confusion    mrs brill no twill do very well here i dare say it is some body i am intimate with though the boy does not recollect her name  here she comes   enter mrs lovemore they both look with a grave surprise at each other then curtsey with an air of distant civility mrs bell maam your most obedient  with a kind of reserve   mrs love maam i beg your pardon for this intrusion  disconcerted   mrs bell pray maam walk in  will not you please to be seated  mignionet reach a chair   mrs love this chair will do mighty well   mrs bell i beg you will sit from the door  i beg you will sit here maam  mrs lovemore crosses the stage and they salute each other   mrs love i am afraid this visit from one unknown to you will be inconvenient and troublesome   mrs bell not at all i dare say  you need not be at the trouble of an apology  would you choose a dish of chocolate   mrs love much obliged to you not any   mrs bell mignionet you may withdraw  exit mignionet mrs love though i have not the pleasure of your acquaintance maam there is a particular circumstance which has determined me to take this liberty with you for which i entreat your pardon beforehand   mrs bell the request is wholly unnecessary  but a particular circumstance you say  pray maam to what circumstance am i indebted for this honor   mrs love i shall appear perhaps very ridiculous and indeed i am afraid i have done the most absurd thing  but maam from the character you bear for tenderness of disposition and generosity of sentiment i easily incline to flatter myself that you will not take offense at any thing and that if it is in your power you will afford me your assistance   mrs bell you may depend upon me   mrs love i will be very ingenuous  pray maam ant you acquainted with a gentleman whose name is lovemore   mrs bell lovemore  no  no such person in my list  lovemore  i dont know him maam   mrs love maam i beg your pardon  i am but where i was  i will not trouble you any further going   mrs bell it is mighty odd this aside madam i must own my curiosity is a good deal excited  takes her by the hand  pray maam give me leave  i beg you will sit down  pray dont think me impertinent  may i beg to know who the gentleman is   mrs love you have such an air of frankness and generosity that i will open myself to you i have been married to him these two years i admired him for his understanding his sentiment and spirit i thought myself as sincerely loved by him as my fond heart could wish but there is of late such a strange revolution in his temper i know not what to make of it  instead of the looks of affection and expressions of tenderness with which he used to meet me it is nothing now but cold averted superficial civility  while abroad he runs on in a wild career of pleasure and to my deep affliction has fixed his affections upon another object   mrs bell if you mean to consult with me in regard to this case i am afraid you have made a wrong choice there is something in her appearance that affects me aside  pray excuse me maam you consider this matter too deeply  men will prove false and if there is nothing in your complaint but mere gallantry on his side  upon my word i cannot think your case the worse for that   mrs love not the worse   mrs bell on the contrary much better if his affections instead of being alienated had been extinguished he would have sunk into a downright stupid habitual insensibility from which it might prove impossible to recall him  in all loves bill of mortality there is not a more fatal disorder  but your husband is not fallen into that way  by your account he still has sentiment and where there is sentiment there is still room to hope for an alteration  but in the other case you have the pain of seeing yourself neglected and for what  for nothing at all  the man has lost all sense of feeling and is become to the warm beams of wit and beauty as impenetrable as an icehouse   mrs lov i am afraid maam he is too much the reverse of this too susceptible of impressions from every beautiful object   mrs bell why so much the better as i told you already  some new idea has struck his fancy and he will be for a while under the influence of that   mrs love how light she makes of it  aside mrs bell but it is the wifes business to bait the hook for her husband with variety and to draw him daily to herself  that is the whole affair i would not make myself uneasy maam   mrs love not uneasy when his indifference does not diminish my regard for him not uneasy when the man i dote on no longer fixes his happiness at home   mrs bell maam you will give me leave to speak my mind freely  i have often observed when the fiend jealousy is roused that women lay out a wonderful deal of anxiety and vexation to no account when perhaps if the truth were known they should be angry with themselves instead of their husbands   mrs love angry with myself madam  calumny can lay nothing to my charge  the virtue of my conduct madam    mrs bell look ye there now  i would have laid my life you would be at that  that is the folly of us all  but virtue is out of the question at present  i mean the want of address and proper management it is there that most women fail  virtue alone cannot please the taste of this age  it is la belle nature  nature embellished by the advantages of art that the men expect nowadays   mrs love but after being married so long and behaving all that time with such an equality    mrs bell ay that equality is the rock so many split upon  the men are now so immersed in luxury that they must have eternal variety in their happiness   mrs love she justifies him  aside mrs bell i will tell you what i would venture to lay a pot of coffee that the person who now rivals you in your husbands affection does it without your good qualities and even without your beauty by the mere force of agreeable talents and assiduity to please   mrs love i am afraid that compliment    mrs bell let me ask you maam have you ever seen this formidable person   mrs love i think i have   mrs bell what fort of a woman pray   mrs love formidable indeed  she was described to me as one of charming and rare accomplishments and that is fatally too true  i can see in her the sensible the spirited the  in short in her i see my ruin   mrs bell never throw up the cards for all that  really maam without compliment you seem to have all the qualities that can dispute your husbands heart with any body but the exertion of those qualities i am afraid is suppressed  you will excuse my freedom  you should counterwork your rival by the very same arts she employs  i know a lady now in your very situation  and what does she do she consumes herself with eternal jealousy whereas if she would but employ half the pains she uses in teazing herself to vie vith the creature that has won her husband from her  to vie with her i say in the arts of pleasing  for it is there a womans pride should be piqued  would she do that take my word for it victory would declare in her favor   mrs love do you think so maam   mrs bell think so  i am sure of it  for there is this advantage on her side that virtue is an auxiliary in her cause  and virtue is the best beautifying fluid for the complexion it gives a luster to the features that cannot be equaled by any artifice whatever   mrs love what can this mean i begin to doubt  aside mrs bell but even virtue herself must condescend to call in external aid  her own native charms would do if men were perfect but that is not the case and since vice can assume allurements why should not truth and innocence have additional ornaments also   mrs love i begin to think sir brilliant has told me truth  aside mrs bell i have been married maam and am a little in the secret  it is much more difficult to keep a heart than win one  after the fatal words for better for worse the general way with wives is to relax into indolence and while they are guilty of no infidelity they think that is enough  but they are mistaken there is a great deal wanting  an address a manner a desire of pleasing  an agreeable contrast in their conduct of grave and gay  a favorite poet of mine  prior has expressed this very delicately  above the fixed and settled rules of vice and virtue in the schools the better part should set before em a grace a manner a decorum  mrs love but when the natural temper    mrs bell the natural temper must be forced home must be made a place of pleasure to the husband and the wife must throw infinite variety into her manner  in short she must as it were multiply herself and appear to him fundry different women on different occasions  and this i take to be the whole mystery the way to keep a man  but i run on at a strange rate  well to be sure i am the giddiest creature  maam will you now give me leave to enquire how i came to have this favor who recommended me to your notice  and pray who was so kind as to intimate that i was acquainted with mr lovemore   mrs love i beg your pardon for all the trouble i have given you and i assure you it is entirely owing to my being told that his visits were requent here   mrs bell his visits frequent here  they have imposed upon you i assure you  and they have told you perhaps that i have robbed you of mr lovemores heart  scandal is always buzzing about  but i assure you i have not meddled with his heart  oh lud i hear a rap at the door i positively will not be at home  rings a bell enter mignionet mign did you call madam   mrs bell i am not at home   mign it is lord etheridge maam  he is coming up stairs the servants told him you were within   mrs bell was ever any thing so cross tell him there is company with me and he will not come in mignionet run to him   mrs love maam i beg i may not hinder you   mrs bell our conversation begins to grow interestig and i would not have you go for the world i will not see my lord   mrs love i beg you will dont let me prevent i will step into another room   mrs bell will you be so kind  there is a study of books in that room if you will be so obliging as to amuse yourself there i shall be glad to resume this conversation again  he shant stay long   mrs love i beg you will be in no hurry i can wait with pleasure   mrs bell this is a lover of mine and a husband and a lover should be treated in the same manner perhaps it will divert you to hear how i manage him i hear him on the stairs for heavens sake make haste mignionet show the way   mign this way madam this way  exeunt mrs love and mignionet mrs bell let me see how i look to receive him  runs to her glass enter lovemore with a star and ribband as lord etheridge mrs bell  looking in her glass lord etheridge walk in my lord   love  repeats a heavenly image in the glass appears to that she bends to that her eyes she rears repairs her smiles   mrs bell repairs her smiles my lord i dont like your application of that phrase  pray my lord are my smiles out of repair like an old house in the country that wants a tenant   love nay now that is wresting the words from their visible intention  you cannot suppose i thought you want repair whatever may be the case maam with regard to the want of a tenant   mrs bell and so you think i really want a tenant and perhaps you imagine too that i am going to put up a bill looking in her glass to signify to all passersby that here is a mansion to be let  well i swear i dont think it would be a bad scheme  i have a great mind to do so   love and he who has the preference    mrs bell will be very happy i know you mean so but i will let it to none but a single gentleman that you may depend upon   love what the devil does she mean by that she has not got an inkling of the affair i hope aside none else could presume madam to    mrs bell and then it must be a lease for life  but no body will be troubled with it  i shall never get it off my hands  do you think i shall my lord   love why that question madam you know i am devoted to you even if it were to be bought with life   mrs bell heavens what a dying swain you are and does your lordship really intend to be guilty of matrimony  lord what a question have i asked  well to be sure i am a very madcap  my lord dont you think me a strange madcap   love a wildness like yours that arises from vivacity and sentiment together serves only to exalt your beauty and give new poignancy to every charm   mrs bell well upon my word you have said it finely  but you are in the right my lord  i hate your pensive melancholy beauty that sits like a wellgrown vegetable in a room for an hour together till at last she is animated to the violent exertion of saying yes or no and then enters into a matteroffact conversion have you heard the news miss beverly is going to be married to captain shoulderknot  my lord mortgage has had another tumble at arthurs sir william squanderstock has lost his election they say short aprons are coming into fashion again   love oh lord a matteroffact conversation is insupportable   mrs bell pray my lord have you ever observed the manner of one ladys accosting another at ranelagh  she comes up to you with a demure look of insipid serenity  makes you a solemn salute  maam i am overjoyed to meet you  you look charmingly  but dear madam did you hear what happened to us all the other night  we were going home from the opera maam  you know my aunt rolypoly  it was her coach  there was she  and lady betty fidget  your most obedient servant maam curtseying to another as it were going by lady betty you know is recovered  every body thought it over with her  but doctor snakeroot was called in no not doctor snakeroot doctor bolus it was and so he altered the course of the medicines  and so my lady betty recovered  well there was she and sir george bragwell  a pretty man sir george  finest teeth in the world  your ladyships most obedient  we expected you last night  but you did not come  he he  and so there was he and the rest of us  and so turning the corner of bondstreet the villain of a coachman  how do you do madam  the villain of a coachman overturned us all  my aunt rolypoly was frightened out of her wits and lady betty has been nervish ever since  only think of that  such accidents in life  maam your most obedient  i am proud to see you look so well   love an exact description  the very thing  ha ha   mrs bell and then from this conversation they all run to cards  quadrille has murdered wit   love ay and beauty too for upon these occasions the passions in the features are   i have seen many a beautiful countenance change in a moment into absolute deformity the little loves and graces that before sparkled in the eye bloomed in the cheek and smiled about the mouth all fly off in an instant and resign the features which they before adorned to fear to anger to grief and the whole train of fretful passions   mrs bell ay and the rage we poor women are often betrayed into on these occasions    love very true maam and if by chance they do bridle and hold in a little the struggle they undergo is the most ridiculous sight imaginable  i have seen an oath quivering upon the pale lip of a reigning toast for half an hour together yes and i have seen an uplifted eye blaspheming providence for the loss of an odd trick  and then at last when the whole room burst out into one loud universal uproar  my lord you flung away the game  no maam it was you  sir george why did not you rough the diamond capt hazard why did not you lead through the honor maam it was not the play  pardon me sir  but maam  but sir  i would not play with you for straws  dont you know what hoyle says if a and b are partners against c and d and the game nineall a and b have won three tricks and c and d four tricks c leads his suit d puts up the king then returns the suit a passes c puts up the queen b roughs the next and so a and b and c and d are banged about and all is jargon confusion uproar and wrangling and nonsense and noise  ha ha   mrs bell ha ha a fine picture of a rout but one must play fometimes  we must let our friends pick our pockets sometimes or they will drop our acquaintance  pray my lord do you never play   love play maam  i must lie to the end of the chapter aside play  now and then out of necessity  otherwise  i never touch a card   mrs bell oh very true you dedicate your time to the muses a downright rhyming peer  do you know my lord that i am charmed with your song   love are you   mrs bell i am indeed  i think you would make a very tolerable vauxball poet   love you flatter me maam   mrs bell no as i live and breathe i dont  and do you know that i can sing it already  come you shall hear me  you shall hear it  sings i attend all ye fair and i will tell ye the art to bind every fancy with ease in your chains to hold in soft fetters the conjugal heart and banish from hymen his doubts and his pains  ii when juno accepted the cestus of love at first she was handsome she charming became with skill the soft passions it taught her to move to kindle at once and to keep up the flame  iii it is this gives the eyes all their magic and fire the voice melting accents impassions the kiss confers the sweet smiles that awaken desire and plants round the fair each incentive to bliss  iv thence flows the gay chat more than reason that charms the eloquent blush that can beauty improve the fond sigh the fond vow the soft touch that alarms the tender disdain the renewal of love  v ye fair take the cestus and practice it is art the mind unaccomplishd mere features are vain exert your sweet power you conquer each heart and the loves joys and graces shall walk in your train  love my poetry is infinitely obliged to you for the embellishments your voice and manner confer upon it   mrs bell oh fulsome  i sing horridly and i look horridly goes to the glass  how do i look my lord  but dont tell me  i will not be told  i see you are studying a compliment and i hate compliments  well what is it let us hear your compliment why dont you compliment me  i will not hear it now  but pray now how came you to choose so grave a subject as connubial happiness  do you think there is any such thing on earth as connubial happiness   love close and particular that question aside why maam in general one does not see the talents of a wife dedicated to the happiness of the husband  i have known ladies who on the eve of their wedding appeared like the very graces in a few weeks after the ceremony become very slatterns both in their persons and understandings no solicitude on their side to appear amiable  distaste insinuates itself by degrees into the husbands mind the bands of hymen grow loose and thus with perhaps the best disposition in the world he is obliged to start wild and away he urges where youth and a career of spirits hurry him and so goodnight to all real and solid happiness  but with one accomplished as you are maam    mrs bell to be sure with me nobody could be otherwise than happy  was not that what you was going to say  i know it was  well upon my word you have drawn your picture so well that one would imagine you had a wife at home to sit for it   love maam embarrassd the compliment  a  you are but laughing at me  i i  i  zouns i am afraid she begins to smoke me aside  a very scanty knowledge of the world will serve and  and there is no need of ones own experience in these cases  nor had i talked so were i not persuaded you will make an exception to the general rule   mrs bell o lard you are going to plague me again with your odious solicitations but i will not hear em  you must be gone  if i should be weak enough to listen to you what would become of sir brilliant fashion   love sir brilliant fashion   mrs bell yes dont you know sir brilliant fashion   love no maam i dont know the gentleman  i beg pardon if he is your acquaintance but from what i have heard of him i should not choose him to be among my intimates   enter mignionet in a violent hurry mig o lud i am frighted out of my senses  the poor lady  where is the hartshorndrops   love the lady what lady   mign never stand asking what lady  she has fainted away maam all of a sudden give me the drops    mrs bell let me run to her assistance  adieu my lord  i shall be at home in the evening  mignionet step this way  my lord you will excuse me i expect you in the evening  exit lovemore i shall wait on you maam what villain am i to carry on this scheme against so much beauty innocence and merit  ay and to have the impudence to assume this badge of honor to cover the most unwarrantable purposes  but no reflection have her i must and that quickly too  if i dont prevail soon i am undone  she will find me out  egad i will be with her betimes this evening and press her with all the vehemence of love  women have their soft unguarded moments and who knows  but to take the advantage of the openness and gaiety of her heart and then my friend sir brilliant will it be fair to supplant him  prithee be quiet my dear conscience dont you be meddling dont interrupt a gentleman in his amusements  dont you know my good friend that love has no respect of persons knows no laws of frienship  besides it is all my wifes fault  why dont she strive to make home agreeable  for foreign pleasures foreign joy i roam no thought of peace or happiness at home  going sir brilliant is heard singing within what the devil is madam fortune at now  sir brilliant by all that is odious  no place to conceal in  no escape  the door is locked  mignionet mignionet open the door    mig within you cannot come in here sir   love this cursed star and this ribband will ruin me  let me get off this confounded telltale evidence  takes off the ribband in a hurry   enter sir brilliant sir brill my dear madam i most heartily rejoice  ha  lovemere   love your slave sir brilliant your slave hiding the star with his hat   sir brill how is this i did not think you had been acquainted here   love i came to look for you  i thought to

suspicions are right i must come at the bottom of it  ay ay  there is something forming here    enter mrs bellmour sir brill my dear mrs bellmour   mrs bell heavens what brings you here   sir brill i congratulate with myself upon the felicity of meeting you thus at home   mrs bell your visit is unseasonable you must be gone   sir brill madam i have a thousand things    mrs bell well well another

mrs bell do you dispute my will and pleasure  fly this instant turns him out so i will make sure of the door   enter mrs lovemore leaning on mignionet mign this way madam here is more air in this room   mrs bell how do you find yourself maam pray sit down   mrs love my spirits were too weak to bear up any longer against such a scene of villainy   mrs bell villainy  what villainy   mrs love of the blackest dye  i see madam you are acquainted with my husband   mrs bell acquainted with your husband angrily   mrs love a moments patience madam  that gentleman that was here with you is my husband   mrs bell lord etheridge your husband   mrs love lord etheridge as he calls himself and as you have been made to call him also is no other than mr lovemore   mrs bell and has he then been base enough to assume that title to ensnare me to my undoing   mign well for certain i believe the devils in me i am certainly a witch for i always thought him a sly one   mrs love to see my husband carrying on this dark business  to see the man i have loved  the man i have esteemed  the man i am afraid i must still love though esteem him again i cannot  to be a witness to his complicated wickedness  it was too much for sensibility like mine  i felt the shock too severely  and sunk under it   mrs bell i am ready to do the same myself now i sink into the very ground with amazement the first time i ever saw him was at old mrs loveits  she introduced him to me  the appointment was of her own making   mrs love you know her character i suppose madam   mrs bell she is a woman of fashion and sees a great deal of good company   mrs love very capable of such an action for all that   mrs bell well i could never have imagined that any woman would be so base as to pass such a cheat upon me step this moment and give orders never to let him within my doors again to her maid who goes out i am much obliged to you maam for this visit to me it is highly fortunate but i am sorry for your share in it as the discovery brings you nothing but a conviction of your husbands baseness   mrs love i am determined to be no further uneasy about him nor will i live a day longer under his roof   mrs bell hold hold make no violent resolutions  you will excuse me i cannot help feeling for you and i think this incident may be still converted to your advantage   mrs love that can never be  i am lost beyond redemption   mrs bell dont decide that too rashly  come come a man is worth thinking a little about before one throws the hideous thing away for ever besides you have heard his sentiments perhaps you are a little to blame yourself  we will talk this very coolly maam you have saved me  and i must now discharge the obligation  you shall stay and dine with me   mrs love i cannot possibly do that  i will not give you so much trouble   mrs bell it will be a pleasure maam  you shall stay with me i will not part with you and i will lay such a plan as may ensure him yours for ever  come come my dear madam dont you still think he has some good qualities to apologize for his vices   mrs love i must own i still hope he has   mrs bell very well then and he may still make atonement for all and let me tell you that a man who can make proper atonement for his faults sold not be entirely despised  allons  exeunt end of the second act act iii scene an apartment at mr lovemores enter mrs lovemore elegantly dressed muslin following her mustin why to be sure maam it is so for certain and your are very much in the right of it   mrs love i fancy i am  i see the folly of my former conduct and i am determined never to let my spirits sink into a melancholy state again   muslin why that is the very thing maam the very thing i have been always preaching up to you  did not i always say see company

world say heavens bless her for a sweet woman and a plague go with him for an inhuman barbarous bloody murdering brute   mrs love no more of these liberties i desire   muslin nay dont be angry  they did say so indeed  but dear heart how every body will be overjoyed when they find you have plucked up a little  as for me it gives me new life to have so much company in the house and such a racketing at the door with coaches and chairs enough to hurry a body out of ones wits  lard this is another thing and you look quite like another thing maam and that dress so becomes you  i suppose maam you will never wear your negligee again it is not fit for you indeed maam  it might pass very well with some folks maam but the like of you    mrs love prithee truce with your tongue and see who is coming

gaiety i have at the bottom but an aching heart   mrs bell be ruled by me and i will answer for the event  why really now you look just as you should do  why should you neglect so fine a figure   mrs love you are so civil mrs bellmour    mrs bell and so true too  what was beautiful before is now heightened by the additional ornaments of dress and if you will but animate and inspire the whole by those graces of the mind which i am sure you possess the impression cannot fail of being effectual upon all beholders and even upon the depraved mind of mr lovemore  you have not heard any thing of him since  have you   mrs love no  no account at all of him   mrs bell i can tell you something  he has been at my house you know i had promised to be at home for him  not being let in my servants

he has no other haunts he may perhaps come home   mrs bell i wish he may  well and have you got together a deal of company   mrs love pretty well   mrs bell that is right  show him that you will consult your own pleasure  is sir brilliant of the party   mrs love a  propos  as soon as i came home i received a letter from him my maid had taken it in  he there presses his addresses with great warmth begs to see me again and has something particular to tell me  you shall see it  oh lud i have not it about me  i left it in my dressing room i believe you mall see it by and by i took your advice and sent him word he might come  that lure brought him hither immediately  he makes no doubt of his success with me   mrs bell well two such friends as sir brilliant and mr lovemore i believe never existed   mrs love their falsehood to each other is unparalleled  i left sir brilliant at the whisttable as soon as the rubbers out he will certainly quit his company in pursuit of me   a rap at the door as i live i believe this is mr lovemore   mrs bell if it is every thing goes on swimmingly   mrs love i hear his voice it is he  how my heart beats   mrs bell courage and the days our own

relapse   mrs love no danger of that sir dont be solicitous about me  why would you leave the company let me entreat you to return sir   sir brill by heaven there is more rapture in being one moment visavis with you than in the company of a whole drawing room of beauties  round you are melting pleasures tender transports youthful loves and blooming graces all unfelt neglected and despised by a tasteless cold languid unimpassiond husband while they might be all so much better employed to the purposes of extacy and bliss   mrs love i am amazed sir at this liberty  what action of my life has authorized such barefaced assurance  and for what reason do you think so meanly of me as to imagine that i have not a greater regard for my reputation and for what the world may say sir   sir brill the world maam  the world will justify you  she served him right  they will all agree in it  there will be but one opinion about it  that is maam if the world should know it  but our loves may be as concealed as secrets undiscovered yet by mortal eye  by all that is soft it goes down with her like a dish of tea aside and so madam since i have convinced you  and since the time the place and mutual ardor all concur    mrs love sir i am not to be treated in this manner  and i assure you sir that were i not afraid of the evil consequences that might follow i should not hesitate a moment to acquaint mr lovemore with your whole behavior   sir brill she will not tell her husband then  charming creature and blessings on her for so convenient a hint  she yields by all that is wicked  what

whimsical adventure    love dont add the meanness of falsehood to the black attempt of invading your friends happiness  i did imagine sir from the long intercourse that has subsisted between us that

your friend mrs leveit and i am much obliged to you both for your very honorable desigs  curtseying to him   love i never was so ashamed in all my life    sir brill so so so all his pains were to hide the star from me  the discovery is a perfect cordial to my dejected spirits   mrs bell mrs lovemore i cannot sufficiently acknowledge the providence that directed you to pay me a visit though i was wholly unknown to you and i shall henceforth consider you as my deliverer   love zoons it was she that fainted away in the closet and be damned to her jealousy aside   sir brill by all that is whimsical an odd sort of an adventure this  my lord advances to him my lord  my lord etheriage as the man says in the play your lordships right welcome back to denmark   love now he comes upon me  oh i am in a fine situation aside   sir brill my lord i hope that ugly pain in your lordships side is abated   love absurd and ridiculous aside   sir brill there is nothing forming there i hope my lord   mrs love apart with mrs bellmour i begin now to feel for him and to pity his uneasiness   sir brill pray my lord dont you think it a base thing to invade the happiness of a friend or to do him a clandestine wrong or to injure him with the woman he loves   love to cut the matter short with you sir we are both rascals   sir brill rascal   love ay both we are two very pretty fellows indeed   mrs bell i am glad to find that you are at length awakened into a sense of your error  to lovemore   love i am madam and i am frank enough to own it  i am above attempting to disguise my feelings when i am conscious they are on the side of truth and honor  and madam with a true remorse  i ask your pardon   mrs bell upon certain terms i dont know but i may sign and seal your pardon   love terms what terms    mrs bell that you make due expiation of your guilt to that lady   love that lady maam  that lady has no reason to complain   mrs love no reason to complain mr lovemore   love no madam  none for whatever may have been my imprudences they have had their source in your conduct   mrs love in my conduct sir   love in your conduct  i here declare before this company  and i am above palliating the matter i here declare that no man in england could be better inclined to domestic happiness if you madam on your part had been willing to make home agreeable   mrs love there i confess he touches me aside   love you could take pains enough before marriage  you would put forth all your charms  practice all your arts  and make your features please by rule  for ever changing  running an eternal round of variety  and all this to win my affections  but when you had won them you did not think them worth your keeping  never dressed  pensive  silent  melancholy  and the only entertainment in my house was the dear pleasure of a dull conjugal teteatete and all this insipidity because you think the sole merit of a wife consists in her virtue  a fine way of amusing a husband truly   sir brill upon my soul and so it is  laughing   enter muslin muslin o gemini gemini here is such a piece of work  what shall i do  my poor dear lady crying bitterly   love is the woman crazy   muslin oh madam  forgive me my dear madam  i did not do it on purpose  as i hope for mercy i did not   mrs love what did not you do   muslin i did not intend to give it him i would have seen him gibbetted first  i found the letter in the parlour madam  i knew it was the same letter i had delivered to you and my curiosity did make me peep into it  says my curiosity  now muslin you may gratify yourself by finding out the contents of that letter which you have such a violent itching for  my curiosity said so maam and then i own maam my respect for you did say to me hussy how dare you meddle with what does not belong to you  keep your distance and let your mistresss secrets alone  but then upon that in comes my curiosity again and says my curiosity read it i tell you muslin a woman of spirit should know every thing  let it alone you jade says my respect  it is as much as your place is worth  there is more places than one says my curiosity and so read it i tell you muslin  i did read it  what could i do heaven help me  i did read it  i dont go to deny it  i dont i dont crying   love dont keep such an uproar woman   muslin and then after i read it thinks me i i will give this to my mistress directly and that persidious thing her husband shall not see it  and so as my ill stars would would have it as i was looking for you i run my hand full in the lions mouth crying   sir brill what an unlucky jade it has been aside   mrs love well have done muslin this is too much   mrs bell upon my word but she gives him his own  i suppose you own the truth of what she says mr lovemore   love pray madam does that lady own the truth of what i have said   mrs love sir i am sensible there is too much truth in what you say this lady has opened my eyes and convinced me that there was a mistake in my former conduct   love come come you need not say any more  i forgive you  i forgive you   mrs love forgive me i like that air of confidence when you know that on my side it is at worst an error in judgment whereas on yours    mrs bell come come you know each others faults and virtues and so you have nothing to do but to mend the former and enjoy the latter  there  there kiss and friends  there mrs lovemore take your reclaimed libertine to your arms   love it is in your power madam to make a reclaimed libertine of me indeed   mrs love from this moment it shall be our mutual study to please each other they embrace   sir brill lovemore may i presume to hope for pardon at that ladys hands   love my dear confederate in vice your pardon is granted  two sad dogs we have been  but come give us your hand  we have used each other damnably  for the future we will endeavor to make each other amends   sir brill and so we will  maam since my lord decamps from before the town may i presume to hope    mrs bell i positively forbid you the least grain of hope whenever i take to myself a husband i must be convinced first that he will answer the trouble of keeping him   sir brill my dear maam by all that is    mrs bell no swearing  i positively will have my own way you shall perform quarantine before i speak to you again   love she is yours man she is yours  she will throw herself into your arms in a day or two  and now i heartily congratulate the whole company that this business has had so happy a tendency to convince each of us of our folly   mrs bell pray sir dont draw me into share of your folly   love come come my dear maam you are not without your share of it this will teach you for the future to be content with one lover at a time without listening to a fellow you know nothing of  because he assumes a title and reports well of himself   mrs bell the reproof is just i grant it   love come let us join the company cheerfully keep our own secrets and not make ourselves a towntalk  though i dont know but if this transaction were sent abroad into the world it might prove a very useful lesson the men would see how their paffions may carry them into the danger of wounding the bosom of a friend  the ladies would learn that after the marriage rites they should not suffer their powers of pleasing to languish away but should still remember to sacrifice to the graces  to win a man when all your pains succeed the way to keep him is a task indeed  finis just published price  s  d  adorned with a neat frontispiece  the desert island a dramatic poem in three acts as it is
