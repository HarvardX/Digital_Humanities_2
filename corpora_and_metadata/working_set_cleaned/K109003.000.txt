three dialogues on the amusements of clergymen  three dialogues on the amusements of clergymen  renounce the world the preacher cries we do  a multitude replies but one as innocent regards a snug and friendly game at cards another can whatever you say perceive no mischief in a play some love a concert or a race and others shooting and the chase reviled yet loved renounced yet followed thus bit by bit the world is swallowed each thinks his neighbor makes too free yet likes a slice as well as he cowper london printed for b and j white fleet street       on the amusements of clergymen when dr josiah framptons library was sold in london in the year      or    0 his divinity books were classed in seven lots one of which was purchased by dr edwards the catalogue of this lot mentioned a parcel of mss among these the doctor found one in dr framptons own handwriting of which the following is a copy  september         i always thought it one of the most fortunate circumstances of my life or rather the most providential as i ought to call it that soon after my leaving college i was led by various and singular accidents to the curacy of wroxal in warwickshire here i met with many civilities from the gentlemen of the country particularly from sir roger burgoin who was equally distinguished for his piety and learning at his house i frequently saw that truly venerable man dr edward stillingfleet afterward bishop of worcester but at that time dean of pauls he had been early connected with the burgoin family and ever preserved a great intimacy with them which he commonly renewed every year by a visit of two or three weeks  what dr stillingfleet saw in me i know not but i thought myself very unworthy of the civilities he showed me i was certainly at that time a very incorrect young man i had entered into the ministry with little attention to the duties i had taken on me to discharge i loved society and was fond of country diversions and though i was fond also of my book i would at any time have left it for a days diversion with the hounds  a ramble in the woods with my gun  or a game of cards and a dance in the evening such as i was however dr stillingfleet was particularly obliging to me and friendly enough to give me a hint now and then with regard to my conduct which i hope i may with truth say was not lost upon me  an opportunity however occurred which enabled me to receive more than casual advantage from his conversation  during one of his annual visits to the burgoin family he was seized with a violent fit of the gout to which his latter years were very subject it happened at this critical time that sir roger burgoin and his lady were called into worcestershire to attend their mother who lay at the point of death and as the dean expressed a desire for my company in their absence i gave him as much of it as i could following not more his desire than my own inclination he was at that time engaged in correcting his origines sacrae this very learned work was written when stillingfleet was under thirty years of age a story is told of his having been put to the blush by bishop saunderson his diocesan who seeing a young man at his visitation of the name of stillingfleet and not knowing his person asked him whether he were related to the great stillingfleet who wrote the origines sacrae for a new edition and had brought down with him several latin books to consult as i could read that language with accuracy enough i was of some little use to him while i read he noted with his pen the passages he wanted the intervals were filled with conversation  we were sitting together one day after dinner and the dean laying up his feet on a cushion and being tolerably free from pain began to rally me a little on my attachment to country diversions  a subject he had often before casually introduced and on which he knew i had a weak side i had brought him two young partridges that day for his dinner and he began by expressing his obligations to me for my attention to him and then asked me some question which led me to give him an account of my days exploits i did not see his drift and in the spirit of a sportsman told him that the late rainy season had made game very scarce  that the two covies from which i had shot the brace i had brought to him were the only birds i had seen the whole day though i had been out from five in the morning till twelve at noon and had walked upwards of fifteen miles  well said the dean with an affected gravity of countenance i only wished to know the extent of my obligation to you and i find your philanthropy has done more for me in giving me seven hours of your time to procure me a dinner than i could have done even were i as able to walk as you are for any man in christendom  from being a little jocular he became by degrees serious i have often thought said he mr frampton and i know your candor will excuse me that the clergy have rather injured the respectability of their characters by mixing too much with the amusements of laymen they not only get into a trifling way of spending their time but by making themselves cheap they diminish the weight of their instructions and often give a sort of sanction by their presence to gaieties which were better checked it is a common speech in the mouths of licentious people that they must be right because they have gotten the parson along with them  indeed a clergyman cannot be too cautious with regard to his character it is a matter of the greatest delicacy and easily sullied if he act contrary to it he always has a consciousness about him which makes him jealous of every eye and when he becomes hardened he is among the most contemptible of mankind  you will easily however understand that when i restrict the clergyman from joining too freely with the amusements of the laity i am equally hurt with every appearance of haughtiness and moroseness if the character of the clergyman is not marked with modesty and humility it is bereft of its most distinguished graces  but said i sir may not example work the other way and the presence of a grave clergyman be a check upon licentiousness  sometimes said he it may and when a clergyman mixes in improper company with this view and is conscious of his own powers of control he imitates that bright example which sorted with publicans and sinners a very respectable clergyman a friend of mine having heard that a favorite youth had been decoyed by bad company into a disreputable house went thither himself and pretending business with the young man sat down on a slight invitation among a set of debauchees trusting his character to its credit he was a man of severe aspect strong sense and ready expression and therefore well fitted for the office he undertook for awhile he overawed by the suddenness of his appearance the vice and folly he was mixed with but well knowing that in a little time the impression he made would go off and he might be liable to affronts he retired before the company could rally their impudence and carried off with him his young friend who would frequently declare afterward that he believed this very circumstance brought him more to recollection than any event of his life and perhaps saved him from ruin  but now my dear sir though i have accommodated your argument with an example i must add that i think the accommodation gives it little support i fear the motive exemplified here has little weight in the common intercourse between the clergy and laity  but may not this intercourse said i sir though without any direct view of leading out of immediate mischief still have its use even the presence of a respectable clergyman i should think might often be a happy restraint  why yes answered the dean but then my good friend you will consider that a young clergyman can rarely act this part years are necessary to give respectability to this mode of instructive intercourse natural talents too which few people possess are necessary a man of morose character may perhaps be of service with his pen in his closet but however pious and wellmeaning he will hardly be of much use in any of the scenes of common life if again we avoid moroseness by assuming the color of our company which must in a degree always be done when we wish to reform in this way i fear instead of doing good we shall do harm  but it is a difficult matter said i sir especially for a young man to preserve those exact bounds of intercourse which his character may require when he enters first into the world and is taken notice of by those who are in a station above him it is hardly possible for him to resist the importunities he meets with to enter into various amusements to drink his glass freely or make one in parties which in fact perhaps he may not approve  no doubt said the dean it may be difficult but do you believe that when god placed you in a state of trial he meant that you should live without difficulties the whole of life is a conflict and if we do not begin early to brace on our moral armor and accustom ourselves to it when are we to enter the field  i should hope it is for want of consideration more than any thing else that so many young clergymen err in this matter i could wish them to fix in their own minds certain bounds to their amusements and remember the poets caution quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum  aye sir said i these certi fines  this narrow path between the citra and the ultra i have often in vain endeavored to pursue and if you can give me any instruction to guide my footsteps better through the amusements of life than they have hitherto been conducted i shall kindly receive them and lay them up in a grateful memory  it is very probable my dear sir said the dean that my rules may be stricter than you would wish to comply with i have thought often on the suject lately for the sake of a young clergyman in whose welldoing i was much interested but i had not all the success i hoped for  i assured the dean i should endeavor to be a more observant disciple i did indeed spend a considerable part of my time in amusements of various kinds but i was hopeful that my errors proceeded more from inattention the apology he was pleased to furnish than from any bad disposition  the good dean was pleased to say he believed me and added some other friendly expressions which not being to our present purpose i omit he then asked me what was my idea of an amusement or how i should define it  this was a puzzling question to one who had trespassed so much on this head and who having never thought much on the subject seldom had any end but barely to please himself i could have given him a definition of amusement but i was afraid of bringing my own practice too much within its censure to gain therefore a little time for reflection i asked whether he meant amusement in general or confined the question to the amusements of clergymen  why truly said the dean the amusements of all people require regulation enough but my question at present relates only to the amusements of the clergy  i answered that i thought bodily exercise was one end and as to the amusement of the mind i thought its only end was to relax and fit it the better for study  your definition said the dean is so far good but it does not go far enough it considers only the purpose of amusement whereas it should also take in the quality you will allow i suppose that the clerical amusement should be suited to the clerical profession  i allowed it certainly  well then said the dean we have now i think obtained a full definition of clerical amusement it should intend the exercise of the body and the recreation of the mind but it should also be suited to the genius of the profession as the first member however of this definition relates to amusement in general and applies as well ad populum as ad clerum we will if you please pass it over at present if we can establish the second part i hope there will be no great danger of mistaking the first i shall only therefore endeavor to show you that all clerical amusements should be suited to the clerical profession  now in order to throw the best light on this subject i should wish to consider amusements under the three heads of riotous and cruel  of trifling and seducing  and lastly of innocent and instructive for i think it very possible that an amusement may be characterized with both these epithets though either may be sufficient are these heads added he comprehensive enough to include all kinds of amusement or do you recollect any other  i thought them sufficiently comprehensive  well then said the dean we will begin with such amusements as are riotous and cruel and among these i should be inclined to assign the first rank to hunting it is an unseeling exercise derived from our savage ancestors who hunted at first for food and consigned the barbarous practice to their posterity for pastime its giving birth to forest laws and game laws  its injuring cornlands and destroying fences  its setting squires and their tenants gentlemen and their neighbors at variance  its consuming the forage of a country in breeding destructive or useless animals in the room of such as are really useful  the riotous uproar of the chase so opposite to the mild serenity which should characterize the clergyman  and the noisy intemperate evening to which it often leads add such an accumulation of mischief to hunting that i should be sorry any clergyman should give his countenance to it  to this we may add the cruelty exercised both on the animals that pursue and the animals that are pursued  the horse pushed to the last extremity  the hound trained to the chase with savage barbarity  at his foot the spaniel dying for some venial fault under dissection of the knotted scourge cowper  and the wretched fugitive agonizing in the extremity of distress  but there is still a greater mischief which often attends these riotous amusements when the squire hunts with his neighbors he introduces no more corruption into the parish than he found but i have sometimes known annual hunts established in sporting countries which draw together hundreds of profligate people from different parts who call themselves gentlemen but are really pests of the neighborhood to which they resort introducing new vices into the villages and every kind of debauchery their servants who are commonly of the same stamp spread the corruption among the peasants and servantgirls which their masters spread among the farmers sons and daughters  the clergyman who mixes in such scenes is far out of sight of the bare decency of his profession  but pray sir said i may not some little plea be offered in favor of hunting is it not a manly exercise does it not furnish our tables with food and rid the country of noxious animals  i beseech you said the dean do not call in argument to defend a pastime which has no alliance with reason call it a wild passion  a brutal propensity  or anything that indicates its nature but to give it any connection with reason is making a union between black and white  but it is manly forsooth to hunt manliless i should suppose implies some mode of action that becomes a man hunting might formerly for aught i know have been a manly exercise when the country was overrun with boars and wolves and it was a public service to extirpate them but to honor with the name of manliness the cruel practice of pursuing timid animals to put them to death merely for amusement is in my opinion perverting the meaning of words there are many ways surely of using manly exercise at least as healthful  and far more innocent and less expensive and dangerous than galloping over hedges gates and ditches if the manliness of the action lie in the risk you run of breaking your neck for no end it would still be greater manliness to jump down a precipice  the foxhunter i doubt not would ridicule the man who runs about with a handnet hunting a butterfly but i protest i see not for what reason the exercise of the butterflyhunter is as good and the pleasure of the chase is to him at least equal  but you allege that hunting supplies the table with food i dare say sir rogers gamekeeper will tell you he could supply it better in many other ways i have certainly no objection to take the lives of animals for food and grant that if they were suffered to multiply they would become noxious what i mean is that i cannot allow turning the destruction of them into an amusement  and least of all into a clerical amusement  i knew a gentleman who took great delight in knocking down an ox which he performed with much dexterity and it was his common amusement to go among the butchers on a slaughteringday and give two or three of them a shilling apiece to let him be their substitute in that operation you call such a man a brute and he surely was one but you would find it difficult to show that the circumstance of riding on a horse and bawling after a pack of dogs makes the amusement less brutal  surely said i sir there is a difference between the pleasure of a pursuit and a pleasure which consists merely in the act of inflicting death  why yes answered the dean there is a difference but i know not on which side of it the advantage lies if hunting be a more genteel species of butchery it is certainly a more cruel one the ox receives its death by an instant stroke whereas the hare is first thrown into convulsions of terror for four or five hours together and then seized in the midst of its agony and torn piecemeal by a pack of ravenous bloodhounds  detested sport that owes its pleasure to anothers pain that feeds upon the sobs and dying shrieks of harmless nature  cowper   as to your last argument that hunting rids the country of noxious animals i apprehend you are mistaken in the fact i rather think it tends to replenish the country with them as one instance at least i can testify that i offended a whole club of sporting neighbors in a manner that was hardly ever to be gotten over by giving a man halfacrown for killing a fox which had thinned my poultryyard and i dare say there is not a hunting squire in the country who would not at any time give up a dozen of his tenants lambs to save half the number of foxes cubs nay i have often known covers of considerable extent left purposely in fields or perhaps planted merely to decoy foxes into a neighborhood by providing a proper shelter for them  but you have provoked me to say all this by aiming to establish an alliance between hunting and rationality i intended not to disturb the squire either in his riotous day or his roaring night i consider his malady as a surgeon does a mortification which has seized the vitals  beyond all hope of recovery what i mean is only to admonish the clergyman not to follow his example  it is but just however to say that examples to warn him might also be found in our own profession i remember a clergyman in a neighborhood where i once lived who had two benefices but he spent little time at either of them because neither happened to be in a sporting country the huntingseason he always spent near a squire in the parish next to mine whose disciplined pack was famous with this gentleman and his hounds he lived on terms of the greatest intimacy indeed both the squire and his dogs looked up to him as their ablest leader though he was a miserable preacher he was uncommonly musical in the field and could cheer and animate his sonorous friends with an eloquence beyond the huntsman himself whose associate he always was and whose place on any emergency he could amply supply he was much readier at finding a hare than a text of scripture and though he was scarce acquainted with the face of one of his parishioners he knew exactly the character of every hound in the squires pack and could run over their names with much more readiness than those of the twelve apostles oh laugh or mourn with me the rueful jest a cassockd huntsman  he takes the field the master of the pack cries well done saint  and claps him on the back is this the path of sanctity is this to stand a waymark in the road to bliss cowper  he had at length the misfortune to break his neck at the end of a foxchase but not till he had first broken the heart of a very amiable woman who had unhappily connected herself with him  such a clergyman said i is hardly to be paralleled in a century but in an inferior degree i fear there are many of our brethren who allow themselves great indulgence i remember a huntingclergyman who received a very proper rebuke from one of his brethren and which i have reason to believe was of service to him as long as he lived he had been lamenting his unfortunate lot in being stationed in a country where there was no hunting the other looking him full in the face said with great gravity of countenance and in a deliberate tone of voice at the great day of accounts the question will not be where have you lived but how have you lived  all this however is carrying amusement to excess but suppose sir when you are riding out you happen to hear the hounds is there any harm merely in taking a little exercise with them if you do not join in the riot of the chase  i hate said the dean to see a man do any thing by halves is it right or is it wrong if it be right do it boldly if it be wrong turn your horse another way and take your exercise in a contrary direction never go to the edge of a precipice you can hardly help going a little farther than you intended i remember hearing a story of a clergyman who was not remarkable for neglecting at least the outward part of his duty but once unhappily forgot it through his love for hunting he was eagerly engaged in a foxchase when the fox took to earth as they call it on which he cried out gentlemen i must leave you this puts me in mind that i have a corpse to bury at four oclock this evening and i fear i shall be an hour too late  besides continued the dean you cannot well avoid in this field of riot at least if you are often seen in it making an acquaintance with several to whom for your characters sake you would not wish to be known  but indeed as i observed to mix in any degree in these scenes of cruelty and riotous exultation is unbecoming the clerical profession  farther still to close my argument with scripture i should wish you to consider that as many good people as well as i disapprove a clergymans mixing in these riotous amusements so of course it will give offense to all these good people no man therefore who has the honor of his profession at heart would give offense where the matter in question is of so little consequence as a mere amusement let him consider how strict st paul was in matters of this kind st pauls example is certainly not very fashionable but with a clergyman i should hope it might have some weight he gives us many hints which come home to the point we are now discussing hunting was out of the question he would not certainly have permitted timothy or titus to hunt if they had been so disposed but he forbids us to give offense in matters that are of much more concern than mere amusement if meat says he make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world stands lest i make my brother to offend  i told the good dean he had silenced me i was afraid my love for the diversion had been founded rather on inclination than argument but nobody again i hoped should ever take offense at my following a pack of hounds  but pray said i sir do you allow shooting it is a much less riotous amusement nay it may even be a solitary one  to speak plainly replied the dean i cordially allow no amusement to a clergyman that has any thing to do with shedding blood  besides i think a peculiar cruelty attends this diversion you may wound and maim as well as kill my heart i am sure would be strongly affected  indeed even my conscience  if i should make a poor animal miserable all the days of its life for the sake of giving myself a momentary amusement  it was but the last autumn when riding down a lane i saw two poor miserable partridges  both bleeding and one trailing a shattered leg after it  fluttering and running before me poor wretches said i i wish the person who put you into this miserable situation may never feel the distress he has occasioned i then ordered my servant to dismount and run after them the lame one he caught the other crawled into a hedge where it probably lingered out its miserable life a few days longer  but the expert marksman i told the dean never shoots among a covey but takes his aim at a single bird  and are all shooters said he expert marksmen and does the expert marksman himself never maim the bird he aims at or the bird that is near it often i have no doubt he maims both  to repel the attack of a bird or beast of prey i have certainly no objection nor to take the life of an animal for food though i should not wish to make a clergyman the butcher whether an ox or a partridge is to be slaughtered but to take the life of an animal except in one or the other of these cases i hold to be absolutely immoral and i think it is no better to run the risk of maiming it and making it miserable for life the most humane way therefore is to take birds with a net which allows you to discharge such as you wish and put to a speedy death those you take for food  but to take birds in a net said i sir is not at all in the spirit of sportsmen  besides there are some species of game as pheasants particularly which cannot be taken in nets  do not tell me replied the dean of the spirit of sportsmen though the ties of humanity no doubt equally bind them yet to such hopeless hearers i should no more attempt to preach than i should to their spaniels  nor do i pretend to know what kind of game may be taken in one way and what in another though i have no doubt but my friend robert sir rogers game keeper could inform me how pheasants might be taken without shooting them but what i labor at chiefly is to convince such soberminded clergymen as i conceive you to be that every species of bloody and cruel amusement is unsuitable to the genius and temper of a christian divine and enters more by habit into a character than is commonly supposed it is under the idea of tainting a character with professional habits that the butcher is prohibited from serving on a jury  for myself sir i replied i am only ashamed that from the dictates of my own reason i have not sooner acknowledged the truths you set before me i always had my doubts but not supposing amusements of this kind to be sinful and not conceiving them to be improper from the eagerness with which numbers of my elder brethren pursue them i stifled my own suggestions but in my present sentiments i believe i shall never fire a gun again for my diversion at any kind of game  to assist your good resolutions said the dean i can suggest two or three other considerations which are worth the attention of a clergyman he can scarce be settled in any place in which he will not find the squire of his parish attached violently to his game and jealous of every man who interferes with him in this great point he is especially jealous of the clergyman whom he considers as an interloper i have known many clergymen get into silly squabbles on this score and by making themselves obnoxious to the squire render themselves much less able to be of service in their parishes on many occasions the squires countenance may be of great use to the clergyman in managing his parochial affairs and it is highly imprudent to lose his assistance for a trifle  i once said i experienced this inconvenience myself but i had the discretion when i found i had raised a jealousy immediately to desist at present i have free permission from sir roger and two or three other gentlemen of the country to range their domains when i please so that i lay down my arms in the plenitude of my power  i should wish still farther to suggest to you continued the dean that if any mischance in these violent exercises should happen to a clergyman it tells much worse than when it happens to another person how oddly would it sound if the parish were told on a sunday there could be no service because the parson had put out his shoulder the day before by a fall at a foxchase if a clergyman lose a hand or an eye in shooting as is sometimes the case i have generally found the commiseration of people mixed with a certain degree of contempt if he had been about his business they would say it would not have happened  the commission also of an accidental mischief in these unclerical amusements will always be more distressing at least it ought to a clergyman than to a layman  poor archbishop abbot was a melancholy instance he was exemplary in many points but unhappily indulged himself in the amusement of shooting and as he was taking this exercise in a park belonging to lord zouch in hampshire he had the misfortune to shoot one of the keepers after this event he never recovered his cheerfulness and party running high it gave his enemies a great handle against him it was brought as a question whether he could ever again officiate as an archbishop after a long inquiry it was determined that he must be degraded but that the king might again restore him which was accordingly done  i could point out a prelate of these days about the beginning of james ii  who does his character no service by being a sportsman formerly he kept a pack of hounds but has had the decency since he obtained a mitre to dismiss them he is still however his own gamekeeper and is so expert that he wants no assistance in furnishing his table with every article of game archbishop abbots misfortune reminds me of a similar accident of which this prelate had nearly been the occasion a young lady who lived near him was riding quietly along a close lane when a gun went off on the other side of the hedge close to her horses ear the beast took fright  started violently aside  and threw her though providentially she was not hurt while her servant was following her horse she walked gently up the lane and coming to an opening in the hedge the bishop in all his shooting accoutrements presented himself he made his apology and hoped she was not hurt she thanked him for his kind enquiry but said she should have been better pleased if it had been needless  i told the dean i remembered something of the story about two years ago in the public prints  yes said the dean she was an arch girl and inserted it in a very ludicrous manner making a laughable contrast between the bishops sporting attire and his lawn sleeves and other episcopal habiliments dr johnsons profound reverence for the hierarchy made him expect from bishops the highest degree of decorum there are gradations he said in conduct there is morality  decency  propriety none of these should be violated by a bishop when a bishop places himself in a situation where he has no distinct character and is of no consequence he degrades the dignity of his order nor was it only in the dignitaries of the church that dr johnson required a particular decorum and delicacy of behavior he justly considered that the clergy as persons set apart for the sacred office of serving at the altar and impressing the minds of men with the awful concerns of a future state should be somewhat more serious than the generality of mankind and have a suitable composure of manners a due sense of the dignity of their profession independent of higher motives will ever prevent them from losing their distinction in an indiscriminate sociality and did such as affect this know how much it lessens them in the eyes of those whom they think to please by it they would feel themselves much mortified  boswells life of johnson vol iii p        well sir said i i hope these examples will prove sufficient cautions to me though i am sorry to receive them from such exalted characters  i should wish you however to believe that i am an enemy to cruelty in all shapes and do not remember that i ever wantonly took the life of the meanest reptile  we certainly said the dean have no right when a spider takes possession of my house or a snail of my garden i make no scruple to destroy them they are invaders but if i meet with either of them in the fields i should think myself the invader if i disturbed them if a wolf attempt to seize a lamb which is my property and under my protection i think his life should pay the forfeit but if he can seize an antelope or any other wild animal with which i have no concern i have no authority to interfere he has the same deed of gift to allege for seizing his prey which i have for the beef or mutton i buy in the market and yet i know not whether i should not put him to death wherever i found him as a proscribed villain as always acting under at least a tacit declaration of war against me if i were not well assured he would attack me when he could i am persuaded i should never molest him  man regulates his actions toward his fellowmen by laws and customs but certainly there are laws also to be observed between man and beast which are equally coercive though the injured party has no power of appeal  i fully accede said i sir to your code of criminal law between man and beast it is certainly power not right that we appeal to in wantonly disposing of the lives of animals and what surprises me the more is we often see this wanton breach of natural law in men of humanity an acquaintance of mine who is as ready as any man to do a goodnatured action will stand whole mornings by the side of a bridge shooting swallows as they thread the arch and flit past him he is however no clergyman  let him be what he will said the dean his profession has been mistaken and he ought to have been bred a butcher i can have no conception of the humanity of a man who can find his amusement in destroying the happiness of a number of little innocent creatures sporting themselves during their short summer in skimming about the air and without doing injury of any kind pursuing only their own little happy excursions and catching the food which providence has allotted them  but i have seen instances enough of this kind of cruelty to remove all surprise more offense from such despotism i never remember to have taken than about five or six years ago in a little voyage i made into the irish sea a nephew of mine the captain of a cruizer whom you saw here last summer was then lying at milfordhaven and being about to take the voyage i have mentioned was desirous to carry me with him as i had expressed an inclination to see the wonderful rocky barrier which nature had formed against the ocean along many of the coasts of wales as we drew near a promontory where the rocks were lofty we found them inhabited by thousands of seafowl of different kinds which at that season frequent them i was greatly amused with seeing the variety of their busy actions and different modes of flight and with hearing the harsh notes of each when single and their varied tones changed into a sort of wild harmony by the clangor of all together one should have thought a colony like this might have been safe from all annoy they are useless when dead  and harmless when alive  we saw however as we proceeded two or three boats anchoring at different distances in which were certain savages  i can call them by no other name  diverting themselves with shooting at these poor birds as they flew from their nests or returned to them with food from the sea destroying not only the parentbirds but leaving the helpless progeny to clamor in vain for food and die of hunger this mode of taking life for no end is a species of cruelty which i should wish to brand with the severest name and should almost detest a clergyman who should find his amusement in it  i must allow said i sir that what you have said against hunting and shooting has entirely convinced me of the impropriety of both as clerical amusements  you have said nothing however against fishing do you allow me to suppose this amusement to be a clerical one it is silent quiet and may be contemplative  i am afraid replied the dean i shall be thought too rigid if i abridge a clergyman of this amusement only i absolutely enjoin him not to impale worms on his hook but to fish either with an artificial fly or a dead bait if he like fishing with a net i approve it more but still i cannot bring myself to recommend any amusement to him which arises from destroying life  but said i sir fishing seems to have scriptural authority many of the apostles were fishermen and our savior himself bids peter cast his hook into the sea  why yes answered the dean but i doubt whether we get much from these authorities fishing you know was the occupation of several of the apostles they fished with nets for a livelihood and st peter you will remember did not cast his hook into the sea for his amusement however you find i am not very rigid on this head  indeed all i have said about taking the lives of animals amounts only to this  that we have no right to do it except for food or to get rid of a nuisance  and that when we are obliged to take life we should always take it in the easiest manner all this appears to me so much the dictate of nature and truth that no man can controvert it in reason whatever he may do in practice but the clergyman is under the still stricter ties of decency and respect to his character  but have not you sir said i confined within too strict a limit the power of man over the lives of animals are there not other reasons besides obtaining food and the removal of a nuisance which may make the exercise of that power lawful may we not take the whale for his oil and the beaver for his fur  i allow it said the dean where the uses of man preponderate his right over the animal seems just but perhaps greater liberty may be commonly taken in this matter than my code will allow if the use be trivial i reject the claim i permit you to take the whale for his oil but i should not readily grant you leave to destroy the elephant for his tooth  i told the dean i saw the difference very plainly but said i sir do you allow the philosopher to take life in making his researches into nature in examining the wonders of the microscope in tracing the circulation of the blood in discovering the properties of air and in other things which tend to advance human knowledge and often serve some great end of utility  this question said the dean is rather more difficult what promotes human knowledge or serves any essential purpose of utility is certainly of more consequence than the life of an animal and i give you liberty to take it when you are sure your motive is good but i should interdict this privilege to mere curiosity we may believe on the credit of others that the blood circulates or that an animal will die in an exhausted receiver  i then asked the dean if he did not think on the other hand that we might carry our tenderness in taking life too far i have frequently said i deserted a path i wished to walk in because i have found it preoccupied by a train of ants which it hurt me to crush and yet i have sometimes thought my caution unnecessary  no doubt replied the dean every virtue has its extremes  its ultra as we just observed as well as its citra i have often seen this tenderness in taking life carried to a ridiculous length if we can call any thing ridiculous that is founded on an amiable principle i knew a humane man who would not suffer a mouse to be taken in a snaptrap he allowed it to be taken alive but he took care to have it carried to a distance into the fields and there set at liberty he would not destroy a spider though he made no scruple to sweep away its web my dear sir i once said to him your tender mercies are cruel it would certainly be more merciful to dispatch these poor animals at once than to make them miserable by turning them adrift or leaving them to a languishing death by taking from them their means of subsistence all this therefore seems to me absurd it is making the lives of animals of more consequence than they should be it is making a man miserable for the sake of a mite for if we carry this tenderness as far as it will fairly go we ought neither to eat a plum nor taste a drop of vinegar it is not size which gives value to life the insect that forms the blue of a plum or that frisks in a drop of vinegar has certainly the same claim to exist as a spider or a mouse and how far life extends we know not so that our tenderness in this respect if indulged to excess might be endless like indian bramins we should not dare to lie down or set a foot to the ground without examining every footstep with microscopical exactness but as these little swarms of nature interfere thus with all the concerns of men it is plain that providence does not lay much stress on their lives all therefore that seems required in these cases is to abstain from wanton injury  i would not however have you always take the measure of a mans virtue by the extraordinary tenderness of his feelings i knew a gentleman so extremely tender toward the lives of animals that when an earwig crept out of a log of wood which had been laid on his fire he forbade any more logs to be taken from that pile and left it to rot yet this very man with all these nice feelings about him lived avowedly in a state of adultery such tenderness therefore may or may not be allied to virtue  certainly not necessarily so allied it is founded merely in nature but when any one affection of the mind is regulated by a religious principle there is in that mind a controlling power which regulates other affections thus if we abstain from cruelty on a religious principle we may depend on that principle on other occasions as to these delicate feelings they seldom reach beyond their immediate object  here the dean made a pause and after a little recollection said he thought we had now run over all the riotous and cruel amusements which he could recollect as for cockfighting and horseracing he added they are such gambling diversions that i conceive no clergyman would even be present at the former nor enter into the spirit of the latter the raceground is a wide field and if he ever enter it for curiosity he will not only avoid the deep concerns and commerce of the place if i may so phrase it but will also keep entirely aloof from the noise and bustle and clamor of the scene a friend of mine lived on the confines of a celebrated raceground he was fond of horses merely as beautiful objects which he liked to see in their various motions and as people are generally well mounted at a race and much agitated he used to gratify his curiosity by walking out in an evening about the time the race was over and would get behind some hedge where unseen he had a good view of the company returning from their sport over a fair plain this was to him the only amusement of a race and he would say he believed he had more pleasure from the sober enjoyment of this moving picture than any one could feel who entered into the wild joy and jollity of the scene  here our conversation ended at that time the good dean complaining that his feet grew a little troublesome rang for his servant to change his posture and i thinking myself in the way wished him a good night  end of the first dialogue  i thought they deserved to be assaulted  i know not said i sir whether i thought quite so ill of them i have always been accustomed to think that moderately used they were an innocent amusement even for a clergyman  but pray said the dean in examining the propriety or impropriety the innocence or guilt of an action are you to consider how it affects yourself alone or how it affects the public in general  no doubt i replied a publicspirited man will consider his actions in reference to the public  he certainly ought said the dean and this being allowed do not you consider the present rage for cardplaying through all ranks of people as a public evil  i replied it was no doubt an amusement much abused but the abuse i thought lay only at the door of the abuser meat and drink were abused  dress was abused  the bible itself was abused but we must have these things notwithstanding  aye there returned the dean you point out the true distinction you answer yourself we must have the one but need not have the other does it follow because we must have meat and drink though they are abused that we must necessarily have cards also  if then cards be allowed to be a public evil and we are at the same time under no necessity to have them every conscientious man would give up a thing so trifling as an amusement at best is to avert that evil and by refraining he certainly does avert it as far as his own ifluence and example reach  you do not mean said i sir that cards are in themselves essentially bad  why no said he cards in themselves may afford as innocent amusement as any thing else and yet i know not whether this concession is not too much i have been used myself to consider amusements under the head of such as are strictly social and of such as contain in them a principle adverse to society many amusements are of the former kind but cards and some other games in which one party must be victorious and the other subdued encourage a kind of principle somewhat opposite to the social temper and the many little squabbles even among friends at such games prove the truth of my remark however if they could be played at with such moderation as occasioned no heartburning i should be inclined to wave this objection and consider chiefly the excess it is this indeed which creates the great mischief and the example spreads it if cards are played in the parlour they descend to the kitchen and from your parlour and kitchen to those of your neighbor and so on the lust of cardplaying is now become so flagitious that every serious man i affirm ought to withdraw his own example from so general and pernicious a practice the clergyman in particular should dread to sanction what has certainly so bad an effect on the manners of the people  but said i sir my example is of so little weight that it cannot make things either better or worse  there is not replied the dean with some warmth in the whole magazine of false reasoning a more destructive mode of it than this i will not set a good example because i know another will not follow it so nobody will set a good example we have betterrules surely to direct us than the practice of other people when a man thus puts his own practice and example into the hands of others and depends upon his neighbors conduct to regulate his own what reformation can we expect if we are right under such circumstances it is by chance every mans example has its influence more or less which he should endeavor for the sake of good order to make as instructive as he can without troubling himself with the example of others in families where cards are never played at in the parlour i dare take upon me to say they are rarely played at in the kitchen except perhaps where servants who have already learned their lesson in cardplaying families are introduced  and if the obligation to avoid setting a bad example in this instance be general it binds the ecclesiastic with double force he should certainly be the salt of the earth and endeavor to keep every thing as far as he can from corruption consider what a change even that might effect there are perhaps twenty or thirty thousand ecclesiastics of different denominations scattered about the various parts of england if each of these influence a dozen which including their own families is no extraordinary calculation consider what a party would be gained over each of these again we may suppose might have some influence and if we may adopt our saviors allusion we might hope to see it work like leaven through the whole mass at least we might hope to see cards confined within the gloomy walls of gaminghouses and nightcellars  but i should think said i sir we should begin our reformation at these places if we could get rid of gaminghouses and nightcellars which the high and low vulgar frequent cards might perhaps be left to us sober people as an innocent amusement  not so entirely my good friend answered the dean it is not only when cards are carried to this pernicious height that i except against them indeed when a man has taken his degrees at a gamingtable i have done with him he is beyond receiving instruction from me i must therefore inform you that i do not confine the gamingtable to what is called so as they say  i rank under that head all those scenes of profligacy scattered not only through the metropolis but through every part of the country where high stakes are pledged and welldressed people meet not so much with a view of amusement as with a purpose to pillage one another  these however are only the excesses of cardplaying but for various other reasons it should be discouraged in the best light i think cards afford only a frivolous and seducing amusement especially to a clergyman they often lead him into more expense still short of what may be called gaming than may be prudent for him to incur once engaged in the habit of playing or listed if i may so phrase it into the corpse of cardplayers he cannot sometimes avoid venturing higher stakes than he could wish  but suppose he keep the scales of loss and gain pretty even as i have sometimes heard the moderate cardplayer boast what shall we say for the expense of time here comes in a very seducing part evening after evening is lost the afternoon is often added habits are formed play and comfort are connected and the day ends in joyless vacancy that does not conclude with cards  besides you give yourself into the hands of others it is unsocial to break up a party you are not therefore master of yourself  then again consider you cannot choose your company you are a known cardplayer you cannot stand out when a hand is wanted and must often consort with those you disesteem  above all young people should consider how easily where amusements are concerned the mind glides into habits of indulgence in these journeys of pleasure step follows step mechanically i knew a young lady thus debauched into a cardplayer though she was once among the most amiable of her sex  domestic  ingenious  fond of books  full of resources and never at a loss for the employment of her time family amusements were all the pleasures she sought her father and mother were excellent people and brought her up an only daughter in what i may justly call the cheerful restraints of religion but during a short visit at a relations to which her father reluctantly consented she unhappily got a taste for cardplaying and when she returned home did not much enjoy those innocent domestic circles in which before she had given and received so much pleasure in short she had lost her heart to this vile amusement soon afterward she married a young gentleman of fortune  a sober virtuous and modest young man but of talents very inferior to those of his wife with discretion she might have modelled her family as she had pleased and had an excellent model before her in her fathers but she chose rather to corrupt her husband and turn his mansion into a gaming house  i mention this example as one among a hundred i have seen in my life to show the rapid progress of pleasurable habits and those of cards perhaps beyond all others to which i think particularly belongs that excellent adage principiis obsta  but since said i sir we are often obliged to consort with those whom we disesteem or with those whose minds are too unfurnished to bear a part in conversation is it not useful and often necessary to introduce something that removes for the time at least all disgusts  something that may level those who have not sense with those who have and enable them to pass their time together in mutual civility without laboring to support a conversation which most probably more than half of them are utterly unable to support  this is the first time said the dean smiling i ever heard cards mentioned as a bond of benevolence as the cause of illhumour and dissension i have often heard them taxed but i suppose you do not hold the argument seriously you cannot imagine cards to be more effectual to this end than even those modes of general civility which commonly reign among polite people and check during the intercourse all appearance of such little hostilities as may rankle within at least you must allow that cardplaying is not quite a clerical mode of inculcating benevolence  and as to your solicitude to lower the man of wit and sense to a level with his neighbors and bring conversation to an equilibrium i think it illjudged if the man of sense have any goodnature in his composition he will not be much hurt at bestowing on his weaker neighbor a pittance of his own information and wisdom at least it is not well done in you to furnish him with an apology to withhold it how is the poor man to improve if on his coming into company an immediate stop is put to all conversation by calling for cards  however i consider this argument only as a shuffle any conversation is surely better than the dull monotony of a cardtable he who can bear the conversation of a card player may bear any thing for myself i protest i should make better company of a parrot  i cannot said i truly say much for the conversation of a cardtable except that it is innocent and may keep conversation from taking a worse turn  why yes said the dean and so it would if you should clap a gag into every bodys mouth when he went into company at the same time i should lay but little stress either on one expedient or the other a short restraint affords no amendment bring the axe to the root of the tree  correct the heart  and you do something but till that be done the propensity to scandal may be checked but will find its opportunity to break out whether you play at cards or not perhaps like fermenting liquor it may burst out with more violence from having been confined  but perhaps said i sir it may be worth consideration that if people do not employ their vacant time on cards they may do worse  i know not what they can do worse answered the dean if you respect their amusements only and if you think cards will keep a young fellow from the stews or a debauch when he is inclined to either i fear you attribute much more to them than they deserve if a man be fond of two games both are amusements and so far as there is a similitude between them the love of one may perhaps overpower an attachment to the other but when a man is fond of a game and addicted to a vice as there is no similitude between the objects you have no more ground for expecting the former will drive out the latter than for supposing a mans dancing a minuet should prevent his admiring a picture  you drive me said i sir out of all my strong holds but you must give me leave to make one observation more i have heard sickly people speak of cards as a great relief in pain when the mind is incapable of any other attention and if exciting this frivolous attention will draw it from attending to its malady cards i think are an opium and may often be called a blessing  i have certainly no objection replied the dean to their being used medicinally but then i should wish to have them sold only at the apothecarys shop and the doctor to prescribe the use of them i should fear if the patient prescribed for himself he may be apt to take too large a dose as he often does of laudanum and other anodyne drugs i once knew an old lady who had lost the use of her speech and of both her hands by two or three paralytic strokes and every evening took the remedy you have been prescribing she was a lady of large fortune  gave good suppers  and had generaly a number of humble friends about her one of whom always after supper dealt sorted and held her cards and pointing to this or that the old lady nodded at the card she wished to have her friend play but it sometimes happened that the paralytic shake of the head was mistaken for the nod of approbation and unfortunately a wrong card was played which threw the old lady whose whole heart was in the remedy she was taking into such violent fits of passion that people thought she received more injury from these irritations than benefit from the prescription  i fear said i sir from all this ridicule that you thought what i advanced rather impertinent  my ridicule replied the dean was not surely directed at you but at those poor pitiable objects who cannot even at the close of life be happy without their cards i have heard of many such and have known some at a time when serious thoughts and meditation are the most becoming it is pitiable in the last degree to see the dregs of life running off in so wretched a manner if there is any thing in human nature which unites contempt and commiseration said a friend of mine coming from a sight of this kind it is the spectacle of a man going down to the grave with a pack of cards in his hand  indeed said i sir these frightful examples are of themselves sufficient warnings  but i have done i give up my cause i was willing to say what i could for an amusement in which i fear i have had too great an interest but i hope sir i shall not be the worse either for your ridicule or your instruction  after all however it must be confessed that we young clergymen have a difficult part to act the prevalence of custom is a vehement tide which we find it very hard to stem  i should therefore said the dean wish you to keep out of it which every man may if he please be resolute at first in resisting importunity and importunity will presently cease you will soon be considered as one who has a will of his own  the clergy i think may be divided into two great bodies one class are such as enter into the ministry only to make their fortunes these are a kind of amphibious animals i cannot call them clergymen they are traders in ecclesiastical goods with them my arguments have nothing to do they have no scruples and will comply of course with every thing that will recommend them to the world  in the other class are many no doubt who have the end and honor of their profession at heart and wish only to be convinced of the propriety or impropriety of a thing to do it or leave it undone but there are numbers i fear in this class wellmeaning on the whole and serious men who are yet ready to make the customs of the world an apology for a variety of improper practices and slide into a number of corrupt habits without considering that to oppose the seducing customs of the world is the very essence of a state of trial and that it is the very business of a good pastor to set up his own example as a way mark against them  to all this i fully assented  aye mr frampton continued the dean with much earnestness in his manner these are serious truths the customs of the world put a gloss upon many improper things  among which i reckon cards and mislead numbers who are glad perhaps to misinterpret the apostle and tell you that if they do them not they must altogether go out of the world but whatever liberties the layman takes and yet i know not what gives him any exclusive liberty the clergyman ought to be particularly guarded against the indulgence of any amusement which is fraught with so much mischief both public and private which so easily gains ground by the force of habit and in the defense of which you see so little can be said many bad habits subside in age nature cannot hold out but here is a mischievous propensity which cleaves often to our very last sand it is possible i may yet live to see people so barefaced as to make no distinction of days and play at cards on sundays it is practiced i am informed in france from which we derive too many of our fashions  i told the dean that as i believed i was better acquainted with the history of cardplaying than he was i was afraid that vile practice though not frequent had gotten at least some footing among us one instance i knew i had not long ago the honor to be admitted in a dearth of better company to the cardtable of a lady of fashion soon after i found she played at cards on sundays when fearing lest i should be involved in the imputation of that practice i never would touch another card at her house on her calling me to account for deserting my post i plainly told her the reason this led to a short debate she said after the duties of the day were over for she was a constant churchwoman she thought a little recreation in the evening was very allowable i talked of the great impropriety at least of breaking down fences and laying the practice open to the common people even though she would not allow any profanation of the day she thought the fault lay in the cattle that went through the breach at length however she allowed that playing at cards on a sunday was a very improper practice to get among the lower people  and farther that when carried to the height of gaming it was a very improper sundayamusement to any one i begged she would suffer me to show her merely on these two concessions of her own the mischief of playing at cards at all on a sunday and that she might see it in the stronger light i offered to put my arguments on paper but i could never obtain leave she always stopped my mouth with saying she had made up her mind and wished to hear no more on the subject  i honor you said the dean as i should every young clergyman who could make so proper a stand against a vicious fashion  and now in return for your story in which you have given me an instance of some duplicity i will contrast it with one of genuine simplicity a friend of mine had a curate recommended from cambridge an excellent young man who had never been in a scrape during the whole time he had been at the university he was addicted to no improper amusement and cards in particular he disliked it happened however on some singular occasion i believe on that of a young ladys coming of age he was invited among several other young folks to spend an evening where cards made a part of the entertainment he stood out strenuously as wholly ignorant of every game at last some general game we have among us at present a kind of game which is called a round game from the companys sitting round a table the dean probably alludes to some such game as this which might be in use in his time i know not what they call it being proposed and some of the company as corruptors are always at hand instructing him in what he could not but feel he had powers of mind to comprehend he was drawn in and sat down though little attentive to the business in which he was engaged at the end of the game when the accounts of profit and loss were settled his companions gave him four shillings to his great surprise for certain little ivory fish which he had received in the course of the game the next morning when he told the story he said it was a fortunate thing that he had been successful for if he had lost four shillings instead of winning them he should certainly have gone off without paying his debt as he had not the least conception that the ivory fish he had received represented any thing but themselves  the good dean having thus dispatched the cardtable led me next to the playhouse what a noble institution said he have we here if it were properly regulated i know of nothing that is better calculated for moral instruction  nothing that holds the glass more forcibly to the follies and vices of mankind i would have it go hand in hand with the pulpit it has nothing indeed to do with scripture and christian doctrines the pageants as i think they were called of the last century used to represent scripturestories which were very improperly introduced and much better handled in the pulpit but it is impossible for the pulpit to represent vice and folly in so strong a light as the stage one addresses our reason the other our imagination and we know which receives commonly the more forcible impression there should always however be a little dash of the caricature to give a zest to character but nature and probability should be strictly observed i remember  i believe it is now thirty years ago  seeing a play acted i forget its title in which an old fellow is represented dallying with a coquettish girl it was an admirable picture from nature the sprightly actions of youth imitated by the ridiculous gesticulations of age struck my memory so forcibly that the picture is yet as fresh as if it had been painted yesterday  as moral representations i cannot say i think shakespeares plays are models there is a fund of nature in them  vast invention  and a variety of passions admirably colored i wish i could forget the loose fancy which wantons through most of them and is extremely disagreeable to a chaste ear but what i chiefly remark is that i do not commonly find in them what i should wish to find in every play some virtue or good quality set in an amiable light or some vice or folly set in a detestable one and made as it were the burden of the whole i call the scenes of falstaff admirable copies from nature but i know not what instruction they give now i should wish to turn the playhouse into a mode of amusing instruction and to suffer no theatrical performance which did not eminently conduce to this end young men for instance are apt to be led away by vicious pleasures and to supply their profligacy are often carried from one degree of wickedness to another a play on such a subject there was afterward a play formed on this very plan entitled george barnwell the moral of which is good though the execution is far from being faultless might perhaps deter many a young man in the beginning of his career or a good effect might be produced by placing some virtue in opposition to its contrary vice as contrasts generally have more force than simple exhibitions  i asked the dean if he meant to exclude comedy from his theater  by no means said he i should rather encourage it more than tragedy inasmuch as i should have more hope of curing such vices and follies as require the lash than such as require the gibbet my stageauthors should deal much in ridicule which when well conducted and not thrown on individuals but cast broadly on vice and folly i conceive to be an admirable engine but i should not ridicule a squinting eye  a stammering voice  a provincial dialect  the peculiarities of a profession  or indeed any oddity or deformity that was not strictly immoral  i am afraid said i sir you will cut off much of our modern wit by this severity for these oddities are in general a great source of it the broken english of a frenchman  the blunders of an irishman  or the broad dialect of a scotsman are what our modern theaters are taught to believe very witty i shall however to speak for one think myself much obliged to you for ridding the stage of all this trumpery of false wit and humor and bringing only such ridiculous characters forward as can support themselves if i may so speak by their real follies and vices  but there is one thing which i fear will incapacitate the stage from being of much use in the reformation of manners the scenery the dresses the music and other appendages of the theater make the expense so great that it can never be brought to a level with the pockets of the multitude  that is well urged said the dean i thank you for the hint and will immediately model my dramatic representations in conformity to it  we have one church for rich and poor all pay equal homage to one god  all are equally his creatures  and it is fit we should all worship him in one place  but though we have only one church there is no necessity to have only one theater in my utopia therefore i mean to establish two  one for the higher  the other for the lower orders of the community in the first of course there will be more elegance and more expense and the drama must be suited to the audience by the representation of such vices and follies as are found chiefly among the great the other theater shall be equally suited to the lower orders and to enable them the better to partake of the moral amusement provided for them i mean to abolish all tumbling  dancing  bearbaiting and every thing else that tends only to encourage merriment without instruction  you have now said i sir perfectly satisfied me i shall heartily rejoice in the erection of your two theaters and it gives me great delight to hear you speak so favorably of the drama i own if there is any one amusement which appears to me superior to all others it is to see a good play well acted  but hold said the dean you understand i hope that i give this commendation only to theaters of my own regulating not to such as at present exist with a few exceptions i think i may describe the drama of the present age it must be observed that the drama of that age was exceedingly corrupt charles the second had introduced great license into the theater bad as the stage still is in this respect it is much chaster than it was then  as having nothing less in its view than good morals amorous scenes  vicious principles  the most indelicate language  debauched characters set off in agreeable colors  scoffs thrown out against religion and morals  with light music tending to soften the mind and make it still more susceptible of those vile incentives that had already been excited are too much i fear the ingredients of our theatrical amusements and even if the play were good and tended to give the thoughts any virtuous impression the light farce coming after would throw the whole at once out of the mind all farces i should recommend to my lower theater the style of all its compositions should be somewhat in this way but they should all certainly have a moral tendency the sarce as at present used is a most absurd excrescence and i suppose intended merely to please the vulgar as there is an upper gallery the people there must be pleased as well as those in the boxes but my two theaters will render this double mode of representation unnecessary  in short if the stage were regulated as i could wish it even clergymen almost might be actors upon it as it is now managed they cannot well i think be innocent spectators tacitus i remember somewhere speaking of the modesty of the german ladies attributes it in a great measure to their not being suffered to attend public diversions the words of the original are nullis spectaculorum illecebris nullis conviviorum irritationibus corruptae  i should wish only to make one improvement on this german fashion which is neither to permit gentlemen nor ladies to attend them till they are better regulated the historian might have reference to the public amusements of his own country with which he thought it happy the german ladies had no opportunities of being corrupted whatever his precise meaning was it shows his general opinion of such amusements and i suppose you will allow tacitus though not an apostle to be a very good judge of men and manners  besides added the dean the very profession of a player is rendered so disreputable that nobody ought to encourage it take the matter home with you would you wish either your son or daughter to seek a livelihood on the stage if not do you think it shows much moral rectitude to encourage in other peoples children what on virtuous principles you would shudder at in your own  i told the dean i durst not take upon me to answer his invective either against the stage or its professors i feared there was more truth in what he had said than i wished to find a clergyman i observed must often be in the way of hearing and seeing improprieties which he cannot avoid but i allowed it certainly to be a different case when he went voluntarily into the way of these things  i then asked the dean what he thought of dancingassemblies and cheerful meetings of other kinds  as they are at present managed said the dean so far as i am acquainted with them i should hardly allow a clergyman to attend any of them put them under my regulation and he may attend them all  for the sake of truth i replied i must say that i have attended the assemblies at our countytown not constantly indeed but very frequently and i do not remember ever seeing except perhaps once or twice what the most exact person would call the least breach of decorum or good manners  i know not said the dean what you precisely mean by the least breach of decorum but before i should give my sanction to the assemblies at your countytown i should wish to ask a few question is all company that are well dressed promiscuously admitted  or admitted on the introduction of nobody can tell who  is there no vying in dress and ornament and fashion  are no cardtables introduced  are suppers and drinking and late hours excluded  while you are dancing or carding or drinking above stairs is any care taken of your poor servants below  are they left to saunter about innyards and taphouses to get into bad company  or not knowing what to do with themselves to debauch one another unless you can answer me rationally on all these heads i shall never suffer any clergyman over whom i have influence to attend any of these meetings it may difficult perhaps to prevent the layman from filling the heads of his sons and daughters with dress and vanity and folly and intrigue and all the impertinence that attends such promiscuous illregulated assemblies  we must leave him if he please to set them an example himself and go before them in all these scenes of dissipation  we must leave him also to take no more care of the morals of his servants than if they were his cattle and to pay no attention to the difficulties into which he leads them if he will run into these excesses i have no better word in my dictionary to explain my meaning i cannot prevent it but certainly i should wish the clergyman to be very cautious how he gives any encouragement to such assemblies by his example the world may laugh at him but he must learn to bear the ridicule of the world and i hope in return he will meet approbation elsewhere  but said i sir i have often heard that prudent fathers and mothers consider these meetings as places where their daughters are seen to most advantage  aye replied the dean i have lately heard that subject discussed in all its folly by one of these prudent mothers to whom i was weak enough to give my advice on this head for the sake of an amiable goddaughter of mine i hate the idea of carrying young women like colts to a fair it is indelicate it is below their dignity they should not seek but be sought after few happy marriages i believe are founded on these hasty impressions  i shall not however say more on this point as i am not instructing the world at large but only giving advice to my brethren of the clergy let the beau suit himself with a belle and choose a wife from the madeup young ladies who are taught to say smart things and shine at assemblies and whose heads are fuller of fashions than of such knowledge as most becomes them but when the clergyman thinks it prudent to change his condition let him look for a wife in some domestic family and endeavor to choose one whom he hears sober people commend for her private virtues and if she happen to be known in any polite circle and dignified by the name of a lifeless inanimate thing he has still the better chance for happiness  as i was always fond of dancing i did not care to let the argument wholly drop and told the dean i hoped he had no dislike to dancing in itself but only when it was improperly circumstanced it appeared to me a very innocent winterevening amusement  it appears so to me said the dean i have already told you that if you will suffer me to regulate your dancings and other eveningmeetings i will freely indulge you in them  summon an assembly when you please at some private house public houses always lead to promiscuous company and intemperance let the meeting consist of welleducated and welldisposed young people of both sexes and when the music strikes up and the dance begins send for me and i will hobble away as fast as my gouty feet will allow and if i may be permitted quietly to occupy a corner of the room in an elbowchair i shall enjoy the scene as much as any of you to see youth and innocence made happy amidst such amusements as are suitable to them always gives a new joy to my philanthropy which is as suddenly injured when i see them entangled in pleasures which i cannot but look upon as secret snares for their innocence  and yet i cannot say i should wish to see a clergyman except perhaps a very young one more than a spectator of these amusements to see him today sailing about in a minuet step and tomorrow preaching in a pulpit might make a contrast perhaps too strong for some of his hearers i do not however wish to determine precisely the amusement is certainly innocent  with regard to the other meetings you mention if you put them under the same rational restraint i have no objection to any of them i should be pleased to meet a set of virtuous wellbred young men or a mixed company either at dinner or supper and if their chief end were either conversation or innocent amusement i should do the best in my power to amuse and enliven them nor should i expect them all to be men of agreeable manners ingenuity and information i should only indulge the hope of their having the same dislike that i had to transgress the rules of decency and propriety  but as for clubs met together on set purpose to be joyous  to drink and to rattle  to sing songs and catches  to roar and stagger as the evening gets late i hold them in abhorrence no clergyman johnson and his friend beauclerk were in company with several clergymen who thought they should appear to advantage by assuming the lax jollity of men of the world johnson who they expected would be entertained sat grave and silent for some time at last turning to beauclerk he said by no means in a whisper the merriment of these parsons is mighty offensive  bos life vol iii p       should ever join in such orgies and i should think very meanly of him if he should frequent a company that had the least tendency to that riotous mirth which produces these improprieties of behavior  you seemed to mention said i sir with a mark of disapprobation songs and catches do you see any thing particularly mischievous in them  by no means replied the dean when they are not found in bad company and when the words are such as neither countenance vice nor violate decorum if the select assembly we just left dancing choose to amuse themselves after their dance or after supper with singing i should not only approve it but beg leave to listen to them even the clergyman i will allow to sing in such an assembly though i should warmly reprove him if he should sing for the entertainment of a mixed company or at a public meeting  if i should not be thought precise or puritanical i should now and then recommend a psalmtune especially on a sunday evening we have several psalmtunes which are very fine and when sung in parts by sweet female voices are in my ear more harmonious than any other species of music and in the language of our great but unfashionable poet at that day milton on the account of his political principles was not in general esteem  divide the night and lift our thoughts to heaven  at the same time i cannot say i am a friend to instrumental music on a sundayevening from no objection to the thing itself though indeed i think harmonious voices sweeter when unaccompanied but i should fear its being misconstrued by undistinguishing people to whom we should always be careful not to give offense psalms are sung in churches and can lead into no mistake but fiddles and flutes and harpsichords are merry instruments and in some peoples opinion can never be accommodated to purposes of devotion occiduus is a pastor of renown when he has prayed and preached the sabbath down with wire and catgut he concludes the day quavring and semiquavring thought away the full concerto swells upon your ear all elbows shake  will not the sickliest sheep of every flock resort to this example  if apostolic gravity be free to play the fool on sundys why not we if he the tinkling harpsichord regards as inoffensive what offense in cards strike up the fiddles let us all be gay laymen have leave to dance if parsons play cowper   as to catches i know little of them but from what i do know they make no attempt either at sense or sentiment the harmony may be good and if the words though senseless have no illmeaning i shall not reprobate though i cannot commend them  having dispatched said the dean all our riotous and cruel amusements and likewise such as are trifling and seducing though they often as in some instances just observed intermingle with each other i should now introduce you to such amusements as i think proper for a clergyman but as the evening grows late we will take an earlier hour if you please tomorrow to discuss them  end of the second dialogue third dialogue the next day was sunday when i happened to be wholly engaged but on monday i waited on the good dean soon after dinner  i am impatient said i sir to have another conversation with you you have taken from me my gun and my dog you have prohibited my playing at cards and have refused me leave to go to an assembly or to meet my friend at a tavern and i cannot but be solicitous to know what amusement you will at length allow me  but are not you replied the dean rather unreasonable i have indeed taken your gun but as to your dog you may keep him if you please for a companion i have no objection have i not at least connived also at your fishing have i not introduced you to many agreeable societies have i not given you leave to sing and to dance and does not all this satisfy you however i mean still to do more i wish only to make your amusements  your habits  your company  your dress  and your profession all agree  by the way i am not a little solicitous about the dress of a clergyman which i think a matter of more consequence than the generality of people will perhaps allow i think it an argument of great lightness in a clergyman to endeavor as far as he can to adopt the layhabit he shows he has embraced his own profession only for reasons of convenience and in his heart dislikes its restraints i should wish to have every clergyman especially when in full orders obliged to appear always in a short cassock under his coat he could not then so easily adopt improprieties in his dress and might be more upon his guard also against improprieties in his behavior his clerical habit would be a continual call upon him for decorum as he durst not in that garb do many things which dressed like a layman he might be tempted to do besides it might tend to keep such young men out of the church as when in it are a disgrace both to it and to themselves clothing was originally intended for the sake of decency and warmth in civilized societies it became afterward of use to distinguish ranks and if in this instance the distinction were a little more enforced it would i am persuaded have a good effect  i hope sir said i that my wardrobe if it were all produced before you would give you no offense nothing would be found there but what is strictly clerical indeed i myself have been often highly offended at the improper dress of many of my younger brethren i wonder not therefore at your being offended  so far then answered the dean i may presue upon you a a hopeful disciple and that as you are clerical in your dress you will be clerical also in your amusements  now as exercise on which health so much depends is one great end of amusement and as the clerical life may in general be called a sedentary one he who provides amusements for a clergyman should have an especial view to exercise but though i forbade the clergyman to gallop after hounds i have no objection to his mounting his horse and riding a dozen miles in a morning for exercise  but without some end in view i observed few people were fond of a solitary ride  solitary ride exclaimed the dean have you forgotten the philosophers noble adage nunquam minus solus quam cum solus i should allow a man brought up in business to urge such a pretense but in a scholar i cannot admit it the very trot of a horse is friendly to thought it beats time as it were to a mind engaged in deep speculation an old acquaintance of mine used to find its effect so strong that he valued his horse for being a little given to stumbling i know not how far he would say i might carry my contemplation and totally forget myself if my honest beast did not now and then by a false step jog me out of my reverie and let me know that i had not yet gotten above a mile or two out of my road this story was afterward told of dr young  not the author of the nightthoughts but another clergyman of that name remarkable for simplicity of character and absence of mind   but every scholar said i sir has not the art of keeping his thoughts so collected the trotting of a horse even without stumbling may be enough to dissipate his best meditations  if he cannot think answered the dean in one way let him think in another if he cannot lay premises and conclusions together and make a sermon let him consider some letter he has to write  or some conference with a neighbor to manage he must be a very thoughtless fellow if he have not some useful topic to engage his thoughts or perhaps he may have some friend to call upon at worst he may amuse himself with looking at the country around him it is a pleasure to see how differently the corn or the grass grows in different parishes and to mark its progress every season furnishes some new and agreeable scene he sees the woods assume one appearance in the spring  another in summer  a third in autumn  and a fourth in winter and as nature is never at a stand he sees a continual variation in her scenes so that if he have no resources in himself he may still find them in the beauties of nature  but perhaps i objected he is not fond of riding or he may not be able to keep a horse  let him walk then said the dean i should recommend walking to him as every way a preferable exercise over the horseman he will enjoy many advantages he is instantly equipped he has only to take his hat and stick and call his dog besides he need not keep the highway like the horseman he goes over the style  he gets into the devious path  he wanders by the side of the river or through the mead  and if these sequestered scenes do not make him think i know not what can do it  besides he may use as much exercise in half the time which is of consequence to a scholar  and i should suppose as wholesome exercise  but above all things i should wish him to get a habit of thinking methodically as he walks it will soon become as easy to think in the fields as at his desk and he will enjoy at once the double advantage of study and exercise here again he has an advantage over the horseman he has his hands at liberty to manage his memorandumbook and his blacklead pencil which with the encumbrances of a whip and a bridle is more difficult to think methodically on horseback is the work rather of a strong head which can continue and carry on an argument  digest it in the mind  and remember the several parts and dependences of it on foot the memorandumbook eases the head of all this trouble by fixing the argument as it proceeds for myself the exercise of walking with a memorandumbook in my hand has ever been among the first pleasures of my life when i was a young man and could go among my poor neighbors i had three employments at the same time visiting my parish  studying  and using exercise i have made in these excursions many a sermon the greatest part of this book the origines sacrae which the dean had just been correcting was first rudely composed in the fields and when i came home i always digested what had occurred in my walk  consulted my authorities and wrote all fair over and even since i grew old when it pleases god to allow me the use of my feet i still continue the same exercise only instead of being able as i was then to take a fatiguing excursion without paying much attention to roads or weather i am obliged now to shorten my walk  to rest a little and divide it into portions  to creep along easy paths  in gardenwalks or under sheltering hedges  much do i wish said i sir that you could continue with more ease your useful walks in which the world has so much partaken and will long partake  for myself i shall certainly endeavor to imitate an example which i am convinced is so profitable i will immediately get a memorandumbook and hope in time to find more pleasure in bringing home the head of a sermon than i have often done in bringing home a pheasant or a partridge  but still sir there are many pious and good clergymen who may be great blessings to their parishes and yet were never able to compose a sermon themselves and cannot perhaps by any means induce a habit of thinking methodically  what are they to do  why they must endeavor said the dean as i advised the horseman in the same circumstances to find employment for their thoughts as they are able if they are visiting a poor neighbor in sickness or distress they may think what to say on the occasion the duties of his parish will always be a call to exercise and engage a worthy clergyman to be frequently abroad in one shape or other especially if his parish be extensive  he may also take a book and read at intervals which will always furnish some employment for his thoughts  i have heard sir roger speak of the mode of exercise used by his late friend dr bret he would generally during two hours every day sally out into the fields with his spud in his hand and cut up all the weeds he could meet with a field of thistles was to him a sporting country and he used to say good man when he was inclined to boast a little of his benevolent exercise that he believed he did not save his parishioners less than a dozen pounds every year in weeding  but if walking after all except when some end or parishduty is in view cannot be made pleasant to a clergyman let him seek other exercise does he love a garden there cannot be a more clerical amusement than the cultivation of it the flowergarden  the fruitgarden  or the kitchengarden may all afford him great amusement and are perfectly consistent with his character i should think it no discredit to a clergyman to have his vines and his fruit trees better trained by his own hands than those of any professed gardener in the country and even his pease and beans and cabbages to be in a more flourishing condition  if he wish for still stronger exercise let him roll his walks or dig his ground usque ad suderem this will be of great use to him for besides the advantage of it it will enable him to take as much exercise in a couple of hours as will serve him for the day  it is a wise provision in the statutes of some monastic houses to obige their members to employ themselves in manual labor during so many hours in the fourandtwenty nothing can contribute more to give them spirits and rid them of the spleen i have heard that the founder of the famous abbey of la trappe in prescribing this kind of discipline to his convent used to say that as labor was originally laid on man as a punishment for sin we may be assured it is one of the best means of keeping us out of it  i admire his wisdom said i in making the rules of his convent an antidote to the natural indolence of a cloister and i think our church in giving the clergyman a glebe has had something of this kind in its eye i suppose you have no objection to his making the culture of it his amusement  none replied the dean if the selling of his corn and hay do not lead him to bargain among low people at markets i have no objection to any innocent rural employment for myself when i lived in the country i had great pleasure in all these things i used to see my horses and cows foddered used to visit them in their pastures and fed my poultry myself but there are few circumstances in which i should advise a clergyman to gather his own tithe it is an odious business  i asked the dean if he had any objection to botany as an inducement to draw us abroad  not the least said he if it be an inducement  to me it would be none though it is certainly very innocent and if i should judge from the numbers who study it very interesting also to examine the beauty and construction of plants  their infinite variety  and their several uses i can easily conceive might furnish much rational amusement but merely to give them hard names when they already have easy ones and to class them botanically which is in fact to class them so that nobody but a botanist can find them out appears to me something like writing an english grammar in hebrew you explain a thing by making it unintelligible  i must speak however with caution on a subject of which i know so little this censure of botany seems to respect mr ray who was contemporary with dr stillingfleet and the only botanist of note i believe at that time   i then asked the dean what he thought of bowls tennis and cricket as clerical amusements  with regard to bowls said he i am a party concerned and therefore improperly called upon either as an advocate or an evidence i always liked a game at bowls and thought it good exercise in a summerevening it is just exercise enough to give the body a gentle breathing without being too violent with regard to tennis and cricket i must be silent for another reason i know nothing of either of them to none of these exercises however i have any objection if the party which joins you in them be well chosen it is this which makes them innocent or seducing the dean did not perhaps know that there are few tenniscourts which are not places of public resort every amusement so circumstanced he would certainly have interdicted   i think said i sir we have now exhausted all such amusements as go under the name of exercise and i cannot but acknowledge you have been more liberal on this subject than i expected if you will be as indulgent to us in our domestic amusements we shall have no reason to complain what gratification sir on this head are you disposed to allow us  all that is necessary replied the dean for my own part i know not what mental amusement men of science and information want after a studious day except that of conversing with each other nothing gives the mind a more pleasing relaxation you need not talk much if you are indisposed and listening to good sense is no fatigue  nor does any thing excite genius so much as this collision among learned men we are equally pleased with feeling our own sentiments corrected as it is done in a manner by ourselves and with correcting the sentiments of others these meetings among learned men may be called the fair of learning they purchase commodities of each other one man exchanges changes his wit for anothers knowledge and each probably gains what he wants at the expense of something in which he abounds  from this kind of communication too we get a variety of hints which we may afterward turn to use and that without the fatigue of thinking as other people think for us i knew an ingenious man who read little himself but kept much good company and had the art of picking up and turning to account every thing he heard by expanding these hints and throwing beautiful lights and images upon them by the help of a good imagination he would write a sermon or an essay which might be called entirely his own though his friends who lived much in the same company with him could now and then discover how he came by his leading ideas  i should not however advise any young man to seek his knowledge in this vague way it is a hundred to one he is not qualified for it besides it is an indolent way when you rest solely upon it in his books he will always meet with instruction  if the pleasure said i sir arising from the company of learned men could be enjoyed in its full purity it would indeed be a relaxation beyond all others where tempers are well harmonized i can conceive nothing more delightful but as in chemical mixtures one single heterogeneous ingredient often puts the whole mass into a ferment so in these learned societies one man who talks incessantly or disputes eagerly destroys all the pleasure of the meeting and makes us think we might have employed our time more happily with our own solitary meditations for myself indeed i have seldom mixed freely with any one set of people among whom some or other has not been of this troublesome description at college i remember several such intruders on the social pleasures of an evening  it is very true answered the dean noisy talking and eager disputing are two great evils in conversation and are often found more or less in the meetings even of learned and ingenious men and it is a miserable thing when a mans self is the only person pleased with hearing his own conversation nay i will go farther and allow that this is not the only evil which infests these societies there are other things which often render them disagreeable a friend of mine told me lately that in a capital town in england he was a member of a very reputable society consisting of several men of taste and science he was delighted with their conversation and thought his time very profitably spent he soon however found that one or two of the members of this society had a deistical turn this might have been endured if they would have kept their sentiments to themselves and discussed only points of literature but they were forward on all occasions to move questions on religious subjects and would discuss them with very offensive license my friend therefore seeing no remedy left his company and consorted no more with a society where he could not receive pleasure without a great mixture of pain and indeed i must allow with you there are so many things which make these general meetings of literati disagreeable that i know not whether as far as mere relaxation is concerned one has not a better chance for it in the mixed company of wellbred people of both sexes i should at least wish for no more than three or four in a society of select friends to make it agreeable  but said i sir there are many of us poor curates who have few opportunities of getting into company of any kind who live in lonely places and see few besides the peasants of our own parishes what resources have you for us  why in the first place answered the dean the peasants of your parish are in many respects the properest company you can keep you will not mingle with their pleasures and diversions but the good pastor will often find leisure to enter their houses and cottages and see and hear what they are about and in this duty he will find his amusement on this head however i need not instruct you  besides added he we are rather going from the question we are not considering amusement as united with duty but as a relaxation from it  are you musical i know no amusement so adapted to the clerical life as music and indeed not only as an amusement but as a mean often as saul used it to drive away the evil spirit sedentary men are subject to nervous complaints and i have known many a man who could at any time fiddle away a fit of the spleen  i am myself said i musical enough to have sometimes felt the relief you mention though i can on no instrument charm any ears but my own  and what other ears replied the dean do you wish to charm to tell you the truth i should think excellence rather a disadvantage i have known several clergymen who were masters of music get into disagreeable connections by being called on frequently to assist in concerts with people whom it would have been more prudent to avoid  we are willing indeed to suppose that music makes a part of our heavenly enjoyments but on earth i am persuaded it is sometimes found among very unharmonized souls it may drive away a fit of the spleen or moderate some momentary passion but i fear it has not often much effect in meliorating the heart by subduing inordinate affections  if therefore continued the dean you can fiddle so as to amuse yourself i should desire no more  i hope then said i sir my acquirements in this art will not displease you for they are very far from the point of excellence  but i am chiefly solicitous to have your opinion on a still more favorite amusement which is drawing it has given agreeable employment to many a solitary hour in my life and i should be sorry to be debarred the exercise of it  i have no intention said the dean to debar you from it but i must give you one piece of advice as you are fond both of music and drawing i should not wish you to practice both one of these domestic amusements i should think might find sufficient employment for your leisure  this piece of advice is from myself but i am not unqualified to give you other instruction i have no knowledge of the art myself but i remember hearing an excellent judge give instruction to a young man who had a profession as you have and wished to follow drawing only as an amusement in the first place i remember he advised his young friend against coloring which all dabblers are fond of to understand the harmony of colors he said required great experience and without it coloring was daubing he advised him also i recollect against attempting history or portrait or animal life or any other branch in which accurate delineation was required landscape he recommended as the easiest and most pleasing branch which might have the farther advantage of decoying him into the forest or the field to examine or copy nature  i gave the dean my best thanks for his advice of the utility of that part which came from himself i was already convinced by experience and had determined to drop one of my amusements as i found i could not without too great an expense of time follow both with regard to the other part of his advice i lamented that it had never been given me before i owned i was a dabbler and had daubed over many a sheet of paper but if i continue said i to practice drawing i shall entirely lay aside my colors and practice my art such as it is in a way that may give me more satisfaction though perhaps sir i shall please you better by not aiming at any excellence at all  if you allude replied the dean to what i said about music you mistake my meaning my great objection to your obtaining excellence in music is lest it should mislead you into improper company its sister art is of a more solitary nature and is not liable to that inconvenience except for this reason and the fear of too much expense of time i have no objection to your obtaining excellence in both arts  but though you should not be able to please yourself with your own proficiency in drawing yet if you have a taste for the art you may be greatly amused with the works of others a clergyman near me who is now dead had a small collection of prints and drawings and when he was fatigued with study as he was a very studious man could at any time amuse himself with a few of his prints  but all this said i sir requires taste and if a clergyman have no taste for these amusements i hope you have no objection to indulge him in some amusement which does not require it  in a game at chess for instance with a neighboring vicar or at backgammon with the squire  in my opinion said the dean chess is so far from being a relaxation as all amusements should be that if you are fairly matched it is a severe study it is a game in which a great variety of different movements create double the variety of different circumstances on each of which circumstances so numerous a train of consequences again depend that to provide for all the contingences that arise from your own moves and may arise from the probable moves of your antagonist requires a mind intensely occupied in the pursuit before it and vacant from every other in short a skill in this game like mathematical knowledge may be continually advancing to perfection when i was fellow of st johns i played much at chess and being fond of it i attained as i thought some degree of excellence till at length from beating all the young men at cambridge who played with me i began to think myself the best chessplayer in england it happened on a visit to a friend in london that an old german officer made one of the party after dinner we went to different amusements and it was proposed that he and i should play a game at chess as we were both known to be chessplayers i modestly threw my glove but my heart beat with a full assurance of triumph i soon however perceived that my antagonist opened his game in a manner to which i had not been accustomed this roused all my attention but while i was defending myself in one quarter for i quickly found i had to act only on the defensive i received a severe blow on another which threw me into great confusion and while i was endeavoring to recover my disordered affairs the enemy broke in upon me and shamefully defeated me without giving me an opportunity of displaying one instance of my prowess i was convinced however that all this mischief had befallen me from too great confidence and an incautious manner of opening my game i begged therefore another trial but it ended in the same disgrace my antagonist by this time was fully apprized what a hero he had to deal with and exulting in his success desired me to fix upon any chamber on the board i pleased and use all my strength merely to defend that single post he engaged to attack no other but in spite of all my endeavors he gave me checkmate upon that very spot nay he did it repeatedly for my shame was now turned into admiration i sat down therefore contented and endeavored to console myself by forming the disgrace i had suffered into a lesson against presumption  i cannot in return said i sir tell you a story of my prowess at chess but if you will give me leave i will tell you one of my perseverance i played a game with a gentleman at my own lodgings and was victorious you have taken me said he rather inopportunely today but if you will be vacant on thursday i shall be this way and will demand satisfaction accordingly on thursday he came about eleven oclock and by the time we had played three games two of which i had won his horses came to the door i cannot leave the matter thus said he if you can set any little matter before me we will go on two games more were played when in the midst of the third a bit of roasted mutton appeared and by the time it was cold i had defeated him again i was now four or five games before him our intercourse therefore with the mutton was short and we went to work again i was still victorious when the horses returned at six this is provoking said he i cannot leave the matter thus can i have a bed at the inn his orders to his servant now were not to bring the horses till they were sent for this was a melancholy note to me fatigued as i was already beyond measure however as i was under some obligations to the gentleman and in my own lodgings i had no choice the night ended late and the morning began early breakfast came  the barber came  dinner came  all was negligently treated except the main point i sighed inwardly and hoped this visitation would now soon have an end it lasted however all that day and i was still two games before my antagonist though i had played as carelessly as i could without discovering my indifference as the evening drew on i expected every moment to hear a message sent for the horses i was shocked with his telling me we could not part on these unequal terms as the next day was saturday and he must of necessity he said then finish he would try his fortune once more so we continued nailed to our board till a late hour on friday night and began again before breakfast on saturday morning toward the close of the day our accounts differed in one game but i was too complainant to dispute the matter so the horses were sent for and i was delivered from such a trial of my patience as i never before experienced  scarce any mischief happens to us said the dean but we have the comfort of thinking it might have been worse and you were happy that your friend did not come to you on monday instead of thursday  as it appears however from my story how much time and pains are necessary to obtain excellence in this game and from your story how fascinating a game it is  it is worth while to consider how far it may be a proper amusement for a clergyman  and whether it really answers the end of an amusement by unbending the mind if it only substitute one severe study for another it cannot certainly take the name of an amusement cowper with his usual descriptive talents admirably portrays the ardour of a chessplayer  who then would waste attention at the checkered board his host of wooden warriors to and fro marching and countermarching with an eye as fixed as marble with a forehead ridgd and furrowed into storms and with a hand trembling as if eternity were hung in balance on his conduct of a pin   let every one however judge for himself i found it too interesting to be amusing to me and therefore in early life i left it off  it is certainly however a noble game it gives us an idea of war without its guilt it gives us a just idea too of common life  of the happy effects of prudent and cautious steps on one hand and of the fatal mischief which often attends even one false step on the other  i know not said i sir whether such games as are made up of skill and chance together are not closer imitations of life our most prudent plans are often defeated by events which do not depend on ourselves but arise from what we call chance while an illdigested plan sometimes succeeds without any aid from our own prudence games therefore consisting partly of skill and partly of chance seem more to resemble the course of events in human life than games of mere skill like chess  certainly replied the dean such games afford a juster picture of the circumstances of life but i am speaking of the conduct of it sometimes it is true we are ruined by unavoidable calamity but more often by our own misconduct and it is this latter view of life which chess so justly resembles  well said i sir as you repudiate chess from the list of your clerical amusements because of its intricacy i hope you will take backgammon into favor because of its simplicity  not into my favor truly answered the dean i know too little of it to make it a favorite i have no objection however to it but its stupidity let those play at it who like it it seems to me a noisy rattling game fit rather to conclude an evening after a foxchase than suited to the taste of men of letters and refinement  but indeed i have a sort of prejudice against backgammon as it contributed to ruin the fortunes of an excellent young man with whom in early life i was intimate at college he was related to a rich old admiral and was supposed to be his intended heir which he probably might have been had not this stupid game intervened backgammon was the admirals delight he had no resources in himself as to books he hardly knew the top of a page from the bottom backgammon was level to his genius all his powers were centered in this game three or four hours after dinner and half that time after supper he never failed to play and all day long if the weather did not permit him to go abroad as the admiral was not a very pleasing man and besides rather penurious in his housekeeping his company was not much sought after and it fell to the unhappy lot of my friend to be his almost constant antagonist day after day  it was weary work i remember well his coming to me one evening much out of humor i have been playing with him said he at this stupid game from four this afternoon till eight and he had the conscience toward the close of this heavy business to look me full in the face and cry cousin you play as if you were tired  in short my friend could not bear this miserable trespass upon his time and began to make conditions the admiral was not used to control took the huff blotted him out of his will and chose a puppy for his heir who was fit for nothing but to play at backgammon  a liberal minded man said i sir is much to be pitied when his interest rest and his sentiment are thus at variance young as i am in life i have seen several instances of it but i have seldom known as on this occasion sentiment prevail  upon the whole however sir i think you are too harsh in your censure of backgammon it is not surely a game of deep contrivance yet i think it possesses variety enough to be amusing even to an enlightened mind which wishes during a short interval to suspend its faculties and enjoy the refreshment of a little privation of sentiment what has hurt this poor harmless game i believe more than any thing else is its connection with those wicked little cubes called dice which are employed in so many villainous purposes that every communication with them is suspected one of our good bishops i have heard is fond of a game at backgammon when he can get snug to it with his chaplain but he stands much in awe of his own servants lest in passing to and fro they should hear their master rattling dice so he plays always on a table lined with green baize and throws his dice from lined boxes this story is told of bishop gibson of london but as he lived after dr stillingfleets time i suppose the same device has been practiced by other bishops   if it had been my case said the dean i should have played openly  these concealments never are concealed they only show that we have not resolution to forbear doing what on some account we do not think perfectly right for myself i see no reason why the bishop may not indulge himself in a game at backgammon without scruple if he like it as for the illrepute it lies under on the account of its connection with dice i see no more reason for it than that knives and forks should be objected to because they may become the instruments of gluttony it is another connection which occasions the mischief if these little wicked cubes as you call them were not connected with certain little wickd circles called money they would be perfectly harmless these little circles are in fact the wicked companions which debauch the cubes and are indeed such mischievous companions as seldom fail to turn all amusements into vice in my utopia therefore money shall in no degree be connected with amusement its proper place is the market and there only it has concern  gaming said i sir no doubt is a very strange perversion of amusement but is there any objection to a trifling stake which is never felt whether we win or lose and is in fact no object  what end then said the dean does it answer  merely i replied to keep the attention a little awake  but you must allow then answered the dean that as far as it does keep the attention awake so far it is an object the amusement itself it seems cannot keep the attention awake but wants a stimulative the love of money which makes you play with that care and caution which the amusement itself could not do and is this any thing else my good friend twist and analyze it as you please but the spirit of avarice one mans attention cannot be kept awake as you phrase it without playing for a shilling another man must keep his attention awake with a pound a third must be enlivened by a stake of ten times as much and so on till the attention of some people must be kept awake by staking a patrimony you see then plainly that if the stake be so trifling as to be no object it can be no incentive and if it be an object it can only be so by your attachment to a sum of money and what will you call that attachment unless you resolve it with me into the spirit of avarice  but though in theory said i sir you may be able to lead it up to this source it seems in fact to be so trifling as not to come within any moral calculation  i know the mathematician replied the dean divides matter with such nicety as to bring it to an invisible point but i do not like to see morals so treated is the excess wrong if it be the approach cannot be right if the mind be at all infected with the spirit of avarice and the desire of profiting by your neighbors loss it is so far an approach there are different degrees of vice no doubt but we are cautioned against breaking one of the least commandments as well as the greatest the good christian endeavors to preserve his mind from the smallest taint and the christian minister thinks himself particularly bound to abstain from every appearance of evil  in fine i will not cavil with you whether playing for money arises from avarice but certainly the amusement ceases when it cannot itself produce its end and what does produce the end becomes the leading principle so that the point issues here if you choose such feeble amusements as are really no amusements without the aid of vicious stimulatives  it becomes you to lay them aside and seek for such amusements as are simply such  to be candid i replied i have nothing farther sir to oppose vicious custom i fear has modified all our amusements as well as every thing else and has driven them from their natural simplicity connecting things with them that have no relation to them i cannot but allow with you that amusements should be simply such and that if they connect themselves with money they should assume another name  i then put the dean in mind that he had yet furnished us with no domestic amusement that came under the name of exercise rainy weather i observed might continue so long as to make a little motion necessary to a sedentary man do you object to billiards  why no said the dean not much my own method when i could not take exercise abroad was to throw two or three doors open and walk from one chamber to another with a book or scrap of paper in my hand as i used to do in the fields but i do not prescribe my own example to others as to billiards they are so unhappily connected with gaming and bad company that i have no great respect for the amusement  at least as a clerical one however as the influence of this game from its expensive apparatus cannot be so extended as cards i should not object to a clergymans playing at it in a private family and under the usual restriction of playing only with good company and for no stake  i am obliged to you said i sir for the liberty you have given me of indulging an amusement which is a favorite one with me and in which i am supposed to have some skill  nay then replied the dean i know not whether i shall not revoke the liberty i have given you i am not fond of a clergymans possessing skill in any game skill always implies a consumption of time and an eagerness after an amusement which i cannot approve  but you have now said i sir given me so much good instruction that whatever i may have done i hope never again either to employ my time in improving my skill or to use my skill in mispending my time  i then asked the dean if he had ever heard of the game of shuttlecock or if he would laugh at me for mentioning it to him as good domestic exercise  laugh at you said the dean i know no game that i value more it has all the characters of the amusement we want it gives us good exercise  it makes us cheerful  and has no connection with our pockets and if i may whisper another truth in your ear it does not require much skill to learn when my legs were in better order i have spent many a rainy halfhour with sir roger at shuttlecock in his hall the worst of it is few parsonage houses have a room large enough for it though perhaps the tithebarn if it be not better employed may furnish one  i could say more in favor of shuttlecock you may play at it alone it is also an exercise too violent to last long we need not fear as at billiards to mispend a morning at it  laugh at you so far from it that i respect the man who invented shuttlecoek  i asked the dean next if he had any objection to some little handicraft business as domestic exercise for a clergyman and i particularised that of a carpenter or a turner both which i said were very well fitted to put the blood in motion  aye aye replied the dean i like them both i have known very worthy clergymen good carpenters and turners i knew one who had a shop in his house and made his own tables and chairs they were substantial and not illmade though he did not think them neat enough for his parlour they did very well for his chambers and study i knew another clergyman added the dean and an exemplary man he was who was an excellent turner he used to work in box ebony and ivory and made a number of little pretty conveniences both for himself and his friends in the coldest weather i have heard him say he could put his whole frame in a glow by working his lathe  did not you see in the prints that mons pascal who died the other day had retired a few years ago to the learned seminary of port royal where he and other eminent men made it a rule to intermix their studies with manual labor  i told the dean i had seen it and that i rather wondered at the choice which pascal had made of his own employment which was that of making wooden shoes  aye good man said the dean he made them for the poor peasants in his neighborhood and i should be glad to give more than double their value for a pair of them to keep for his sake  i then mentioned bookbinding to the dean as a clerical art  why yes said he i think it is but we should have introduced it earlier in our conversation under the head of domestic amusement it will hardly come under that of domestic exercise  well have you any thing more to offer you see i am disposed to allow my brethren every mode of amusement and exercise that is consistent with innocence and propriety of manners and i hope the range which may be taken within these bounds will be thought fully sufficient if i have omitted any thing or if you have any thing farther to propose let me know  i recollect nothing said i sir at present and have only left to express my grateful obligations to you for what is past if any thing farther should occur i shall take the liberty on some future occasion to propose it in the mean time i am perfectly satisfied myself with the indulgence you have given me and should think any of my brethren unreasonable who should desire more  end of the dialogues this is the substance of what passed between the dean of pauls and me on the subject of clerical amusements as our conversation lasted three evenings i had the more leisure to commit it to writing the force of many of the deans expressions i fear is injured in an account which depended so much on memory but i dare take upon me to say the sentiments are invariably his  as this conversation gave a new turn to all my own amusements it enabled me also to be of some service in giving occasional advice to several of my younger brethren and if my executors should find these papers and think them worth communicating to the public i should hope they might be of use also to others after i am gone  jos frampton  the end
