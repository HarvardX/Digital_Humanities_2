three other very remarkable smallpox cases etc  to which is added a letter to dr lee giving him an account of a letter of dr freinds concerning that fever which infested the army under the conduct of the earl of peterborough while he was physician to it anno   0  etc in spain together with the said letter  by pierce dod m d fellow of the college of physicians and physician to st bartholomews

to the public through the candor of the learned gentleman to whom they are addressed  it may be seemingly unnecessary therefore perhaps to publish them again but as there is something in each of them which is very remarkable and one of them in particular seems to clear up a point of considerable consequence with respect to inoculation it cannot be amiss i think to give them a chance at least of being if possible a little more public besides there are several additions to the two last of them since they were sent to the royal society  most of the other cases are taken from some adversaria or manuscript notes which i have as well as an account of several diseases both acute and chronical in manuscript likewise of dr brownes son of the famous author of the religio medici nec satis est vulgasse fidem  but the author likewise of pseudodoxia epidemica and of several other valuable treatises sir thomas brown and who was himself likewise a person of great learning and eminence and physician to st bartholomews hospital for upwards of six and twenty years and succeeded therein by dr cade in october anno domini   0   the first of them was communicated to him by one r g an apothecary at the bath and the minutes of it are said to have been taken from mr longs own mouth as may be seen by the said r gs letter dated july         and is by no means an inaccurate relation the three others viz mr dormers mr haless and the marquis of dorchesters came directly within his own observation and have something in them which is very well worth notice as well as that brief account of the smallpox which is chiefly likewise taken from his manuscript papers  there are but two cases besides one of them of the same kind with that in the first letter to mr folks though not of the same fortunate event the other taken from tulpius which i hope there is no occasion to make any apology for especially considering how apposite it seems to be to some of those observations which occurred to me upon mr haless case and to another case of the stone which has lately made a great deal of noise in the world  that letter of dr freinds to dr cockburne which is added after these cases

recovered in a letter to martin folks esquire president of the royal society sir making bloody water is universally esteemed as terrible a symptom as any that can happen in the smallpox and all who have wrote concerning that distemper do unanimously agree that it is a certain forerunner of approaching death dr cade indeed says in his letter to dr friend concerning purging in that distemper that he has sometimes cured this symptom by the help of camphire and a copious quantity of acids but then he adds that this relief was only temporary and that to confess the truth he never knew any body that made that sort of water who ever survived the   th day from the eruption and there is no body whom i know of that has been conversant in this distemper but has constantly experienced sooner or later the like fatality in consequence of it i mean when this sort of urine has plainly proceeded from a broken crasis or contexture or as it were a thorough dissolution of the whole mass of blood for i know very well you shall now and then have several streaks and sometimes larger quantities of blood in the urine from the acrimony of the salts that are in spanish flies upon the application of blisters which are frequently ordered and mostly likewise necessary in one or other of the stadia of this distemper and yet the patient shall do well and dr brown who was a very worthy predecessor of mine in st bartholomews hospital gives an account of a gentlewoman that lived in deans yard westminster who made bloody urine in the smallpox for four or five days together and that dr needham who attended her along with him did upon that account forsake her and yet she did well but that they found afterward that this bloody urine was not occasioned by the malignancy of the distemper but by a sharp stone which was at that time descending from one of the kidneys through the ureters into the bladder and which she afterward voided this i have from some adversaria of his a good number of which i have had the fortune to be in possession of several years and among which there are likewise several other remarkable cases that occurred to him during the course of a very long and extensive as well as successful practice  but to return to my subject  it cannot but be a satisfaction therefore to a person of your humanity and goodness to hear of an instance in which this frightful symptom was not attended with its usual fatality and it was in the case of a young gentleman of about    years of age son to one colonel ellitson a gentleman of very considerable fortune and worth in jamaica  he was taken with a fever and great pain in his head on april the  0th last and had the smallpox come out upon him the day following notwithstanding which the same symptoms still continued and nothing almost would stay in his stomach and his head likewise was very delirious he was obliged therefore to be blooded and had blisters applied to his neck and to his arms which together with a proper quantity of pulvis e chelis cancror comp and nitre were the first things that i had an opportunity of ordering for him  the next day every thing was more quiet and so again the third day from the eruption but the smallpox were very numerous all over him and of a rank angry sort as they generally are i think in most of your west india constitutions but this young gentleman had besides overheated himself a little before upon acting his part among the rest of his schoolfellows at the montum near eaton  things continued in the same state the fourth day but toward the evening there were a few streaks of blood mixed with and subsiding in his water which did not much alarm me because i did not know but it might be caused by the blisters i had but one reason to doubt the contrary and that was he had little or no strangury but some persons did assure me that they had known such or even a more bloody sort of water occasioned by blisters even though there was no strangury i was willing therefore to hope the best and so made no other alteration in my process than to direct a plentiful use of spirit of vitriol  what was ordered happened to succeed we had no more of that sort of water either that night or the next day or the morning following but i was sent for in a great hurry that day viz the  th in the afternoon and found his friends in the utmost consternation not only because it returned but because it began to increase upon them and was pouring off in a very free manner no notice was taken of this either to the society or in the account which is given of this affair in the transactions the reasons for which you will see toward the beginning of the subsequent letter a specimen of which i herewith send you  it was necessary therefore to proceed in another method and i accordingly prescribed him gum arabic oliban and pulv amyl ana ss alumin nup gr iv to be taken sextis horis in   or   spoonfuls of a mixture ex aqua cinnamom ten ciras nigr ana iii theriacal iss terr japonic ss tinct antiphthisic iss and syrup de mecon ss which with tinct rosar rubrar strongly acidulated with spirit of vitriol sweetened with the above syrup aqua cinnamom tem fort ana ii to be used ad libit had the desired effect and the bloodiness of the urine began to abate in about  0 or    hours and in  0 or    hours more to go thoroughly off so that by the next day in the evening the urine was returned to its natural state and color  there was nothing farther observable in the course of this case except that the distemper was of the coherent kind and accordingly attended with many other dubious symptoms likewise for though it is generally thought that the coherent sort is not so formidable as the confluent yet as dr friend has judiciously observed and dr moreton before him there is not so much difference between them but they are almost always attended with much the same appearances and the same fevers plainly at the time of maturation for that the danger does not arise so much from the sort as from the number of the pustules which if it be great there is the like reason to be fearful of the event whether they flux or whether they only cohere all which notwithstanding this young gentleman had the good fortune to escape  i have nothing farther to detain you with at present but one short request and that is that you will be so good as to believe me with all the respect and esteem imaginable  sir your most obedient faithful servant p d june         case the second and third a second letter to martin folksesquire president of the royal society in vindication of the foregoing case together with two other very remarkable smallpox cases sir i did myself the pleasure some time since to send you an account of a young gentleman who made bloody water in the course of the smallpox and yet recovered and you were so obliging as to give it a place in a subsequent transaction  there is one thing however which i could wish had not been omitted and that is that i sent you likewise a sample of that water by which you might see whether it was or was not of that formidable sort which i took it to be but dr mortimer tells me there were several gentlemen at the society who had never had the smallpox and that some of them might probably be very much afraid of it and that it was not therefore thought advisable that the said sample should be produced and that it not having been produced before the society he through inadvertency did forget to take any notice of it in the publication  the case must therefore rest upon the bare relation as it does all that i shall say farther in relation to it is that it was a more thorough bloody urine and in a larger quantity than is ever occasioned by blisters and entirely of that kind as seldom ever fails to be fatal et quamvis remedia proposita sint vulgaria hic casus tamen observationem meruit propter eventum non vulgarem ex omnibus enim variolis laborantibus quos mihi tota vita videre contigit hic unicus fuit qui ex fluxu sanguineo evaserit sed in caeteris certum mortis praesagium fuit magna praesertim sanguinis copia affluente as riverius had the goodfortune to be able to say before me in a parallel case which came before him centur prima observation  observat lxxi  i call it a parallel case though this was a fluxus alvei because the prognostic is the same whether the effusion of blood be per alveum vel per vesicam  what i have to offer to you now is a case of a different nature but an instance likewise of the recovery of a gentleman who had this distemper in as terrible a manner as can well be conceived and that by a regimen altogether as extraordinary  it was one mr prouse grandson to the learned and good dr hooper at that time bishop of bath and wells and the present worthy and steady representative of his country for the county of somerset and is taken from a letter which was sent to a friend of mine from one of the nearest relations that mr prouse had and who was with him during the whole time viz his mother dated october          he had the smallpox came out upon him october         and on the   th i e the third day at night was seized with a violent shortness of breath which increased upon him the   th in the morning so that he was in danger of being what they call throttled had the hiccups rattled in his throat fetched his breath double grew senseless looked black and blue was convulsed all over and lost one pulse in four  this till eight at night during which time they poured in as much wine brandy and spirits as they could every quarter of an hour but about that time he began to be in such a state as they could not get in any more and he fell into a sort of slumber out of which he waked in a very little time and was something better so from thence they continued him in the same course drinking nothing weaker than strong beer and that with at least two or three spoonfuls of brandy or spirits in every draught of it once every hour to the   th or the   th after the eruption and what is very remarkable if they let him lie any time an hour or two extraordinary without these liquors he would grow lightheaded hot and sick but upon returning to them would grow cool and easy  the night between the   th and the   th was a very bad one insomuch that it was as much as three persons could do to hold him in his bed but about seven in the morning he came entirely to himself and was from that time thoroughly out of danger but during the course that he was in before which was from the   th to the morning of the   th besides his other potables which were all heightened and made strong with drops or spirits he drank six and twenty quarts and one pint of liquor the smallest of which was strong beer and the greatest part the strongest wine that could be got besides a full quart of brandy  all this while he did not know that it was the smallpox but fancied it was a surfeit which he had got by his having eaten too heartily of pork and was about    years old when this happened  the eclat of this recovery did a great deal of credit to old dr bettenson under whose care he was at the bath who as he was a very eminent and good physician did every thing incumbent upon a person of skill and integrity in a regular manner previous to these terrible appearances but found himself as he thought then obliged to go a good deal out of the way in order to support him if possible under the violence of them and was afterward in a manner necessitated to go on with it by what is above related and his success in this case if i am rightly informed encouraged him to treat some of his future smallpox patients more particularly the present earl powlet and a brother or two of his in much the same manner and that without any sinister event but not being master of those cases i cannot say any thing more as to them  give me leave only to remark that the gentlemen of that county have for the most part good stamina and that it happens likewise very fortunately especially in cases of such extreme danger as that of mr prouse was ut and sint as horace expresses it dura ilia and ut quicquid veneni saeviat in praecordiis medici sinnt qui iis auxiliatricem exporrigant manum  i did not think to trouble you with any thing more at present but another smallpox case being lately come to my hands i was not willing to lose the opportunity of communicating it  it is the case of a little boy son to mr richards member of parliament for bridport in dorsetshire he was inoculated about three years ago at the age of about   and had the smallpox come out upon him to the number of  0 or  0 and they maturated and scabbd and went off in the same manner that that sort of pock which was a regular and distinct one generally does but about two years afterward i e about a year ago he had the smallpox again and there came out between   and  00 which maturated and scabbd likewise and went through the same stages and in the same manner that the former did only he was worse before the eruption but when that was completed had no manner of disorder except too much of an appetite as is usual every now and then in and after the smallpox  this is authenticated to me by a letter which i have from a learned and experienced physician in those parts dr brodrepp who is likewise grandfather to the child and attended him upon both occasions and whatever may be said in evasion of other gases in which persons that have been inoculated have had the smallpox afterward as that the inoculation did not take place there was no eruption at least no variolous one and the like is certainly an instance that all is not to be depended upon that is given out in favor of or is expected from inoculation and that it is by no means an effectual security from ones having the smallpox again  what is between these two asterisks added now upon the printing but as it has been observed long since by the inimitable author of hudibrass  surety the pleasure is as great in being cheated as to cheat or else it is impossible that inoculation should triumph so much as it is said appendix to dr jurins case p    that it does over all its opposers what is between these two asterisks added now upon the printing   addresses of this kind likewise ought not to be too long i shall therefore say no more with relation to this point at present but hasten to a conclusion for fear that mine should not only be thought but prove so and am with great respect  sir your most obedient humble servant p d june      postscript to the above letter since i wrote this i have likewise had an opportunity of being afresh satisfied of what is above related with respect to mr prouse with these further particulars viz  that he was at first treated in the same manner that other people usually are and put into a very temperate if not too cool a regimen  that the smallpox thereupon did not come on or rather struck in and that in consequence thereof he was brought into the straits in which he was upon the third and fourth days  that upon this dr bettenson told mr prouses relations of the good effects which he had sometimes seen from a free use of strong and spirituous liquors in his practice among people in the country but did not care to venture upon it in a person of such tender years and of such consequence as mr prouse was but that it was insisted upon that he should do it it being apparently a desperate case and there being nothing else seemingly to be done  that they accordingly entered upon it and went on with it but more frequently than as it is above mentioned being never able to discontinue the pouring in of them by as much as he could take for a quarter of an hour without a sensible detriment to him  that the strong beer which he drank was some that his grandfather had brewed when he was dean of canterbury and brought with him from thence which was then a matter of sixteen years before and of the black or noggish sort of near  0 bushels to the hogshead  that the good event of this process occasioned a pretty general run into a like one in those parts during the time that the smallpox was so rife and of so malignant a sort as it was that winter and the spring following and that the failure of it in some instances was thought to be owing to too negligent an attendance to it or the not plying them duly and sufficiently with suchlike liquors  and lastly that it had been generally thought that mr prouses cure extraordinary as it was could not well be ascribed to any thing else but that a physician of the first rank who has been concerned in his family seemed to make light of it and very frankly told them that he would have done every whit as well if old bettenson had ordered him to have been dragged through a horsepond at which i perceive they were somewhat surpised and which is more indeed than i should have thought had it come from one of less eminence in the profession or less critical upon the practice of others than himself but presume that he took it from a very good way that they have of curing fevers among the tartars dum quis febre corripitur tunc comprehensa coma ipsum aliquantisper exagitantes and circumrotantes in aquam profluentem projiciunt hocque modo humores and spiritus alterando procurant febrifugum  observationes medicinales circa morbos in regionibus septentrionalibus per philippum lloyd m d in actis philosophicis no     page  0  and that is when any one is seized with a fever they take him by the hair of the head and shake him well for a little while and swing him round and round and then throw him into the water by which means a turn is given to the blood and the humors and spirits are altered and so the fever is cured  and thus much for this memorable case  case the fourth bloody urine in the smallpox and the patient lived to the  0th day together with a short account of the smallpox in general since i wrote the foregoing letters etc i have met with a case of the same nature with the first in which there was reason as i thought to hope for the same fortunate event and of which i will likewise give a brief account notwithstanding i was disappointed  it was in a servant of my own a lad of about    years old who was seized with a violent pain in his back which he imputed to his having helped the brewers servants in carrying down drink but which continuing notwithstanding he was blooded and had a plaster put upon it and being attended likewise with a pain in his head though not a great one the day following i immediately apprehended that it was the forerunner of the smallpox and that of a bad sort i say of a bad sort because i have scarce ever known that symptom to have preceded and to persist but the smallpox has proved of a very dangerous sort and almost constantly fatal which is more than i remember to have been observed by any body that has hitherto treated concerning this distemper  the eruption ensued i e began to show itself on the third day and bloody water upon the fourth from that or the seventh from the invasion and continued that and the next day and great part of the day following and there were other symptoms viz a delirium and diarrhoea and great restlesness and inquietude which attended him likewise from just before the eruption to almost that time notwithstanding he had been blooded again and had a blister inter scapulas and taken all proper temperate restringents the whole while  what was farther remarkable in this case is that he went on pretty tolerably for number and sort etc after this until the fifteenth day but was then seized with a sudden deliquium and in such a state that it was almost impracticable to get any thing down and he was seemingly expiring they made a shift however to get down every now and then a spoonful or two of lac ammoniac and tinctura croci with some serpentaria in it and a couple of blisters were applied infra cubitos by means of which he came to himself and was likely enough to live the next morning and continuing so that day which was the sixteenth from the eruption and which has been observed vide case i page   to be the latest that any one has been known to survive who ever made such dreadful water and continuing so likewise with not much of a fever and something of an appetite and two or three stools a day and good apprehensions for himself for two days more i cannot but think there was reason to hope he might have done well but unluckily for him the fever rose upon him again the third time to a very high degree the next day in the evening and threw every thing into confusion and he died upon the   th day of december last having had the smallpox come out upon him the  0th of the month before  sect ii as i am upon smallpox cases it will not be unacceptable i hope if i add something concerning that distemper in general especially as it is partly taken from the adversaria of that learned gentleman who is mentioned in the preface and to whom the reader will be further obliged in most of the subsequent cases  the smallpox is a contagious distemper and as terrible as any of them very many dying of it more particularly when it is accompanied as it generally is with a fever of a dangerous kind  this when they are many or of the flux or confluent sort on the contrary when the patient has but a few and the fever ceases upon the eruption no disease is more favorable and you may sometimes meet them walking about their affairs with the smallpox in their faces in the open streets of london  no disease likewise in which there is more of a crisis than in the smallpox for by the fourth day at furthest after the invasion the eruption is evident by the seventh it is perfected or all are come out by the eleventh they dry away or turn into scabs and by the fourteenth they fall off though in the flux sort they are often slower and some die after the fourteenth nay on the seventeenth and twentieth days although few have strength enough to hold out so long  a fever as has been said generally joined with the smallpox and when it ceases not upon the eruption apt however for some days after it to be more remiss but on the seventh from the eruption it increases again and returns with some violence and this is what is generally called the second fever and occasions the danger which continues for some days nay in the flux sort some are so unfortunate as to have a third fever seven days after the second in which case very few escape  the smallpox favorable  quae cito maturae quae erumpunt febre remissa rubrae albae paucae nullae nigrore notatae et ubi  libera vox facilis spiratio non sitis ingens those on the contrary unfavourable and for the most part mortal where there is  mictus sanguineus fluxusve angina phrenitis qui variolis pereunt vel angina fauces occludente vel peripneumonia aut respiratione suffocatoria vel syncope vires dejiciente vel febre vel demum diarrhoea aut dysenteria fatis ut plurimum cedunt the greatest danger as has been said before mostly from the fever upon which account dr brown is of opinion that if that could be respited there would not near so many die of this disease and was confirmed in this opinion from his own experience upon trying of the bark both in the first fever which brings them out and in the second when they begin to dry and should go away and gives us some of the instances one of which relating to its efficacy in the secondary fever i shall here set down and may be called  the fifth case mr dormer who lodged then in pall mall had a very ill sort of smallpox which ran all together and covered most of the superficies of his skin both in face and body and was in danger from the beginning when the time came that they should dry away and the second fever increased upon him they stood like a quagmire all about him and would advance no further notwithstanding many powerful remedies were given him in this difficult case the doctor delayed no longer but gave him a dram of the bark in substance and repeated it every six hours at furthest till he had taken about an ounce and an half of it his nights were so bad before notwithstanding many quieting remedies which he had taken that each of them as it was feared would be his last but the first night after he began with the bark was quieter and the smallpox on both sides of his face began to dry the second night his face was all dried and some of his body advanced very much and after the third night all the symptoms abated and he seemed to be in great safety and very suddenly recovered to the great joy of all his numerous friends  the doctors general process as to this distemper upon other occasions much the same as has been ever since except as to bleeding which he restrains to a plethoric habit and the time before the eruption though at the same time he informs us that at paris they let them blood any day after the appearance but says this is not practiced here in england and excepting likewise as to blisters which he does not so much as advise the use of or make any mention of in the whole country or in any state of the disease and which i am the more surprised at because he takes great notice of them and advises one at least to be kept continually open and running during the whole course of the malady in malignant and pestilential fevers and says that the great use of them came first to be known during the pestilential constitution which was anno      and      and had continued ever since  the rest of his process pectoral drinks lambatives and posset drink with tares in it in case that the lungs and gargles and mucilages in case that the throat is affected together with diascordium theriaca or philonium in case of a looseness and an ounce of diacodium every night in case of inquietude and if the smallpox prove long lasting some temperate cordial and to supply the spirits often with a draught of it in case of faintness and thorough purging when the smallpox is well off and the patient fit for it  there is one thing further which the doctor takes notice of and that is that many waters oils and unguents or liniments are frequently made use of in order to preserve the face after the smallpox all which he thinks altogether useless if not hurtful and that a little flower or white starch well dried and shaken upon the face is preferable to them all nay if you let nothing that is moist or greasy touch the face for fifteen days the face he says will scarce be red at least not so red as it will otherwise be and if for a long while after you forbear to wash it it will be the better and the most that you need to do is to breathe upon a warm handkerchief and to wipe your face with it  case the sixth a general decrepitacy from the gout cured by bathing and drinking of the bathwaters anno domini      and      mr long of downeside in the parish of shepton mallet in the county of somerset of about    years of age was seized with the gout about    years before i e before the year    and for the three years immediately preceding was never without great pains a month together in the whole year the pains rambling from part to part and upon abatement leaving a numbness over the whole body in consequence of this likewise the joints of his fingers became crooked and inflexible the patella of his right knee fixed his posture decrepit and quite double with extreme pain in his hips and small of the back the muscles and joints of his thighs legs ancles and feet motionless so that he was carried about from place to place not able to put the least stress upon the ground his stomach lost his thirst unquenchable his face meagre pale and yellow the hair of his head gray and the whole habit of his body emaciated to skin and bones to these afflictions were frequently added terrible fits of the stone to which sort of concretions the entrails of his body were so much disposed that after six weeks use of the bath waters leaving his waters by chance for seven days the urinal was crusted all over with a perfect hard stone like a pumice thicker than a crownpiece  this was his case when he began to drink the bath waters at the end of april      and he drank them hot in the morning and cold at meals and in a little time was reconciled to them for his constant drink without desire of any other in a weeks time his stomach came and his thirst abated and after a months constantly drinking and bathing every other day a little while only to stretch his joints it gave him perfect ease from pain  the   th of may he returned home and carried some of the waters along with him and sent for them constantly once a week using them for his ordinary drink and sometimes drinking them warm in the morning for a stool or two as occasion required and they passed very well but not so effectually as upon the place this course continued till the end of august      when he came to the bath again drinking and bathing as at the first till the middle of october with increasing success but toward that time he went home again and sent and continued to use the waters as before  between allhallowtide and christmas the gray hairs began to fall off and new ones succeeded and by candlemas they were all gone and a brown curling hair came in their place such as he had when he was about  0 growing so fast that he was obliged to cut above an inch a month and still growing thicker and fresher so that he had a head of hair like a wig without a gray one in it  this encouraged him to quit his own house and come and take a house at the bath and to renew and pursue the above method very diligently and it was accordingly attended with daily amendment insomuch that in the summer      his toenails which before were hard rugged and scaly were thrust off by some that were new fresh and smooth his arms were strengthened his legs plumpd out and his feet could bear a strait pair of shoes and he that before could not lay the least stress upon them could then bear to stamp upon the ground and that forcibly and without the least regret and found his strength as he had done his decay still increasing upwards so that he could stand almost upright without any pain  he acquired likewise a fleshy habit of body and a ruddy and plump face and a lively vigorous eye and could bend his knees and did not want other effects or powers of youth nor had he any fit of the gout to lay him up nor the least touch of the stone or any sharpness of urine after he was once well entered into drinking of the bathwaters  this case is related among a great many others by dr pierce in his memoirs of the bath page     etc but neither so clearly nor so fully as above upon which account i take the liberty to publish it and think that it is so remarkable and welltold a case that it very well deserves the notice which is taken of it and there is thus much farther remarkable in it viz that the cure seems to be in a great measure owing to the bathing as well as drinking of the waters though it is now thought to be extremely prejudicial and consequently prohibited to all who are in any manner afflicted with the gout  case the seventh the case of the marquis of dorchester a large quantity of opium taken through a mistake henry marquis of dorchester son to the earl of kingston lieutenant general of his majesty king charles i his forces within the counties of lincoln rutland etc a great lover of learning and a great lover of learned men and to whom the college of physicians is obliged for a valuable collection of books which he purchased at the expense of some thousand pounds and gave to the college had a cabinet of choice remedies as was usual with great persons and in all great families at that time and among the rest a metalline substance which looked like regulus of antimony but being in wine or any other liquor was not vomitive but sudorifick  he had likewise a wellcompounded cordial electuary of which he used to take about the quantity of a walnut every morning and likewise always kept a celebrated extract then much in use and called extractum cardiac magistrale the seventh part of which was extract of or purified opium and of which he used also to give his servants or ethers that wanted it every now and then a few grains  one morning as a servant of his was passing through his bedchamber he called to her to reach him the gallypot in which the cordial electuary was out of his closet but she through mistake brought him the pot of the extract and of which as it happened there were four ounces and he immediately took six drachms of it as appeared upon weighing of what remained afterward so that what he took contained about two scruples and an half or fifty grains of pure opium  after this he slept four hours viz from eight to twelve before his servants perceived any thing of the mistake or attempted to wake him but then they could not though they did what they could and therefore sent immediately from highgate where his lordship then was to dr brown and sir john micklethwaite to come and attend him  sir john micklethwaite being abroad dr brown prescribed diverse things and had them made up ready and a little while afterward they met with sir john and by five in the evening they were both of them with my lord at his house in highgate his servants in the mean time had been able to take him up and put on his clothes and to support and assist him to walk about his chamber and he was sometimes able to open his eyes and to answer to what was spoken but fell asleep again presently and they were not able to keep him awake a quarter of a minute with all their striving calling upon him giving him provoking language nor any thing else that they could do  he was therefore let blood directly and that plentifully and then took infusion croci metallor iss and after that vitrioli albi i twice but could not vomit neither did he ever vomit in the whole course of his life however the medicines worked downwards and he had a stool in about an hours time and they then proceeded to give him a draught of decoct senn iv with two ounces of syrupus de spina and repeated the same sort of medicines every two or three hours afterward and sir john micklethwait seeing little or no alteration for the better returned to london about nine at night bewailing the apparent loss of so great a man so good a friend and so kind a master but dr brown continued with him and still to give what assistance he could and about midnight ordered my lord to be put to bed and to be suffered to sleep without those frequent interruptions which had been hitherto given him  the purging draughts continued to work plentifully and as soon as the day began to appear the doctor walked down into the garden to refresh himself with the cool air of the morning giving orders to be called in half an hour or upon any alteration which might happen to his lordship and about that time notice was brought him that my lord seemed to be more sensible and was awake upon which the doctor went in again and found his pulse not quite so high as it had been before and gave him a cordial draught with    drops of spiritus salis armoniaci in it  my lord being now not so desirous of sleep as before called for his chaplain to read to him and in half an hour more his head was clear and he seemed to be totally recovered and desired to see what had been ordered for him and spoke of the praescriptions with a great deal of candor and reason and skill and judgment and thus in the space of less than twentyfour hours from the time of the taking it the narcotick or whatever other noxious quality there may be in too large a quantity of opium was mastered and totally remedied  this case is without a date but what i have likewise among dr brownes adversaria and a clear instance of his abilities and of the justice with which my lord marquis was pleased to speak of him in his profession bleeding vomiting and purging or one or more if not all of them being certainly the most effectual if not the unice necessaria upon all such occasions upon which account i have often wondered that so general a notice only is taken of them that acid medicines and lixivial salts are put upon an equal foot of efficacy with them in a celebrated treatise upon the subject of poisons with which the world has been long obliged and lately reobligd but multiplicity of business greater concerns and a non vacat pro rebus exiguis cannot but prevent persons of eminence from being so particularly instructive as they might otherwise be and what is said in relation to it in each of the editions a mechanical account of poisons london   0  and      page     of the first edition and     of the third  seems to be intended rather for hints of all that is proper in general than to point out what may be more particularly necessary and is principally to be depended upon on such occasions  the said marquis of dorchester was educated at emanuelcollege in cambridge and became afterward a hard student studying as it is said for the most part ten or twelve hours a day and applying himself to the study of the fathers and schoolmen and casuists and of the canon and civil law as likewise of the common law and was accordingly admitted a bencher of grays inn anno dom      but about seven years afterward when he was about    years old viz in the year      he betook himself to the study of physic and anatomy and was admitted to be a fellow of the college of physcians in      and became a credit and ornament to it or as tony wood athenae oxonienses fasti vol ii page    expresses it their pride and glory and was a great lover of the whole society and more particularly of dr brown who was the person whom he consulted principally and entrusted likewise as to the purchase of such books as were necessary for completing of his library for the future service and benefit of the college he was born anno dom   0  and died at his own house in charter house yard december      0 aged    years  case the eighth a suppression of urine from the stone in the kidneys cured by a large quantity of soap mr hales brother to sir edward hales of kent had stones in both kidneys and it so happened that the stones on each side descended together and stopped or pluggd up both the ureters in such a manner that he labored under a total suppression of urine for twenty days together dr brown visited him from the beginning of it and gave him glysters and purges and ordered him to be bloodedseveral times and as often as he could bear it for the pain to go from his brothers chambers in the temple where he lodged as far as to hydepark in a coach he gave him vomits likewise especially if ever he began to be drowsy which frequently happened and they were of vitriol alb oxymel of squills and vin benedictum as his purges were of decoct sennae and mannae with syrup of buckthorn and julep and resin of julep and aloes and scammony which the doctor gave chiefly because he hoped they would prove hydragogues and help to carry off the serous parts of the blood lest they should otherwise break in upon and drown the brain  these and other medicines were given scarce any thing being omitted that could any ways contribute either to the support of him or to the suppling of the passages or the making a discharge of the stone in all respects more easy notwithstanding which there was no relief only that he was kept still alive  at length the doctor thought of castile soap and gave him not a little but from two or three drachms to an ounce and an ounce and an half and to two and more ounces at a time dissolved in water till he had taken two pounds of it and at last there came away a stuff and some water followed  this stuff was separated as the doctor imagines from the inside of the ureter and there came away a large stone along with it and wrapped up in it besides several other small ones and dirt and skin and the gangrened membrane and after that a foul and nasty urine and then viz the next day in the morning a great quantity of water  what he took afterward was terebinthina veneta and other soft and gentle medicines of the same tendency and all was well  this is a remarkable account of a very happy effect from the use of soap and an instance how free it may be made with even to a degree which is almost incredible but then it must be considered that this was likewise an almost gone case and of extreme exigence every thing else in a manner had been tried and there was no other chance for his survival in which sort of cases it is not only the judgment but warrantable to give things of the greatest efficacy and that not only in the common trifling way and doses but to the utmost stretch that either the patient can bear or the medicine shall be found not to be going beyond the anceps remedium  it is to be observed likewise that the effect which this medicine had was merely to bring away the stuff stone etc soap more particularly that of castile being as dr brown immediately previous to this case has observed an excellent diuretic the subtilty of its parts and the activity and asperity of its salts softened by means of their union with an oil admirably qualifying it to stimulate and deterge as well as to relax the urinary passages and consequently to facilitate the exclusion of any thing that wants to pass off that way  how far it is capable of being improved into further excellencies and to become a lithontriptick or possessed of the virtue to break or dissolve the stone in a human body i will not pretend to determine dr brown though he has mentioned several things which are thought to be so does not seem to think that any thing is really so or much to be relied upon for any such purpose and tulpius that faithful observer says  nihil medicis frequentius in ore quam medicamentum calculos frangens at vide fis arenosos and molles duntaxat intelligas

lib iv cap    the rest of which because it is not altogether foreign to the present purpose i shall take the liberty to subjoin immediately after the present case  but i forget  physic is an ample field and there ever have been and ever will be opportunities of adding to or retrenching from and making some improvements or alterations or other in medicine and there have ever likewise been some who have been discreet enough to reserve the pleasure of the knowledge of them to themselves although at the same time they have never failed to be so publickspirited as to acquaint the world of whom and where they were to be had and it is certainly an argument of a refined and understanding age there either are any new lights struck out in any branch of science  vel horatius lib   od ult verse
