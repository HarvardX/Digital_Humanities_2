essay upon wit  by  sir richard blackmore        an essay upon wit   the inclinations of men in this their degenerate state carry them with great force to those voluptuous objects that please their appetites and gratify their senses and which not only by their early acquaintance and familiarity but as they are adapted to the prevailing instincts of nature are more esteemd and pursud than all other satisfactions as those inferior enjoyments that only affect the organs of the body are chiefly coveted so next to these that light and facetious qualification of the mind that diverts the hearers and is proper to produce mirth and alacrity has in all ages by the greatest part of mankind been admird and applauded no productions of human understanding are receivd with such a general pleasure and approbation as those that abound with wit and humour on which the people set a greater value than on the wisest and most instructive discourses hence a pleasant man is always caressd above a wise one and ridicule and satyr that entertain the laughers often put solid reason and useful science out of countenance the wanton temper of the nation has been gratifyd so long with the high seasonings of wit and raillery in writing and conversation that now almost all things that are not accommodated to their relish by a strong infusion of those ingredients are rejected as the heavy and insipid performances of men of a plain understanding and meer masters of sense  since the power of wit is so prevalent and has obtained such esteem and popularity that a man endowd with this agreeable quality is by many lookd on as a heavenly being if compard with others who have nothing but learning and a clear arguing head it will be worth the while to search into its nature and examine its usefulness and take a view of those fatal effects which it produces when it happens to be misapplyd  tho perhaps the talent which we call wit like that of humour is as clearly understood by its simple term as by the most labourd description an argument or which is this that many ingenious persons by their unsuccessful essays to explain it have rather obscurd than illustrated its idea i will notwithstanding adventure to give the definition of it which tho it may fall short of perfection yet i imagine will come nearer to it than any that has yet appeard wit is a qualification of the mind that raises and enlivens cold sentiments and plain propositions by giving them an elegant and surprizing turn  it is evident that wit cannot essentially consist in the justness and propriety of the thoughts that is the conformity of our conceptions to the objects we conceive for this is the definition of truth when taken in a physical sense nor in the purity of words and expression for this may be eminent in the cold didactick stile and in the correct writers of history and philosophy but wit is that which imparts spirit to our conceptions and diction by giving them a lively and novel and therefore an agreeable form and thus its nature is limited and diversifyd from all other intellectual endowments wit therefore is the accomplishment of a warm sprightly and fertile imagination enrichd with great variety of proper ideas which active principle is however under the direction of a regular judgment that takes care of the choice of just and suitable materials prescribes to the tighter faculties the due bounds of their sport and activity and assists and guides them while they imprint on the conceptions of the mind their peculiar and delightful figures the addition of wit to proper subjects is like the artful improvement of the cook who by his exquisite sauce gives to a plain dish a pleasant and unusual relish a man of this character works on simple proportions a rich embroidery of flowers and figures and imitates the curious artist who studs and inlays his prepard steel with devices of gold and silver but wit is not only the improvement of a plain piece by intellectual enameling besides this it animates and warms a cold sentiment and makes it glow with life and vigor and this it effects as is expressd in the last part of the definition by giving it as elegant and surprizing turn it always conveys the thought of the speaker or writer cloathd in a pleasing but foreign dress in which it never appeard to the hearer before who however had been long acquainted with it and this appearance in the habit of a stranger must be admirable since surprize naturally arises from novelty as delight and wonder result from surprize which i have more fully explaind in the former essay  as to its efficient cause wit owes its production to an extraordinary and peculiar temperament in the constitution of the possessors of it in which is found a concurrence of regular and exalted ferments and an affluence of animal spirits refind and rectifyd to a great degree of purity whence being endowd with vivacity brightness and celerity as well in their reflexions as direct motions they become proper instruments for the sprightly operations of the mind by which means the imagination can with great facility range the wide field of nature contemplate an infinite variety of objects and by observing the similitude and disagreement of their several qualities single out and abstract and then suit and unite those ideas which will best serve its purpose hence beautiful allusions surprizing metaphors and admirable sentiments are always ready at hand and while the fancy is full of images collected from innumerable objects and their different qualities relations and habitudes it can at pleasure dress a common notion in a strange but becoming garb by which as before observd the same thought will appear a new one to the great delight and wonder of the hearer what we call genius results from this particular happy complexion in the first formation of the person that enjoys it and is natures gift but diversifyd by various specifick characters and limitations as its active fire is blended and allayd by different proportions of phlegm or reducd and regulated by the contrast of opposite ferments therefore as there happens in the composition of a facetious genius a greater or less tho still an inferior degree of judgment and prudence and different kinds of instincts and passions one man of wit will be varyd and distinguishd from another that distinction that seems common to persons of this denomination is an inferior degree of wisdom and discretion and tho these two qualities wit and discretion are almost incapable of a friendly agreement and will not but with great difficulty be workd together and incorporated in the constitution of any individual yet this observation is not so conspicuous in any as in those whose native complexion comes the nearest to a subversion and absence of mind tho it should never degenerate into that distemperd elevation of the spirits nothing is more common than to see persons of this class always think right and always act wrong admirable for the richness delicacy and brightness of their imaginations and at the same time to be pityd for their want of prudence and common sense abounding with excellent maxims and instructive sentiments which however are not of the least use to themselves in the conduct of their lives and hence it is certain that tho the gentlemen of a pleasant and witty turn of mind often make the industrious merchant and grave persons of all professions the subjects of their raillery and expose them as stupid creatures not supportable in good company yet these in their turn believe they have as great a right as indeed they have to reproach the others for want of industry good sense and regular oeconomy much more valuable talents than those which any mere wit can boast of and therefore wise parents who from a tender concern for the honour and happiness of their children earnestly desire they may excel in intellectual endowments should instead of refind parts and a genius turnd for pleasant conversation wish them a solid understanding and a faculty of close and clear reasoning these qualifications being likely to make them good men and the other only good companions  and this leads to another observation namely that persons of facetious talents and agreeable humour in whose temperament judgment and discretion as before observd are usually found in a disproportionate measure are more inclind than others to levity and dissolute manners the same swiftness of thought and sprightliness of imagination that qualifies them for ingenious conversation sports of fancy and comick writing do likewise give them an exquisite taste of sensual pleasures and expose them to the prevailing power of tempting tho forbidden enjoyments the passions and appetites of these men from the same spring from whence they derive their extraordinary parts that is a redundancy of warm and lively spirits are more violent and impatient of restraint than those in a cooler and less active complexion who however may be more eminent in the superior faculties of the mind hence it will be no wonder that while their propensions to pleasure are much stronger and their reason much weaker than those of other men they should be less able than others to resist the allurements of criminal delights and this remark is confirmd by daily experience how few of this facetious and comick species of men caressd and applauded for their shining parts and witty discourses escape the snares that encompass them and preserve their vertue and sobriety of manners it too often happens that a man elevated above the rest by his uncommon genius is as much distinguishd by his extraordinary immorality and it would be well if it stopd here but by degrees he often grows much worse by adding impiety and profaneness to looseness of manners for being unable that is having a moral impotence of will to restrain his evil propensions and govern his vicious appetites and finding his guilty enjoyments attended with inward uneasiness and unavoidable remorse and being conscious that his irregular life is inconsistent with safety and happiness in a future state to remove the troublesome misgivings of his mind from the apprehensions of guilt here and rid himself of the fears of suffering hereafter he at length disclaims the belief of a supream being and a future existence and with much ado brings over his judgment to the side of his passions this ingenious libertine having too little strength of reason to subdue his appetites and too much wit to think that if that be not done he shall escape at last divine punishment abolishes his creed for the quiet of his mind and renounces his god to preserve his vices  the objects about which wit is exercisd are the common and less important actions of life it is the province of the civil magistrate to make laws against enormous crimes and great immoralities and by punishing offenders to deter men from the like transgressions but they take no notice of lower errors either because they have not such noxious influence on the state or because it is impossible to foresee and enumerate their numberless classes and prevent their growth where then the legislator ends the comick genius begins and presides over the low and ordinary affairs and manners of life it extends its power and jurisdiction over the wide field of inferior faults and ridiculous follies over the districts of indiscretion indecency and impertinence and is visitor of the regions void of discipline politeness and civility  wit is employd in its own province when the possessor of it exercises his genius on the ordinary customs and manners of life either in conversation or comick writing it has therefore no place in the works where severe knowledge and judgment are chiefly exercisd those superior productions of the understanding must be expressd in a clear and strong manner without intervening strains of wit or facetious fancies which were they admitted would appear incongruous and impertinent and diminish the merit of the writing hence wit has no place in history philology philosophy or in the greater lyrick or epick poems the two last of which containing either the praises of deities or demigods or treating of lofty and illustrious subjects such as the foundation rise and revolution of kingdoms commotions of state battles triumphs solemn embassies and various other important actions of princes and heroes are exalted above the sphere of wit and humour the strength and dignity of the sublime stile is debasd and adulterated by the foreign and improper mixture of light sentiments and pretty fancies these sallies and sports of the imagination will no more advance the beauty of such superior productions than the addition of glittering tinsel and glass beads will improve the imperial purple or adorn the crowns of great monarchs and therefore we see with what judicious care virgil has avoided this error how clear are his celebrated writings from the least sprinkling of wit and pleasant conceits which corrupt the purity debase the majesty and sully the lustre of the greater species of poetry and as the gravity and chastness of the sublime stile in the works last mentiond will not endure the gay ornaments of fancy so does that light dress more misbecome the pious and wise discourses that come either from the pulpit or the press wit is so far from being a grace or improvement of divine eloquence that on the contrary it destroys its dignity breaks its force and renders it base and puerile  the end and usefulness of this ingenious qualification is to delight and instruct it animates and sweetens conversation by raising innocent mirth and good humour and by this effect it relieves domestick cares revives men of business and studious professions and softens the asperity of morose dispositions it suspends uneasy and anxious thoughts dispels cloudy and fallen melancholy and by unbending and exhilerating the minds of the assembly gives them new life and spirit to resume the labour of their respective employments the exercise of wit and a pleasant genius excels all other recreations what is the satisfaction that arises from country sports or the politer diversions of balls and operas compard with the delightful conversation of men of parts and facetious talents other amusements how agreeable soever only please the body and gratify the senses but this strikes the imagination touches the passions and recreates the intellectual faculties and as the taste of the soul is more delicate and exquisite than that of the body so much superior are the pleasures of one to those of the other it is no wonder then that the assemblies of friends are dull and heavy that feasts and wine are flat entertainments unless some ingenious persons are present to improve their taste and enliven the company by agreeable discourses  another part of the province in which wit is properly exercisd are ingenious writings intended to please and improve the people and this is more various and extensive than comick poetry tho of the same kind for it takes in not only the subjects of prudence and decency regular behaviour and vertuous actions but likewise the justness of human sentiments and opinions in points of controversy of the last the dialogue of dr eachard against mr hobbes is a famous example where by great strength and solidity of reason mixt with agreeable wit and raillery he entertains and informs the reader and at once exposes and confutes the conceited philosopher an instance of the first is the celebrated history of don quixote compild by the spanish wit michael de cervantes a book so well imagind and writ with so much spirit and fine raillery that it effectually procurd the end of the admirable author for by turning into mirth and ridicule the reigning folly of romantick chivalry and freeing the minds of the people from that fashionable delusion he broke the force of as strong an enchantment and destroyd as great a monster as was ever pretended to be vanquishd by their imaginary heroes and many more books on other moral subjects have been composd with much wit and vivacity in our own and foreign countries to expose vice and folly and promote decency and sobriety of manners but the productions of this nature which have of late appeard in this nation whether we regard the just and generous sentiments the fertile invention the variety of subjects the surprizing turns of wit and facetious imagination the genteel satire the purity and propriety of the words and the beauty and dignity of the diction have surpassd all the productions of this kind that have been publishd in any age or country the reader no doubt is beforehand with me and concludes that i mean the tatler and spectator which for the greatest part have all the perfection of writing and all the advantages of wit and humour that are requird to entertain and instruct the people and it must chiefly be owing to the great depravity of manners in these loose and degenerate times that such worthy performances have producd no better effects  but this excellent and amiable qualification of the mind is too apt to be abusd and perverted to ill purposes instead of being ingagd on the side of vertue and usd to promote just notions and regularity of life it is frequently employd to expose the most sacred things to turn gravity and reservd behaviour into ridicule to keep in countenance vice and irreligion and with a petulant and unrestraind liberty to deride the principles and practices of the wisest and best of men the conversation of ingenious libertines generally turns upon reveald religion and the venerable teachers of it or on those of the laity who seem most sincere in the belief of christianity and express the greatest conformity in their actions to the precepts of it nothing gives so high a seasoning to their raillery and more improves the taste of their jests than some sharp and pointed ingredients that wound religion and the professors of it whereof some are made the entertainment of the company by these facetious scoffers and exposd as persons fetterd with prepossessions and biassd by notions of vertue derivd from education and the early instructions of canting parents others are represented as indebted for their piety to the prevalency of the spleen and an immoderate mixture of melancholy in their complexion which say they give to the mind a superstitious turn and fill the head with religious chimeras frightful phantomes of guilt and idle fears of imaginary punishments while others are ridiculd as men of a cold and phlegmatick complexion without spirit and native fire who derive say they their vertue not from choice or restraint of appetite but from their deadness and indisposition to pleasure not from the power of their reason but the weakness of their passions it would be endless to enumerate the various ways which the atheistical wit and merry libertine employ to take off all veneration of religion and expose its adherents to publick derision this is certainly the greatest abuse of wit imaginable in all the errors and monstrous productions of nature can any appear more deformd than a man of parts who employs his admirable qualities in bringing piety into contempt putting vertue to the blush and making sobriety of manners the common subject of his mirth while with zeal and industry he propagates the malignant contagion of vice and irreligion poisons his friends and admirers and promotes the destruction of his native country and if these foolish wits and ingenious madmen could reflect they would soon be convincd that while they are engagd against religion they hurt themselves and that wit and humour thus misapplyd will prove but a wretched compensation for their want of vertue  in this place i crave leave to transcribe some passages relating to this subject from the writings of a good judge of wit and as great a master of it as perhaps any nation ever bred i mean archbishop tillotson i know not how it comes to pass says he that some men have the fortune to be esteemd wits only for jesting out of the common road and for making bold to scoff at those things which the greatest part of mankind reverence if men did truly consult the interest either of their safety or reputation they would never exercise their wit in such dangerous matters wit is a very commendable quality but then a wise man should have the keeping of it it is a sharp weapon as apt for mischief as for good purposes if it be not well managd the proper use of it is to season conversation to represent what is praiseworthy to the greatest advantage and to expose the vices and follies of men such things as are in themselves truly ridiculous but if it be applyd to the abuse of the gravest and most serious matters it then loses its commendation if any man thinks he abounds in this quality and hath wit to spare there is scope enough for it within the bounds of religion and decency and when it transgresseth these it degenerates into insolence and impietyand afterwards a sharp wit may find something in the wisest man whereby to expose him to the contempt of injudicious people the gravest book that ever was written may be made ridiculous by applying the sayings of it to a foolish purpose for a jest may be obtruded upon any thing and therefore no man ought to have the less reverence for the principles of religion or for the holy scriptures because idle and profane wits can break jests upon them nothing is so easy as to take particular phrases and expressions out of the best book in the world and to abuse them by forcing an odd and ridiculous sense upon them and in another place having mentiond the most proper objects of wit he thus expresses himselfthis i say on purpose to recommend to men a nobler exercise for their wits and if it be possible to put them out of conceit with that scoffing humour which is so easy and so illnaturd and is not only an enemy to religion but to every thing else that is wise and worthy and i am very much mistaken if the state as well as the church the civil government as well as religion do not in a short space find the intolerable inconvenience of this humour  tho the persons addicted to this impious folly expose the sacred mysteries of christianity and make its votaries the common topick of their raillery it cannot thence be concluded that they are certain that those whom they thus deride as whimsical stupid and deluded men have not the least reason to support their religious principles and practice for if they were sure of this they would treat such unhappy persons as men robd of their senses with tenderness and compassion for none will allow such distemperd minds to be proper subjects of ridicule and derision but those who attentively observe the manner and air of these jesting libertines when they laugh at vertue will see plainly their licentious mirth springs from other principles either from this that the example of many persons who in earnest embrace and profess the articles of religion continually disturbs their opinion of themselves and creates severe misgivings and distrust in their minds lest their notions about religion should not be true when they observe that many persons of eminent parts superior reason and erudition maintain with zeal quite contrary sentiments or else it proceeds from their hatred of men of vertue founded in the dissimilitude of dispositions and manners and disagreement in interest employments and designs or from an envy of their great merit innocent life and worthy actions which from the prevailing power of their own vicious inclinations they are unable to imitate for after all their raillery and expressions of contempt vertue has that native lustre and amiable appearance that will compel men secretly to esteem it even while they deride the possessors of it such is the pride and vanity of degenerate nature that loose men will always endeavour to level the eminent characters of religious and sober persons and reduce them to the inferior degree of their own and for that end they will labour to sink the opinion and esteem of any excellence or merit to which themselves can make no pretence while they cannot equal the bright example of vertue in others they strive to sully or efface it and by turning it into ridicule make it seem rather the dishonour and deformity than the beauty and perfection of the mind and if they can disgrace religion and subvert all moral distinction men will be valud only for their intellectual endowments and then they imagine they have gaind their point since the superiority of wit as they suppose is on their side these seem to me the genuine and natural causes why men of great parts and extraordinary wit but of loose principles and immoral lives who above all others affect popularity and gasp after applause take so much pleasure without the least regard to modesty and decency in a christian country to mock religion and jerk with spiteful satire men of vertue and inoffensive behaviour  wit is likewise misapplyd when exercisd to ridicule any unavoidable defects and deformities of body or mind for since nothing is a moral blemish but as it is the effect of our own choice nothing can be disgraceful but what is voluntary and brought freely upon our selves and since nothing is the proper object of raillery and ridicule but what is shameful it must be a violence to reason and humanity to reproach and expose another for any thing that was not in his power to escape and therefore to make a man contemptible and the jest of the company by deriding him for his mishapen body ill figurd face stammering speech or low degree of understanding is a great abuse of ingenious faculties  nor is it a less criminal use of this talent when it is exercisd in lascivious and obscene discourses the venom is not less but more infectious and destructive when conveyd by artful insinuation and a delicate turn of wit when impure sentiments are expressd by men of a heavy and gross imagination in direct and open terms the company are put out of countenance and nauseate the coarseness of the conversation but a man of wit gilds the poison dresses his wanton thoughts in a beautiful habit and by slanting and side approaches possesses the imagination of the hearers before his design is well discoverd by which means he more effectually gains admission to the mind and fills the fancy with immodest ideas  nothing can be more illmannerd or disagreeable to persons of vertue and sobriety of manners than wanton and obscene expressions on which subject the excellent archbishop tillotson has the following paragraph nothing that trespasses upon the modesty of the company and the decency of conversation can become the mouth of a wise and vertuous person this kind of conversation would fain pass for wit among some sort of persons to whom it is acceptable but whatever savours of rudeness and immodesty and illmanners is very far from deserving that name and they that are sober and vertuous cannot entertain any discourse of this kind with approbation and acceptance a well bred person will never offend in this way and therefore it cannot but be esteemd as an affront to modest company and a rude presuming upon their approbation impudently taking it for granted that all others are as lewd and dissolute as themselves  men of finer spirits do likewise abuse their parts as well as misapply their time when to gain applause and increase their popularity they run without distinction into company and by too great condescention and false humanity mingle in inferior and unworthy assemblies where delighted with the silly approbation of ignorant laughers they shine forth in a great effusion of wit and humour by which they make themselves cheap if not contemptible in the opinion of wise and discerning persons men of singular wit like women of great beauty should never be unguarded for if not endowd with a decent reservedness a modest air and a discreet behaviour they sink in their value and by appearing in all places and becoming common and familiar lose in a great measure their honour and the opinion of their merit it is a meretricious prostitution of wit when the possessors of it can deny no addresses and refuse no invitations and appointments but suffer themselves to be shown at every entertainment besides the gratifying of their vanity by a constant pursuit of approbation and praise which is the spring whence this prodigality of parts and waste of facetious humour chiefly arise it is evident they spend a great deal of time of which a wise man can give no account while wit which should in its proper place renew and revive the spirits for useful employment becomes a continud diversion and makes everlasting idleness the business of life  it is pity that a man of fine spirit and a fertile as well as delicate imagination should think himself engagd in high conversation when he is only employd in the lowest affairs that concern mankind his post is of the same kind and but the next in order above that of players on instruments admirable voices excellent actors on the stage and famous dancers whose province is only to amuse and recreate and is therefore far below theirs who are either busied in governing the state defending their country improving the minds or relieving the bodies of other men  hence the labours of the meanest persons that conduce to the welfare and benefit of the publick are more valuable because more useful than the employments of those who apply themselves only or principally to divert and entertain the fancy and therefore must be as much preferable to the occupation or profession of a wit as the improvement and happiness of men is to be regarded above their mirth and recreation i allow that the talents of these ingenious men are very much to be esteemd in their proper place that is as they unbend the mind relieve the satiety of contemplation and labour and by the delight which they give refresh the spirits and fit them for the returns of study and employment but then it must be granted that as i have said this is the meanest as being the least beneficial province in which our intellectual faculties can be engagd and therefore these facetious men can only claim the highest rank among those who are inventors or ministers of pleasure and provide amusements and recreations for the busy and the wise  i would illustrate what i have asserted by the following reflection domestick fowls the hen the turkey and goose are preferable as more useful to the singing bird and the parrot the ox that ploughs the field and brings home the harvest the horse the mule and even the stupid ass that carry their owners or their goods and merchandize are more to be regarded than the hound the lapdog and various other animals that seem to have been created only for our pleasure and amusement and the reason of this is very evident mankind may be very happy and states and kingdoms may remain in a flourishing condition tho there were no such diverting creatures in the world and from the same consideration men tho of a lower station who are not only beneficial but necessary to the wellbeing of human societies are of far greater importance and therefore deserve more esteem than those who only are subservient to our recreation for the world may still subsist and continue in very comfortable circumstances without one but not without the other and tis easy to name some learned and powerful communities the envy and terror of their neighbours who tho they abound in men of good sense and diligent application to business yet have few wits and jesters among them to make them merry  the truth of what i have asserted will farther appear if we reflect that generally men of a plain understanding and good sense but of great industry and capacity for business are in all governments advancd to posts of trust and great employments in the state while meer wits are regarded as men of the lowest merit and accordingly are promoted to the meaner and less profitable places being lookd on by reason of their inapplication and volatile temper as unfit for a higher station  another pernicious abuse of wit is that which appears in the writings of some ingenious men who are so hardy as to expose from the press the most venerable subjects and treat vertue and sobriety of manners with raillery and ridicule several in their books have many sarcastical and spiteful strokes at religion in general while others make themselves pleasant with the principles of the christian of the last kind this age has seen a most audacious example in the book intituld a tale of a tub had this writing been publishd in a pagan or popish nation who are justly impatient of all indignity offerd to the establishd religion of their country no doubt but the author would have receivd the punishment he deservd but the fate of this impious buffoon is very different for in a protestant kingdom zealous of their civil and religious immunities he has not only escapd affronts and the effects of publick resentment but has been caressd and patronizd by persons of great figure and of all denominations violent partymen who differd in all things besides agreed in their turn to shew particular respect and friendship to this insolent derider of the worship of his country till at last the reputed writer is not only gone off with impunity but triumphs in his dignity and preferment i do not know that any inquiry or search was ever made after this writing or that any reward was ever offerd for the discovery of the author or that the infamous book was ever condemnd to be burnt in publick whether this proceeds from the excessive esteem and love that men in power during the late reign had for wit or their defeat of zeal and concern for the christian religion will be determind best by those who are best acquainted with their character  but the most extensive abuse of parts and ingenuity appears in the loose productions of our writers to the stage it was the complaint of the celebrated wit of spain michael de cervantes beforecited that the comedies in his time were not only extravagant and monstrous in their contrivance but likewise the exemplars of vice and representations of lewdness but had the plays in spain at that time been as immoral and unchaste as the daily entertainments of the british theatre which have a manifest tendency to vitiate the taste of the people fill their imaginations with obscene ideas and their lives with levity idleness and luxury i say if that great man whose judgment was equal to his admirable genius had seen religion and vertue so derided and modesty reservedness and decency so insulted and exposd his zeal for the honour of his country and his love of mankind would have animated him to have attackd the comick poets with the same spirit with which he assaulted the prevailing folly of his age the romantick atchievements of knights errant his wit and good sense would have made those merry authors as odious for poisoning the people with their loose and immoral writings as he made the others ridiculous for their extravagant and idle tales  no doubt a comedy may be so contrivd that it may at once become delightful and promote prudence and sobriety of manners that is when the characters are well chosen justly delineated and every where distinguishd when the various manners are exactly imitated and carryd on with propriety and uniformity when the principal action contains an instructive moral and all the parts in a regular connexion dependance and proportion illustrate and support each other and have a manifest influence on the main event when the incidents are well imagind and result from the manners of the dramatick persons when the turns are surprizing the knots or obstructions natural and unconstraind and the unraveling of them tho unforeseen yet free and easy and when the diction is pure proper and elegant as well as chaste and inoffensive to the modest and vertuous hearers so regular and beautiful a piece as this cannot but greatly please and divert as well as instruct the audience nor is it i imagine from want of knowledge of the rules of writing nor of sufficient genius in which this nation abounds that so few comedies distinguishd by these perfections have been producd but this defect arises partly from this that the comick poets are often men of loose manners and therefore unlikely persons to undertake the promotion and encouragement of vertue of which they have no taste and to discountenance imprudence and immorality when by doing so they must expose their own character to derision tho sometimes it may happen that a loose poet as well as preacher merely from his just manner of thinking and his sense of decency in forming discourses becoming his character may entertain the audience with laudable performances  another and the chief cause of the immorality of the theatre is the ill taste of the people who notwithstanding they have applauded several clean and regular ttagedies such as those which have of late appeard that are worthy of the greatest commendation especially cato and the plays for the most part of mr row as great a genius for tragedy as any nation in any age has producd yet still frequent and encoutage the loosest comedies it happens that the greatest part of men of wit and humour who not being easy in their fortunes work for the stage and are daylabourers to the muses lie under a necessity of bringing those productions to market which are in fashion and therefore vendible while others tho of ever so much greater value would be turnd back upon their hands nor would the actors who live by their employment as the comick writers do by theirs undertake to represent an innocent and much less a comedy of yet higher merit  tho several assaults have been made upon the comick poets in fashion and many batteries have been raisd against the theatre yet hitherto they have provd unsuccessful the stage is become impregnable where loose poets supported by numbers power and interest in defiance of all rules of decency and vertue still provide new snares and temptations to seduce the people and corrupt their manners notwithstanding the earnest cries of this great city that importune these writers to reform the theatre and no longer to infest her youth and draw their inclinations from their professions and employments notwithstanding the sighs and tears of many once flourishing but now disconsolate families ruind by the dissolute lives of their chief branches who lost their vertue by frequenting the fatal entertainments of the theatre notwithstanding the wise and sober part of the kingdom earnestly sollicit them to spare the people to stop the spreading plague and slay the destroying pen they persevere with intrepid resolution and inexorable cruelty to poison the minds and ruin the morals of the nation  the great archbishop tillotson has set our present theatre in a true light in his discourse upon corrupt communication  i shall only speak a few words concerning plays which as they are now orderd among us are a mighty reproach to the age and nation  to speak against them in general may be thought too severe and that which the present age cannot so well brook and would not perhaps be so just and reasonable because it is very possible they might be so framd and governd by such rules as not only to be innocently diverting but instructing and useful to put some vices and follies out of countenance which cannot perhaps be so decently reprovd nor so effectually exposd and corrected any other way but as the stage now is they are intollerable and not fit to be permitted in a civilizd much less a christian nation they do most notoriously minister both to infidelity and vice by the profaneness of them they are apt to instil bad principles into the minds of men and to lessen that awe and reverence which all men ought to have for god and religion and by their lewdness they teach vice and are apt to infect the minds of men and dispose them to lewd and dissolute practices  and therefore i do not see how any persons pretending to sobriety and vertue and especially to the pure and holy religion of our blessed saviour can without great guilt and open contradiction to his holy profession be present at such lewd and immodest plays much less frequent them as too many do who yet would take it very ill to be shut out of the communion of christians as they would most certainly have been in the first and purest ages of christianity  and not only wise and sober men have declard their detestation of the immorality of the stage but eminent poets themselves who have written the most applauded comedies have ownd that the theatre stands in great need of restraints and regulation and wishd that plays were compild in such an inoffensive manner that not only discreet and vertuous persons of the laity but a bishop himself without being shockd might be present while they were acted mr dryden has up and down in his prefatory discourses and dedications freely aeknowledgd the looseness of our dramatick entertainments which sometimes he charges upon the countenance given to it by the dissolute court of king charles the second and sometimes upon the vitiated taste of the people in his dedication of juvenal made english to the late famous earl of dorset he thus bespeaks him as a counsellor bred up in the knowledge of the municipal and statute laws may honestly inform a just prince how far his prerogative extends so i may be allowd to tell your lordship who by an indisputed title are the king of poets what an extent of power you have and how lawfully you may exercise it over the petulant scriblers of the age as lord chamberlain you are absolute by your office in all that belongs to the decency and good manners of the stage you can banish thence scurrility and profaneness and restrain the licentious insolence of the poets and their actors in all things that shock the publick quiet or the reputation of private persons under the notion of humour hence it evidently appears that mr dryden lookd on the decency of the stage to be violated in his time by licentious and insolent poets and i wish i could say that there is less reason of complaint in ours in a copy of verses publishd in one of the volumes of the miscellany poems the same celebrated author inveighs against the lewdness and pollutions of the stage in the strongest expressions that can be conceivd and in his latter days when his judgment was more mature he condemns all his loose and profane writings to the flames which he says they justly deserve which is not only a free and ingenious confession of his fault but a considerable mark of repentance and worthy to be imitated by his successors who have broken in upon the rules of vertue and modesty in the like manner  tho all men of vertue who wish well to mankind and are zealous for the happiness of their country cannot but observe the mischievous effects of these licentious dramatick compositions yet they will find it very difficult to suggest an effectual remedy for the cure of so obstinate an evil the ingenious spaniard mentiond before for stopping the progress of this contagious lewdness in his country proposd to the government that an officer or inspector might be establishd with authority to peruse and correct the poets writings and that no comedies should be presented to the publick without his licence and approbation  but if this would have been sufficient to have prevented or removd this hurtful practice the british nation would long since have had no reason to complain on this subject we have officers intrusted with this useful and important power and are able if they please to hinder the spreading of the infection by not permitting such noxious productions to appear in publick but whether those inspectors have had a true taste and judgment themselves or have diligently applyd themselves to the reading and amending the comedies put into their hands for their approbation or whether they comply with the importunity of the actors who tell them that such is the disposition of the audience that no plays of that kind will appear beautiful if they are stripd of those embellishments and ornaments of wit which some morose and unfashionable people stile impure and obscene and that to leave out those ingenious strokes and heightnings of fancy and put into the mouths of the actors only good sense and modest and clean expressions is to clear and refine our comedies from the most entertaining and delightful parts perhaps they assure them that the audience will endure no reformation of the stage and that it were altogether as adviseable to shut up the doors of the playhouse as to attempt a regulation of the pleasures and diversions of it  but tho men who love their country born down with a torrent of profane libertines persons without taste and distinction of vertue and vice have almost despaird of seeing the comick poets reformd and the exorbitant liberties of the stage restraind within the limits of modest language and decent behaviour yet now their hopes revive and they promise to themselves a sudden and effectual reformation of these abuses since the government has placd so worthy a person at the head of the actors and given him ample authority to rectify their errors what a happy revolution what a regular and clean stage may justly be now expected how free from all sordid and impure mixtures how innocent as well as diverting will our comedies appear when they have been corrected and refind by such an accomplishd director of the dramatick poets one that has a true and delicate taste and who is sensible of the indecencies and hurtful nature of our plays who has engagd his celebrated pen in defiance of sneering wits and powerful libertines on the side of vertue and has propagated the esteem of morals humanity decorum and sobriety of manners who with great spirit genius and courage to his lasting honour has publickly exposd the absurdities vices and follies that stain and disgrace the theatre in which censure he has not spard his own performances one who has expressd a warm zeal on this subject and declard his generous intention if it were in his power to cleanse these polluted places and not to suffer a comedy to be presented but what had past a severe examination and where all things which might shock a modest ear or be lookd on as repugnant to good manners might be expungd  but if these fair expectations should be blasted in the bloom and notwithstanding the vigorous efforts which will be made by this reformer immorality shall maintain its ground and keep possession of the theatre some other expedients may be suggested to procure a regulation it might perhaps be desirable that a few persons of importance men of learning gravity and good taste might be commissiond by authority as a check upon the actors to censure and suppress any dramatick entertainments that shall offend against religion sobriety of manners or the publick peace and all persons should be encouragd to send them such loose or profane passages which they hear from the stage or read in the printed plays nor will it be less expedient that they should be instructed to peruse the plays already publishd and which are now publickly acted and to expunge all offensive and criminal mixtures that hereafter they may become a clean and innocent diversion besides this end would the more effectually be accomplishd if the writers of comedy farce and interludes were rewarded and supported by means independent on the actors for while the poets who write for a maintenance are paid by the theatre they will be under a great temptation to write as desird and directed by the actors which was the complaint of cervantes abovecited concerning the comick poets of spain the actors we may safely conclude are not restraind by such rigorous precepts of vertue but that they will always be inclind to present those performances which will best fill the house and promote their interest and therefore they will readily humour the vitiated taste of the audience by acting the most immoral plays while they find their account in doing so and that which confirms this observation is that they never as far as i have heard rejected any comedy merely for its looseness tho i believe they have refusd many for want of that entertaining quality now were the comick writers provided of a subsistence some other way they would be deliverd from the necessity of complying with their actors by writing such plays as they shall bespeak or at least approve as the most likely to invite a profitable audience  it would prove an effectual remedy for this evil if the ladies would discountenance these loose comedies by expressing their dislike and refusing to be present when they are acted and this no doubt they would do were they informd that the comedies which they encourage by their appearance at the theatre are full of wanton sentiments obscene allusions and immodest ideas containd in expressions of a double meaning for it cannot be imagind they would bear with unconcernedness much less with pleasure discourses in publick which they detest as unsufferable in private convention if they knew them to be unchast and should the ladies assert their esteem of vertue and declare openly on the side of modesty the most attractive beauty of the fair sex as certainly they would do if they understood how much those amiable qualities have been exposd and affronted by our most eminent comick poets this would lay the ax to the root and at one blow destroy this pernicious practice for after this what writer would transgress the rules of decency and purity of expression when he knows that by his immodest mixtures he shall fright the ladies from the house  it would be another effectual means to redress the grievance of the stage if the clergy could be prevaild upon to condemn from the pulpit and the press as well as in their conversation the unjustifiable entertainments of the theatre would they insist upon it and urge it as a necessary duty of the people to avoid these occasions and at least appearances of evil would they shew them that by frequenting these unwarrantable diversions they rush into snares court temptation and invite others to follow their criminal example would they set before them the hazard of playing on the nice and dubious limits of innocence and adventuring to the utmost extent of vertue and the frontier of vice there would be great hopes of stemming this strong tide of iniquity and this is no more than the indispensable obligation which our divines are under whose proper province it is to warn the people of their danger and to press them earnestly to fly from it this venerable order have by solemn engagements set themselves apart as spiritual guides to point out the fatal rocks and treacherous sands to their neighbours that they may not make shipwreck of modesty and innocence and plunge into the depths of irreligion and vice nor is it obvious why these reverend teachers by their silence and neutrality should give profaneness and immorality such fair play as if the controversy between the stage and the pulpit were compremisd and the poets and the priests were engagd as indeed they ought to be in the same good designs interests and pursuits it is certain that this mildness and friendly behaviour of the clergy to the comick writers cannot arise from any respect or handsome usage which that sacred order has met with on the theatre where they have been so often jerkd and exposd in such a manner that their divine function has been wounded through their sides  the clergy lie under such manifest obligations to attack publick immorality wherever it is found and by whatsoever patrons of power dignity and interest it is shelterd and supported thar as i have suggested it is not easy to imagine whence their lenity and tenderness for the theatre can proceed but if the true reason of it whatever it is and which is so hard to be accounted for were removd and our divines would interest themselves with zeal in the cause of vertue in respect to our dramatick entertainments as they espouse and defend it in all other instances i cannot believe that the stage without a regulation would be able to stand when batterd with vigor from the pulpit the poets and players would soon find themselves obligd to restrain their licentious conduct reform the theatre and present to the town if not instructive at least inoffensive and unshocking diversions and it is very desirable that this expedient were set on foot that the honour of the english theatre may be retrievd that while we justly boast of our priority in wit and humour to our neighbours we may not be obligd to acknowledge the great inferiority of our comedies in respect of cleanness and moral beauty that we may not be reproachd that while we profess a reformd and pure religion we encourage an immodest and unreformd theatre and that we are very defective in the practice of vertue and regularity of manners while these abominations are indulgd and these unhallowd groves and high places of immorality are frequented without disturbance
