the gallick tyrants chain for see the british genius comes to cheer the fainting sons and kindleem to war with her own glorious fires their souls she warms and bids em burn for liberty and arms unhappy land the foremost once in fame once lifting to the stars thy noble name in arts excelling and in arms severe the western kingdoms envy and their fear where is thy pride thy conscious honor flown thy ancient valor and thy first renown how art thou sunk among the nations now how have thou taught thy haughty neek to bow and dropped the warriors wreath inglorious from thy brow not thus of old her valiant fathers bore the bondage of the unbelieving moor but often alternate made the victors yield and proved their might in many a wellfought field bold in defense of liberty they stood and doubly died their cross in moorish blood then in heroic arms their knights excelled the tyrant then and giant then they quelled then every nobler thought their minds did move and those who fought for freedom sighed for love like one those sacred flames united live at once they languish and at once revive alike they shun the coward and the slave but bless the free the virtuous and the brave nor frown ye fair nor think my verse untrue though we disdain that man should man subdue yet all the freeborn race are slaves alike to you yet once again that glory to restore the britons seek the celtiberian shore with echoing peals at annas high command their naval thunder wakes the drowsy land high at their head iberias promised lord young charles of austria waves his shining sword his youthful veins with hopes of empire glow swell his bold heart and urge him on the foe with joy he reads in every warriors face some happy omen of a sure success then leaps exulting on the hostile strand and thinks the destined scepter in his hand nor fate denies what first his wishes name proud barcelona owns his juster claim with the first laurel binds his youthful brows and pledge of future crowns the mural wreath bestows but soon the equal of his youthful years philip of bourbons haughty line appears like hopes attend his birth like glories grace if glory can be in a tyrants race in numbers proud he threats no more from far but nearer draws the black impending war he views his host then scorns the rebel town and dooms to certain death the rival of his crown now fame and empire all the nobler spoils that urge the hero and reward his toils placed in their view alike their hopes engage and fire their breasts with more than mortal rage not lawless love not vengeance nor despair so daring fierce untamed and furious are as when ambition prompts the great to war as youthful kings when striving for renown they prove their might in arms and combat for a crown hard was the cruel strife and doubtful long betwixt the chiefs suspended conquest hung till forced at length disdaining much to yield charles to his rival quits the fatal field numbers and fortune over his right prevail and even the british valor seems to fail and yet they failed not all in that extreme conscious of virtue liberty and fame they vow the youthful monarchs fate to share above distress unconquered by despair still to defend the town and animate the war but lo when every better hope was past when every day of danger seemed their last far on the distant ocean they survey where a proud navy plows its watery way nor long they doubted but with joy descry upon the chiefs tall topmasts waving high the british cross and belgic lion fly loud with tumultuous clamor loud they rear their cries of ecstasy and rend the air in peals on peals the shouts triumphal rise spread swift and rattle through the spacious skies while from below old ocean groans profound the walls the rocks the shores repel the sound ring with the deafning shock and thunder all around such was the joy the trojan youth expressed who by the fierce rutilians siege distressed were by the tyrrhene aid at length released when young ascanius then in arms first tried numbers and every other want supplied and haughty turnus from his walls defied saved in the town an empire yet to come and fixed the fate of his imperial rome but oh what verse what numbers shall reveal those pangs of rage and grief the vanquished feel who shall retreating philips shame impart and tell the anguish of his laboring heart what paint what speaking pencil shall express the blended passions striving in his face hate indignation courage pride remorse with thoughts of glory past the losers greatest curse fatal ambition say what wondrous charms delude mankind to toil for thee in arms when all thy spoils thy wreaths in battle won the pride of power and glory of a crown when all war gives when all the great can gain even thy whole pleasure pays not half thy pain all hail ye softer happier arts of peace secured from harms and blessed with learned ease in battles blood and perils hard unskilled which haunt the warrior in the fatal field but chief thee goddess muse my verse would raise and to thy own soft numbers tune thy praise happy the youth inspired beneath thy shade thy verdant everliving laurels laid there safe no pleasures there no pains they know but those which from thy sacred raptures flow nor wish for crowns but what thy groves bestow me nymph divine nor scorn my humble prayer receive unworthy to thy kinder care doomed to a gentler though more lowly fate nor wishing once nor knowing to be great me to thy peaceful haunts inglorious bring where secret thy celestial sisters sing fast by their sacred hill and sweet castalian spring but nobler thoughts the victor prince employ and raise his heart with high triumphant joy from hence a better course of time rolls on and whiter days successive seem to run from hence his kinder fortune seems to date the rising glories of his future state from hence  but oh too soon the hero mourns his hopes deceived and wars inconstant turns in vain his echoing trumpets loud alarms provoke the cold iberian lords to arms careless of fame as of their monarchs fate in sullen sloth supinely proud they sat or to be slaves or free alike prepared and trusting heaven was bound to be their guard untouched with shame the noble strife beheld nor once essayed to struggle to the field but sought in the cool shade and rural seat an unmolested ease and calm retreat saw each contending princes arms advance then with a lazy dull indifference turned to their rest and left the world to chance so when commanded by the wife of jove thaumantian iris left the realms above and swift descending on her painted bow sought the dull god of sleep in shades below nodding and slow his drowsy head he reared and heavily the sacred message heard then with a yawn at once forgot the pain and sunk to his first sloth and indolence again but oh my muse the ungrateful toil forsake some task more pleasing to thy numbers take nor choose in melancholy strains to tell each harder chance the juster cause befell oh rather turn auspicious turn thy flight where marlboroughs heroic arms invite where highest deeds the poets breast inspire with rage divine and fan the sacred fire see where at once ramillias noble field ten thousand themes for living verse shall yield see where at once the dreadful objects rise at once they spread before my wondering eyes and shock my laboring soul with vast surprise at once the wideextended battles move at once they join at once their fate they prove the roar ascends promiscuous groans and cries the drums the cannons burst the shout supplies one universal anarchy of noise one din confused sound mixed and lost in sound echos to all the frighted cities round thick dust and smoke in wavy clouds arise stain the bright day and taint the purer skies while flashing flames like lightning dart between and fill the horror of the fatal scene around the field all died in purple foam hate fury and insatiate slaughter roam discord with pleasure over the ruin treads and laughing wraps her in her tattered weeds while fierce bellona thunders in her car shakes terrible her steely whip from far and with new rage revives the fainting war so when two currents rapid in their course rush to a point and meet with equal force the angry billows rear their heads on high dashing aloft the foaming surges fly and rising cloud the air with misty spry the raging flood is heard from far to rore by listening shepherds on the distant shore while much they fear what ills it should portend and wonder why the watery gods contend high in the midst britannias warlike chief too greatly bold and prodigal of life is seen to press where death and dangers call where the war bleeds and where the thickest fall he flies and drives confused the fainting gaul like heat diffused his great example warms and animates the social warriors arms inflames each colder heart confirms the bold makes the young heroes and renews the old in forms divine around him watchful wait the guardian genii of the british state justice and truth his steps unerring guide and faithful loyalty defends his side prudence and fortitude their marlero guard and pleasing liberty his labors cheered but chief the angel of his queen was there the union cross his silver shield did bear and in his decent hand he shook a warlike spear while victory celestial soars above plumed like the eagle of imperial jove hangs over the chief whom she delights to bless and ever arms his sword with sure success dooms him the proud oppressor to destroy then waves her palm and claps her wings for joy such was young ammon on arbelas plain or such the le brun painter did the hero feign where rushing on and fierce he seems to ride with graceful ardor and majestic pride with all the gods of greece and fortune on his side nor long bavarias haughty prince in vain labors the fight unequal to maintain he sees it is doomed his fatal friend the gaul shall share the shame and in one ruin fall flies from the foe too often in battle tried and heaven contending on the victors side then mourns his rash ambitions crime too late and yields reluctant to the force of fate so when aeneas through nights gloomy shade the dreadful forms of hostile gods surveyed hopeless he lose the burning town and fled saw twas in vain to prop declining troy or save what heaven had destined to destroy what vast reward o europe shall thou pay to him who saved thee on this glorious day bless him ye grateful nations where he goes and heap the victors laurel on his brows in every land in every city freed let the proud column rear its marble head to marlborough and liberty decreed rich with his wars triumphal arches raise to teach your wondering sons the heros praise to him your skilful bards their verse shall bring for him the tuneful voice be taught to sing the breathing pipe shall swell shall found the trembling string oh happy thou where peace for ever smiles britannia noblest of the oceans isles fair queen who do amidst thy waters reign and stretch thy empire over the farthest main what transports in thy parent bosom rolled when fame at first the pleasing story told how did thou lift thy towry front on high not meanly conscious of a mothers joy proud of thy son as crete was of her jove how were thou pleased heaven did thy choice approve and fixed success where thou had fixed thy love how with regret his absence did thou mourn how with impatience wait his wished return how were the winds accused for his delay how did thou chide the gods who rule the sea and charge the nereid nymphs to waft him on his way at length he comes he ceases from his toil like kings of old returning from the spoil to britain and his queen for ever dear he comes their joy and grateful thanks to share lowly he kneels before the royal seat and lays his proudest wreaths at annas feet while formed alike for labors or for ease in camps to thunder or in courts to please britains bright nymphs make marlborough their care in all his dangers all his triumphs share conquering he lends the wellpleased fair new grace and adds fresh luster to each beauteous face britain preserved by his victorious arms with wondrous pleasure each fair bosom warms lightens in all their eyes and doubles all their cherms even his own sunderland in beautys store so rich she seemed incapable of more now shines with graces never known before fierce with transporting joy she seems to burn and each soft feature takes a sprightly turn new flames are seen to sparkle in her eyes and on her blooming cheeks fresh roses rise the pleasing passion heightens each bright hue and seems to touch the finished piece anew improves what natures bounteous hand had given and mends the fairest workmanship of heaven nor joy like this in courts is only found but spreads to all the grateful people round laborious hinds inured to rural toil to tend the flocks and turn the mellow soil in homely guise their honest hearts express and bless the warrior who protects the peace who keeps the foe aloof and drives afar the dreadful ravage of the wasting war no rude destroyer cuts the ripening crop prevents the harvest and deludes their hope no helpless wretches fly with wild amaze look weeping back and see their dwellings blaze the victors chain no mournful captives know nor hear the threats of the insulting foe but freedom laughs the fuitful fields abound the cheerful voice of mirth is heard to sound and plenty doles her various bounties round the humble village and the wealthy town consenting join their happiness to own what heaven and annas gentlest reign afford all is secured by marlbros conquering sword o sacred ever honored name o thou that were our greatest william once below what place soever thy virtues now possess near the bright source of everlasting bliss wherever exalted to etherial height radiant with stars thou treadst the fields of light thy seats divine thy heaven awhile forsake and deign the britons triumph to partake nor art thou changed but still thou shall delight to hear the fortune of the glorious fight how failed oppression and prevailed the right what once below such still thy pleasures are europe and liberty are still thy care thy great thy generous pure immortal mind is ever to the public good inclined is still the tyrants foe and patron of mankind behold where marlborough thy last best gift at parting to thy native belgia left succeeds to all thy kind paternal cares thy watchful counsels and laborious wars like thee extends his great assisting hand and in thy stead protects the orphan land like thee aspires by virtue to renown fights to secure an empire not his own reaps only toil himself and gives away a crown at length thy prayer o pious prince is heard heaven has at length in its own cause appeared at length ramillias field atones for all the faithless breaches of the perjured gaul at length a better age to man decreed with truth with peace and justice shall succeed fallen are the proud and the grieved world is freed one triumph yet my muse remains behind another vengeance yet the gaul shall find on lombard plains beyond his alpine hills louis the force of hostile britain feels swift to her friends distressed her succors fly and distant wars her wealthy sons supply from slow unactive courts they grieve to hear eugene a name to every briton dear by tedious languishing delays is held repining and impatient from the field while factious statesmen riot in excess and lazy priests whole provinces possess of unregarded wants the brave complain and the starved soldier sues for bread in vain at once with generous indignation warm britain the treasure sends and bids the hero arm staight eager to the field he speeds away there vows the victor gaul shall dear repay the spoils of calcinatos fatal day cheered by the presence of the chief they love once more their fate the warriors long to prove revived each soldier lifts his drooping head forgets his wounds and calls him on to lead again their crests the german eagles rear stretch their broad wings and fan the latian air greedy for battle and the prey they call and point great eugenes thunder on the gaul the chief commands and soon in dread array onwards the moving legions urge their way with hardy marches and successful haste over every barrier fortunate they passed which nature or the skilful foe had placed the foe in vain with gallick arts attends to mark which way the wary leader bends vainly in wars mysterious rules is wise lurks where tall woods and thickest coverts rise and meanly hopes a conquest from surprise now with swift horse the plain around em beats and often advances and as often retreats now fixed to wait the coming force he seems secured by steepy banks and rapid streams while rivergods in vain exhaust their store from plenteous urns the gushing torrents pour rise over their utmost margins to the plain and strive to stay the warriors haste in vain alike they pass the plain and closer wood explore the ford and tempt the swelling flood unshaken still pursue their steadfast course and where they want their way they find it or they force but anxious thoughts savoys great prince infest and roll illboding in his careful breast often he revolves the ruins of the great and sadly thinks on lost bavarias fate the hapless mark of fortunes cruel sport an exile meanly forced to beg support from the slow bounties of a foreign court forced from his loved turin his last retreat his glory once and empires ancient seat he sees from far where wide destructions spread and fiery showers the goodly town invade then turns to mourn in vain his ruined state and curse the unrelenting tyrants hate but great eugene prevents his every fear he had resolved it and he would be there not danger toil the tedious weary way nor all the gallick powers his promised aid delay like truth itself unknowing how to fail he scorned to doubt and knew he must prevail thus ever certain does the sun appear bound by the law of joves eternal year thus constant to his course sets out at morn round the wide world in twice twelve hours is born and to a moment keeps his fixed return straight to the town the heroes turn their care their friendly succor for the brave prepare and on the foe united bend the war over the steep trench and ramparts guarded height at once they rush and drive the rapid fight with idle arms the gallick legions seem to stem the rage of the resistless stream at once it bears em down at once they yield headlong are pushed and swept along the field resistance ceases and it is war no more at once the vanquished own the victors power throughout the field wherever they turn their sight it is all or conquest or inglorious flight swift to their rescued friends their joys they bear with life and liberty at once they cheer and save em in the moment of despair so timely to the aid of sinking rome with active haste did great camillus come so to the capitol he forced his way so from the proud barbarians snatched the prey and saved his country in one signal day from impious arms at length o louis cease and leave at length the laboring world in peace lest heaven disclose some yet more fatal scene fatal beyond ramillia or turin lest from thy hand thou see thy scepter torn and humbled in the dust thy losses mourn
