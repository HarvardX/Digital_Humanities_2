autobiography     –   0          jan   at the age of    i begin to make some memoranda and state some recollections of dates  facts concerning myself for my own more ready reference  for the information of my family the tradition in my fathers family was that their ancestor came to this country from wales and from near the mountain of snowdon the highest in gr br i noted once a case from wales in the law reports where a person of our name was either pl or def and one of the same name was secretary to the virginia company  these are the only instances in which i have met with the name in that country i have found it in our early records but the first particular information i have of any ancestor was   my grandfather who lived at the place in chesterfield called ozbornes and ownd the lands afterwards the glebe of the parish  he had three sons thomas who died young field who settled on the waters of roanoke and left numerous descendants and peter my father who settled on the lands i still own called shadwell  adjoining my present residence he was born feb      0   and intermarried      with jane randolph of the age of    daur of isham randolph one of the seven sons of that name  family settled at dungeoness in goochld they trace their pedigree far back in england  scotland to which let every one ascribe the faith  merit he chooses my fathers education had been quite neglected but being of a strong mind sound judgment and eager after information he read much and improved himself insomuch that he was chosen with joshua fry professor of mathem in w  m college to continue the boundary line between virginia  n caroline which had been begun by colo byrd and was afterwards employed with the same mr fry to make the  st map of virginia  which had ever been made that of capt smith being merely a conjectural sketch they possessed excellent materials for so much of the country as is below the blue ridge little being then known beyond that ridge he was the    d or  th settler of the part of the country in which i live which was about      he died aug         leaving my mother a widow who lived till      with   daurs    sons myself the elder  to my younger brother he left his estate on james river called snowden after the supposed birthplace of the family to myself the lands on which i was born  live he placed me at the english school at   years of age and at the latin at   where i continued until his death my teacher mr douglas  a clergyman from scotland was but a superficial latinist less instructed in greek but with the rudiments of these languages he taught me french and on the death of my father i went to the revd mr maury  a correct classical scholar with whom i continued two years and then went to wm and mary college to wit in the spring of    0 where i continued   years it was my great good fortune and what probably fixed   the destinies of my life that dr wm small of scotland was then professor of mathematics a man profound in most of the useful branches of science with a happy talent of communication correct and gentlemanly manners  an enlarged  liberal mind he most happily for me became soon attached to me  made me his daily companion when not engaged in the school and from his conversation i got my first views of the expansion of science  of the system of things in which we are placed fortunately the philosophical chair became vacant soon after my arrival at college and he was appointed to fill it per interim and he was the first who ever gave in that college regular lectures in ethics rhetoric  belles lettres he returned to europe in      having previously filled up the measure of his goodness to me by procuring for me from his most intimate friend g wythe a reception as a student of law under his direction and introduced me to the acquaintance and familiar table of governor fauquier the ablest man who had ever filled that office with him and at his table dr small  mr wythe his amici omnium horarum  myself formed a partie quarree  to the habitual conversations on these occasions i owed much instruction mr wythe continued to be my faithful and beloved mentor in youth and my most affectionate friend through life in      he led me into the practice of the law at the bar of the general court at which i continued until the revolution shut up the courts of justice for a sketch of the life  character of mr wythe see my letter of aug     0 to mr john saunderson   in      i became a member of the legislature by the choice of the county in which i live  continued in that until it was closed by the revolution i made one effort in that body for the permission of the emancipation of slaves  which was rejected and indeed during the regal government nothing liberal could expect success our minds were circumscribed within narrow limits by an habitual belief that it was our duty to be subordinate to the mother country in all matters of government to direct all our labors in subservience to her interests and even to observe a bigoted intolerance for all religions but hers the difficulties with our representatives were of habit and despair not of reflection  conviction experience soon proved that they could bring their minds to rights on the first summons of their attention but the kings council which acted as another house of legislature held their places at will  were in most humble obedience to that will the governor too who had a negative on our laws held by the same tenure  with still greater devotedness to it and last of all the royal negative closed the last door to every hope of amelioration on the  st of january      i was married to martha skelton widow of bathurst skelton  daughter of john wayles then    years old mr wayles was a lawyer of much practice to which he   was introduced more by his great industry punctuality  practical readiness than to eminence in the science of his profession he was a most agreeable companion full of pleasantry  good humor and welcomed in every society he acquired a handsome fortune died in may      leaving three daughters and the portion which came on that event to mrs jefferson after the debts should be paid which were very considerable was about equal to my own patrimony and consequently doubled the ease of our circumstances when the famous resolutions of      against the stampact were proposed i was yet a student of law in wmsbg i attended the debate however at the door of the lobby of the h of burgesses  heard the splendid display of mr henrys talents as a popular orator they were great indeed such as i have never heard from any other man he appeared to me to speak as homer wrote mr johnson a lawyer  member from the northern neck seconded the resolns  by him the learning  the logic of the case were chiefly maintained my recollections of these transactions may be seen pa  0 wirts life of p h  to whom i furnished them in may       a meeting of the general assembly was called by the govr ld botetourt i had then become a member and to that meeting became known the joint resolutions  address of the lords  commons of     –  on the proceedings in massachusetts counterresolutions  an address to the   king by the h of burgesses were agreed to with little opposition  a spirit manifestly displayed of considering the cause of massachusetts as a common one the governor dissolved us  but we met the next day in the apollo  of the raleigh tavern formed ourselves into a voluntary convention drew up articles of association against the use of any merchandise imported from gr britain signed and recommended them to the people repaired to our several counties  were re elected without any other exception than of the very few who had declined assent to our proceedings nothing of particular excitement occurring for a considerable time our countrymen seemed to fall into a state of insensibility to our situation the duty on tea not yet repealed  the declaratory act of a right in the british parl to bind us by their laws in all cases whatsoever still suspended over us but a court of inquiry held in r island in      with a power to send persons to england to be tried for offences committed here  was considered at our session of the spring of      as demanding attention not thinking our old  leading members up to the point of forwardness  zeal which the times required mr henry r h lee francis l lee mr carr  myself agreed to meet in the evening in a private room of the raleigh to consult on the state of things there may have been a member or two more whom i  0 do not recollect we were all sensible that the most urgent of all measures was that of coming to an understanding with all the other colonies to consider the british claims as a common cause to all  to produce an unity of action and for this purpose that a commee of correspondence in each colony would be the best instrument for intercommunication and that their first measure would probably be to propose a meeting of deputies from every colony at some central place who should be charged with the direction of the measures which should be taken by all we therefore drew up the resolutions which may be seen in wirt pa    the consulting members proposed to me to move them but i urged that it should be done by mr carr  my friend  brother in law then a new member to whom i wished an opportunity should be given of making known to the house his great worth  talents it was so agreed he moved them they were agreed to nem con and a commee of correspondence appointed of whom peyton randolph the speaker was chairman the govr then ld dunmore dissolved us but the commee met the next day prepared a circular letter to the speakers of the other colonies inclosing to each a copy of the resolns and left it in charge with their chairman to forward them by expresses the origination of these commees of correspondence between the colonies has been since claimed for massachusetts and marshall ii     has given into this error altho the very note of his appendix to which he refers shows that their establmt was confined    to their own towns this matter will be seen clearly stated in a letter of samuel adams wells to me of apr        and my answer of may    i was corrected by the letter of mr wells in the information i had given mr wirt as stated in his note pa    that the messengers of massach  virga crossed each other on the way bearing similar propositions for mr wells shows that mass did not adopt the measure but on the receipt of our proposn delivered at their next session their message therefore which passed ours must have related to something else for i well remember p randolphs informing me of the crossing of our messengers the next event which excited our sympathies for massachusets was the boston port bill by which that port was to be shut up on the  st of june      this arrived while we were in session in the spring of that year the lead in the house on these subjects being no longer left to the old members mr henry r h lee fr l lee   or   other members whom i do not recollect and myself agreeing that we must boldly take an unequivocal stand in the line with massachusetts determined to meet and consult on the proper measures in the council chamber for the benefit of the library in that room we were under conviction of the necessity of arousing our people from the lethargy into which they had fallen as to passing events and thought that the appointment of a day of general fasting  prayer would be most likely to call up  alarm their attention  no    example of such a solemnity had existed since the days of our distresses in the war of    since which a new generation had grown up with the help therefore of rushworth whom we rummaged over for the revolutionary precedents  forms of the puritans of that day preserved by him we cooked up a resolution somewhat modernizing their phrases for appointing the  st day of june on which the port bill was to commence for a day of fasting humiliation  prayer to implore heaven to avert from us the evils of civil war to inspire us with firmness in support of our rights and to turn the hearts of the king  parliament to moderation  justice  to give greater emphasis to our proposition we agreed to wait the next morning on mr nicholas  whose grave  religious character was more in unison with the tone of our resolution and to solicit him to move it we accordingly went to him in the morning he moved it the same day the  st of june was proposed and it passed without opposition  the governor dissolved    us as usual we retired to the apollo as before agreed to an association  and instructed the commee of correspdce to propose to the corresponding commees of the other colonies to appoint deputies to meet in congress at such place annually as should be convenient to direct from time to time the measures required by the general interest and we declared that an attack on any one colony should be considered as an attack on the whole this was in may  we further recommended to the several counties to elect deputies to meet at wmsbg the  st of aug ensuing to consider the state of the colony  particularly to appoint delegates to a general congress should that measure be acceded to by the commees of correspdce generally  it was acceded to philadelphia was appointed for the place and the  th of sep for the time of meeting we returned home and in our several counties invited the clergy to meet assemblies of the people on the  st of june  to perform the ceremonies of the day  to address to them discourses suited to the occasion the people met generally with anxiety  alarm in their countenances and the effect of the day thro the whole colony was like a shock of electricity arousing every man  placing him erect  solidly on his centre    they chose universally delegates for the convention being elected one for my own county i prepared a draught of instructions to be given to the delegates whom we should send to the congress and which i meant to propose at our meeting in this i took the ground which from the beginning i had thought the only one orthodox or tenable which was that the relation between gr br and these colonies was exactly the same as that of england  scotland after the accession of james  until the union and the same as her present relations with hanover having the same executive chief but no other necessary political connection and that our emigration from england to this country gave her no more rights over us than the emigrations of the danes and saxons gave to the present authorities of the mother country over england in this doctrine however i had never been able to get any one to agree with me but mr wythe he concurred in it from the first dawn of the question what was the political relation between us  england our other patriots randolph the lees nicholas pendleton stopped at the halfway house of john dickinson who admitted that england had a right to regulate our commerce and to lay duties on it for the purposes of regulation but not of raising revenue but for this ground there was no foundation in compact in any acknowledged principles of colonization nor in reason expatriation being a natural right and acted on as such by all nations in all ages i set out for wmsbg some days before that appointed for our meeting but was taken ill of a dysentery on the road  unable to proceed    i sent on therefore to wmsbg two copies of my draught the one under cover to peyton randolph who i knew would be in the chair of the convention the other to patrick henry whether mr henry disapproved the ground taken or was too lazy to read it for he was the laziest man in reading i ever knew i never learned but he communicated it to nobody peyton randolph informed the convention he had received such a paper from a member prevented by sickness from offering it in his place and he laid it on the table for perusal it was read generally by the members approved by many but thought too bold for the present state of things but they printed it in pamphlet form under the title of a summary view of the rights of british america it found its way to england was taken up by the opposition interpolated a little by mr burke so as to make it answer opposition purposes and in that form ran rapidly thro several editions  this information i had from parson hurt  who happened at the time to be in london whither he had gone to receive clerical orders and i was informed afterwards by peyton randolph that it had procured me the honor of having my name inserted in a long list of proscriptions enrolled in a bill of attainder commenced in one of the houses of parliament but suppressed in embryo by the hasty step of events which warned them to be a little cautious  montague    agent of the h of burgesses in england made extracts from the bill copied the names and sent them to peyton randolph the names i think were about  0 which he repeated to me but i recollect those only of hancock the two adamses peyton randolph himself patrick henry  myself  the convention met on the  st of aug renewed their association appointed delegates to the congress gave them instructions very temperately  properly expressed both as to style  matter and they repaired to philadelphia at the time appointed the splendid proceedings of that congress at their  st session belong to general history are known to every one and need not therefore be noted here they terminated their session on the   th of octob to meet again on the  0th may ensuing the convention at their ensuing session of mar     approved of the proceedings of congress thanked their delegates and reappointed the same persons to represent the colony at the meeting to be held in may and foreseeing the probability that peyton randolph their president and speaker also of the h of b might be called off they added me in that event to the delegation mr randolph was according to expectation obliged to leave the chair of congress to attend the gen assembly summoned by ld dunmore to meet on the  st day of june      ld norths conciliatory    propositions as they were called had been received by the governor and furnished the subject for which this assembly was convened mr randolph accordingly attended and the tenor of these propositions being generally known as having been addressed to all the governors he was anxious that the answer of our assembly likely to be the first  should harmonize with what he knew to be the sentiments and wishes of the body he had recently left he feared that mr nicholas whose mind was not yet up to the mark of the times would undertake the answer  therefore pressed me to prepare an answer i did so and with his aid carried it through the house with long and doubtful scruples from mr nicholas and james mercer and a dash of cold water on it here  there enfeebling it somewhat but finally with unanimity or a vote approaching it  this being passed i repaired immediately to philadelphia and conveyed to congress the first notice they had of it it was entirely approved there i took my seat with them on the   st of june on the   th a commee which had been appointed to prepare a declaration of the causes of taking up arms brought in their report drawn i believe by j rutledge which not being liked they recommitted it on the   th and added mr dickinson and myself to the committee on the rising of the house the commee having not yet met i happened to find myself near govr w livingston and proposed to him to draw the paper    he excused himself and proposed that i should draw it on my pressing him with urgency we are as yet but new acquaintances sir said he why are you so earnest for my doing it because said i i have been informed that you drew the address to the people of gr britain a production certainly of the finest pen in america on that says he perhaps sir you may not have been correctly informed i had received the information in virginia from colo harrison on his return from that congress lee livingston  jay had been the commee for that draught the first prepared by lee had been disapproved  recommitted the second was drawn by jay but being presented by govr livingston had led colo harrison into the error the next morning walking in the hall of congress many members being assembled but the house not yet formed i observed mr jay speaking to r h lee and leading him by the button of his coat to me i understand sir said he to me that this gentleman informed you that govr livingston drew the address to the people of gr britain i assured him at once that i had not received that information from mr lee  that not a word had ever passed on the subject between mr lee  myself and after some explanations the subject was dropt these gentlemen had had some sparrings in debate before and continued ever very hostile to each other i prepared a draught of the declaration committed to us  it was too strong for mr dickinson he still retained the hope of reconciliation with the    mother country and was unwilling it should be lessened by offensive statements he was so honest a man  so able a one that he was greatly indulged even by those who could not feel his scruples we therefore requested him to take the paper and put it into a form he could approve he did so preparing an entire new statement and preserving of the former only the last   paragraphs  half of the preceding one we approved  reported it to congress who accepted it congress gave a signal proof of their indulgence to mr dickinson and of their great desire not to go too fast for any respectable part of our body in permitting him to draw their second petition to the king according to his own ideas  and passing it with scarcely any amendment the disgust against this humility was general and mr dickinsons delight at its passage was the only circumstance which reconciled them to it the vote being passed altho further observn on it was out of order he could not refrain from rising and expressing his satisfaction and concluded by saying there is but one word mr president in the paper which i disapprove  that is the word congress on which ben harrison rose and said there is but one word in the paper mr president of which i approve and that is the word congress on the   d of july dr franklin mr adams r h lee  myself were appointed a commee to consider and report on ld norths conciliatory resolution the answer of the virginia assembly on that subject having been approved i was requested by  0 the commee to prepare this report which will account for the similarity of feature in the two instruments  on the   th of may      the convention of virginia instructed their delegates in congress to propose to that body to declare the colonies independent of g britain and appointed a commee to prepare a declaration of rights and plan of government   in congress friday june        the delegates from virginia moved  in obedience to instructions from their constituents that the congress should declare that these united colonies are  of right ought to be free  independent states that they are absolved from all allegiance to the british crown and that all political connection between them  the state of great britain is  ought to be totally dissolved that measures should be immediately taken for procuring the assistance of foreign powers and a confederation be formed to bind the colonies more closely together     the house being obliged to attend at that time to some other business the proposition was referred to the next day when the members were ordered to attend punctually at ten oclock saturday june   they proceeded to take it into consideration and referred it to a committee of the whole into which they immediately resolved themselves and passed that day  monday the  0th in debating on the subject it was argued by wilson robert r livingston e rutledge dickinson and others that tho they were friends to the measures themselves and saw the impossibility that we should ever again be united with gr britain yet they were against adopting them at this time that the conduct we had formerly observed was wise  proper now of deferring to take any capital step till the voice of the people drove us into it that they were our power  without them our declarations could not be carried into effect that the people of the middle colonies maryland delaware pennsylva the jerseys  n york were    not yet ripe for bidding adieu to british connection but that they were fast ripening  in a short time would join in the general voice of america that the resolution entered into by this house on the   th of may  for suppressing the exercise of all powers derived from the crown had shown by the ferment into which it had thrown these middle colonies that they had not yet accommodated their minds to a separation from the mother country that some of them had expressly forbidden their delegates to consent to such a declaration and others had given no instructions  consequently no powers to give such consent that if the delegates of any particular colony had no power to declare such colony independant certain they were the others could not declare it for them the colonies being as yet perfectly independant of each other that the assembly of pennsylvania was now sitting above stairs their convention would sit within a few days the convention of new york was now sitting  those of the jerseys  delaware counties would meet on the monday following  it was probable these bodies would take up the question of independance  would declare to their delegates the voice of their state    that if such a declaration should now be agreed to these delegates must retire  possibly their colonies might secede from the union that such a secession would weaken us more than could be compensated by any foreign alliance that in the event of such a division foreign powers would either refuse to join themselves to our fortunes or having us so much in their power as that desperate declaration would place us they would insist on terms proportionably more hard and prejudicial that we had little reason to expect an alliance with those to whom alone as yet we had cast our eyes that france  spain had reason to be jealous of that rising power which would one day certainly strip them of all their american possessions that it was more likely they should form a connection with the british court who if they should find themselves unable otherwise to extricate themselves from their difficulties would agree to a partition of our territories restoring canada to france  the floridas to spain to accomplish for themselves a recovery of these colonies that it would not be long before we should receive certain information of the disposition of the french court from the agent whom we had sent to paris for that purpose that if this disposition should be favorable by waiting the event of the present campaign which we all hoped would be successful we should have reason to expect an alliance on better terms that this would in fact work no delay of any effectual aid from such ally as from the advance of    the season  distance of our situation it was impossible we could receive any assistance during this campaign that it was prudent to fix among ourselves the terms on which we should form alliance before we declared we would form one at all events and that if these were agreed on  our declaration of independance ready by the time our ambassador should be prepared to sail it would be as well as to go into that declaration at this day on the other side it was urged by j adams lee wythe and others that no gentleman had argued against the policy or the right of separation from britain nor had supposed it possible we should ever renew our connection that they had only opposed its being now declared that the question was not whether by a declaration of independance we should make ourselves what we are not but whether we should declare a fact which already exists that as to the people or parliament of england we had alwais been independent of them their restraints on our trade deriving efficacy from our acquiescence only  not from any rights they possessed of imposing them  that so far our connection had been federal only  was now dissolved by the commencement of hostilities that as to the king we had been bound to him by allegiance but that this bond was now dissolved by his assent to the late act of parliament by which he declares us out of his protection and by his levying    war on us a fact which had long ago proved us out of his protection it being a certain position in law that allegiance  protection are reciprocal the one ceasing when the other is withdrawn that james the iid never declared the people of england out of his protection yet his actions proved it  the parliament declared it no delegates then can be denied or ever want a power of declaring an existing truth that the delegates from the delaware counties having declared their constituents ready to join there are only two colonies pennsylvania  maryland whose delegates are absolutely tied up and that these had by their instructions only reserved a right of confirming or rejecting the measure that the instructions from pennsylvania might be accounted for from the times in which they were drawn near a twelvemonth ago since which the face of affairs has totally changed that within that time it had become apparent that britain was determined to accept nothing less than a carteblanche and that the kings answer to the lord mayor aldermen  common council of london which had come to hand four days ago must have satisfied every one of this point that the people wait for us to lead the way that they are in favour of the measure tho the instructions given by some of their representatives are not that the voice of the representatives is not always consonant with the voice of the people and that this is remarkably the case in these middle colonies    that the effect of the resolution of the   th of may has proved this which raising the murmurs of some in the colonies of pennsylvania  maryland called forth the opposing voice of the freer part of the people  proved them to be the majority even in these colonies that the backwardness of these two colonies might be ascribed partly to the influence of proprietary power  connections  partly to their having not yet been attacked by the enemy that these causes were not likely to be soon removed as there seemed no probability that the enemy would make either of these the seat of this summers war that it would be vain to wait either weeks or months for perfect unanimity since it was impossible that all men should ever become of one sentiment on any question that the conduct of some colonies from the beginning of this contest had given reason to suspect it was their settled policy to keep in the rear of the confederacy that their particular prospect might be better even in the worst event that therefore it was necessary for those colonies who had thrown themselves forward  hazarded all from the beginning to come forward now also and put all again to their own hazard that the history of the dutch revolution of whom three states only confederated at first proved that a secession of some colonies would not be so dangerous as some apprehended that a declaration of independence alone could    render it consistent with european delicacy for european powers to treat with us or even to receive an ambassador from us that till this they would not receive our vessels into their ports nor acknowledge the adjudications of our courts of admiralty to be legitimate in cases of capture of british vessels that though france  spain may be jealous of our rising power they must think it will be much more formidable with the addition of great britain and will therefore see it their interest to prevent a coalition but should they refuse we shall be but where we are whereas without trying we shall never know whether they will aid us or not that the present campaign may be unsuccessful  therefore we had better propose an alliance while our affairs wear a hopeful aspect that to await the event of this campaign will certainly work delay because during this summer france may assist us effectually by cutting off those supplies of provisions from england  ireland on which the enemys armies here are to depend or by setting in motion the great power they have collected in the west indies  calling our enemy to the defence of the possessions they have there that it would be idle to lose time in settling the terms of alliance till we had first determined we would enter into alliance that it is necessary to lose no time in opening a trade for our people who will want clothes and will want money too for the paiment of taxes and that the only misfortune is that we did not    enter into alliance with france six months sooner as besides opening their ports for the vent of our last years produce they might have marched an army into germany and prevented the petty princes there from selling their unhappy subjects to subdue us it appearing in the course of these debates that the colonies of n york new jersey pennsylvania delaware maryland and south carolina  were not yet matured for falling from the parent stem but that they were fast advancing to that state it was thought most prudent to wait a while for them and to postpone the final decision to july   but that this might occasion as little delay as possible a committee was appointed  to prepare a declaration of independence the commee were j adams dr franklin roger sherman robert r livingston  myself committees were also appointed at the same time to prepare a plan of confederation for the colonies and to state the terms proper to be proposed for foreign alliance the committee for drawing the declaration of independence desired me to do it it was accordingly done and being approved by them i reported it to the house on friday the   th of june when it was read and ordered to lie on the table  on    monday the  st of july the house resolved itself into a commee of the whole  resumed the consideration of the original motion made by the delegates of  0 virginia which being again debated through the day was carried in the affirmative by the votes of n hampshire connecticut massachusetts rhode island n jersey maryland virginia n carolina     georgia s carolina and pennsylvania voted against it delaware having but two members present they were divided  the delegates for new york declared    they were for it themselves  were assured their constituents were for it but that their instructions having been drawn near a twelvemonth before when reconciliation was still the general object they were enjoined by them to do nothing which should impede that object they therefore thought themselves not justifiable in voting on either side and asked leave to withdraw from the question which was given them the commee rose  reported their resolution to the house mr edward rutledge of s carolina then requested the determination might be put off to the next day as he believed his colleagues tho they disapproved of the resolution would then join in it for the sake of unanimity the ultimate question whether the house would agree to the resolution of the committee was accordingly postponed to the next day when it was again moved and s carolina concurred in voting for it in the meantime a third member had come post from the delaware counties  and turned the vote of that colony in favour of the resolution members  of a different sentiment attending that morning from pennsylvania also their vote was changed so that the whole    colonies who were authorized to vote at all gave their voices for it and within a few days  the convention of n york approved of it and thus supplied the void occasioned by the withdrawing of her delegates from the vote congress proceeded the same day  to consider the    declaration of independance which had been reported  lain on the table the friday preceding and on monday referred to a commee of the whole the pusillanimous idea that we had friends in england worth keeping terms with still haunted the minds of many for this reason those passages which conveyed censures on the people of england were struck out lest they should give them offence the clause too reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of africa was struck out in complaisance to south carolina and georgia who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves and who on the contrary still wished to continue it our northern brethren also i believe felt a little tender under those censures for tho their people have very few slaves themselves yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others the debates having taken up the greater parts of the  d  d   th days of july were  in the evening of the last closed the declaration was reported by the commee agreed to by the house and signed by every member present except mr dickinson  as the sentiments of men are known not only by what they receive but what they    reject also i will state the form of the declaration as originally reported the parts struck out by congress shall be distinguished by a black line drawn under them  those inserted by them shall be placed in the margin or in a concurrent column      a declaration by the representatives of the united states of america in general congress assembled when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate  equal station to which the laws of nature and of natures god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with inherent and certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty  the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it  to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles  organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety  happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light  transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are    accustomed but when a long train of abuses  usurpations begun at a distinguished period and pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government  to provide new guards for their future security such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies  such is now the necessity which constrains them to expunge alter their former systems of government the history of the present king of great britain is a history of unremitting repeated injuries  usurpations among which appears no solitary fact to contradict the uniform tenor of the rest but all have all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world for the truth of which we pledge a faith yet unsullied by falsehood he has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome  necessary for the public good he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate  pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained  when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them he has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature a right inestimable to them  formidable to tyrants only he has called together legislative bodies at places unusual uncomfortable and distant from the depository    of their public records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly  continually for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people he has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected whereby the legislative powers incapable of annihilation have returned to the people at large for their exercise the state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without  convulsions within he has endeavored to prevent the population of these states for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither  raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands he has suffered obstructed the administration of justice totally to cease in some of these by states refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers he has made our judges dependant on his will alone for the tenure of their offices  the amount  paiment of their salaries he has erected a multitude of new offices by a self assumed power and sent hither swarms of new officers to harass our people and eat out their substance he has kept among us in times of peace standing armies and ships of war without the consent of our legislatures he has affected to render the military independent of  superior to the civil power    he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitutions  unacknowledged by our laws giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us for protecting them by a mocktrial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world for imposing taxes on us without our consent for depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences for abolishing the free system of english laws in a neighboring province establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these states colonies for taking away our charters abolishing our most valuable laws and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments for suspending our own legislatures  declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever he has abdicated government here withdrawing his governors and declaring us out of his allegiance  protection by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us he has plundered our seas ravaged our coasts burnt our towns  destroyed the lives of our people he is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death desolation  tyranny already begun with circumstances    of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages  totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation he has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country to become the executioners of their friends  brethren or to fall themselves by their hands he has excited domestic insurrection among us  has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes  conditions of existence he has incited treasonable insurrections of our fellowcitizens with the allurements of forfeiture  confiscation of our property he has waged cruel war against human nature itself violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him captivating  carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither this piratical warfare the opprobium of infidel powers is the warfare of the christian king of great britain determined to keep open a market where men should be bought  sold he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce and that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them by murdering the people on whom he also obtruded them thus paying  0 off former crimes committed against the liberties of one people with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives of another in every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injuries a prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people who mean to be free future ages will scarcely believe that the hardiness of one man adventured within the short compass of twelve years only to lay a foundation so broad  so undisguised for tyranny over a people fostered  fixed in principles of freedom nor have we been wanting in attention to our british brethren we have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend a an unwarrantable jurisdiction over these our states us we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration  settlement here no one of which could warrant so strange a pretension that these were effected at the expense of our own blood  treasure unassisted by the wealth or the strength of great britain that in constituting indeed our several forms of government we had adopted one common king thereby laying a foundation for perpetual league  amity with them but that submission to their parliament was no part of our constitution nor ever in idea if history may be credited and we have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity as well as to and we have conjured them by the ties of our common    kindred to disavow these usurpations which were likely to would inevitably interrupt our connection and correspondence they too have been deaf to the voice of justice  of consanguinity and when occasions have been given them by the regular course of their laws of removing from their councils the disturbers of our harmony they have by their free election reestablished them in power at this very time too they are permitting their chief magistrate to send over not only soldiers of our common blood but scotch  foreign mercenaries to invade  destroy us these facts have given the last stab to agonizing affection and manly spirit bids us to renounce forever these unfeeling brethren we must endeavor to forget our former love for them and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind enemies in war in peace friends we might have been a free and a great people together but a communication of grandeur  of freedom it seems is below their dignity be it so since they will have it the road to happiness  to glory is open to us too we will tread it apart from them and we must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denuonces our eternal separation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind enemies in war in peace friends we therefore the representatives of the united states of america in general congress assembled do in the name  by authority of the good people of these states reject     renounce all allegiance  subjection to the kings of great britain  all others who may hereafter claim by through or under them we utterly dissolve all political connection which may heretofore have subsisted between us  the people or parliament of great britain  finally we do assert  declare these colonies to be free  independent states  that as free  independent states they have full power to levy war conclude peace contract alliances establish commerce  to do all other acts  things which independent states may of right do and for the support of this declaration we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes  our sacred honor we therefore the representatives of the united states of america in general congress assembled appealing to the supreme judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions    do in the name  by the authority of the good people of these colonies solemnly publish  declare that these united colonies are  of right ought to be free  independent states that they are absolved from all allegiance to the british crown and that all political connection between them  the state of great britain is  ought to be totally dissolved  that as free  independent states they have full power to levy war conclude peace contract alliances establish commerce  to do all other acts  things which independant states may of right do and for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes  our sacred honor     the declaration thus signed on the  th on paper was engrossed on parchment  signed again on the  d of august  on friday july    the committee appointed to draw the articles of confederation reported them and on the   d the house resolved themselves into a committee to take them into consideration on the  0th    st of that month   st of the ensuing those articles were debated which determined the proportion or quota of money which each state should furnish to the common treasury and the manner of voting in congress the first of these articles was expressed in the original draught in these words  art xi all charges of war  all    other expenses that shall be incurred for the common defence or general welfare and allowed by the united states assembled shall be defrayed out of a common treasury which shall be supplied by the several colonies in proportion to the number of inhabitants of every age sex  quality except indians not paying taxes in each colony a true account of which distinguishing the white inhabitants shall be triennially taken  transmitted to the assembly of the united states mr samuel chase moved that the quotas should be fixed not by the number of inhabitants of every condition but by that of the white inhabitants he admitted that taxation should be alwais in proportion to property that this was in theory the true rule but that from a variety of difficulties it was a rule which could never be adopted in practice the value of the property in every state could never be estimated justly  equally some other measure for the wealth of the state must therefore be devised some standard referred to which would be more simple he considered the number of inhabitants as a tolerably good criterion of property and that this might alwais be obtained he therefore thought it the best mode which we could adopt with one exception only he observed that negroes are property    and as such cannot be distinguished from the lands or personalities held in those states where there are few slaves that the surplus of profit which a northern farmer is able to lay by he invests in cattle horses c whereas a southern farmer lays out that same surplus in slaves there is no more reason therefore for taxing the southern states on the farmers head  on his slaves head than the northern ones on their farmers heads  the heads of their cattle that the method proposed would therefore tax the southern states according to their numbers  their wealth conjunctly while the northern would be taxed on numbers only that negroes in fact should not be considered as members of the state more than cattle  that they have no more interest in it mr john adams observed that the numbers of people were taken by this article as an index of the wealth of the state  not as subjects of taxation that as to this matter it was of no consequence by what name you called your people whether by that of freemen or of slaves that in some countries the labouring poor were called freemen in others they were called slaves but that the difference as to the state was imaginary only what matters it whether a landlord employing ten labourers in his farm gives them annually as much money as will buy them the necessaries of life or gives them those necessaries at short hand the ten labourers add as much wealth annually to the state increase its exports as much in the one case as the other certainly  00 freemen produce no more profits no greater surplus for the    paiment of taxes than  00 slaves therefore the state in which are the labourers called freemen should be taxed no more than that in which are those called slaves suppose by any extraordinary operation of nature or of law one half the labourers of a state could in the course of one night be transformed into slaves would the state be made the poorer or the less able to pay taxes that the condition of the laboring poor in most countries that of the fishermen particularly of the northern states is as abject as that of slaves it is the number of labourers which produce the surplus for taxation and numbers therefore indiscriminately are the fair index of wealth that it is the use of the word property here  its application to some of the people of the state which produces the fallacy how does the southern farmer procure slaves either by importation or by purchase from his neighbor if he imports a slave he adds one to the number of labourers in his country and proportionably to its profits  abilities to pay taxes if he buys from his neighbor it is only a transfer of a labourer from one farm to another which does not change the annual produce of the state  therefore should not change its tax that if a northern farmer works ten labourers on his farm he can it is true invest the surplus of ten mens labour in cattle but so may the southern farmer working ten slaves that a state of one hundred thousand freemen can maintain no more cattle than one of one hundred thousand slaves therefore they have no more of that kind of property that a slave may indeed from the custom of    speech be more properly called the wealth of his master than the free labourer might be called the wealth of his employer but as to the state both were equally its wealth and should therefore equally add to the quota of its tax mr benjamin harrison proposed as a compromise that two slaves should be counted as one freeman he affirmed that slaves did not do so much work as freemen and doubted if two effected more than one that this was proved by the price of labor the hire of a labourer in the southern colonies being from   to £   while in the northern it was generally £   mr james wilson said that if this amendment should take place the southern colonies would have all the benefit of slaves whilst the northern ones would bear the burthen that slaves increase the profits of a state which the southern states mean to take to themselves that they also increase the burthen of defence which would of course fall so much the heavier on the northern that slaves occupy the places of freemen and eat their food dismiss your slaves  freemen will take their places it is our duty to lay every discouragement on the importation of slaves but this amendment would give the jus trium liberorum to him who would import slaves that other kinds of property were pretty equally distributed thro all the colonies there were as many cattle horses  sheep in the north as the south  south as the north but not so as to slaves that experience has shown that those colonies have been alwais able to pay most which have the most inhabitants whether they be    black or white and the practice of the southern colonies has alwais been to make every farmer pay poll taxes upon all his labourers whether they be black or white he acknowledges indeed that freemen work the most but they consume the most also they do not produce a greater surplus for taxation the slave is neither fed nor clothed so expensively as a freeman again white women are exempted from labor generally but negro women are not in this then the southern states have an advantage as the article now stands it has sometimes been said that slavery is necessary because the commodities they raise would be too dear for market if cultivated by freemen but now it is said that the labor of the slave is the dearest mr payne  urged the original resolution of congress to proportion the quotas of the states to the number of souls dr john witherspoon was of opinion that the value of lands  houses was the best estimate of the wealth of a nation and that it was practicable to obtain such a valuation this is the true barometer of wealth the one now proposed is imperfect in itself and unequal between the states it has been objected that negroes eat the food of freemen  therefore should be taxed horses also eat the food of freemen therefore they also should be taxed it has been said too that in carrying slaves into the estimate of the taxes the state is to pay we do no more than those states themselves do who alwais take slaves into the estimate of the taxes the individual is to pay but    the cases are not parallel in the southern colonies slaves pervade the whole colony but they do not pervade the whole continent that as to the original resolution of congress to proportion the quotas according to the souls it was temporary only  related to the monies heretofore emitted whereas we are now entering into a new compact and therefore stand on original ground aug   the question being put the amendment proposed was rejected by the votes of n hampshire massachusetts rhode island connecticut n york n jersey  pennsylvania against those of delaware maryland virginia north  south carolina georgia was divided the other article was in these words art xvii in determining questions each colony shall have one vote july  0    aug   present    members mr chase observed that this article was the most likely to divide us of any one proposed in the draught then under consideration that the larger colonies had threatened they would not confederate at all if their weight in congress should not be equal to the numbers of people they added to the confederacy while the smaller ones declared against a union if they did not retain an equal vote for the protection of their rights that it was of the utmost consequence to bring the parties together as should we sever from each other either no foreign power will ally with us at all or the different states will form different alliances and thus increase the horrors of those scenes of civil war and bloodshed which in such a state of  0 separation  independance would render us a miserable people that our importance our interests our peace required that we should confederate and that mutual sacrifices should be made to effect a compromise of this difficult question he was of opinion the smaller colonies would lose their rights if they were not in some instances allowed an equal vote and therefore that a discrimination should take place among the questions which would come before congress  that the smaller states should be secured in all questions concerning life or liberty  the greater ones in all respecting property he therefore proposed that in votes relating to money the voice of each colony should be proportioned to the number of its inhabitants dr franklin  thought that the votes should be so proportioned in all cases he took notice that the delaware counties had bound up their delegates to disagree to this article he thought it a very extraordinary language to be held by any state that they would not confederate with us unless we would let them dispose of our money certainly if we vote equally we ought to pay equally but the smaller states will hardly purchase the privilege at this price that had he lived in a state where the representation originally equal had become unequal by time  accident he might have submitted rather than disturb government but that we should be very wrong to set out in this practice when it is in our power to establish what is right that at the time of the    union between england and scotland the latter had made the objection which the smaller states now do but experience had proved that no unfairness had ever been shown them that their advocates had prognosticated that it would again happen as in times of old that the whale would swallow jonas but he thought the prediction reversed in event and that jonas had swallowed the whale for the scotch had in fact got possession of the government and gave laws to the english he reprobated the original agreement of congress to vote by colonies and therefore was for their voting in all cases according to the number of taxables  dr witherspoon opposed every alteration of the article all men admit that a confederacy is necessary should the idea get abroad that there is likely to be no union among us it will damp the minds of the people diminish the glory of our struggle  lessen its importance because it will open to our view future prospects of war  dissension among ourselves if an equal vote be refused the smaller states will become vassals to the larger  all experience has shown that the vassals  subjects of free states are the most enslaved he instanced the helots of sparta  the provinces of rome he observed that foreign powers discovering this blemish would make it a handle for disengaging the smaller states from so unequal a confederacy that the colonies should in fact be considered as individuals and that as such in all disputes they should have an    equal vote that they are now collected as individuals making a bargain with each other  of course had a right to vote as individuals that in the east india company they voted by persons  not by their proportion of stock that the belgic confederacy voted by provinces that in questions of war the smaller states were as much interested as the larger  therefore should vote equally and indeed that the larger states were more likely to bring war on the confederacy in proportion as their frontier was more extensive he admitted that equality of representation was an excellent principle but then it must be of things which are coordinate that is of things similar  of the same nature that nothing relating to individuals could ever come before congress nothing but what would respect colonies he distinguished between an incorporating  a federal union the union of england was an incorporating one yet scotland had suffered by that union for that its inhabitants were drawn from it by the hopes of places  employments nor was it an instance of equality of representation because while scotland was allowed nearly a thirteenth of representation they were to pay only one fortieth of the land tax he expressed his hopes that in the present enlightened state of mens minds we might expect a lasting confederacy if it was founded on fair principles john adams advocated the voting in proportion to numbers he said that we stand here as the representatives of the people that in some states the people are many in others they are few that    therefore their vote here should be proportioned to the numbers from whom it comes reason justice  equity never had weight enough on the face of the earth to govern the councils of men it is interest alone which does it and it is interest alone which can be trusted that therefore the interests within doors should be the mathematical representatives of the interests without doors that the individuality of the colonies is a mere sound does the individuality of a colony increase its wealth or numbers if it does pay equally if it does not add weight in the scale of the confederacy it cannot add to their rights nor weigh in argument a has £ 0 b £ 00 c £ 000 in partnership is it just they should equally dispose of the monies of the partnership it has been said we are independent individuals making a bargain together the question is not what we are now but what we ought to be when our bargain shall be made the confederacy is to make us one individual only it is to form us like separate parcels of metal into one common mass we shall no longer retain our separate individuality but become a single individual as to all questions submitted to the confederacy therefore all those reasons which prove the justice  expediency of equal representation in other assemblies hold good here it has been objected that a proportional vote will endanger the smaller states we answer that an equal vote will endanger the larger virginia pennsylvania  massachusetts are the three greater colonies consider their distance their difference of produce of interests  of manners  it is apparent they can    never have an interest or inclination to combine for the oppression of the smaller that the smaller will naturally divide on all questions with the larger rhode isld from its relation similarity  intercourse will generally pursue the same objects with massachusetts jersey delaware  maryland with pennsylvania dr benjamin rush took notice that the decay of the liberties of the dutch republic proceeded from three causes   the perfect unanimity requisite on all occasions   their obligation to consult their constituents   their voting by provinces this last destroyed the equality of representation and the liberties of great britain also are sinking from the same defect that a part of our rights is deposited in the hands of our legislatures there it was admitted there should be an equality of representation another part of our rights is deposited in the hands of congress why is it not equally necessary there should be an equal representation there were it possible to collect the whole body of the people together they would determine the questions submitted to them by their majority why should not the same majority decide when voting here by their representatives the larger colonies are so providentially divided in situation as to render every fear of their combining visionary their interests are different  their circumstances dissimilar it is more probable they will become rivals  leave it in the power of the smaller states to give preponderance to any scale they please the voting by the number of free inhabitants will have one excellent effect that    of inducing the colonies to discourage slavery  to encourage the increase of their free inhabitants mr stephen hopkins observed there were   larger   smaller    middlesized colonies that the   largest would contain more than half the inhabitants of the confederated states  therefore would govern the others as they should please that history affords no instance of such a thing as equal representation the germanic body votes by states the helvetic body does the same  so does the belgic confederacy that too little is known of the ancient confederations to say what was their practice mr wilson thought that taxation should be in proportion to wealth but that representation should accord with the number of freemen that government is a collection or result of the wills of all that if any government could speak the will of all it would be perfect and that so far as it departs from this it becomes imperfect it has been said that congress is a representation of states not of individuals i say that the objects of its care are all the individuals of the states it is strange that annexing the name of state to ten thousand men should give them an equal right with forty thousand this must be the effect of magic not of reason as to those matters which are referred to congress we are not so many states we are one large state we lay aside our individuality whenever we come here the germanic body is a burlesque on government and their practice on any point is a sufficient authority  proof that it is wrong the greatest    imperfection in the constitution of the belgic confederacy is their voting by provinces the interest of the whole is constantly sacrificed to that of the small states the history of the war in the reign of q anne sufficiently proves this it is asked shall nine colonies put it into the power of four to govern them as they please i invert the question and ask shall two millions of people put it in the power of one million to govern them as they please it is pretended too that the smaller colonies will be in danger from the greater speak in honest language  say the minority will be in danger from the majority and is there an assembly on earth where this danger may not be equally pretended the truth is that our proceedings will then be consentaneous with the interests of the majority and so they ought to be the probability is much greater that the larger states will disagree than that they will combine i defy the wit of man to invent a possible case or to suggest any one thing on earth which shall be for the interests of virginia pennsylvania  massachusetts and which will not also be for the interest of the other states  these articles reported july       were debated    from day to day  time to time for two years were ratified july      by  0 states by n jersey on the   th of nov of the same year and by delaware on the   d of feb following maryland alone held off   years more acceding to them mar      and thus closing the obligation our delegation had been renewed for the ensuing year commencing aug    but the new government was now organized a meeting of the legislature was to be held in oct and i had been elected a member by my county i knew that our legislation under the regal government had many very vicious points which urgently required reformation and i thought i could be of more use in forwarding that work i therefore retired from my seat in congress on the  d of sep resigned it and took my place in the legislature of my state on the  th of october on the   th  i moved for leave to bring in a bill for the establishment of courts of justice the organization of which was of importance i drew the bill it was approved by the commee reported and passed after going thro its due course     on the   th i obtained leave to bring in a bill declaring tenants in tail to hold their lands in fee simple  in the earlier times of the colony when lands were to be obtained for little or nothing some provident individuals procured large grants and desirous of founding great families for themselves settled them on their descendants in feetail the transmission of this property from generation to generation in the same name raised up a distinct set of families who being privileged by law in the perpetuation of their wealth were thus formed into a patrician order distinguished by the splendor and luxury of their establishments from this order too the king habitually selected his counsellors of state the hope of which distinction devoted the whole corps to the interests  will of the crown to annul this privilege and instead of an aristocracy of wealth of more harm and danger than benefit to society to make an opening for the aristocracy of virtue and talent which nature has wisely provided for the direction of the interests of society  scattered with equal hand through all its conditions was deemed essential to a well ordered republic to effect it no violence was necessary no deprivation of natural right but rather an enlargement of it by a repeal of the law for this would authorize the present holder to divide the property among his    children equally as his affections were divided and would place them by natural generation on the level of their fellow citizens but this repeal was strongly opposed by mr pendleton who was zealously attached to ancient establishments and who taken all in all was the ablest man in debate i have ever met with he had not indeed the poetical fancy of mr henry his sublime imagination his lofty and overwhelming diction but he was cool smooth and persuasive his language flowing chaste  embellished his conceptions quick acute and full of resource never vanquished for if he lost the main battle he returned upon you and regained so much of it as to make it a drawn one by dexterous manœuvres skirmishes in detail and the recovery of small advantages which little singly were important altogether you never knew when you were clear of him but were harassed by his perseverance until the patience was worn down of all who had less of it than himself add to this that he was one of the most virtuous  benevolent of men the kindest friend the most amiable  pleasant of companions which ensured a favorable reception to whatever came from him finding that the general principles of entails could not be maintained he took his stand on an amendment which he proposed instead of an absolute abolition to permit the tenant in tail to convey in fee simple if he chose it and he was within a few votes of saving so much of the old law but the bill passed finally for entire abolition in that one of the bills for organizing our judiciary system which proposed a court of chancery i had  0 provided for a trial by jury of all matters of fact in that as well as in the courts of law he defeated it by the introduction of   words only if either party chuse  the consequence has been that as no suitor will say to his judge sir i distrust you give me a jury juries are rarely i might say perhaps never seen in that court but when called for by the chancellor of his own accord the first establishment in virginia which became permanent was made in   0  i have found no mention of negroes in the colony until about    0 the first brought here as slaves were by a dutch ship after which the english commenced the trade and continued it until the revolutionary war that suspended ipso facto their further importation for the present and the business of the war pressing constantly on the legislature this subject was not acted on finally until the year    when i brought in a bill to prevent their further importation  this    passed without opposition and stopped the increase of the evil by importation leaving to future efforts its final eradication the first settlers of this colony were englishmen loyal subjects to their king and church and the grant to sr walter raleigh contained an express proviso that their laws should not be against the true christian faith now professed in the church of england as soon as the state of the colony admitted it was divided into parishes in each of which was established a minister of the anglican church endowed with a fixed salary in tobacco a glebe house and land with the other necessary appendages to meet these expenses all the inhabitants of the parishes were assessed whether they were or not members of the established church towards quakers who came here they were most cruelly intolerant driving them from the colony by the severest penalties in process of time however other sectarisms were introduced chiefly of the presbyterian family and the established clergy secure for life in their glebes and salaries adding to these generally the emoluments of a classical school found employment    enough in their farms and schoolrooms for the rest of the week and devoted sunday only to the edification of their flock by service and a sermon at their parish church their other pastoral functions were little attended to against this inactivity the zeal and industry of sectarian preachers had an open and undisputed field and by the time of the revolution a majority of the inhabitants had become dissenters from the established church but were still obliged to pay contributions to support the pastors of the minority this unrighteous compulsion to maintain teachers of what they deemed religious errors was grievously felt during the regal government and without a hope of relief but the first republican legislature which met in    was crowded with petitions to abolish this spiritual tyranny these brought on the severest contests in which i have ever been engaged our great opponents were mr pendelton  robert carter nicholas honest men but zealous churchmen the petitions were referred to the commee of the whole house on the state of the country and after desperate contests in that committee almost daily from the   th of octob  to the  th of december we prevailed so far only as to repeal the laws which rendered criminal the maintenance of any religious opinions the forbearance of repairing to church or the exercise of any mode of worship and    further to exempt dissenters from contributions to the support of the established church and to suspend only until the next session levies on the members of that church for the salaries of their own incumbents for although the majority of our citizens were dissenters as has been observed a majority of the legislature were churchmen among these however were some reasonable and liberal men who enabled us on some points to obtain feeble majorities but our opponents carried in the general resolutions of the commee of nov    a declaration that religious assemblies ought to be regulated and that provision ought to be made for continuing the succession of the clergy and superintending their conduct and in the bill now passed  was inserted an express reservation of the question whether a general assessment should not be established by law on every one to the support of the pastor of his choice or whether all should be left to voluntary contributions and on this question debated at every session from    to    some of our dissenting allies having now secured their particular object going over to the advocates of a general assessment we could only obtain a suspension from session to session until    when the question against a general assessment was finally carried and the establishment of the anglican    church entirely put down in justice to the two honest but zealous opponents who have been named i must add that altho from their natural temperaments they were more disposed generally to acquiesce in things as they are then to risk innovations yet whenever the public will had once decided none were more faithful or exact in their obedience to it the seat of our government had been originally fixed in the peninsula of jamestown the first settlement of the colonists and had been afterwards removed a few miles inland to williamsburg but this was at a time when our settlements had not extended beyond the tide water now they had crossed the alleghany and the center of population was very far removed from what it had been yet williamsburg was still the depository of our archives the habitual residence of the governor  many other of the public functionaries the established place for the sessions of the legislature and the magazine of our military stores and its situation was so exposed that it might be taken at any time in war and at this time particularly an enemy might in the night run up either of the rivers between which it lies land a force above and take possession of the place without the possibility of saving either persons or things i had proposed its removal so early as octob     but it did not prevail until the session of may    early in the session of may    i prepared and obtained leave to bring in a bill declaring who should    be deemed citizens asserting the natural right of expatriation and prescribing the mode of exercising it this when i withdrew from the house on the  st of june following i left in the hands of george mason and it was passed on the   th of that month  in giving this account of the laws of which i was myself the mover  draughtsman i by no means mean to claim to myself the merit of obtaining their passage i had many occasional and strenuous coadjutors in debate and one most steadfast able and zealous who was himself a host this was george mason a man of the first order of wisdom among those who acted on the theatre of the revolution of expansive mind profound judgment cogent in argument learned in the lore of our former constitution and earnest for the republican change on democratic principles his elocution was neither flowing nor smooth but his language was strong his manner most impressive and strengthened by a dash of biting cynicism when provocation made it seasonable mr wythe while speaker in the two sessions of      between his return from congress and his appointment to the chancery was an able and constant associate in whatever was before a committee of the whole his pure integrity judgment and reasoning powers gave him great weight of him see more in some notes inclosed in my letter of august         to mr john saunderson mr madison came into the house in      a new member and young which circumstances concurring    with his extreme modesty prevented his venturing himself in debate before his removal to the council of state in nov    from thence he went to congress then consisting of few members trained in these successive schools he acquired a habit of selfpossession which placed at ready command the rich resources of his luminous and discriminating mind  of his extensive information and rendered him the first of every assembly afterwards of which he became a member never wandering from his subject into vain declamation but pursuing it closely in language pure classical and copious soothing always the feelings of his adversaries by civilities and softness of expression he rose to the eminent station which he held in the great national convention of      and in that of virginia which followed he sustained the new constitution in all its parts bearing off the palm against the logic of george mason and the fervid declamation of mr henry with these consummate powers were united a pure and spotless virtue which no calumny has ever attempted to sully of the powers and polish of his pen and of the wisdom of his administration in the highest office of the nation i need say nothing they have spoken and will forever speak for themselves so far we were proceeding in the details of reformation only selecting points of legislation prominent in character  principle urgent and indicative of the strength of the general pulse of reformation when i left congress in    it was in the persuasion that our whole code must be reviewed adapted to our republican form of government and now that we    had no negatives of councils governors  kings to restrain us from doing right that it should be corrected in all its parts with a single eye to reason  the good of those for whose government it was framed early therefore  in the session of    to which i returned i moved and presented a bill for the revision of the laws which was passed on the   th of october and on the  th of november mr pendleton mr wythe george mason thomas l lee and myself were appointed a committee to execute the work we agreed to meet at fredericksburg to settle the plan of operation and to distribute the work we met there accordingly on the   th of january      the first question was whether we should propose to abolish the whole existing system of laws and prepare a new and complete institute or preserve the general system and only modify it to the present state of things mr pendleton contrary to his usual disposition in favor of antient things was for the former proposition in which he was joined by mr lee to this it was objected that to abrogate our whole system would be a bold measure and probably far beyond the views of the legislature that they had been in the practice of revising from time to time the laws of the colony omitting the expired the repealed and the obsolete amending only those retained and probably meant we should now do the same only including the british statutes as well as our own that to compose a new institute like those of justinian and bracton or that of blackstone which was the model proposed by mr pendleton would be an arduous    undertaking of vast research of great consideration  judgment and when reduced to a text every word of that text from the imperfection of human language and its incompetence to express distinctly every shade of idea would become a subject of question  chicanery until settled by repeated adjudications that this would involve us for ages in litigation and render property uncertain until like the statutes of old every word had been tried and settled by numerous decisions and by new volumes of reports  commentaries and that no one of us probably would undertake such a work which to be systematical must be the work of one hand this last was the opinion of mr wythe mr mason  myself when we proceeded to the distribution of the work mr mason excused himself as being no lawyer he felt himself unqualified for the work and he resigned soon after mr lee excused himself on the same ground and died indeed in a short time the other two gentlemen therefore and myself divided the work among us the common law and statutes to the   james i when our separate legislature was established were assigned to me the british statutes from that period to the present day to mr wythe and the virginia laws to mr pendleton as the law of descents  the criminal law fell of course within my portion i wished the commee to settle the leading principles of these as a guide for me in framing them and with respect to the first i proposed to abolish the law of primogeniture and to make real estate descendible in parcenary to the next of kin as personal property is by the statute of distribution    mr pendleton wished to preserve the right of primogeniture but seeing at once that that could not prevail he proposed we should adopt the hebrew principle and give a double portion to the elder son i observed that if the eldest son could eat twice as much or do double work it might be a natural evidence of his right to a double portion but being on a par in his powers  wants with his brothers and sisters he should be on a par also in the partition of the patrimony and such was the decision of the other members on the subject of the criminal law all were agreed that the punishment of death should be abolished except for treason and murder and that for other felonies should be substituted hard labor in the public works and in some cases the lex talionis how this last revolting principle came to obtain our approbation i do not remember there remained indeed in our laws a vestige of it in a single case of a slave it was the english law in the time of the anglosaxons copied probably from the hebrew law of an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth and it was the law of several antient people but the modern mind had left it far in the rear of its advances these points however being settled we repaired to our respective homes for the preparation of the work feb   in the execution of my part i thought it material not to vary the diction of the antient statutes by modernizing it nor to give rise to new questions by new expressions the text of these statutes had been so fully explained and defined by numerous  0 adjudications as scarcely ever now to produce a question in our courts i thought it would be useful also in all new draughts to reform the style of the later british statutes and of our own acts of assembly which from their verbosity their endless tautologies their involutions of case within case and parenthesis within parenthesis and their multiplied efforts at certainty by saids and aforesaids by ors and by ands to make them more plain do really render them more perplexed and incomprehensible not only to common readers but to the lawyers themselves we were employed in this work from that time to feb      when we met at williamsburg that is to say mr pendleton mr wythe  myself and meeting day by day we examined critically our several parts sentence by sentence scrutinizing and amending until we had agreed on the whole we then returned home had fair copies made of our several parts which were reported to the general assembly june         by mr wythe and myself mr pendletons residence being distant and he having authorized us by letter to declare his approbation we had in this work brought so much of the common law as it was thought necessary to alter all the british statutes from magna charta to the present day and all the laws of virginia from the establishment of our legislature in the  th jac   to the present time which we thought should be retained within the compass of     bills making a printed folio of  0 pages only some bills were taken out occasionally from time to time and passed but the main body of the work was not entered on by the legislature until    after the general peace in      when by the unwearied exertions of mr madison in opposition to the endless quibbles chicaneries perversions vexations and delays of lawyers and demilawyers most of the bills were passed by the legislature with little alteration  the bill for establishing religious freedom  the principles of which had to a certain degree been enacted before i had drawn in all the latitude of reason  right it still met with opposition but with some mutilations in the preamble it was finally passed and a singular proposition proved that its protection of opinion was meant to be universal where the preamble declares that coercion is a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion an amendment was proposed by inserting the word jesus christ so that it should read a departure from the plan of jesus christ the holy author of our religion the insertion was rejected by a great majority in proof that they meant to comprehend within the mantle of its protection the jew and the gentile the christian and mahometan the hindoo and infidel of every denomination beccaria and other writers on crimes and punishments had satisfied the reasonable world of the unrightfulness and inefficacy of the punishment of crimes by death and hard labor on roads canals and other public works had been suggested as a proper substitute the revisors had adopted these    opinions but the general idea of our country had not yet advanced to that point the bill therefore for proportioning crimes and punishments was lost in the house of delegates by a majority of a single vote  i learnt afterwards that the substitute of hard labor in public was tried i believe it was in pennsylvania without success exhibited as a public spectacle with shaved heads and mean clothing working on the high roads produced in the criminals such a prostration of character such an abandonment of selfrespect as instead of reforming plunged them into the most desperate  hardened depravity of morals and character—to pursue the subject of this law—i was written to in      being then in paris by directors appointed to superintend the building of a capitol in richmond to advise them as to a plan and to add to it one of a prison thinking it a favorable opportunity of introducing into the state an example of architecture in the classic style of antiquity and the maison quarrée of nismes an antient roman temple being considered as the    most perfect model existing of what may be called cubic architecture i applied to m clerissault who had published drawings of the antiquities of nismes to have me a model of the building made in stucco only changing the order from corinthian to ionic on account of the difficulty of the corinthian capitals i yielded with reluctance to the taste of clerissault in his preference of the modern capital of scamozzi to the more noble capital of antiquity this was executed by the artist whom choiseul gouffier had carried with him to constantinople and employed while ambassador there in making those beautiful models of the remains of grecian architecture which are to be seen at paris to adapt the exterior to our use i drew a plan for the interior with the apartments necessary for legislative executive  judiciary purposes and accommodated in their size and distribution to the form and dimensions of the building these were forwarded to the directors in      and were carried into execution with some variations not for the better the most important of which however admit of future correction with respect to the plan of a prison requested at the same time i had heard of a benevolent society in england which had been indulged by the government in an experiment of the effect of labor in solitary confinement on some of their criminals which experiment had succeeded beyond expectation the same idea had been suggested in france and an architect of lyons had proposed a plan of a well contrived edifice on the principle of solitary confinement i procured a copy and as it was too large    for our purposes i drew one on a scale less extensive but susceptible of additions as they should be wanting this i sent to the directors instead of a plan of a common prison in the hope that it would suggest the idea of labor in solitary confinement instead of that on the public works which we had adopted in our revised code its principle accordingly but not its exact form was adopted by latrobe in carrying the plan into execution by the erection of what is now called the penitentiary built under his direction in the meanwhile the public opinion was ripening by time by reflection and by the example of pensylva where labor on the highways had been tried without approbation from      to     had been followed by their penitentiary system on the principle of confinement and labor which was proceeding auspiciously in      our legislature resumed the subject and passed the law for amending the penal laws of the commonwealth they adopted solitary instead of public labor established a gradation in the duration of the confinement approximated the style of the law more to the modern usage and instead of the settled distinctions of murder  manslaughter preserved in my bill they introduced the new terms of murder in the  st   d degree whether these have produced more or fewer questions of definition i am not sufficiently informed of our judiciary transactions to say i will here however insert the text of my bill with the notes i made in the course of my researches into the subject     feb   the acts of assembly concerning the college of wm  mary were properly within mr pendletons portion of our work but these related chiefly to its revenue while its constitution organization and scope of science were derived from its charter we thought that on this subject a systematical plan of general education should be proposed and i was requested to undertake it i accordingly prepared three bills for the revisal proposing three distinct grades of education reaching all classes    elementary schools for all children generally rich and poor   colleges for a middle degree of instruction calculated for the common purposes of life and such as would be desirable for all who were in easy circumstances and  d an ultimate grade for teaching the sciences generally  in their highest degree the first bill proposed to lay off every county into hundreds or wards of a proper size and population for a school in which reading writing and common arithmetic should be taught and that the whole state should be divided into    districts in each of which should be a school for classical learning grammar geography and the higher branches of numerical arithmetic the second bill proposed to amend the constitution of wm  mary college to enlarge its sphere of science and to make it in fact an university the third was for the establishment of a library these bills were not acted on until the same year    and then only so much of the first as provided for elementary schools the college of wm  mary was an establishment    purely of the church of england the visitors were required to be all of that church the professors to subscribe its    articles its students to learn its catechism and one of its fundamental objects was declared to be to raise up ministers for that church the religious jealousies therefore of all the dissenters took alarm lest this might give an ascendancy to the anglican sect and refused acting on that bill its local eccentricity too and unhealthy autumnal climate lessened the general inclination towards it and in the elementary bill they inserted a provision which completely defeated it for they left it to the court of each county to determine for itself when this act should be carried into execution within their county one provision of the bill was that the expenses of these schools should be borne by the inhabitants of the county every one in proportion to his general taxrate this would throw on wealth the education of the poor and the justices being generally of the more wealthy class were unwilling to incur that burthen and i believe it was not suffered to commence in a single county i shall recur again to this subject towards the close of my story if i should have life and resolution enough to reach that term for i am already tired of talking about myself the bill on the subject of slaves was a mere digest of the existing laws respecting them without any intimation of a plan for a future  general emancipation it was thought better that this should be kept back and attempted only by way of amendment whenever the bill should be brought on  the principles    of the amendment however were agreed on that is to say the freedom of all born after a certain day and deportation at a proper age but it was found that the public mind would not yet bear the proposition nor will it bear it even at this day yet the day is not distant when it must bear and adopt it or worse will follow nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be free nor is it less certain that the two races equally free cannot live in the same government nature habit opinion has drawn indelible lines of distinction between them it is still in our power to direct the process of emancipation and deportation peaceably and in such slow degree as that the evil will wear off insensibly and their place be pari passu filled up by free white laborers if on the contrary it is left to force itself on human nature must shudder at the prospect held up we should in vain look for an example in the spanish deportation or deletion of the moors this precedent would fall far short of our case i considered   of these bills passed or reported as forming a system by which every fibre would be eradicated of antient or future aristocracy and a foundation laid for a government truly republican the repeal of the laws of entail would prevent the accumulation and perpetuation of wealth in select families and preserve the soil of the country from being daily more  more absorbed in mortmain the abolition of primogeniture and equal partition of inheritances removed the feudal and unnatural distinctions which made one member of every family    rich and all the rest poor substituting equal partition the best of all agrarian laws the restoration of the rights of conscience relieved the people from taxation for the support of a religion not theirs for the establishment was truly of the religion of the rich the dissenting sects being entirely composed of the less wealthy people and these by the bill for a general education would be qualified to understand their rights to maintain them and to exercise with intelligence their parts in selfgovernment and all this would be effected without the violation of a single natural right of any one individual citizen to these too might be added as a further security the introduction of the trial by jury into the chancery courts which have already ingulfed and continue to ingulf so great a proportion of the jurisdiction over our property on the  st of june      i was appointed governor of the commonwealth and retired from the legislature being elected also one of the visitors of wm  mary college a selfelecting body i effected during my residence in williamsburg that year a change in the organization of that institution by abolishing the grammar school and the two professorships of divinity  oriental languages and substituting a professorship of law  police one of anatomy medicine and chemistry and one of modern languages and the charter confining us to six professorships  we added the law of nature  nations  the fine arts to the duties of the moral professor and natural history to those of the professor of mathematics and natural philosophy    being now as it were identified with the commonwealth itself to write my own history during the two years of my administration would be to write the public history of that portion of the revolution within this state this has been done by others and particularly by mr girardin who wrote his continuation of burkes history of virginia while at milton in this neighborhood had free access to all my papers while composing it and has given as faithful an account as i could myself for this portion therefore of my own life i refer altogether to his history from a belief that under the pressure of the invasion under which we were then laboring the public would have more confidence in a military chief and that the military commander being invested with the civil power also both might be wielded with more energy promptitude and effect for the defence of the state i resigned the administration at the end of my  d year and general nelson was appointed to succeed me soon after my leaving congress in sep    to wit on the last day of that month  i had been appointed with dr franklin to go to france as a commissioner to negotiate treaties of alliance and commerce with that government silas deane then in france acting as agent  for procuring military stores was  0 joined with us in commission but such was the state of my family that i could not leave it nor could i expose it to the dangers of the sea and of capture by the british ships then covering the ocean i saw too that the laboring oar was really at home where much was to be done of the most permanent interest in new modelling our governments and much to defend our fanes and firesides from the desolations of an invading enemy pressing on our country in every point i declined therefore and dr lee was appointed in my place on the   th of june       i had been appointed with mr adams dr franklin mr jay and mr laurens a minister plenipotentiary for negotiating peace then expected to be effected thro the mediation of the empress of russia the same reasons obliged me still to decline and the negotiation was in fact never entered on but in the autumn of the next year      congress receiving assurances that a general peace would be concluded in the winter and spring they renewed my appointment on the   th of nov of that year i had two months before that lost the cherished companion of my life in whose affections unabated on both sides i had lived the last ten years in unchequered happiness with the public interests the state of my mind concurred in recommending the change of scene proposed and i accepted the appointment and left monticello on the   th of dec      for philadelphia where i arrived on the   th the minister of france luzerne offered me a passage in the romulus frigate    which i accepting but she was then lying a few miles below baltimore blocked up in the ice i remained therefore a month in philadelphia looking over the papers in the office of state in order to possess myself of the general state of our foreign relations and then went to baltimore to await the liberation of the frigate from the ice after waiting there nearly a month we received information that a provisional treaty of peace had been signed by our commissioners on the  d of sep      to become absolute on the conclusion of peace between france and great britain considering my proceeding to europe as now of no utility to the public i returned immediately to philadelphia to take the orders of congress and was excused by them from further proceeding i therefore returned home where i arrived on the   th of may      on the  th of the following month i was appointed by the legislature a delegate to congress the appointment to take place on the  st of nov ensuing when that of the existing delegation would expire i accordingly left home on the   th of oct arrived at trenton where congress was sitting on the  d of nov and took my seat on the  th on which day congress adjourned to meet at annapolis on the   th congress had now become a very small body and the members very remiss in their attendance on its duties insomuch that a majority of the states necessary by the confederation to constitute a house even for minor business did not assemble until the   th of december they as early as jan        had turned their    attention to the monies current in the several states and had directed the financier robert morris to report to them a table of rates at which the foreign coins should be received at the treasury that officer or rather his assistant gouverneur morris answered them on the   th  in an able and elaborate statement of the denominations of money current in the several states and of the comparative value of the foreign coins chiefly in circulation with us he went into the consideration of the necessity of establishing a standard of value with us and of the adoption of a moneyunit he proposed for the unit such a fraction of pure silver as would be a common measure of the penny of every state without leaving a fraction this common divisor he found to be  –   0 of a dollar or  –  00 of the crown sterling the value of a dollar was therefore to be expressed by    0 units and of a crown by   00 each unit containing a quarter of a grain of fine silver congress turning again their attention to this subject the following year the financier by a letter of apr  0      further explained and urged the unit he had proposed but nothing more was done on it until the ensuing year when it was again taken up and referred to a commee of which i was a member the general views of the financier were sound and the principle was ingenious on which he proposed to found his unit but it was too minute for ordinary use too laborious for computation either by the head or in figures the price of a loaf of bread  – 0 of a dollar would be    units    a pound of butter  –  of a dollar     units a horse or bullock of  0 d value would require a notation of   figures to wit     00 and the public debt suppose of  0 millions would require    figures to wit     00000000 units such a system of moneyarithmetic would be entirely unmanageable for the common purposes of society i proposed therefore instead of this to adopt the dollar as our unit of account and payment and that its divisions and subdivisions should be in the decimal ratio i wrote some notes  on the subject which i submitted to the consideration of the financier i received his answer and adherence to his general system only agreeing to take for his unit  00 of those he first proposed so that a dollar should be     0– 00 and a crown    units i replied to this and printed my notes and reply on a flying sheet which i put into the hands of the members of congress for consideration and the committee agreed to report on my principle this was adopted the ensuing year and is the system which now prevails i insert here the notes and reply as shewing the different views on which the adoption of our money system hung the division into dimes cents  mills is now so well understood that it would be easy of introduction into the kindred branches of weights  measures i use when i travel an odometer of clarkes invention which divides the mile into cents and i find every one comprehend a distance readily when stated to them in miles  cents so they would in feet and cents pounds  cents c    the remissness of congress and their permanent session began to be a subject of uneasiness and even some of the legislatures had recommended to them intermissions and periodical sessions as the confederation had made no provision for a visible head of the government during vacations of congress and such a one was necessary to superintend the executive business to receive and communicate with foreign ministers  nations and to assemble congress on sudden and extraordinary emergencies i proposed early in april  the appointment of a commee to be called the committee of the states to consist of a member from each state who should remain in session during the recess of congress that the functions of congress should be divided into executive and legislative the latter to be reserved and the former by a general resolution to be delegated to that committee this proposition was afterwards agreed to a committee appointed who entered on duty on the subsequent adjournment of congress quarrelled very soon split into two parties abandoned their post and left the government without any visible head until the next meeting in congress we have since seen the same thing take place in the directory of france and i believe it will forever take place in any executive consisting of a plurality our plan best i believe combines wisdom and practicability by providing a plurality of counsellors but a single arbiter for ultimate decision i was in france when we heard of this schism    and separation of our committee and speaking with dr franklin of this singular disposition of men to quarrel and divide into parties he gave his sentiments as usual by way of apologue he mentioned the eddystone lighthouse in the british channel as being built on a rock in the midchannel totally inaccessible in winter from the boisterous character of that sea in that season that therefore for the two keepers employed to keep up the lights all provisions for the winter were necessarily carried to them in autumn as they could never be visited again till the return of the milder season that on the first practicable day in the spring a boat put off to them with fresh supplies the boatmen met at the door one of the keepers and accosted him with a how goes it friend very well how is your companion i do not know dont know is not he here i cant tell have not you seen him today no when did you see him not since last fall you have killed him not i indeed they were about to lay hold of him as having certainly murdered his companion but he desired them to go up stairs  examine for themselves they went up and there found the other keeper they had quarrelled it seems soon after being left there had divided into two parties assigned the cares below to one and those above to the other and had never spoken to or seen one another since but to return to our congress at annapolis the definitive treaty of peace which had been signed at paris on the  d of sep      and received here could not be ratified without a house of   states     on the   d of dec  therefore we addressed letters to the several governors stating the receipt of the definitive treaty that   states only were in attendance while   were necessary to its ratification and urging them to press on their delegates the necessity of their immediate attendance and on the   th to save time i moved that the agent of marine robert morris should be instructed to have ready a vessel at this place at n york  at some eastern port to carry over the ratification of the treaty when agreed to it met the general sense of the house but was opposed by dr lee  on the ground of expense which it would authorize the agent to incur for us and he said it would be better to ratify at once  send on the ratification some members had before suggested that   states were competent to the ratification my motion was therefore postponed and another brought forward by mr read  of s c for an immediate ratification this was debated the   th and   th reed lee hugh williamson  jeremiah chace urged that ratification was a mere matter of form that the treaty was conclusive from the moment it was signed by the ministers that although the confederation requires the assent of   states to enter into a treaty yet that its conclusion could not be called entrance into it that supposing   states requisite it would be in the power of   states to keep us always at war that   states had virtually authorized the ratifion having ratified    the provisional treaty and instructed their ministers to agree to a definitive one in the same terms and the present one was in fact substantially and almost verbatim the same that there now remain but    days for the ratification for its passage across the atlantic and its exchange that there was no hope of our soon having   states present in fact that this was the ultimate point of time to which we could venture to wait that if the ratification was not in paris by the time stipulated the treaty would become void that if ratified by   states it would go under our seal without its being known to gr britain that only   had concurred that it was a question of which they had no right to take cognizance and we were only answerable for it to our constituents that it was like the ratification which gr britain had received from the dutch by the negotiations of sr wm temple on the contrary it was argued by monroe gerry howel ellery  myself that by the modern usage of europe the ratification was considered as the act which gave validity to a treaty until which it was not obligatory  that the commission to the ministers reserved the ratification to congress that the treaty itself stipulated that it should be ratified that it became a  d question who were competent to the ratification that the confederation expressly required   states to enter into any treaty that by this that instrument must have intended that the assent of   states should be necessary as    well to the completion as to the commencement of the treaty its object having been to guard the rights of the union in all those important cases where   states are called for that by the contrary construction   states containing less than one third of our whole citizens might rivet on us a treaty commenced indeed under commission and instructions from   states but formed by the minister in express contradiction to such instructions and in direct sacrifice of the interests of so great a majority that the definitive treaty was admitted not to be a verbal copy of the provisional one and whether the departures from it were of substance or not was a question on which   states alone were competent to decide that the circumstances of the ratification of the provisional articles by   states the instructions to our ministers to form a definitive one by them and their actual agreement in substance do not render us competent to ratify in the present instance if these circumstances are in themselves a ratification nothing further is requisite than to give attested copies of them in exchange for the british ratification if they are not we remain where we were without a ratification by   states and incompetent ourselves to ratify that it was but   days since the seven states now present unanimously concurred in a resolution to be forwarded to the governors of the absent states in which they stated as a cause for urging on their delegates that   states were necessary to ratify the treaty that in the case of the dutch ratification gr britain had courted it and therefore was glad to accept it as it was that    they knew our constitution and would object to a ratification by   that if that circumstance was kept back it would be known hereafter  would give them ground to deny the validity of a ratification into which they should have been surprised and cheated and it would be a dishonorable prostitution of our seal that there is a hope of   states that if the treaty would become null if not ratified in time it would not be saved by an imperfect ratification but that in fact it would not be null and would be placed on better ground going in unexceptionable form tho a few days too late and rested on the small importance of this circumstance and the physical impossibilities which had prevented a punctual compliance in point of time that this would be approved by all nations  by great britain herself if not determined to renew the war and if determined she would never want excuses were this out of the way mr reade gave notice he should call for the yeas  nays whereon those in opposition prepared a resolution expressing pointedly the reasons of the dissent from his motion it appearing however that his proposition could not be carried it was thought better to make no entry at all massachusetts alone would have been for it rhode island pennsylvania and virginia against it delaware maryland  n carolina would have been divided our body was little numerous but very contentious day after day was wasted on the most unimportant questions my colleague mercer  was one of those afflicted with the morbid rage of debate  0 of an ardent mind prompt imagination and copious flow of words he heard with impatience any logic which was not his own sitting near me on some occasion of a trifling but wordy debate he asked how i could sit in silence hearing so much false reasoning which a word should refute i observed to him that to refute indeed was easy but to silence impossible that in measures brought forward by myself i took the laboring oar as was incumbent on me but that in general i was willing to listen if every sound argument or objection was used by some one or other of the numerous debaters it was enough if not i thought it sufficient to suggest the omission without going into a repetition of what had been already said by others that this was a waste and abuse of the time and patience of the house which could not be justified and i believe that if the members of deliberative bodies were to observe this course generally they would do in a day what takes them a week and it is really more questionable than may at first be thought whether bonapartes dumb legislature which said nothing and did much may not be preferable to one which talks much and does nothing i served with general washington in the legislature of virginia before the revolution and during it with dr franklin in congress i never heard either of them speak ten minutes at a time nor to any but the main point which was to decide the question they laid their shoulders to the great points knowing that the little ones would follow of themselves if the present congress errs in too much talking how can it be otherwise in a body to which the people    send   0 lawyers whose trade it is to question everything yield nothing  talk by the hour that   0 lawyers should do business together ought not to be expected but to return again to our subject those who thought   states competent to the ratification being very restless under the loss of their motion i proposed on the  d of january to meet them on middle ground and therefore moved a resolution  which premising that there were but   states present who were unanimous for the ratification but that they differed in opinion on the question of competency that those however in the negative were unwilling that any powers which it might be supposed they possessed should remain unexercised for the restoration of peace provided it could be done saving their good faith and without importing any opinion of congress that   states were competent and resolving that treaty be ratified so far as they had power that it should be transmitted to our ministers with instructions to keep it uncommunicated to endeavor to obtain   months longer for exchange of ratifications that they should be informed that so soon as   states shall be present a ratification by   shall be sent them if this should get to them before the ultimate point of time for exchange they were to use it and not the other if not they were to offer the act of the   states in exchange informing them the treaty had come to hand while congress was not in session that but   states were as yet assembled and these had unanimously concurred in the ratification this was    debated on the  d and  th  and on the  th a vessel being to sail for england from this port annapolis the house directed the president to write to our ministers accordingly jan    delegates from connecticut having attended yesterday and another from s carolina coming in this day the treaty was ratified without a dissenting voice and three instruments of ratification were ordered to be made out one of which was sent by colo harmer another by colo franks and the  d transmitted to the agent of marine to be forwarded by any good opportunity congress soon took up the consideration of their foreign relations they deemed it necessary to get their commerce placed with every nation on a footing as favorable as that of other nations and for this purpose to propose to each a distinct treaty of commerce this act too would amount to an acknowledgment by each of our independance and of our reception into the fraternity of nations which altho as possessing our station of right and in fact we would not condescend to ask we were not unwilling to furnish opportunities for receiving their friendly salutations  welcome with france the united netherlands and sweden we had already treaties of commerce but commissions were given for those countries also should any amendments be thought necessary the other states to which treaties were to be proposed were england hamburg saxony prussia denmark russia austria venice rome naples tuscany sardinia genoa    spain portugal the porte algiers tripoli tunis  morocco  mar    on the  th of may congress resolved that a minister plenipotentiary should be appointed in addition to mr adams  dr franklin for negotiating treaties of commerce with foreign nations and i was elected to that duty i accordingly left annapolis on the   th took with me my elder daughter  then at philadelphia the two others being too young for the voyage  proceeded to boston in quest of a passage while passing thro the different states i made a point of informing myself of the state of the commerce of each went on to new hampshire with the same view and returned to boston from thence i sailed on the  th of july in the ceres a merchant ship of mr nathaniel tracey bound to cowes he was himself a passenger and after a pleasant voyage of    days from land to land we arrived at cowes on the   th i was detained there a few days by the indisposition of my daughter on the  0th we embarked for havre arrived there on the   st left it on the  d of august and arrived at paris on the  th i called immediately on doctr franklin at passy communicated to him our charge and we wrote to mr adams then at the hague to join us at paris before i had left america that is to say in the year      i had received a letter from m de marbois of the french legation in philadelphia informing me he had been instructed by his government to    obtain such statistical accounts of the different states of our union as might be useful for their information and addressing to me a number of queries relative to the state of virginia i had always made it a practice whenever an opportunity occurred of obtaining any information of our country which might be of use to me in any station public or private to commit it to writing these memoranda were on loose papers bundled up without order and difficult of recurrence when i had occasion for a particular one i thought this a good occasion to embody their substance which i did in the order of mr marbois queries so as to answer his wish and to arrange them for my own use some friends to whom they were occasionally communicated wished for copies but their volume rendering this too laborious by hand i proposed to get a few printed for their gratification i was asked such a price however as exceeded the importance of the object on my arrival at paris i found it could be done for a fourth of what i had been asked here i therefore corrected and enlarged them and had  00 copies printed under the title of notes on virginia i gave a very few copies to some particular persons in europe and sent the rest to my friends in america an european copy by the death of the owner got into the hands of a bookseller who engaged its translation  when ready for the press communicated his intentions  manuscript to me without any other permission than that of suggesting corrections i never had seen so wretched an attempt at translation interverted abridged mutilated and    often reversing the sense of the original i found it a blotch of errors from beginning to end i corrected some of the most material and in that form it was printed in french  a london bookseller on seeing the translation requested me to permit him to print the english original i thought it best to do so to let the world see that it was not really so bad as the french translation had made it appear and this is the true history of that publication mr adams soon joined us at paris  our first employment was to prepare a general form to be proposed to such nations as were disposed to treat with us during the negotiations for peace with the british commissioner david hartley our commissioners had proposed on the suggestion of doctr franklin to insert an article exempting from capture by the public or private armed ships of either belligerent when at war all merchant vessels and their cargoes employed merely in carrying on the commerce between nations it was refused by england and unwisely in my opinion for in the case of a war with us their superior commerce places infinitely more at hazard on the ocean than ours and as hawks abound in proportion to game so our privateers would swarm in proportion to the wealth exposed to their prize while theirs would be few for want of subjects of capture we inserted this article in our form with a provision against the molestation of fishermen husbandmen citizens unarmed and following their occupations in unfortified places for the humane treatment of prisoners of war    the abolition of contraband of war which exposes merchant vessels to such vexatious  ruinous detentions and abuses and for the principle of free bottoms free goods in a conference with the count de vergennes it was thought better to leave to legislative regulation on both sides such modifications of our commercial intercourse as would voluntarily flow from amicable dispositions without urging we sounded the ministers of the several european nations at the court of versailles on their dispositions towards mutual commerce and the expediency of encouraging it by the protection of a treaty old frederic of prussia met us cordially and without hesitation and appointing the baron de thulemeyer his minister at the hague to negotiate with us we communicated to him our project which with little alteration by the king was soon concluded denmark and tuscany entered also into negotiations with us other powers appearing indifferent we did not think it proper to press them they seemed in fact to know little about us but as rebels who had been successful in throwing off the yoke of the mother country they were ignorant of our commerce which had been always monopolized by england and of the exchange of articles it might offer advantageously to both parties they were inclined therefore to stand aloof until they could see better what relations might be usefully instituted with us the negotiations therefore begun with denmark  tuscany we protracted designedly until our powers had expired and abstained from making new propositions to    others having no colonies because our commerce being an exchange of raw for wrought materials is a competent price for admission into the colonies of those possessing them but were we to give it without price to others all would claim it without price on the ordinary ground of gentis amicissimæ mr adams being appointed min pleny of the u s to london left us in june and in july      dr franklin returned to america and i was appointed his successor at paris in feb      mr adams wrote to me pressingly to join him in london immediately as he thought he discovered there some symptoms of better disposition towards us colo smith  his secretary of legation was the bearer of his urgencies for my immediate attendance i accordingly left paris on the  st of march and on my arrival in london we agreed on a very summary form of treaty proposing an exchange of citizenship for our citizens our ships and our productions generally except as to office on my presentation as usual to the king and queen at their levées it was impossible for anything to be more ungracious than their notice of mr adams  myself i saw at once that the ulcerations in the narrow mind of that mulish being left nothing to be expected on the subject of my attendance and on the first conference with the marquis of caermarthen his minister of foreign affairs the distance and disinclination which he betrayed in his conversation the vagueness  evasions of his answers to us confirmed me in the belief of their aversion to have anything to do with us we    delivered him however our projét mr adams not despairing as much as i did of its effect we afterwards by one or more notes requested his appointment of an interview and conference which without directly declining he evaded by pretences of other pressing occupations for the moment after staying there seven weeks till within a few days of the expiration of our commission i informed the minister by note that my duties at paris required my return to that place and that i should with pleasure be the bearer of any commands to his ambassador there he answered that he had none and wishing me a pleasant journey i left london the   th arrived at paris on the  0th of april while in london we entered into negotiations with the chevalier pinto ambassador of portugal at that place the only article of difficulty between us was a stipulation that our bread stuff should be received in portugal in the form of flour as well as of grain he approved of it himself but observed that several nobles of great influence at their court were the owners of wind mills in the neighborhood of lisbon which depended much for their profits on manufacturing our wheat and that this stipulation would endanger the whole treaty he signed it however  its fate was what he had candidly portended my duties at paris were confined to a few objects the receipt of our whaleoils salted fish and salted meats on favorable terms the admission of our rice on equal terms with that of piedmont egypt  the levant a mitigation of the monopolies of our tobacco by the farmersgeneral and a free admission of our    productions into their islands were the principal commercial objects which required attention and on these occasions i was powerfully aided by all the influence and the energies of the marquis de la fayette who proved himself equally zealous for the friendship and welfare of both nations and in justice i must also say that i found the government entirely disposed to befriend us on all occasions and to yield us every indulgence not absolutely injurious to themselves the count de vergennes had the reputation with the diplomatic corps of being wary  slippery in his diplomatic intercourse and so he might be with those whom he knew to be slippery and doublefaced themselves as he saw that i had no indirect views practised no subtleties meddled in no intrigues pursued no concealed object i found him as frank as honorable as easy of access to reason as any man with whom i had ever done business and i must say the same for his successor montmorin one of the most honest and worthy of human beings our commerce in the mediterranean was placed under early alarm by the capture of two of our vessels and crews by the barbary cruisers i was very unwilling that we should acquiesce in the european humiliation of paying a tribute to those lawless pirates and endeavored to form an association of the powers subject to habitual depredation from them i accordingly prepared and proposed to their ministers at paris for consultation with their governments articles of a special confederation in the following form  00 proposals for concerted operation among the powers at war with the piratical states of barbary   it is proposed that the several powers at war with the piratical states of barbary or any two or more of them who shall be willing shall enter into a convention to carry on their operations against those states in concert beginning with the algerines   this convention shall remain open to any other power who shall at any future time wish to accede to it the parties reserving a right to prescribe the conditions of such accession according to the circumstances existing at the time it shall be proposed   the object of the convention shall be to compel the piratical states to perpetual peace without price  to guarantee that peace to each other   the operations for obtaining this peace shall be constant cruises on their coast with a naval force now to be agreed on it is not proposed that this force shall be so considerable as to be inconvenient to any party it is believed that half a dozen frigates with as many tenders or xebecs one half of which shall be in cruise while the other half is at rest will suffice   the force agreed to be necessary shall be furnished by the parties in certain quotas now to be fixed it being expected that each will be willing to contribute in such proportion as circumstance may render reasonable   as miscarriages often proceed from the want of harmony among officers of different nations the parties shall now consider  decide whether it will  0  not be better to contribute their quotas in money to be employed in fitting out and keeping on duty a single fleet of the force agreed on   the difficulties and delays too which will attend the management of these operations if conducted by the parties themselves separately distant as their courts may be from one another and incapable of meeting in consultation suggest a question whether it will not be better for them to give full powers for that purpose to their ambassadors or other ministers resident at some one court of europe who shall form a committee or council for carrying this convention into effect wherein the vote of each member shall be computed in proportion to the quota of his sovereign and the majority so computed shall prevail in all questions within the view of this convention the court of versailles is proposed on account of its neighborhood to the mediterranean and because all those powers are represented there who are likely to become parties to this convention   to save to that council the embarrassment of personal solicitations for office and to assure the parties that their contributions will be applied solely to the object for which they are destined there shall be no establishment of officers for the said council such as commis secretaries or any other kind with either salaries or perquisites nor any other lucrative appointments but such whose functions are to be exercised on board the sd vessels   should war arise between any two of the parties to this convention it shall not extend to this  0  enterprise nor interrupt it but as to this they shall be reputed at peace  0 when algiers shall be reduced to peace the other pyratical states if they refuse to discontinue their pyracies shall become the objects of this convention either successively or together as shall seem best    where this convention would interfere with treaties actually existing between any of the parties and the sd states of barbary the treaty shall prevail and such party shall be allowed to withdraw from the operations against that state spain had just concluded a treaty with algiers at the expense of   millions of dollars and did not like to relinquish the benefit of that until the other party should fail in their observance of it portugal naples the two sicilies venice malta denmark and sweden were favorably disposed to such an association but their representatives at paris expressed apprehensions that france would interfere and either openly or secretly support the barbary powers and they required that i should ascertain the dispositions of the count de vergennes on the subject i had before taken occasion to inform him of what we were proposing and therefore did not think it proper to insinuate any doubt of the fair conduct of his government but stating our propositions i mentioned the apprehensions entertained by us that england would interfere in behalf of those piratical governments she dares not do it said he i pressed it no further the other agents were  0  satisfied with this indication of his sentiments and nothing was now wanting to bring it into direct and formal consideration but the assent of our government and their authority to make the formal proposition i communicated to them the favorable prospect of protecting our commerce from the barbary depredations and for such a continuance of time as by an exclusion of them from the sea to change their habits  characters from a predatory to an agricultural people towards which however it was expected they would contribute a frigate and its expenses to be in constant cruise but they were in no condition to make any such engagement their recommendatory powers for obtaining contributions were so openly neglected by the several states that they declined an engagement which they were conscious they could not fulfill with punctuality and so it fell through may    in      while at paris i became acquainted with john ledyard of connecticut a man of genius of some science and of fearless courage  enterprise he had accompanied capt cook in his voyage to the pacific had distinguished himself on several occasions by an unrivalled intrepidity and published an account of that voyage with details unfavorable to cooks deportment towards the savages and lessening our regrets at his fate ledyard had come to paris in the hope of forming a company to engage in the fur trade of the western coast of america he was disappointed in this and being out of business and of a roaming restless character i suggested to him the enterprise of exploring the  0  western part of our continent by passing thro st petersburg to kamschatka and procuring a passage thence in some of the russian vessels to nootka sound whence he might make his way across the continent to america and i undertook to have the permission of the empress of russia solicited he eagerly embraced the proposition and m de sémoulin the russian ambassador and more particularly baron grimm the special correspondent of the empress solicited her permission for him to pass thro her dominions to the western coast of america and here i must correct a material error which i have committed in another place to the prejudice of the empress in writing some notes of the life of capt lewis  prefixed to his expedition to the pacific i stated that the empress gave the permission asked  afterwards retracted it this idea after a lapse of    years had so insinuated itself into my mind that i committed it to paper without the least suspicion of error yet i find on recurring to my letters of that date that the empress refused permission at once considering the enterprise as entirely chimerical but ledyard would not relinquish it persuading himself that by proceeding to st petersburg he could satisfy the empress of its practicability and obtain her permission he went accordingly but she was absent on a visit to some distant part of her dominions  and he pursued his course to within  00 miles of kamschatka where he was overtaken by an arrest from the empress brought back to poland and there dismissed i must therefore  0  in justice acquit the empress of ever having for a moment countenanced even by the indulgence of an innocent passage thro her territories this interesting enterprise may    the pecuniary distresses of france produced this year a measure of which there had been no example for near two centuries  the consequences of which good and evil are not yet calculable for its remote causes we must go a little back celebrated writers of france and england had already sketched good principles on the subject of government yet the american revolution seems first to have awakened the thinking part of the french nation in general from the sleep of despotism in which they were sunk the officers too who had been to america were mostly young men less shackled by habit and prejudice and more ready to assent to the suggestions of common sense and feeling of common rights they came back with new ideas  impressions the press notwithstanding its shackles began to disseminate them conversation assumed new freedoms politics became the theme of all societies male and female and a very extensive  zealous party was formed which acquired the appellation of the patriotic party who sensible of the abusive government under which they lived sighed for occasions of reforming it this party comprehended all the honesty of the kingdom sufficiently at its leisure to think the men of letters the easy bourgeois the young nobility partly from reflection partly from mode for these sentiments became matter of mode and as such  0  united most of the young women to the party happily for the nation it happened at the same moment that the dissipations of the queen and court the abuses of the pensionlist and dilapidations in the administration of every branch of the finances had exhausted the treasures and credit of the nation insomuch that its most necessary functions were paralyzed to reform these abuses would have overset the minister to impose new taxes by the authority of the king was known to be impossible from the determined opposition of the parliament to their enregistry no resource remained then but to appeal to the nation he advised therefore the call of an assembly of the most distinguished characters of the nation in the hope that by promises of various and valuable improvements in the organization and regimen of the government they would be induced to authorize new taxes to controul the opposition of the parliament and to raise the annual revenue to the level of expenditures an assembly of notables therefore about   0 in number named by the king convened on the   d of feb the minister calonne stated to them that the annual excess of expenses beyond the revenue when louis xvi came to the throne was    millions of livres that   0 millns had been borrowed to reestablish the navy that the american war had cost them    0 millns     mils of dollars and that the interest of these sums with other increased expenses had added  0 millns more to the annual deficit but a subseqt and more candid estimate made it    millns he proffered them an  0  universal redress of grievances laid open those grievances fully pointed out sound remedies and covering his canvas with objects of this magnitude the deficit dwindled to a little accessory scarcely attracting attention the persons chosen were the most able  independent characters in the kingdom and their support if it could be obtained would be enough for him they improved the occasion for redressing their grievances and agreed that the public wants should be relieved but went into an examination of the causes of them it was supposed that calonne was conscious that his accounts could not bear examination and it was said and believed that he asked of the king to send   members to the bastile of whom the m de la fayette was one to banish  0 others    of his ministers the king found it shorter to banish him his successor went on in full concert with the assembly the result was an augmentation of the revenue a promise of economies in its expenditure of an annual settlement of the public accounts before a council which the comptroller having been heretofore obliged to settle only with the king in person of course never settled at all an acknowledgment that the king could not lay a new tax a reformation of the criminal laws abolition of torture suppression of corvées reformation of the gabelles removal of the interior custom houses free commerce of grain internal  external and the establishment of provincial assemblies which alltogether constituted a great mass of improvement in the condition of the nation the establishment of the provincial assemblies  0  was in itself a fundamental improvement they would be of the choice of the people one third renewed every year in those provinces where there are no states that is to say over about three fourths of the kingdom they would be partly an executive themselves  partly an executive council to the intendant to whom the executive power in his province had been heretofore entirely delegated chosen by the people they would soften the execution of hard laws  having a right of representation to the king they would censure bad laws suggest good ones expose abuses and their representations when united would command respect to the other advantages might be added the precedent itself of calling the assemblée des notables which would perhaps grow into habit the hope was that the improvements thus promised would be carried into effect that they would be maintained during the present reign  that that would be long enough for them to take some root in the constitution so that they might come to be considered as a part of that and be protected by time and the attachment of the nation the count de vergennes had died a few days before the meeting of the assembly  the count de montmorin had been named minister of foreign affairs in his place villedeuil succeeded calonnes as comptroller general  lomenie de bryenne archbishop of thoulouse afterwards of sens  ultimately cardinal lomenie was named minister principal with whom the other ministers were to transact the business of their departments heretofore  0  done with the king in person and the duke de nivernois and m de malesherbes were called to the council on the nomination of the minister principal the marshals de segur  de castries retired from the departments of war  marine unwilling to act subordinately or to share the blame of proceedings taken out of their direction they were succeeded by the count de brienne brother of the prime minister and the marquis de la luzerne brother to him who had been minister in the united states may    a dislocated wrist unsuccessfully set occasioned advice from my surgeon to try the mineral waters of aix in provence as a corroborant i left paris for that place therefore on the   th of feb and proceeded up the seine thro champagne  burgundy and down the rhone thro the beaujolais by lyons avignon nismes to aix where finding on trial no benefit from the waters i concluded to visit the rice country of piedmont to see if anything might be learned there to benefit the rivalship of our carolina rice with that and thence to make a tour of the seaport towns of france along its southern and western coast to inform myself if anything could be done to favor our commerce with them  from aix therefore i took my route by marseilles toulon hieres nice across the col de tende by coni turin vercelli novara milan pavia novi genoa thence returning along the coast by savona noli albenga oneglia monaco nice antibes frejus aix marseilles avignon   0 nismes montpellier frontignan cette agde and along the canal of languedoc by bezieres narbonne cascassonne castelnaudari thro the souterrain of st feriol and back by castelnaudari to toulouse thence to montauban  down the garonne by langon to bordeaux thence to rochefort la rochelle nantes lorient then back by rennes to nantes and up the loire by angers tours amboise blois to new orleans thence direct to paris where i arrived on the  0th of june soon after my return from this journey to wit about the latter part of july i received my younger daughter maria from virginia by the way of london the youngest having died some time before the treasonable perfidy of the prince of orange stadtholder  captain general of the united netherlands in the war which england waged against them for entering into a treaty of commerce with the us is known to all as their executive officer charged with the conduct of the war he contrived to baffle all the measures of the states general to dislocate all their military plans  played false into the hands of england and against his own country on every possible occasion confident in her protection and in that of the king of prussia brother to his princess the states general indignant at this patricidal conduct applied to france for aid according to the stipulations of the treaty concluded with her in    it was assured to them readily and in cordial terms in a letter from the ct de vergennes to the marquis de verac ambassador of france at the hague of which the following is an extract     extrait de la depeche de monsr le comte de vergennes à monsr le marquis de verac ambassadeur de france à la haye du  er mars      le roi concourrera autant quil sera en son pouvoir au succes de la chose et vous inviterez de sa part les patriotes de lui communiquer leurs vues leurs plans et leurs envieux vous les assurerez que le roi prend un interêt veritable à leurs personnes comme à leur cause et qu ils peuvent compter sur sa protection ils doivent y compter d autant plus monsieur que nous ne dissimulons pas que si monsr le stadhoulder reprend son ancienne influence le systeme anglois ne tardera pas de prevaloir et que notre alliance deviendroit un être de raison les patriotes sentiront facilement que cette position seroit incompatible avec la dignité comme avec la consideration de sa majesté mais dans le cas monsieur ou les chefs des patriotes auroient à craindre une scission ils auroient le temps suffisant pour ramener ceux de leurs amis que les anglomanes ont egarés et preparer les choses de maniere que la question de nouveau mise en deliberation soit decidé selon leurs desirs dans cette hypothese le roi vous autorise à agir de concert avec eux de suivre la direction qu ils jugeront devoir vous donner et d employer tous les moyens pour augmenter le nombre des partisans de la bonne cause il me reste monsieur il me reste monsieur de vous parler de la sureté personelle des patriotes vous les assurerez que dans tout etat de cause le roi les prend sous sa protection immediate et vous ferez connoitre partout ou vous le jugerez necessaire que sa majesté     regarderoit comme une offense personnelle tout ce qu on entreprenderoit contre leur liberte il est à presumer que ce langage tenu avec energie en imposera à laudace des anglomanes et que monsr le prince de nassau croira courir quelque risque en provoquant le ressentiment de sa majesté this letter was communicated by the patriots to me when at amsterdam in      and a copy sent by me to mr jay in my letter to him of mar         the object of the patriots was to establish a representative and republican government the majority of the states general were with them but the majority of the populace of the towns was with the prince of orange and that populace was played off with great effect by the triumvirate of    harris  the english ambassador afterwards ld malmesbury the prince of orange a stupid man and the princess as much a man as either of her colleagues in audaciousness in enterprise  in the thirst of domination by these the mobs of the hague were excited against the members of the states general their persons were insulted  endangered in the streets the sanctuary of their houses was violated and the prince whose function  duty it was to repress and punish these violations of order took no steps for that purpose the states general for their own protection were therefore obliged to place their militia under the command of a committee the prince filled the courts of london and berlin     with complaints at this usurpation of his prerogatives and forgetting that he was but the first servant of a republic marched his regular troops against the city of utrecht where the states were in session they were repulsed by the militia his interests now became marshalled with those of the public enemy  against his own country the states therefore exercising their rights of sovereignty deprived him of all his powers the great frederic had died in august     he had never intended to break with france in support of the prince of orange during the illness of which he died he had thro the duke of brunswick declared to the marquis de la fayette who was then at berlin that he meant not to support the english interest in holland that he might assure the government of france his only wish was that some honorable place in the constitution should be reserved for the stadtholder and his children and that he would take no part in the quarrel unless an entire abolition of the stadtholderate should be attempted but his place was now occupied by frederic william his great nephew a man of little understanding much caprice  very inconsiderate and the princess his sister altho her husband was in arms against the legitimate authorities of the country attempting to go to amsterdam for the purpose of exciting the mobs of that place and being refused permission to pass a military post on the way he put the duke of brunswick at the head of  0000 men and made demonstrations of marching on holland the king of france hereupon     declared by his chargé des affaires in holland that if the prussian troops continued to menace holland with an invasion his majesty in quality of ally was determined to succor that province  in answer to this eden gave official information to count montmorin that england must consider as at an end its convention with france relative to giving notice of its naval armaments and that she was arming generally  war being now imminent eden questioned me on the effect of our treaty with france in the case of a war  what might be our dispositions i told him frankly and without hesitation that our dispositions would be neutral and that i thought it would be the interest of both these powers that we should be so because it would relieve both from all anxiety as to feeding their w india islands that england too by suffering us to remain so would avoid a heavy landwar on our continent which might very much cripple her proceedings elsewhere that our treaty indeed obliged us to receive into our ports the armed vessels of france with their prizes and to refuse admission to the prizes made on her by her enemies that there was a clause also by which we guaranteed to france her american possessions which might perhaps force us into the war if these were attacked then it will be war said he for they will assuredly be attacked  liston at madrid about the same time made the same inquiries of carmichael the government of france then declared a determination to     form a camp of observation at givet commenced arming her marine and named the bailli de suffrein their generalissimo on the ocean she secretly engaged also in negotiations with russia austria  spain to form a quadruple alliance the duke of brunswick having advanced to the confines of holland sent some of his officers to givet to reconnoitre the state of things there and report them to him he said afterwards that if there had been only a few tents at that place he should not have advanced further for that the king would not merely for the interest of his sister engage in a war with france but finding that there was not a single company there he boldly entered the country took their towns as fast as he presented himself before them and advanced on utrecht the states had appointed the rhingrave of salm their commanderinchief a prince without talents without courage and without principle he might have held out in utrecht for a considerable time but he surrendered the place without firing a gun literally ran away  hid himself so that for months it was not known what had become of him amsterdam was then attacked and capitulated in the meantime the negotiations for the quadruple alliance were proceeding favorably but the secrecy with which they were attempted to be conducted was penetrated by fraser chargé des affaires of england at st petersburg who instantly notified his court and gave the alarm to prussia the king saw at once what would be his situation between the jaws of france austria and russia in great dismay he besought the court of london     not to abandon him sent alvensleben to paris to explain and soothe and england thro the d of dorset and eden renewed her conferences for accommodation the archbishop who shuddered at the idea of war and preferred a peaceful surrender of right to an armed vindication of it received them with open arms entered into cordial conferences and a declaration and counter declaration were cooked up at versailles and sent to london for approbation they were approved there reached paris at   oclock of the   th and were signed that night at versailles it was said and believed at paris that m de montmorin literally pleuroit comme un enfant when obliged to sign this counter declaration so distressed was he by the dishonor of sacrificing the patriots after assurances so solemn of protection and absolute encouragement to proceed  the prince of orange was reinstated in all his powers now become regal a great emigration of the patriots took place all were deprived of office many exiled and their property confiscated they were received in france and subsisted for some time on her bounty thus fell holland by the treachery of her chief from her honorable independence to become a province of england and so also her stadtholder from the high station of the first citizen of a free republic to be the servile viceroy of a foreign sovereign and this was effected by a mere scene of bullying  demonstration not one of the parties france england or prussia having ever really meant to encounter actual war     for the interest of the prince of orange but it had all the effect of a real and decisive war our first essay in america to establish a federative government had fallen on trial very short of its object during the war of independance while the pressure of an external enemy hooped us together and their enterprises kept us necessarily on the alert the spirit of the people excited by danger was a supplement to the confederation and urged them to zealous exertions whether claimed by that instrument or not but when peace and safety were restored and every man became engaged in useful and profitable occupation less attention was paid to the calls of congress the fundamental defect of the confederation was that congress was not authorized to act immediately on the people  by its own officers their power was only requisitory and these requisitions were addressed to the several legislatures to be by them carried into execution without other coercion than the moral principle of duty this allowed in fact a negative to every legislature on every measure proposed by congress a negative so frequently exercised in practice as to benumb the action of the federal government and to render it inefficient in its general objects  more especially in pecuniary and foreign concerns the want too of a separation of the legislative executive  judiciary functions worked disadvantageously in practice yet this state of things afforded a happy augury of the future march of our confederacy when it was seen that the good sense and good dispositions of the people as soon as they perceived the     incompetence of their first compact instead of leaving its correction to insurrection and civil war agreed with one voice to elect deputies to a general convention who should peaceably meet and agree on such a constitution as would ensure peace justice liberty the common defence  general welfare this convention met at philadelphia on the   th of may    it sate with closed doors and kept all its proceedings secret until its dissolution on the   th of september when the results of their labors were published all together i received a copy early in november and read and contemplated its provisions with great satisfaction as not a member of the convention however nor probably a single citizen of the union had approved it in all its parts so i too found articles which i thought objectionable the absence of express declarations ensuring freedom of religion freedom of the press freedom of the person under the uninterrupted protection of the habeas corpus  trial by jury in civil as well as in criminal cases excited my jealousy and the reeligibility of the president for life i quite disapproved i expressed freely in letters to my friends and most particularly to mr madison  general washington my approbations and objections how the good should be secured and the ill brought to rights was the difficulty to refer it back to a new convention might endanger the loss of the whole my first idea was that the   states first acting should accept it unconditionally and thus secure what in it was good and that the   last should accept on the previous condition that     certain amendments should be agreed to but a better course was devised of accepting the whole and trusting that the good sense  honest intention of our citizens would make the alterations which should be deemed necessary accordingly all accepted   without objection and   with recommendations of specified amendments those respecting the press religion  juries with several others of great value were accordingly made but the habeas corpus was left to the discretion of congress and the amendment against the reeligibility of the president was not proposed by that body my fears of that feature were founded on the importance of the office on the fierce contentions it might excite among ourselves if continuable for life and the dangers of interference either with money or arms by foreign nations to whom the choice of an american president might become interesting examples of this abounded in history in the case of the roman emperors for instance of the popes while of any significance of the german emperors the kings of poland  the deys of barbary i had observed too in the feudal history and in the recent instance particularly of the stadtholder of holland how easily offices or tenures for life slide into inheritances my wish therefore was that the president should be elected for   years  be ineligible afterwards this term i thought sufficient to enable him with the concurrence of the legislature to carry thro  establish any system of improvement he should propose for the general good but the practice adopted i think is better allowing his   0 continuance for   years with a liability to be dropped at half way of the term making that a period of probation that his continuance should be restrained to   years was the opinion of the convention at an early stage of its session when it voted that term by a majority of   against   and by a simple majority that he should be ineligible a second time this opinion c was confirmed by the house so late as july    referred to the committee of detail rereported favorably by them and changed to the present form by final vote on the last day but one only of their session  of this change three states expressed their disapprobation n york by recommending an amendment that the president should not be eligible a third time and virginia and n carolina that he should not be capable of serving more than   in any term of    years and altho this amendment has not been made in form yet practice seems to have established it the example of   presidents voluntarily retiring at the end of their  th year  the progress of public opinion that the principle is salutary have given it in practice the force of precedent  usage insomuch that should a president consent to be a candidate for a  d election i trust he would be rejected on this demonstration of ambitious views but there was another amendment of which none of us thought at the time and in the omission of which lurks the germ that is to destroy this happy     combination of national powers in the general government for matters of national concern and independent powers in the states for what concerns the states severally in england it was a great point gained at the revolution that the commissions of the judges which had hitherto been during pleasure should thenceforth be made during good behavior a judiciary dependent on the will of the king had proved itself the most oppressive of all tools in the hands of that magistrate nothing then could be more salutary than a change there to the tenure of good behavior and the question of good behavior left to the vote of a simple majority in the two houses of parliament before the revolution we were all good english whigs cordial in their free principles and in their jealousies of their executive magistrate these jealousies are very apparent in all our state constitutions and in the general government in this instance we have gone even beyond the english caution by requiring a vote of two thirds in one of the houses for removing a judge a vote so impossible where  any defence is made before men of ordinary prejudices  passions that our judges are effectually independent of the nation but this ought not to be i would not indeed make them dependant on the executive authority as they formerly were in england but i deem it indispensable to the continuance of this government that they should be submitted to some practical      impartial controul and that this to be imparted must be compounded of a mixture of state and federal authorities it is not enough that honest men are appointed judges all know the influence of interest on the mind of man and how unconsciously his judgment is warped by that influence to this bias add that of the esprit de corps of their peculiar maxim and creed that it is the office of a good judge to enlarge his jurisdiction and the absence of responsibility and how can we expect impartial decision between the general government of which they are themselves so eminent a part and an individual state from which they have nothing to hope or fear we have seen too that contrary to all correct example they are in the habit of going out of the question before them to throw an anchor ahead and grapple further hold for future advances of power they are then in fact the corps of sappers  miners steadily working to undermine the independant rights of the states  to consolidate all power in the hands of that government in which they have so important a freehold estate but it is not by the consolidation or concentration of powers but by their distribution that good government is effected were not this great country already divided into states that division must be made that each might do for itself what concerns itself directly and what it can so much better do than a distant authority every state again is divided into counties each to take care of what lies within its local bounds each county again into townships or wards to manage minuter details and every ward into     farms to be governed each by its individual proprietor were we directed from washington when to sow  when to reap we should soon want bread it is by this partition of cares descending in gradation from general to particular that the mass of human affairs may be best managed for the good and prosperity of all i repeat that i do not charge the judges with wilful and illintentioned error but honest error must be arrested where its toleration leads to public ruin as for the safety of society we commit honest maniacs to bedlam so judges should be withdrawn from their bench whose erroneous biases are leading us to dissolution it may indeed injure them in fame or in fortune but it saves the republic which is the first and supreme law among the debilities of the government of the confederation no one was more distinguished or more distressing than the utter impossibility of obtaining from the states the monies necessary for the payment of debts or even for the ordinary expenses of the government some contributed a little some less  some nothing and the last furnished at length an excuse for the first to do nothing also mr adams while residing at the hague had a general authority to borrow what sums might be requisite for ordinary  necessary expenses interest on the public debt and the maintenance of the diplomatic establishment in europe had been habitually provided in this way he was now elected vice president of the u s was soon to return to america  and had referred our bankers to me for     future councel on our affairs in their hands but i had no powers no instructions no means and no familiarity with the subject it had always been exclusively under his management except as to occasional and partial deposits in the hands of mr grand banker in paris for special and local purposes these last had been exhausted for some time and i had fervently pressed the treasury board to replenish this particular deposit as mr grand now refused to make further advances they answered candidly that no funds could be obtained until the new government should get into action and have time to make its arrangements mr adams had received his appointment to the court of london while engaged at paris with dr franklin and myself in the negotiations under our joint commissions he had repaired thence to london without returning to the hague to take leave of that government he thought it necessary however to do so now before he should leave europe and accordingly went there i learned his departure from london by a letter from mrs adams received on the very day on which he would arrive at the hague a consultation with him  some provision for the future was indispensable while we could yet avail ourselves of his powers for when they would be gone we should be without resource i was daily dunned by a company who had formerly made a small loan to the u s the principal of which was now become due and our bankers in amsterdam had notified me that the interest on our general debt would be expected in june that if we failed to pay it it would be deemed     an act of bankruptcy and would effectually destroy the credit of the u s and all future prospect of obtaining money there that the loan they had been authorized to open of which a third only was filled had now ceased to get forward and rendered desperate that hope of resource i saw that there was not a moment to lose and set out for the hague on the  d morning after receiving the information of mr adamss journey i went the direct road by louvres senlis roye pont st maxence bois le duc gournay peronne cambray bouchain valenciennes mons bruxelles malines antwerp mordick and rotterdam to the hague where i happily found mr adams he concurred with me at once in opinion that something must be done and that we ought to risk ourselves on doing it without instructions to save the credit of the u s we foresaw that before the new government could be adopted assembled establish its financial system get the money into the treasury and place it in europe considerable time would elapse that therefore we had better provide at once for the years         0 in order to place our government at its ease and our credit in security during that trying interval we set out therefore by the way of leyden for amsterdam where we arrived on the  0th i had prepared an estimate showing that       florins                                   there would be necessary for the year             – 0              0       0         0                                                                                       total         0  – 0         flor    to meet this the bankers had in hand      – –   the unsold bonds would yield     00        0  – –  leaving a deficit of           – –  we proposed then to borrow a million yielding       0000 which would leave a small deficiency of             – –  mr adams accordingly executed  000 bonds for  000 florins each and deposited them in the hands of our bankers with instructions however not to issue them until congress should ratify the measure this done he returned to london and i set out for paris and as nothing urgent forbade it i determined to return along the banks of the rhine to strasburg and thence strike off to paris i accordingly left amsterdam on the  0th of march and proceeded by utrecht nimeguen cleves duysberg dusseldorf cologne bonne coblentz nassau hocheim frankfort  made an excursion to hanau thence to mayence and another excursion to rudesheim  johansberg then by oppenheim worms and manheim and an excursion to heidelberg then by spire carlsruh rastadt  kelh to strasburg where i arrived apr   th and proceeded again on the   th by phalsbourg fenestrange dieuze moyenvie nancy toul ligny barleduc st diziers vitry chalons sur marne epernay chateau thierri meaux to paris where i arrived on the   d of april  and i had the satisfaction to reflect that by this journey our credit was secured the new government was placed at ease for two years to come and that     as well as myself were relieved from the torment of incessant duns whose just complaints could not be silenced by any means within our power a consular convention had been agreed on in    between dr franklin and the french government containing several articles so entirely inconsistent with the laws of the several states and the general spirit of our citizens that congress withheld their ratification and sent it back to me with instructions to get those articles expunged or modified so as to render them compatible with our laws the minister retired unwillingly from these concessions which indeed authorized the exercise of powers very offensive in a free state after much discussion it was reformed in a considerable degree and the convention was signed by the count montmorin and myself on the   th of nov    not indeed such as i would have wished but such as could be obtained with good humor  friendship  on my return from holland i had found paris still in high fermentation as i had left it had the archbishop on the close of the assembly of notables immediately carried into operation the measures contemplated it was believed they would all have been registered by the parliament but he was slow presented his edicts one after another  at considerable intervals of time which gave time for the feelings excited by the proceedings of the notables to cool off new claims to be advanced and a pressure     to arise for a fixed constitution not subject to changes at the will of the king nor should we wonder at this pressure when we consider the monstrous abuses of power under which this people were ground to powder when we pass in review the weight of their taxes and inequality of their distribution the oppressions of the tythes of the tailles the corvées the gabelles the farms  barriers the shackles on commerce by monopolies on industry by gilds  corporations on the freedom of conscience of thought and of speech on the press by the censure and of person by lettres de cachet the cruelty of the criminal code generally the atrocities of the rack the venality of judges and their partialities to the rich the monopoly of military honors by the noblesse the enormous expenses of the queen the princes  the court the prodigalities of pensions  the riches luxury indolence  immorality of the clergy surely under such a mass of misrule and oppression a people might justly press for a thoro reformation and might even dismount their roughshod riders  leave them to walk on their own legs the edicts relative to the corvées  free circulation of grain were first presented to the parliament and registered but those for the impôt territorial  stamp tax offered some time after were refused by the parliament which proposed a call of the states general as alone competent to their authorization their refusal produced a bed of justice and their exile to troyes the advocates however refusing to attend them a suspension in the administration of justice took place     the parliament held out for awhile but the ennui of their exile and absence from paris begun at length to be felt and some dispositions for compromise to appear on their consent therefore to prolong some of the former taxes they were recalled from exile the king met them in session nov       promised to call the states general in the year    and a majority expressed their assent to register an edict for successive and annual loans from      to    but a protest being entered by the duke of orleans and this encouraging others in a disposition to retract the king ordered peremptorily the registry of the edict and left the assembly abruptly the parliament immediately protested that the votes for the enregistry had not been legally taken and that they gave no sanction to the loans proposed this was enough to discredit and defeat them hereupon issued another edict for the establishment of a cour plenière and the suspension of all the parliaments in the kingdom this being opposed as might be expected by reclamations from all the parliaments  provinces the king gave way and by an edict of july      renounced his cour plenière  promised the states general for the  st of may of the ensuing year and the archbishop finding the times beyond his faculties accepted the promise of a cardinals hat was removed sep    from the ministry and mr necker was called to the department of finance the innocent rejoicings of the people of paris on this change provoked the interference of an officer of the city guards whose order for their dispersion not being obeyed he charged them with fixed bayonets   0 killed two or three and wounded many this dispersed them for the moment but they collected the next day in great numbers burnt  0 or    guard houses killed two or three of the guards  lost   or   more of their own number the city was hereupon put under martial law and after awhile the tumult subsided the effect of this change of ministers and the promise of the states general at an early day tranquillized the nation but two great questions now occurred   what proportion shall the number of deputies of the tiers etat bear to those of the nobles and clergy and   shall they sit in the same or in distinct apartments mr necker desirous of avoiding himself these knotty questions proposed a second call of the same notables and that their advice should be asked on the subject they met nov      and by five bureaux against one they recommended the forms of the states general of      wherein the houses were separate and voted by orders not by persons but the whole nation declaring at once against this and that the tiers etat should be in numbers equal to both the other orders and the parliament deciding for the same proportion it was determined so to be by a declaration of dec       a report of mr necker to the king of about the same date contained other very important concessions   that the king could neither lay a new tax nor prolong an old one   it expressed a readiness to agree on the periodical meeting of the states   to consult on the necessary restriction on letters de cachet and   how far the press might be made free   it admits that     the states are to appropriate the public money and   that ministers shall be responsible for public expenditures and these concessions came from the very heart of the king he had not a wish but for the good of the nation and for that object no personal sacrifice would ever have cost him a moments regret but his mind was weakness itself his constitution timid his judgment null and without sufficient firmness even to stand by the faith of his word his queen too haughty and bearing no contradiction had an absolute ascendency over him and around her were rallied the kings brother dartois the court generally and the aristocratic part of his ministers particularly breteuil broglio vauguyon foulon luzerne men whose principles of government were those of the age of louis xiv against this host the good counsels of necker montmorin st priest altho in unison with the wishes of the king himself were of little avail the resolutions of the morning formed under their advice would be reversed in the evening by the influence of the queen  court but the hand of heaven weighed heavily indeed on the machinations of this junto producing collateral incidents not arising out of the case yet powerfully coexciting the nation to force a regeneration of its government and overwhelming with accumulated difficulties this liberticide resistance for while laboring under the want of money for even ordinary purposes in a government which required a million of livres a day and driven to the last ditch by the universal call for liberty there came on a winter of such severe cold as was without     example in the memory of man or in the written records of history the mercury was at times  0° below the freezing point of fahrenheit and   ° below that of reaumur all outdoor labor was suspended and the poor without the wages of labor were of course without either bread or fuel the government found its necessities aggravated by that of procuring immense quantities of firewood and of keeping great fires at all the crossstreets around which the people gathered in crowds to avoid perishing with cold bread too was to be bought and distributed daily gratis until a relaxation of the season should enable the people to work and the slender stock of breadstuff had for some time threatened famine and had raised that article to an enormous price so great indeed was the scarcity of bread that from the highest to the lowest citizen the bakers were permitted to deal but a scanty allowance per head even to those who paid for it and in cards of invitation to dine in the richest houses the guest was notified to bring his own bread to eke out the existence of the people every person who had the means was called on for a weekly subscription which the curés collected and employed in providing messes for the nourishment of the poor and vied with each other in devising such economical compositions of food as would subsist the greatest number with the smallest means this want of bread had been foreseen for some time past and m de montmorin had desired me to notify it in america and that in addition to the market price a premium should be given on what should be brought from     the u s notice was accordingly given and produced considerable supplies subsequent information made the importations from america during the months of march april  may into the atlantic ports of france amount to about   000 barrels of flour besides what went to other ports and in other months while our supplies to their westindian islands relieved them also from that drain this distress for bread continued till july hitherto no acts of popular violence had been produced by the struggle for political reformation little riots on ordinary incidents had taken place as at other times in different parts of the kingdom in which some lives perhaps a dozen or twenty had been lost but in the month of april a more serious one occurred in paris unconnected indeed with the revolutionary principle but making part of the history of the day the fauxbourg st antoine is a quarter of the city inhabited entirely by the class of daylaborers and journeymen in every line a rumor was spread among them that a great paper manufacturer of the name of reveillon had proposed on some occasion that their wages should be lowered to    sous a day inflamed at once into rage  without inquiring into its truth they flew to his house in vast numbers destroyed everything in it and in his magazines  work shops without secreting however a pins worth to themselves and were continuing this work of devastation when the regular troops were called in admonitions being disregarded they were of necessity fired on and a regular action ensued in which about  00 of them     were killed before the rest would disperse there had rarely passed a year without such a riot in some part or other of the kingdom and this is distinguished only as cotemporary with the revolution altho not produced by it the states general were opened on the  th of may    by speeches from the king the garde des sceaux lamoignon and mr necker the last was thought to trip too lightly over the constitutional reformations which were expected his notices of them in this speech were not as full as in his previous rapport au roi this was observed to his disadvantage but much allowance should have been made for the situation in which he was placed between his own counsels and those of the ministers and party of the court overruled in his own opinions compelled to deliver and to gloss over those of his opponents and even to keep their secrets he could not come forward in his own attitude the composition of the assembly altho equivalent on the whole to what had been expected was something different in its elements it had been supposed that a superior education would carry into the scale of the commons a respectable portion of the noblesse it did so as to those of paris of its vicinity and of the other considerable cities whose greater intercourse with enlightened society had liberalized their minds and prepared them to advance up to the measure of the times but the noblesse of the country which constituted two thirds of that body were far in their rear residing constantly on their patrimonial feuds and familiarized     by daily habit with seigneurial powers and practices they had not yet learned to suspect their inconsistence with reason and right they were willing to submit to equality of taxation but not to descend from their rank and prerogatives to be incorporated in session with the tiers etat among the clergy on the other hand it had been apprehended that the higher orders of the hierarchy by their wealth and connections would have carried the elections generally but it proved that in most cases the lower clergy had obtained the popular majorities these consisted of the curés sons of the peasantry who had been employed to do all the drudgery of parochial services for  0  0 or  0 louis a year while their superiors were consuming their princely revenues in palaces of luxury  indolence the objects for which this body was convened being of the first order of importance i felt it very interesting to understand the views of the parties of which it was composed and especially the ideas prevalent as to the organization contemplated for their government i went therefore daily from paris to versailles and attended their debates generally till the hour of adjournment those of the noblesse were impassioned and tempestuous they had some able men on both sides and actuated by equal zeal the debates of the commons were temperate rational and inflexibly firm as preliminary to all other business the awful questions came on shall the states sit in one or in distinct apartments and shall they vote by heads or houses the opposition was soon found to consist of the episcopal     order among the clergy and two thirds of the noblesse while the tiers etat were to a man united and determined after various propositions of compromise had failed the commons undertook to cut the gordian knot the abbe sieyes the most logical head of the nation author of the pamphlet quest ce que le tiers etat which had electrified that country as paines common sense did us after an impressive speech on the  0th of june moved that a last invitation should be sent to the nobles and clergy to attend in the hall of the states collectively or individually for the verification of powers to which the commons would proceed immediately either in their presence or absence this verification being finished a motion was made on the   th that they should constitute themselves a national assembly which was decided on the   th by a majority of four fifths during the debates on this question about twenty of the curés had joined them and a proposition was made in the chamber of the clergy that their whole body should join them this was rejected at first by a small majority only but being afterwards somewhat modified it was decided affirmatively by a majority of eleven while this was under debate and unknown to the court to wit on the   th a council was held in the afternoon at marly wherein it was proposed that the king should interpose by a declaration of his sentiments in a seance royale a form of declaration was proposed by necker which while it censured in general the proceedings both of the nobles and commons announced the kings views such as substantially     to coincide with the commons it was agreed to in council the seance was fixed for the   d the meetings of the states were till then to be suspended and everything in the meantime kept secret the members the next morning  0th repairing to their house as usual found the doors shut and guarded a proclamation posted up for a seance royale on the   d and a suspension of their meetings in the meantime concluding that their dissolution was now to take place they repaired to a building called the jeu de paume or tennis court and there bound themselves by oath to each other never to separate of their own accord till they had settled a constitution for the nation on a solid basis and if separated by force that they would reassemble in some other place the next day they met in the church of st louis and were joined by a majority of the clergy the heads of the aristocracy saw that all was lost without some bold exertion the king was still at marly nobody was permitted to approach him but their friends he was assailed by falsehoods in all shapes he was made to believe that the commons were about to absolve the army from their oath of fidelity to him and to raise their pay the court party were now all rage and desperate they procured a committee to be held consisting of the king and his ministers to which monsieur  the count d artois should be admitted at this committee the latter attacked mr necker personally arraigned his declaration and proposed one which some of his prompters had put into his hands mr necker was browbeaten and intimidated and the     king shaken he determined that the two plans should be deliberated on the next day and the seance royale put off a day longer this encouraged a fiercer attack on mr necker the next day his draught of a declaration was entirely broken up  that of the count dartois inserted into it himself and montmorin offered their resignation which was refused the count dartois saying to mr necker no sir you must be kept as the hostage we hold you responsible for all the ill which shall happen this change of plan was immediately whispered without doors the noblesse were in triumph the people in consternation i was quite alarmed at this state of things the soldiery had not yet indicated which side they should take and that which they should support would be sure to prevail i considered a successful reformation of government in france as ensuring a general reformation thro europe and the resurrection to a new life of their people now ground to dust by the abuses of the governing powers i was much acquainted with the leading patriots of the assembly being from a country which had successfully passed thro a similar reformation they were disposed to my acquaintance and had some confidence in me i urged most strenuously an immediate compromise to secure what the government was now ready to yield and trust to future occasions for what might still be wanting it was well understood that the king would grant at this time   freedom of the person by habeas corpus   freedom of conscience   freedom of the press   trial by jury   a representative     legislature   annual meetings   the origination of laws   the exclusive right of taxation and appropriation and   the responsibility of ministers and with the exercise of these powers they would obtain in future whatever might be further necessary to improve and preserve their constitution they thought otherwise however and events have proved their lamentable error for after  0 years of war foreign and domestic the loss of millions of lives the prostration of private happiness and foreign subjugation of their own country for a time they have obtained no more nor even that securely they were unconscious of for who could foresee the melancholy sequel of their wellmeant perseverance that their physical force would be usurped by a first tyrant to trample on the independance and even the existence of other nations that this would afford fatal example for the atrocious conspiracy of kings against their people would generate their unholy and homicide alliance to make common cause among themselves and to crush by the power of the whole the efforts of any part to moderate their abuses and oppressions when the king passed the next day thro the lane formed from the chateau to the hotel des etats there was a dead silence he was about an hour in the house delivering his speech  declaration on his coming out a feeble cry of vive le roy was raised by some children but the people remained silent  sullen in the close of his speech he had ordered that the members should follow him  resume their deliberations the next day the   0 noblesse followed him and so did the clergy except about thirty who with the tiers remained in the room and entered into deliberation they protested against what the king had done adhered to all their former proceedings and resolved the inviolability of their own persons an officer came to order them out of the room in the kings name tell those who sent you said mirabeau that we shall not move hence but at our own will or the point of the bayonet in the afternoon the people uneasy began to assemble in great numbers in the courts and vicinities of the palace this produced alarm the queen sent for mr necker he was conducted amidst the shouts and acclamations of the multitude who filled all the apartments of the palace he was a few minutes only with the queen and what passed between them did not transpire the king went out to ride he passed thro the crowd to his carriage and into it without being in the least noticed as mr neckar followed him universal acclamations were raised of vive monsr neckar vive le sauveur de la france opprimée he was conducted back to his house with the same demonstrations of affection and anxiety about  00 deputies of the tiers catching the enthusiasm of the moment went to his house and extorted from him a promise that he would not resign on the   th    of the nobles joined the tiers  among them the d of orleans there were then with them     members of the clergy altho the minority of that body still sat apart  called themselves the chamber of the clergy on the   th the archbp of paris joined     the tiers as did some others of the clergy and of the noblesse these proceedings had thrown the people into violent ferment it gained the souldiery first of the french guards extended to those of every other denomination except the swiss and even to the body guards of the king they began to quit their barracks to assemble in squads to declare they would defend the life of the king but would not be the murderers of their fellowcitizens they called themselves the souldiers of the nation and left now no doubt on which side they would be in case of rupture similar accounts came in from the troops in other parts of the kingdom giving good reason to believe they would side with their fathers and brothers rather than with their officers the operation of this medicine at versailles was as sudden as it was powerful the alarm there was so compleat that in the afternoon of the   th the king wrote with his own hand letters to the presidents of the clergy and nobles engaging them immediately to join the tiers these two bodies were debating  hesitating when notes from the ct d artois decided their compliance they went in a body and took their seats with the tiers and thus rendered the union of the orders in one chamber compleat the assembly now entered on the business of their mission and first proceeded to arrange the order in which they would take up the heads of their constitution as follows first and as preliminary to the whole a general declaration of the rights of man then specifically     the principles of the monarchy rights of the nation rights of the king rights of the citizens organization  rights of the national assembly forms necessary for the enactment of laws organization  functions of the provincial  municipal assemblies duties and limits of the judiciary power functions  duties of the military power a declaration of the rights of man as the preliminary of their work was accordingly prepared and proposed by the marquis de la fayette but the quiet of their march was soon disturbed by information that troops and particularly the foreign troops were advancing on paris from various quarters the king had been probably advised to this on the pretext of preserving peace in paris but his advisers were believed to have other things in contemplation the marshal de broglio was appointed to their command a high flying aristocrat cool and capable of everything some of the french guards were soon arrested under other pretexts but really on account of their dispositions in favor of the national cause the people of paris forced their prison liberated them and sent a deputation to the assembly to solicit a pardon the assembly recommended peace and order to the people of paris the prisoners to the king and asked from him the removal of the troops his answer was negative and dry saying they might remove themselves if they pleased to noyons or soissons in the meantime these troops to the number of twenty or thirty thousand had arrived and were posted in and between paris and versailles the bridges and passes were     guarded at three oclock in the afternoon of the   th july the count de la luzerne was sent to notify mr neckar of his dismission and to enjoin him to retire instantly without saying a word of it to anybody he went home dined and proposed to his wife a visit to a friend but went in fact to his country house at st ouen and at midnight set out for brussels this was not known till the next day   th when the whole ministry was changed except villedeuil of the domestic department and barenton garde des sceaux the changes were as follows the baron de breteuil president of the council of finance de la galaisiere comptroller general in the room of mr neckar the marshal de broglio minister of war  foulon under him in the room of puysegur the duke de la vauguyon minister of foreign affairs instead of the ct de montmorin de la porte minister of marine in place of the ct de la luzerne st priest was also removed from the council luzerne and puysegur had been strongly of the aristocratic party in the council but they were not considered as equal to the work now to be done the king was now compleatly in the hands of men the principal among whom had been noted thro their lives for the turkish despotism of their characters and who were associated around the king as proper instruments for what was to be executed the news of this change began to be known at paris about   or   oclock in the afternoon a body of about  00 german cavalry were advanced and drawn up in the place louis xv and about  00 swiss posted at a little distance in their rear this drew people to the     spot who thus accidentally found themselves in front of the troops merely at first as spectators but as their numbers increased their indignation rose they retired a few steps and posted themselves on and behind large piles of stones large and small collected in that place for a bridge which was to be built adjacent to it in this position happening to be in my carriage on a visit i passed thro the lane they had formed without interruption but the moment after i had passed the people attacked the cavalry with stones they charged but the advantageous position of the people and the showers of stones obliged the horse to retire and quit the field altogether leaving one of their number on the ground  the swiss in their rear not moving to their aid this was the signal for universal insurrection and this body of cavalry to avoid being massacred retired towards versailles the people now armed themselves with such weapons as they could find in armorers shops and private houses and with bludgeons and were roaming all night thro all parts of the city without any decided object the next day   th the assembly pressed on the king to send away the troops to permit the bourgeosie of paris to arm for the preservation of order in the city and offered to send a deputation from their body to tranquillize them but their propositions were refused a committee of magistrates and electors of the city are appointed by those bodies to take upon them its government the people now openly joined by the french guards force the prison of st lazare release all the prisoners and take a great     store of corn which they carry to the cornmarket here they get some arms and the french guards begin to form  train them the citycommittee determined to raise   000 bourgeoise or rather to restrain their numbers to   000 on the   th they send one of their members mons de corny to the hotel des invalides to ask arms for their gardebourgeoise he was followed by and he found there a great collection of people the governor of the invalids came out and represented the impossibility of his delivering arms without the orders of those from whom he received them de corny advised the people then to retire and retired himself but the people took possession of the arms it was remarkable that not only the invalids themselves made no opposition but that a body of  000 foreign troops within  00 yards never stirred m de corny and five others were then sent to ask arms of m de launay governor of the bastile they found a great collection of people already before the place and they immediately planted a flag of truce which was answered by a like flag hoisted on the parapet the deputation prevailed on the people to fall back a little advanced themselves to make their demand of the governor and in that instant a discharge from the bastile killed four persons of those nearest to the deputies the deputies retired i happened to be at the house of m de corny when he returned to it and received from him a narrative of these transactions on the retirement of the deputies the people rushed forward  almost in an instant were in possession of a fortification defended by  00     men of infinite strength which in other times had stood several regular sieges and had never been taken how they forced their entrance has never been explained they took all the arms discharged the prisoners and such of the garrison as were not killed in the first moment of fury carried the governor and lt governor to the place de grève the place of public execution cut off their heads and sent them thro the city in triumph to the palais royal about the same instant a treacherous correspondence having been discovered in m de flesselles prevot des marchands they seized him in the hotel de ville where he was in the execution of his office and cut off his head these events carried imperfectly to versailles were the subject of two successive deputations from the assembly to the king to both of which he gave dry and hard answers for nobody had as yet been permitted to inform him truly and fully of what had passed at paris but at night the duke de liancourt forced his way into the kings bed chamber and obliged him to hear a full and animated detail of the disasters of the day in paris he went to bed fearfully impressed the decapitation of de launai worked powerfully thro the night on the whole aristocratic party insomuch that in the morning those of the greatest influence on the count dartois represented to him the absolute necessity that the king should give up everything to the assembly this according with the dispositions of the king he went about    oclock accompanied only by his brothers to the assembly  there read to them a speech in which he asked their interposition     to reestablish order altho couched in terms of some caution yet the manner in which it was delivered made it evident that it was meant as a surrender at discretion he returned to the chateau afoot accompanied by the assembly they sent off a deputation to quiet paris at the head of which was the marquis de la fayette who had the same morning been named commandant en chef of the milice bourgeoise and mons bailly former president of the states general was called for as prevot des marchands the demolition of the bastile was now ordered and begun a body of the swiss guards of the regiment of ventimille and the city horse guards joined the people the alarm at versailles increased the foreign troops were ordered off instantly every minister resigned the king confirmed bailly as prevot des marchands wrote to mr neckar to recall him sent his letter open to the assembly to be forwarded by them and invited them to go with him to paris the next day to satisfy the city of his dispositions and that night and the next morning the count dartois and m de montesson a deputy connected with him madame de polignac madame de guiche and the count de vaudreuil favorites of the queen the abbe de vermont her confessor the prince of condé and duke of bourbon fled the king came to paris leaving the queen in consternation for his return omitting the less important figures of the procession the kings carriage was in the center on each side of it the assembly in two ranks afoot at their head the m de la fayette as commanderinchief on horseback and bourgeois     guards before and behind about  0000 citizens of all forms and conditions armed with the muskets of the bastile and invalids as far as they would go the rest with pistols swords pikes pruning hooks scythes c lined all the streets thro which the procession passed and with the crowds of people in the streets doors  windows saluted them everywhere with cries of vive la nation but not a single vive le roy was heard the king landed at the hotel de ville there m bailly presented and put into his hat the popular cockade and addressed him the king being unprepared and unable to answer bailly went to him gathered from him some scraps of sentences and made out an answer which he delivered to the audience as from the king on their return the popular cries were vive le roy et la nation he was conducted by a garde bourgeoise to his palace at versailles  thus concluded an amende honorable as no sovereign ever made and no people ever received and here again was lost another precious occasion of sparing to france the crimes and cruelties thro which she has since passed and to europe  finally america the evils which flowed on them also from this mortal source the king was now become a passive machine in the hands of the national assembly and had he been left to himself he would have willingly acquiesced in whatever they should devise as best for the nation a wise constitution would have been formed hereditary in his line himself placed at its head with powers so large as to enable him to do all the good of his station and so limited     as to restrain him from its abuse this he would have faithfully administered and more than this i do not believe he ever wished but he had a queen of absolute sway over his weak mind and timid virtue and of a character the reverse of his in all points this angel as gaudily painted in the rhapsodies of the rhetor burke with some smartness of fancy but no sound sense was proud disdainful of restraint indignant at all obstacles to her will eager in the pursuit of pleasure and firm enough to hold to her desires or perish in their wreck her inordinate gambling and dissipations with those of the count dartois and others of her clique had been a sensible item in the exhaustion of the treasury which called into action the reforming hand of the nation and her opposition to it her inflexible perverseness and dauntless spirit led herself to the guillotine  drew the king on with her and plunged the world into crimes  calamities which will forever stain the pages of modern history i have ever believed that had there been no queen there would have been no revolution no force would have been provoked nor exercised the king would have gone hand in hand with the wisdom of his sounder counsellors who guided by the increased lights of the age wished only with the same pace to advance the principles of their social institution the deed which closed the mortal course of these sovereigns i shall neither approve nor condemn i am not prepared to say that the first magistrate of a nation cannot commit treason against his country or is unamenable to its punishment nor yet that where there is no written   0 law no regulated tribunal there is not a law in our hearts and a power in our hands given for righteous employment in maintaining right and redressing wrong of those who judged the king many thought him wilfully criminal many that his existence would keep the nation in perpetual conflict with the horde of kings who would war against a regeneration which might come home to themselves and that it were better that one should die than all i should not have voted with this portion of the legislature i should have shut up the queen in a convent putting harm out of her power and placed the king in his station investing him with limited powers which i verily believe he would have honestly exercised according to the measure of his understanding in this way no void would have been created courting the usurpation of a military adventurer nor occasion given for those enormities which demoralized the nations of the world and destroyed and is yet to destroy millions and millions of its inhabitants there are three epochs in history signalized by the total extinction of national morality the first was of the successors of alexander not omitting himself the next the successors of the first cæsar the third our own age this was begun by the partition of poland followed by that of the treaty of pilnitz next the conflagration of copenhagen then the enormities of bonaparte partitioning the earth at his will and devastating it with fire and sword now the conspiracy of kings the successors of bonaparte blasphemously calling themselves the holy alliance and treading in the footsteps of their incarcerated     leader not yet indeed usurping the government of other nations avowedly and in detail but controuling by their armies the forms in which they will permit them to be governed and reserving in petto the order and extent of the usurpations further meditated but i will return from a digression anticipated too in time into which i have been led by reflection on the criminal passions which refused to the world a favorable occasion of saving it from the afflictions it has since suffered m necker had reached basle before he was overtaken by the letter of the king inviting him back to resume the office he had recently left he returned immediately and all the other ministers having resigned a new administration was named to wit st priest  montmorin were restored the archbishop of bordeaux was appointed garde des sceaux la tour du pin minister of war la luzerne minister of marine this last was believed to have been effected by the friendship of montmorin for altho differing in politics they continued firm in friendship  luzerne altho not an able man was thought an honest one and the prince of bauvau was taken into the council seven princes of the blood royal six exministers and many of the high noblesse having fled and the present ministers except luzerne being all of the popular party all the functionaries of government moved for the present in perfect harmony in the evening of aug   and on the motion of the viscount de noailles brother in law of la fayette the assembly abolished all titles of rank all the     abusive privileges of feudalism the tythes and casuals of the clergy all provincial privileges and in fine the feudal regimen generally to the suppression of tythes the abbe sieyes was vehemently opposed but his learned and logical arguments were unheeded and his estimation lessened by a contrast of his egoism for he was beneficed on them with the generous abandonment of rights by the other members of the assembly many days were employed in putting into the form of laws the numerous demolitions of ancient abuses which done they proceeded to the preliminary work of a declaration of rights there being much concord of sentiment on the elements of this instrument it was liberally framed and passed with a very general approbation they then appointed a committee for the reduction of a projet of a constitution at the head of which was the archbishop of bordeaux i received from him as chairman of the committee a letter of july  0 requesting me to attend and assist at their deliberations but i excused myself on the obvious considerations that my mission was to the king as chief magistrate of the nation that my duties were limited to the concerns of my own country and forbade me to intermeddle with the internal transactions of that in which i had been received under a specific character only their plan of a constitution was discussed in sections and so reported from time to time as agreed to by the committee the first respected the general frame of the government and that this should be formed into three departments executive legislative and judiciary was generally agreed but     when they proceeded to subordinate developments many and various shades of opinion came into conflict and schism strongly marked broke the patriots into fragments of very discordant principles the first question whether there should be a king met with no open opposition and it was readily agreed that the government of france should be monarchical  hereditary shall the king have a negative on the laws shall that negative be absolute or suspensive only shall there be two chambers of legislation or one only if two shall one of them be hereditary or for life or for a fixed term and named by the king or elected by the people these questions found strong differences of opinion and produced repulsive combinations among the patriots the aristocracy was cemented by a common principle of preserving the ancient regime or whatever should be nearest to it making this their polar star they moved in phalanx gave preponderance on every question to the minorities of the patriots and always to those who advocated the least change the features of the new constitution were thus assuming a fearful aspect and great alarm was produced among the honest patriots by these dissensions in their ranks in this uneasy state of things i received one day a note from the marquis de la fayette informing me that he should bring a party of six or eight friends to ask a dinner of me the next day i assured him of their welcome when they arrived they were la fayette himself duport barnave alexander la meth blacon mounier maubourg and dagout these were leading patriots     of honest but differing opinions sensible of the necessity of effecting a coalition by mutual sacrifices knowing each other and not afraid therefore to unbosom themselves mutually this last was a material principle in the selection with this view the marquis had invited the conference and had fixed the time  place inadvertently as to the embarrassment under which it might place me the cloth being removed and wine set on the table after the american manner the marquis introduced the objects of the conference by summarily reminding them of the state of things in the assembly the course which the principles of the constitution were taking and the inevitable result unless checked by more concord among the patriots themselves he observed that altho he also had his opinion he was ready to sacrifice it to that of his brethren of the same cause but that a common opinion must now be formed or the aristocracy would carry everything and that whatever they should now agree on he at the head of the national force would maintain the discussions began at the hour of four and were continued till ten oclock in the evening during which time i was a silent witness to a coolness and candor of argument unusual in the conflicts of political opinion to a logical reasoning and chaste eloquence disfigured by no gaudy tinsel of rhetoric or declamation and truly worthy of being placed in parallel with the finest dialogues of antiquity as handed to us by xenophon by plato and cicero the result was an agreement that the king should have a suspensive veto on the laws that the legislature should be composed     of a single body only  that to be chosen by the people this concordate decided the fate of the constitution the patriots all rallied to the principles thus settled carried every question agreeably to them and reduced the aristocracy to insignificance and impotence but duties of exculpation were now incumbent on me i waited on count montmorin the next morning and explained to him with truth and candor how it had happened that my house had been made the scene of conferences of such a character he told me he already knew everything which had passed that so far from taking umbrage at the use made of my house on that occasion he earnestly wished i would habitually assist at such conferences being sure i should be useful in moderating the warmer spirits and promoting a wholesome and practicable reformation only i told him i knew too well the duties i owed to the king to the nation and to my own country to take any part in councils concerning their internal government and that i should persevere with care in the character of a neutral and passive spectator with wishes only and very sincere ones that those measures might prevail which would be for the greatest good of the nation i have no doubt indeed that this conference was previously known and approved by this honest minister who was in confidence and communication with the patriots and wished for a reasonable reform of the constitution here i discontinue my relation of the french revolution the minuteness with which i have so far given its details is disproportioned to the general     scale of my narrative but i have thought it justified by the interest which the whole world must take in this revolution as yet we are but in the first chapter of its history the appeal to the rights of man which had been made in the u s was taken up by france first of the european nations from her the spirit has spread over those of the south the tyrants of the north have allied indeed against it but it is irresistible their opposition will only multiply its millions of human victims their own satellites will catch it and the condition of man thro the civilized world will be finally and greatly ameliorated this is a wonderful instance of great events from small causes so inscrutable is the arrangement of causes  consequences in this world that a twopenny duty on tea unjustly imposed in a sequestered part of it changes the condition of all its inhabitants i have been more minute in relating the early transactions of this regeneration because i was in circumstances peculiarly favorable for a knowledge of the truth possessing the confidence and intimacy of the leading patriots  more than all of the marquis fayette their head and atlas who had no secrets from me i learnt with correctness the views  proceedings of that party while my intercourse with the diplomatic missionaries of europe at paris all of them with the court and eager in prying into its councils and proceedings gave me a knolege of these also my information was always and immediately committed to writing in letters to mr jay and often to my friends and a recurrence to these letters now insures me against errors of memory     these opportunities of information ceased at this period with my retirement from this interesting scene of action i had been more than a year soliciting leave to go home with a view to place my daughters in the society  care of their friends and to return for a short time to my station at paris but the metamorphosis thro which our government was then passing from its chrysalid to its organic form suspended its action in a great degree and it was not till the last of august that i received the permission i had asked—and here i cannot leave this great and good country without expressing my sense of its preeminence of character among the nations of the earth a more benevolent people i have never known nor greater warmth  devotedness in their select friendships their kindness and accommodation to strangers is unparalleled and the hospitality of paris is beyond anything i had conceived to be practicable in a large city their eminence too in science the communicative dispositions of their scientific men the politeness of the general manners the ease and vivacity of their conversation give a charm to their society to be found nowhere else in a comparison of this with other countries we have the proof of primacy which was given to themistocles after the battle of salamis every general voted to himself the first reward of valor and the second to themistocles so ask the travelled inhabitant of any nation in what country on earth would you rather live—certainly in my own where are all my friends my relations and the earliest  sweetest affections and recollections of my life which would be your second choice france     on the   th of sep i left paris for havre where i was detained by contrary winds until the  th of oct on that day and the  th i crossed over to cowes where i had engaged the clermont capt colley to touch for me she did so but here again we were detained by contrary winds until the   d when we embarked and landed at norfolk on the   d of november on my way home i passed some days at eppington in chesterfield the residence of my friend and connection mr eppes and while there i received a letter from the president genl washington by express covering an appointment to be secretary of state i received it with real regret my wish had been to return to paris where i had left my household establishment as if there myself and to see the end of the revolution which i then thought would be certainly and happily closed in less than a year i then meant to return home to withdraw from political life into which i had been impresed by the circumstances of the times to sink into the bosom of my family and friends and devote myself to studies more congenial to my mind in my answer of dec    i expressed these dispositions candidly to the president and my preference of a return to paris but assured him that if it was believed i could be more useful in the administration of the government i would sacrifice my own inclinations without hesitation and repair to that destination this i left to his decision i arrived at monticello on the   d of dec where i received a second letter from the president expressing his continued wish that i should take my station there but leaving me still at liberty to continue     in my former office if i could not reconcile myself to that now proposed this silenced my reluctance and i accepted the new appointment in the interval of my stay at home my eldest daughter had been happily married to the eldest son  of the tuckahoe branch of randolphs a young gentleman of genius science and honorable mind who afterwards filled a dignified station in the general government  the most dignified in his own state i left monticello on the  st of march    0 for new york at philadelphia i called on the venerable and beloved franklin he was then on the bed of sickness from which he never rose my recent return from a country in which he had left so many friends and the perilous convulsions to which they had been exposed revived all his anxieties to know what part they had taken what had been their course and what their fate he went over all in succession with a rapidity and animation almost too much for his strength when all his inquiries were satisfied and a pause took place i told him i had learnt with much pleasure that since his return to america he had been occupied in preparing for the world the history of his own life i cannot say much of that said he but i will give you a sample of what i shall leave and he directed his little grandson william bache who was standing by the bedside to hand him a paper from the table to which he pointed he did so and the doctr putting it into my hands desired me to take it and read it at my leisure it was about a quire of folio paper written in a large and running   0 hand very like his own i looked into it slightly then shut it and said i would accept his permission to read it and would carefully return it he said no keep it not certain of his meaning i again looked into it folded it for my pocket and said again i would certainly return it no said he keep it i put it into my pocket and shortly after took leave of him he died on the   th of the ensuing month of april and as i understood that he had bequeathed all his papers to his grandson william temple franklin i immediately wrote to mr franklin to inform him i possessed this paper which i should consider as his property and would deliver to his order he came on immediately to new york called on me for it and i delivered it to him as he put it into his pocket he said carelessly he had either the original or another copy of it i do not recollect which this last expression struck my attention forcibly and for the first time suggested to me the thought that dr franklin had meant it as a confidential deposit in my hands and that i had done wrong in parting from it i have not yet seen the collection he published of dr franklins works  and therefore know not if this is among them i have been told it is not it contained a narrative of the negotiations between dr franklin and the british ministry when he was endeavoring to prevent the contest of arms which followed the negotiation was brought about by the intervention of ld howe and his sister who i believe was called lady howe but i may misremember her title ld howe seems     to have been friendly to america and exceedingly anxious to prevent a rupture his intimacy with dr franklin and his position with the ministry induced him to undertake a mediation between them in which his sister seemed to have been associated they carried from one to the other backwards and forwards the several propositions and answers which past and seconded with their own intercessions the importance of mutual sacrifices to preserve the peace  connection of the two countries i remember that ld norths answers were dry unyielding in the spirit of unconditional submission and betrayed an absolute indifference to the occurrence of a rupture and he said to the mediators distinctly at last that a rebellion was not to be deprecated on the part of great britain that the confiscations it would produce would provide for many of their friends  this expression was reported by the mediators to dr franklin and indicated so cool and calculated a purpose in the ministry as to render compromise hopeless and the negotiation was discontinued if this is not among the papers published we ask what has become of it i delivered it with my own hands into those of temple franklin it certainly established views so atrocious in the british government that its suppression would to them be worth a great price but could the grandson of dr franklin be in such degree an accomplice in the parricide of the memory of his immortal grandfather the suspension for more than  0 years of the general publication     bequeathed and confided to him produced for awhile hard suspicions against him and if at last all are not published a part of these suspicions may remain with some i arrived at new york on the   st of mar where congress was in session so far july           the anas      –  0  explanations of the   volumes bound in marbled paper in these   vols will be found copies of the official opinions given in writing by me to genl washington while i was secretary of state with sometimes the documents belonging to the case some of these are the rough draughts some presscopies some fair ones in the earlier part of my acting in that office i took no other note of the passing transactions but after awhile i saw the importance of doing it in aid of my memory very often therefore i made memorandums     on loose scraps of paper taken out of my pocket in the moment and laid by to be copied fair at leisure which however they hardly ever were  these scraps therefore ragged rubbed  scribbled as they were i had bound with the others by a binder who came into my cabinet did it under my own eye and without the opportunity of reading a single paper at this day after the lapse of    years or more from their dates i have given to the whole a calm revisal when the passions of the time are past away and the reasons of the transactions act alone on the judgment some of the informations i had recorded are now cut out from the rest because i have seen that they were incorrect or doubtful or merely personal or private with which we have nothing to do i should perhaps have thought the rest not worth preserving but for their testimony against the only history of that period  which pretends to have been compiled from authentic and unpublished documents could these documents all be laid open to the public eye they might be compared contrasted weighed  the truth fairly sifted out of them for we are not to suppose that every thing found among genl washingtons papers is to be taken as gospel truth facts indeed of his own writing  inditing must be believed by all who knew him and opinions which were his own merit veneration and respect     for few men have lived whose opinions were more unbiassed and correct not that it is pretended he never felt bias his passions were naturally strong but his reason generally stronger but the materials from his own pen make probably an almost insensible part of the mass of papers which fill his presses he possessed the love the veneration and confidence of all with him were deposited suspicions  certainties rumors  realities facts  falsehoods by all those who were or who wished to be thought in correspondence with him and by the many anonymi who were ashamed to put their names to their slanders from such a congeries history may be made to wear any hue with which the passions of the compiler royalist or republican may chuse to tinge it had genl washington himself written from these materials a history of the period they embrace it would have been a conspicuous monument of the integrity of his mind the soundness of his judgment and its powers of discernment between truth  falsehood principles  pretensions but the party feeling of his biographer to whom after his death the collection was confided has culled from it a composition as different from what genl washington would have offered as was the candor of the two characters during the period of the war the partiality of this pen is displayed in lavishments of praise on certain military characters who had done nothing military but who afterwards  before he wrote had become heroes in party altho not in war and in his reserve on the merits of others who rendered signal services indeed but did not earn his     praise by apostatising in peace from the republican principles for which they had fought in war it shews itself too in the cold indifference with which a struggle for the most animating of human objects is narrated no act of heroism ever kindles in the mind of this writer a single aspiration in favor of the holy cause which inspired the bosom  nerved the arm of the patriot warrior no gloom of events no lowering of prospects ever excites a fear for the issue of a contest which was to change the condition of man over the civilized globe the sufferings inflicted on endeavors to vindicate the rights of humanity are related with all the frigid insensibility with which a monk would have contemplated the victims of an auto da fé let no man believe that genl washington ever intended that his papers should be used for the suicide of the cause for which he had lived and for which there never was a moment in which he would not have died the abuse of these materials is chiefly however manifested in the history of the period immediately following the establishment of the present constitution and nearly with that my memorandums begin were a reader of this period to form his idea of it from this history alone he would suppose the republican party who were in truth endeavoring to keep the government within the line of the constitution and prevent its being monarchised in practice were a mere set of grumblers and disorganisers satisfied with no government without fixed principles of any and like a british parliamentary opposition gaping after loaves and fishes     and ready to change principles as well as position at any time with their adversaries but a short review of facts omitted or uncandidly stated in this history will shew that the contests of that day were contests of principle between the advocates of republican and those of kingly government and that had not the former made the efforts they did our government would have been even at this early day a very different thing from what the successful issue of those efforts have made it the alliance between the states under the old articles of confederation for the purpose of joint defence against the aggression of great britain was found insufficient as treaties of alliance generally are to enforce compliance with their mutual stipulations and these once fulfilled that bond was to expire of itself  each state to become sovereign and independant in all things yet it could not but occur to every one that these separate independencies like the petty states of greece would be eternally at war with each other  would become at length the mere partisans  satellites of the leading powers of europe all then must have looked forward to some further bond of union which would ensure internal peace and a political system of our own independant of that of europe whether all should be consolidated into a single government or each remain independant as to internal matters and the whole form a single nation as to what was foreign only and whether that national government should be a monarchy or republic would of course divide opinions     according to the constitutions the habits and the circumstances of each individual some officers of the army as it has always been said and believed and steuben and knox have even been named as the leading agents trained to monarchy by military habits are understood to have proposed to genl washington to decide this great question by the army before its disbandment and to assume himself the crown on the assurance of their support the indignation with which he is said to have scouted this parricid proposition was equally worthy of his virtue and his wisdom the next effort was on suggestion of the same individuals in the moment of their separation the establishment of an hereditary order under the name of the cincinnati ready prepared by that distinction to be engrafted into the future frame of government  placing genl washington still at their head the general  wrote to me on this subject while i was in congress at annapolis and an extract from my answer is inserted in   marshalls hist pa    he afterwards called on me at that place on his way to a meeting of the society and after a whole evening of consultation he left that place fully determined to use all his endeavors for its total suppression but he found it so firmly riveted in the affections of the members that strengthened as they happened to be by an adventitious occurrence of the moment he could effect no more than the abolition of its hereditary principle  he called     again on his return   explained to me fully the opposition which had been made the effect of the occurrence from france and the difficulty with which its duration had been limited to the lives of the present members further details will be found among my papers in his and my letters and some in the encyclop method dictionnaire decon politique communicated by myself to m meusnier  its author who had made the establishment of this society the ground in that work of a libel on our country the want of some authority which should procure justice to the public creditors and an observance of treaties with foreign nations produced some time after the call of a convention of the states at annapolis altho at this meeting a difference of opinion was evident on the question of a republican or kingly government yet so general thro the states was the sentiment in favor of the former that the friends of the latter confined themselves to a course of obstruction only and delay to every thing proposed they hoped that nothing being done and all things going from bad to worse a kingly government might be usurped and submitted to by the people as better than anarchy  wars internal and external the certain consequences of the present want of a general government  the effect of their manœuvres with   0 the defective attendance of deputies from the states resulted in the measure of calling a more general convention to be held at philadelphia at this the same party exhibited the same practices and with the same views of preventing a government of concord which they foresaw would be republican and of forcing thro anarchy their way to monarchy but the mass of that convention was too honest too wise and too steady to be baffled or misled by their manœuvres one of these was a form of government proposed by colo hamilton which would have been in fact a compromise between the two parties of royalism  republicanism according to this the executive  one branch of the legislature were to be during good behavior i e for life and the governors of the states were to be named by these two permanent organs this however was rejected on which hamilton left the convention as desperate  never returned again until near its final conclusion  these opinions  efforts secret or avowed of the advocates for monarchy had begotten great jealousy thro the states generally and this jealousy it was which excited the strong opposition to the conventional constitution a jealousy which yielded at last only to a general determination to establish certain amendments as barriers against a government either     monarchical or consolidated in what passed thro the whole period of these conventions i have gone on the information of those who were members of them being absent myself on my mission to france i returned from that mission in the  st year of the new government having landed in virginia in dec     proceeded to n york in march  0 to enter on the office of secretary of state here certainly i found a state of things which of all i had ever contemplated i the least expected i had left france in the first year of its revolution in the fervor of natural rights and zeal for reformation my conscientious devotion to these rights could not be heightened but it had been aroused and excited by daily exercise the president received me cordially and my colleagues  the circle of principal citizens apparently with welcome the courtesies of dinner parties given me as a stranger newly arrived among them placed me at once in their familiar society but i cannot describe the wonder and mortification with which the table conversations filled me politics were the chief topic and a preference of kingly over republican government was evidently the favorite sentiment an apostate i could not be nor yet a hypocrite and i found myself for the most part the only advocate on the republican side of the question unless among the guests there chanced to be some member of that party from the legislative houses hamiltons financial system had then past it had two objects  st as a puzzle to exclude popular understanding  inquiry  dly as a machine for the corruption of the legislature for he avowed the     opinion that man could be governed by one of two motives only force or interest force he observed in this country was out of the question and the interests therefore of the members must be laid hold of to keep the legislature in unison with the executive and with grief and shame it must be acknowledged that his machine was not without effect that even in this the birth of our government some members were found sordid enough to bend their duty to their interests and to look after personal rather than public good it is well known that during the war the greatest difficulty we encountered was the want of money or means to pay our souldiers who fought or our farmers manufacturers  merchants who furnished the necessary supplies of food  clothing for them after the expedient of paper money had exhausted itself certificates of debt were given to the individual creditors with assurance of payment so soon as the u s should be able but the distresses of these people often obliged them to part with these for the half the fifth and even a tenth of their value and speculators had made a trade of cozening them from the holders by the most fraudulent practices and persuasions that they would never be paid in the bill for funding  paying these hamilton made no difference between the original holders  the fraudulent purchasers of this paper great  just repugnance arose at putting these two classes of creditors on the same footing and great exertions were used to pay to the former the full value and to the latter the price only which he had paid with interest but this would have prevented the game     which was to be played  for which the minds of greedy members were already tutored and prepared when the trial of strength on these several efforts had indicated the form in which the bill would finally pass this being known within doors sooner than without and especially than to those who were in distant parts of the union the base scramble began couriers  relay horses by land and swift sailing pilot boats by sea were flying in all directions  active partners  agents were associated  employed in every state town and country neighborhood and this paper was bought up at   and even as low as   in the pound before the holder knew that congress had already provided for its redemption at par immense sums were thus filched from the poor  ignorant and fortunes accumulated by those who had themselves been poor enough before men thus enriched by the dexterity of a leader would follow of course the chief who was leading them to fortune and become the zealous instruments of all his enterprises this game was over and another     was on the carpet at the moment of my arrival  and to this i was most ignorantly  innocently made to hold the candle this fiscal maneuvre is well known by the name of the assumption independantly of the debts of congress the states had during the war contracted separate and heavy debts and massachusetts particularly in an absurd attempt absurdly conducted on the british post of penobscot and the more debt hamilton could rake up the more plunder for his mercenaries this money whether wisely or foolishly spent was pretended to have been spent for general purposes and ought therefore to be paid from the general purse but it was objected that nobody knew what these debts were what their amount or what their proofs no matter we will guess them to be  0 millions but of these  0 millions we do not know how much should be reimbursed to one state nor how much to another no matter we will guess and so another scramble was set on foot among the several states and some got much some little some nothing but the main object was obtained the phalanx of the treasury was reinforced by additional recruits this measure produced the most bitter  angry contests ever known in congress before or since the union of the states i arrived in the midst of it but a stranger     to the ground a stranger to the actors on it so long absent as to have lost all familiarity with the subject and as yet unaware of its object i took no concern in it the great and trying question however was lost in the h of representatives so high were the feuds excited by this subject that on its rejection business was suspended congress met and adjourned from day to day without doing any thing the parties being too much out of temper to do business together the eastern members particularly who with smith from south carolina  were the principal gamblers in these scenes threatened a secession and dissolution hamilton was in despair as i was going to the presidents one day i met him in the street he walked me backwards  forwards before the presidents door for half an hour he painted pathetically the temper into which the legislature had been wrought the disgust of those who were called the creditor states the danger of the secession of their members and the separation of the states he observed that the members of the administration ought to act in concert that tho this question was not of my department yet a common duty should make it a common concern that the president was the center on which all administrative questions ultimately rested and that all of us should rally around him and support with joint efforts measures approved by him and that the question having been lost by a small majority only it was     probable that an appeal from me to the judgment and discretion of some of my friends might effect a change in the vote and the machine of government now suspended might be again set into motion i told him that i was really a stranger to the whole subject not having yet informed myself of the system of finances adopted i knew not how far this was a necessary sequence that undoubtedly if its rejection endangered a dissolution of our union at this incipient stage i should deem that the most unfortunate of all consequences to avert which all partial and temporary evils should be yielded i proposed to him however to dine with me the next day and i would invite another friend or two bring them into conference together and i thought it impossible that reasonable men consulting together coolly could fail by some mutual sacrifices of opinion to form a compromise which was to save the union the discussion took place i could take no part in it but an exhortatory one because i was a stranger to the circumstances which should govern it but it was finally agreed that whatever importance had been attached to the rejection of this proposition the preservation of the union  of concord among the states was more important and that therefore it would be better that the vote of rejection should be rescinded to effect which some members should change their votes but it was observed that this pill would be peculiarly bitter to the southern states and that some concomitant measure should be adopted to sweeten it a little to them there had before been propositions to fix the seat of government     either at philadelphia or at georgetown on the potomac and it was thought that by giving it to philadelphia for ten years and to georgetown permanently afterwards this might as an anodyne calm in some degree the ferment which might be excited by the other measure alone so two of the potomac members white  lee  but white with a revulsion of stomach almost convulsive agreed to change their votes  hamilton undertook to carry the other point in doing this the influence he had established over the eastern members with the agency of robert morris with those of the middle states effected his side of the engagement and so the assumption was passed and  0 millions of stock divided among favored states and thrown in as pabulum to the stockjobbing herd this added to the number of votaries to the treasury and made its chief the master of every vote in the legislature which might give to the government the direction suited to his political views i know well and so must be understood that nothing like a majority in congress had yielded to this corruption far from it but a division not very unequal had already taken place in the honest part of that body between the parties styled republican and federal the latter being monarchists in principle adhered to hamilton of course as their leader in that principle and this mercenary phalanx added to them ensured him always a majority in both houses so that the whole action of the legislature was now under the direction of the     treasury still the machine was not compleat the effect of the funding system  of the assumption would be temporary it would be lost with the loss of the individual members whom it had enriched and some engine of influence more permanent must be contrived while these myrmidons were yet in place to carry it thro all opposition this engine was the bank of the u s all that history is known so i shall say nothing about it while the government remained at philadelphia a selection of members of both houses were constantly kept as directors who on every question interesting to that institution or to the views of the federal head voted at the will of that head and together with the stockholding members could always make the federal vote that of the majority by this combination legislative expositions were given to the constitution and all the administrative laws were shaped on the model of england  so passed and from this influence we were not relieved until the removal from the precincts of the bank to washington here then was the real ground of the opposition which was made to the course of administration its object was to preserve the legislature pure and independant of the executive to restrain the administration to republican forms and principles and not permit the constitution to be construed into a monarchy and to be warped in practice into all the principles and pollutions of their favorite english model nor was this an opposition to genl washington he was true to the republican charge confided to him  has solemnly and repeatedly protested to me in our     private conversations that he would lose the last drop of his blood in support of it and he did this the oftener and with the more earnestness because he knew my suspicions of hamiltons designs against it  wished to quiet them for he was not aware of the drift or of the effect of hamiltons schemes unversed in financial projects  calculations  budgets his approbation of them was bottomed on his confidence in the man but hamilton was not only a monarchist but for a monarchy bottomed on corruption in proof of this i will relate an anecdote for the truth of which i attest the god who made me before the president set out on his southern tour in april      he addressed a letter of the  th of that month from mt vernon to the secretaries of state treasury  war desiring that if any serious and important cases should arise during his absence they would consult  act on them and he requested that the vicepresident should also be consulted this was the only occasion on which that officer was ever requested to take part in a cabinet question some occasion for consultation arising i invited those gentlemen and the attorney genl as well as i remember to dine with me in order to confer on the subject after the cloth was removed and our question agreed  dismissed conversation began on other matters and by some circumstance was led to the british constitution on which mr adams observed purge that constitution of its corruption and give to its popular branch equality of representation and it would be the most perfect constitution ever devised by the wit of man hamilton paused and   0 said purge it of its corruption and give to its popular branch equality of representation  it would become an impracticable government as it stands at present with all its supposed defects it is the most perfect government which ever existed and this was assuredly the exact line which separated the political creeds of these two gentlemen the one was for two hereditary branches and an honest elective one the other for a hereditary king with a house of lords  commons corrupted to his will and standing between him and the people hamilton was indeed a singular character of acute understanding disinterested honest and honorable in all private transactions amiable in society and duly valuing virtue in private life yet so bewitched  perverted by the british example as to be under thoro conviction that corruption was essential to the government of a nation mr adams had originally been a republican the glare of royalty and nobility during his mission to england had made him believe their fascination a necessary ingredient in government and shays rebellion not sufficiently understood where he then was seemed to prove that the absence of want and oppression was not a sufficient guarantee of order his book on the american constitutions having made known his political bias he was taken up by the monarchical federalists in his absence and on his return to the u s he was by them made to believe that the general disposition of our citizens was favorable to monarchy he here wrote his davila as a supplement to the former work and his election to the     presidency confirmed his errors innumerable addresses too artfully and industriously poured in upon him deceived him into a confidence that he was on the pinnacle of popularity when the gulph was yawning at his feet which was to swallow up him and his deceivers for when genl washington was withdrawn these energumeni of royalism kept in check hitherto by the dread of his honesty his firmness his patriotism and the authority of his name now mounted on the car of state  free from controul like phäeton on that of the sun drove headlong  wild looking neither to right nor left nor regarding anything but the objects they were driving at until displaying these fully the eyes of the nation were opened and a general disbandment of them from the public councils took place mr adams i am sure has been long since convinced of the treacheries with which he was surrounded during his administration he has since thoroughly seen that his constituants were devoted to republican government and whether his judgment is resettled on its ancient basis or not he is conformed as a good citizen to the will of the majority and would now i am persuaded maintain its republican structure with the zeal and fidelity belonging to his character for even an enemy has said he is always an honest man  often a great one but in the fervor of the fury and follies of those who made him their stalking horse no man who did not witness it can form an idea of their unbridled madness and the terrorism with which they surrounded themselves the horrors of the french revolution then raging     aided them mainly and using that as a raw head and bloody bones they were enabled by their stratagems of x y z in which this historian was a leading mountebank their tales of tubplots ocean massacres bloody buoys and pulpit lyings and slanderings and maniacal ravings of their gardiners their osgoods and parishes to spread alarm into all but the firmest breasts their attorney general had the impudence to say to a republican member that deportation must be resorted to of which said he you republicans have set the example thus daring to identify us with the murderous jacobins of france these transactions now recollected but as dreams of the night were then sad realities and nothing rescued us from their liberticide effect but the unyielding opposition of those firm spirits who sternly maintained their post in defiance of terror until their fellow citizens could be aroused to their own danger and rally and rescue the standard of the constitution this has been happily done federalism  monarchism have languished from that moment until their treasonable combinations with the enemies of their country during the late war their plots of dismembering the union  their hartford convention has consigned them to the tomb of the dead and i fondly hope we may now truly say we are all republicans all federalists and that the motto of the standard to which our country will forever rally will be federal union and republican government and sure i am we may say that we are indebted for the preservation of this point of ralliance to that opposition of which so injurious     an idea is so artfully insinuated  excited in this history much of this relation is notorious to the world  many intimate proofs of it will be found in these notes from the moment where they end of my retiring from the administration the federalists  got unchecked hold of genl washington his memory was already sensibly impaired by age the firm tone of mind for which he had been remarkable was beginning to relax its energy was abated a listlessness of labor a desire for tranquillity had crept on him and a willingness to let others act and even think for him like the rest of mankind he was disgusted with atrocities of the french revolution and was not sufficiently aware of the difference between the rabble who were used as instruments of their perpetration and the steady  rational character of the american people in which he had not sufficient confidence the opposition too of the republicans to the british treaty and zealous support of the federalists in that unpopular but favorite measure of theirs had made him all their own understanding moreover that i disapproved of that treaty  copiously nourished with falsehoods by a malignant neighbor  of mine who ambitioned to be his correspondent he had become alienated from myself personally as from the republican body generally of his fellow citizens  he wrote the letters to mr adams and mr carroll over which in devotion to his imperishable     fame we must forever weep as monuments of mortal decay th jefferson feb        aug         notes of a conversn between a hamilton and th jefferson th j mentioned to him a lre recd from john adams disavowing publicola   denying that he ever entertd a wish to bring this country under a hereditary executive or introduce an hereditary branch of legislature c see his lre a h condemning mr as writings  most particularly davila  as having a tendency to weaken the present govmt declared in substance as follows i own it is my own opn tho i do not publish it in dan  bersheba that the present govnmt is not that which will answer the ends of society by giving stability  protection to its rights and that it will probably be found expedient to go into the british form however since we have undertaken the experiment i am for giving it a fair course whatever my expectns the success indeed so far is greater than i had expected  therefore at present success seems more possible than it had done heretofore  there are still other  other stages of improvement which if the present does not succeed may be tried  ought to be tried before we give up the republican form altogether for that mind must be really depraved which would not prefer the     equality of political rights which is the foundation of pure republicanism if it can be obtained consistently with order therefore whoever by his writings disturbs the present order of things is really blameable however pure his intentions may be  he was sure mr adams were pure this is the substance of a declaration made in much more lengthy terms  which seemed to be more formal than usual for a private conversation between two  as if intended to qualify some less guarded expressions which had been dropped on former occasions th j has committed it to writing in the moment of a hs leaving the room dec         colo gunn of georgia dining the other day with colo hamilton said to him with that plain freedom he is known to use i wish sir you would advise your friend king to observe some kind of consistency in his votes there has been scarcely a question before senate on which he has not voted both ways on the representation bill for instance he first voted for the proposition of the representatives and ultimately voted against it why says colo h i ll tell you as to that colo gunn that it never was intended that bill should pass gunn told this to butler who told it to th j  memorandum of communications made to a committee of the senate on the subject of the     diplomatic nominations to paris london and the hague january  th      the secretary of state having yesterday received a note from mr strong as chairman of a committee of the senate asking a conference with him on the subject of the late diplomatic nominations to paris london and the hague he met them in the senate chamber in the evening of the same day and stated to them in substance what follows— that he should on all occasions be ready to give to the senate or to any other branch of the government whatever information might properly be communicated and might be necessary to enable them to proceed in the line of their respective offices that on the present occasion particularly as the senate had to decide on the fitness of certain persons to act for the united states at certain courts they would be the better enabled to decide if they were informed of the state of our affairs at those courts and what we had to do there that when the bill for providing the means of intercourse with foreign nations was before the legislature he had met the committees of each house and had given them the ideas of the executive as to the courts with which we should keep diplomatic characters and the grades we should employ that there were two principles which decided on the courts vizt   vicinage and   commerce that the first operated in the cases of london and madrid and the second in the same cases and also in those of france and portugal perhaps too of holland that as to all other countries our commerce and connections were too unimportant     to call for the exchange of diplomatic residents that he thought we should adopt the lowest grades admissible to wit at paris that of minister plenipotentiary because that grade was already established there the same at london because the pride of that court and perhaps the sense of our country and its interests would require a sort of equality of treatment to be observed towards them and for spain and lisbon that of chargé des affaires only the hague uncertain that at the moment of this bill there was a complete vacancy of appointment between us and france and england by the accidental translations of the ministers of france and the united states to other offices and none as yet appointed to or from england that in this state of things the legislature had provided for the grade of minister plenipotentiary as one that was to be continued  shewed they had their eye on that grade only and that of chargé des affaires  that by the sum allowed they approved of the views then communicated that circumstances had obliged us to change the grade at lisbon to minister resident and this of course would force a change at madrid and the hague as had been communicated at the time to the senate but that no change was made in the salary that of resident being made the same as had been established for a chargé des affaires he then added the new circumstances which had supervened on those general ones in favour of these establishments to wit with paris the proposal on their part to make a liberal treaty the present     situation of their colonies which might lead to a freer commerce with them and the arrival of a minister plenipotentiary here with london their sending a minister here in consequence of notorious and repeated applications from us the powers given him to arrange the differences which had arisen about the execution of the treaty to wit the posts negroes c which was now in train and perhaps some authority to talk on the subject of arrangements of commerce and also the circumstances which had induced that minister to produce his commission with madrid the communication from the king that he was ready to resume the negociations on the navigation of the mississippi and to arrange that and a port of deposit on the most friendly footing if we would send a proper person to madrid for that purpose he explained the idea of joining one of the ministers in europe to mr carmichael for that purpose with lisbon that we had to try to obtain a right of sending flour there and mentioned del pintos former favourable opinion on that subject he stated also the interesting situation of brazil and the dispositions of the court of portugal with respect to our warfare with the algerines with holland the negociating loans for the transfer of the whole french debt there an operation which must be of some years because there is but a given sum of new money there every year and only a given proportion of that will be lent to any one nation he then particularly recapitulated the circumstances which justified the presidents having continued the grade of minister plenipotentiary     but added that whenever the biennial bill should come on each house would have a constitutional right to review the establishment again and whenever it should appear that either house thought any part of it might be reduced on giving to the executive time to avail themselves of the first convenient occasion to reduce it the executive could not but do it but that it would be extremely injurious now or at any other time to do it so abruptly as to occasion the recall of ministers or unfriendly sensations in any of those countries with which our commerce is interesting— that a circumstance recalled to the recollection of the secretary of state this morning induced him immediately to add to the preceding verbal communication a letter addressed to mr strong in the following words— thomas jefferson jan        philadelphia strong philadelphia january  th      sir— i am just now made to recollect a mistake in one of the answers i gave last night in the committee of the senate and which therefore i beg leave to correct after calling to their minds the footing on which mr morris had left matters at the court of london and informing them of what had passed between the british minister here  myself i was asked whether this was all that had taken place whether there had been no other or further engagement i paused you may remember to recollect i knew nothing more had passed on the other side the water because mr morriss powers there had   0 been determined and i endeavoured to recollect whether anything else had passed with mr hammond and myself i answered that this was all and added in proof that i was sure nothing had passed between the president  mr hammond personally and so i might safely say this was all it escaped me that there had been an informal agent here col beckwith and so informal that it was thought proper that i should never speak on business with him and that on a particular occasion the question having been asked whether if a british minister should be sent here we would send one in exchange it was said through another channel that one would doubtless be sent having only been present when it was concluded to give the answer and not having been myself the person who communicated it nor having otherwise had any conversation with col beckwith on the subject it absolutely escaped my recollection at the moment the committee put the question and i now correct the error i committed in my answer with the same good faith with which i committed the error in the first moment permit me to ask the favour of you sir to communicate this to the other members of the committee and to consider this as a part of the information i have had the honor of giving the committee on the subject i am with the most perfect esteem sir your most obt  most hble servant th jefferson thomas jefferson jan        philadelphia strong mr strong which letter with the preceding statement contains     the substance of what the secretary of state has communicated to the committee as far as his memory enables him to recollect th jefferson january  th      feb         colo beckwith called on me and informed me that tho not publicly commissioned he had been sent here on the part of his government that arriving before i came into office he had been put into the hands of another department not indeed by the chief magistrate directly as he had never had any direct communications but informally  had never been transferred to my department that on commencing his correspondence with the secretary of state of gr britain he had thought it his duty to make that circumstance known to us that mr hammonds arrival had now rendered his longer continuance here unnecessary as his residence hitherto had been only preparatory to mr hammonds reception that he had received orders by the last packet from the secretary of state to return to england by the next and that he should accdly do so he acknowledged the personal civility with which he had been treated generally  his entire satisfaction note this was the first conversation i ever had with him but merely as a private gentleman i note its purport because he was sent here by ld dorchester from quebeck which consequently authorizes us to send such a character to quebec t j     conversations with the president      feb    i was to have been with him long enough before   o clock which was the hour  day he received visits to have opened to him a proposition for doubling the velocity of the post riders who now travel about  0 miles a day  might without difficulty go  00 and for taking measures by waybills to know where the delay is when there is any i was delayed by business so as to have scarcely time to give him the outlines i run over them rapidly  observed afterwards that i had hitherto never spoke to him on the subject of the post office not knowing whether it was considered as a revenue law or a law for the general accommodation of the citizens that the law just passed seemed to have removed the doubt by declaring that the whole profits of the office should be applied to extending the posts  that even the past profits should be refunded by the treasury for the same purpose that i therefore conceived it was now in the department of the secretary of state that i thought it would be advantageous so to declare it for another reason to wit that the department of treasury possessed already such an influence as to swallow up the whole executive powers and that even the future presidents not supported by the weight of character which himself possessed would not be able to make head against this department that in urging this measure i had certainly no personal interest since if i was supposed to have any appetite for power yet as my career would certainly be exactly as short     as his own the intervening time was too short to be an object my real wish was to avail the public of every occasion during the residue of the presidents period to place things on a safe footing—he was now called on to attend his company  he desired me to come and breakfast with him the next morning feb    i did so  after breakfast we retired to his room  i unfolded my plan for the postoffice and after such an approbation of it as he usually permitted himself on the first presentment of any idea and desiring me to commit it to writing he during that pause of conversation which follows a business closed said in an affectionate tone that he had felt much concern at an expression which dropt from me yesterday  which marked my intention of retiring when he should that as to himself many motives obliged him to it he had through the whole course of the war and most particularly at the close of it uniformly declared his resolution to retire from public affairs  never to act in any public office that he had retired under that firm resolution that the government however which had been formed being found evidently too inefficacious and it being supposed that his aid was of some consequence towards bringing the people to consent to one of sufficient efficacy for their own good he consented to come into the convention  on the same motive after much pressing to take a part in the new government and get it under way that were he to continue longer it might give room to say that having tasted the sweets of office he could not do     without them that he really felt himself growing old his bodily health less firm his memory always bad becoming worse and perhaps the other faculties of his mind showing a decay to others of which he was insensible himself that this apprehension particularly oppressed him that he found moreover his activity lessened business therefore more irksome and tranquility  retirement become an irresistible passion that however he felt himself obliged for these reasons to retire from the government yet he should consider it as unfortunate if that should bring on the retirement of the great officers of the government and that this might produce a shock on the public mind of dangerous consequence i told him that no man had ever had less desire of entering into public offices than myself that the circumstance of a perilous war which brought every thing into danger  called for all the services which every citizen could render had induced me to undertake the administration of the government of virginia that i had both before  after refused repeated appointments of congress to go abroad in that sort of office which if i had consulted my own gratification would always have been the most agreeable to me that at the end of two years i resigned the government of virginia  retired with a firm resolution never more to appear in public life that a domestic loss however happened and made me fancy that absence  a change of scene for a time might be expedient for me that i therefore accepted a foreign appointment limited to two years that at the close of that dr franklin having left france i was appointed to supply his     place which i had accepted  tho i continued in it three or four years it was under the constant idea of remaining only a year or two longer that the revolution in france coming on i had so interested myself in the event of that that when obliged to bring my family home i had still an idea of returning  awaiting the close of that to fix the æra of my final retirement that on my arrival here i found he had appointed me to my present office that he knew i had not come into it without some reluctance that it was on my part a sacrifice of inclination to the opinion that i might be more serviceable here than in france  with a firm resolution in my mind to indulge my constant wish for retirement at no very distant day that when therefore i received his letter written from mount vernon on his way to carolina  georgia apr        and discovered from an expression in that that he meant to retire from the government ere long  as to the precise epoch there could be no doubt my mind was immediately made up to make that the epoch of my own retirement from those labors of which i was heartily tired that however i did not believe there was any idea in either of my brethren in the administration of retiring that on the contrary i had perceived at a late meeting of the trustees of the sinking fund that the secretary of the treasury had developed the plan he intended to pursue  that it embraced years in its view—he said that he considered the treasury department as a much more limited one going only to the single object of revenue while that of the secretary of state embracing nearly all the objects of     administration was much more important  the retirement of the officer therefore would be more noticed that tho the government had set out with a pretty general good will of the public yet that symptoms of dissatisfaction had lately shewn themselves far beyond what he could have expected and to what height these might arise in case of too great a change in the administration could not be foreseen— i told him that in my opinion there was only a single source of these discontents tho they had indeed appear sic to spread themselves over the war department also yet i considered that as an overflowing only from their real channel which would never have taken place if they had not first been generated in another department to wit that of the treasury that a system had there been contrived for deluging the states with paper money instead of gold  silver for withdrawing our citizens from the pursuits of commerce manufactures buildings  other branches of useful industry to occupy themselves  their capitals in a species of gambling destructive of morality  which had introduced its poison into the government itself that it was a fact as certainly known as that he  i were then conversing that particular members of the legislature while those laws were on the carpet had feathered their nests with paper had then voted for the laws and constantly since lent all the energy of their talents  instrumentality of their offices to the establishment and enlargement of this system that they had chained it about our necks for a great length of time  in order to keep the game in their     hands had from time to time aided in making such legislative constructions of the constitution as made it a very different thing from what the people thought they had submitted to that they had now brought forward a proposition far beyond every one ever yet advanced  to which the eyes of many were turned as the decision which was to let us know whether we live under a limited or an unlimited government—he asked me to what proposition i alluded i answered to that in the report on manufactures which under colour of giving bounties for the encouragement of particular manufactures meant to establish the doctrine that the power given by the constitution to collect taxes to provide for the general welfare of the u s permitted congress to take everything under their management which they should deem for the public welfare  which is susceptible of the application of money consequently that the subsequent enumeration of their powers was not the description to which resort must be had  did not at all constitute the limits of their authority that this was a very different question from that of the bank which was thought an incident to an enumerated power that therefore this decision was expected with great anxiety that indeed i

0th of mar         mar    consulted verbally by the president on whom a commee of the senate izard morris  king are to wait tomorrow morning to know whether he will think it proper to redeem our algerine captives  make a treaty with the algerines on the single vote of the senate without taking that of the represent my opn run on the following heads we must go to algiers with the cash in our hands where shall we get it by loan by converting money now in the treasury probably a loan mt be obtd on the presids authority but as this cd nt be repd without a subseqt act of legislature the represent mt refuse it  0  so if convert money in treasury they may refuse to sanction it the subseqt approbatn of the sen being necessary to validate a treaty they expect to be consulted beforehand if the case admits so the subseqt act of the repr being necessary where money is given why shd nt they expect to be consulted in like manner when the case admits a treaty is a law of the land but prudence will point out this difference to be attended to in making them viz where a treaty contains such articles only as will go into exn of themselves or be carried into exn by the judges they may be safely made but where there are articles which require a law to be passed afterwds by the legislature great caution is requisite eg the consular convention with france required a very small legislative reguln this convention was unanimously ratified by the senate yet the same identical men threw by the law to enforce it at the last session  the repr at this session have placed it among the laws which they may take up or not at their own convenience as if that was a higher motive than the public faith therefore against hazarding this transaction with out the sanction of both houses the pres concurred the senate express the motive for this proposn to be a fear that the repr would not keep the secret he has no opinion of the secrecy of the senate in this very case mr izard made the communication to him setting next to him at table on one hand while a lady mrs mclane was on his other hand and the fr minister next to  0  her and as mr izard got on with his communication his voice kept rising  his stutter bolting the words out loudly at intervals so that the minister might hear if he would he sd he hd a great mind at one time to have got up in order to put a stop to mr

hogeboom sheriff of columbia county n york were acquitted aye says smith this is what comes of your damned trial by jury verbal answer proposed to the president to be made to the commee who are to wait on him with the resoln of the  0th inst congratulating on the completion  acceptance of the french constn that the president will in his answer communicate to the king of the french the sentiments expressed by the h of representatives in the resolution which the committee has delivered him mar              towards the latter end of nov h had drawn ternant into a conversation on the subject of the treaty of commerce recommdd by the natl assembly of france to be negotiated with us and as he hd nt recd instrns on the subject he led him into a proposal that ternant shd take the thing up as a volunteer with me that we shd arrange condns and let them go for confirmn or refusal h communicated  0  this to the presid who came into it  proposed it to me i disapproved of it observg that such a volunteer project would be binding on us  not on them that it would enable them to find out how far we would go  avail themselves of it however the presidt thot it worth trying  i acquiesced i prepared a plan of treaty for exchanging the privileges of native subjects and fixing all duties forever as they now stood he did not like this way of fixing the duties because he said that many articles here would bear to be raised and therefore he would prepare a tariff he did so raising duties for the french from    to  0 per cent so they were to give us the privileges of native subjects and we as a compensation were to make them pay higher duties h havg made his arrangemts with hammond to pretend that tho he had no powers to conclude a treaty of commerce yet his genl commn authorized him to enter into the discussion of one then proposed to the president at one of our meetings that the business should be taken up with hammond in the same informal way i now discovd the trap which he hd laid by first getting the presidt into that step with ternant i opposed the thing warmly h observed if we did it with ternant we shd also with hammond the presid thot this reasonable i desired him to recollect i had been agt it with ternant  only acquiesced under his opn so the matter went off as to both his scheme was evidently to get us engaged first with ternant merely that he might have a pretext to engage us on the same ground with hammond taking care at the  0  same time by an extravagant tariff to render it impossible we should come to any conclusion with ternant probably meaning at the same time to propose terms so favble to gr br as wd attach us to that country by treaty on one of those occans he asserted that our commerce with gr br  her colonies was put on a much more favble footing than with france  her colonies i therefore prepared the tabular comparative view of the footing of our commerce with those nations which see among my papers see also my project of a treaty  hs tariff committed to writing mar         it was observable that whenever at any of our consultns anything was proposed as to gr br hamilton had constantly ready something which mr hammond had communicated to him which suited the subject and proved the intimacy of their communications insomuch that i believe he communicated to hammond all our views  knew from him in return the views of the british court many evidences of this occurred i will state some—i delivd to the presid my report of instrns for carmichl  short on the subjects of navign boundary  commerce  desired him to submit it to hamilton h made several just criticisms on difft parts of it but where i asserted that the u s had no right to alienate an inch of the territory of any state he attacked  denied the doctrine see my report his note  my answer  a few days after came to hand   0 kirklands lre informing us that the british at niagara expected to run a new line between them and us and the reports of pond  stedman informing us it was understood at niagara that capt stevenson had bn sent here by simcoe to settle that plan with hammd hence hamiltons attack of the principle i had laid down in order to prepare the way for this new line see minute of mar   another proof at one of our consultns about the last of dec i mentd that i wished to give in my report on commerce in which i cd nt avoid recommendg a commercial retaliation agt gr b h opposed it violently  among other arguments observed that it was of more importance to us to have the posts than to commence a commercial war that this  this alone wd free us from the expense of the indn wars that it wd therefore be the height of imprudce in us while treating for the surrender of the posts to engage in anything which wd irritate them that if we did so they wd naturally say these people mean war let us therefore hold what we have in our hands this argument struck me forcibly  i said if there is a hope of obtaining the posts i agree it wd be imprudent to risk that hope by a commercial retaliation i will therefore wait till mr hammond gives me in his assignment of breaches  if that gives a glimmering of hope that they mean to surrender the posts i will not give in my report till the next session now hammond had recd my assignment of breaches on the   th of dec and about the   d or   d had made me an apology for not having been able to send me his counter assignment of breaches     but in terms which showed i might expect it in a few days from the moment it escaped my lips in the presence of hamilton that i wd nt give in my rept till i shd see hammonds countercomplaint  judge if there were a hope of the posts hammond never said a word to me on any occn as to the time he should be ready at length the presidt got out of patience  insisted i shd jog him this i did on the   st of feb at the presidents assembly he immediately promised i should have it in a few days and accdly on the  th of mar i recd them written mar         mar       sent for by the presidt  desired to bring the lre he had signed to the k of france—went—he said the h of repr had on saturday taken up the communication he had made of the kings lre to him and come to a vote in their own name that he did not expect this when he sent his message  the letter otherwise he would have sent the message without the letter as i had proposed that he apprehendd the legislature wd be endeavoring to invade the executive—i told him i hd understood the house had resolved to request him to join their congratulations to his on the completion  acceptance of the constitn on which part of the vote there were only two dissentients barnwell  benson that the vote was    to    on that part which expressed an approbn of the wisdom of the constn that in the lre he had signed i had avoided saying a word in approbn of the constn not knowing whether the king in his heart approved it why indeed     says he i begin to doubt very much of the affairs of france there are papers from london as late as the  0th of jan which represent them as going into confusion—he read over the letter he had signed found there was not a word which could commit his judgmt about the constn  gave it me back again this is one of many proofs i have had of his want of confidence in the event of the french revoln the fact is that governeur morris a high flying monarchyman shutting his eyes  his faith to every fact against his wishes  believing everything he desires to be true has kept the presidents mind constantly poisoned with his forebodings that the president wishes the revoln may be established i believe from several indications i remember when i recd the news of the kings flight  capture i first told him of it at his assembly i never saw him so much dejected by any event in my life he expressed clearly on this occasion his disapprobation of the legislature referring things to the heads of departments written mar    eod die ten oclock am the preceding was about   oclock the presid now sends lear to me to ask what answer he shall give the commee and particularly whether he shall add to it that in making the communicn it was not his expectn that the house should give any answer i told mr lear that i thought the house had a right independantly of legislation to express sentiments on other subjects that when these subjects did not belong to any other branch particularly they would     publish them by their own authority that in the present case which respected a foreign nation the pres being the organ of our nation with other nations the house would satisfy their duty if instead of a direct communication they shd pass their sentiments thro the president that if expressing a sentiment were really an invasion of the executive power it was so faint a one that it would be difficult to demonstrate it to the public  to a public partial to the french revoln  not disposed to consider the approbn of it from any quarter as improper that the senate indeed had given many indicns of their wish to invade the executive power the represent had done it in one case which was indeed mischievous and alarming that of giving orders to the heads of the executive depmts without consulting the pres but that the late vote for directing the sec of the treasy to report ways  means tho carried was carried by so small a majority  with the aid of members so notoriously under a local influence on that question as to give a hope that the practice would be arrested  the constnl course be taken up of asking the pres to have informn laid before them  but that in the prest instance it was so far from being clearly an invasion of the executive and wd be so little approved by the genl voice that i cd not advise the pres to express any dissatisfn at the vote of the house  i gave lear in writing what i thot should be his answers see it mar    a meeting at the ps present th j     a h h k  e randolph the subject was the resoln of the h of repr of mar    to appt a commee to inquire into the causes of the failure of the late expdn under maj genl st clair with power to call for such persons papers  records as may be necessary to assist their inquiries the commee had written to knox for the original letters instns c the president he had called us to consult merely because it was the first example  he wished that so far as it shd become a precedent it should be rightly conducted he neither acknowledged nor denied nor even doubted the propriety of what the house were doing for he had not thought upon it nor was acquainted with subjects of this kind he could readily conceive there might be papers of so secret a nature as that they ought not to be given up—we were not prepared  wished time to think  enquire apr   met again at ps on same subject we had all considered and were of one mind   that the house was an inquest  therefore might institute inquiries   that they might call for papers generally   that the executive ought to communicate such papers as the public good would permit  ought to refuse those the disclosure of which would injure the public consequently were to exercise a discretion   that neither the commee nor house had a right to call on the head of a deptmt who  whose papers were under the presidt alone but that the commee shd instruct their chairman to move the house to address the president we had principally consulted the proceedings of the commons in     the case of s rob walpole    chandlers deb for   point see pages       0              0  for the  d pa          0  for the  d        append pa    for the  th pa     note hamilt agrd with us in all these points except as to the powr of the house to call on heads of departmts he observed that as to his departmt the act constituting it had made it subject to congress in some points but he thot himself not so far subject as to be obliged to produce all papers they might call for they might demand secrets of a very mischievous nature here i thot he began to fear they would go to examining how far their own members  other persons in the govmt had been dabbling in stocks banks c and that he probably would choose in this case to deny their power  in short he endeavd to place himself subject to the house when the executive should propose what he did not like  subject to the executive when the house shd propose anything disagreeable i observed here a difference between the brit parl  our congress that the former was a legislature an inquest  a council s c page    for the king the latter was by the constn a legislature  an inquest but not a council finally agreed to speak separation sic to the members of the commee  bring them by persuasion into the right channel it was agreed in this case that there was not a paper which might not be properly produced that copies only should be sent with an assurance that if they should desire it a clerk should attend with the originals to be verified by themselves the commee were fitzsimmons steele mercer clarke sedgwick giles vining     april        the presit hd wished to redeem our captives at algiers  to make peace with them on paying an annual tribute the senate were willing to approve this but unwilling to have the lower house applied to previously to furnish the money they wished the president to take the money from the treasury or open a loan for it they thought that to consult the representatives on one occasion would give them a handle always to claim it  would let them into a participation of the power of making treaties which the constn had given exclusively to the president  senate they said too that if the particular sum was voted by the represent it would not be a secret the president had no confidence in the secresy of the senate  did not chuse to take money from the treasury or to borrow but he agreed he would enter into provisional treaties with the algerines not to be binding on us till ratified here i prepared questions for consultn with the senate  added that the senate were to be apprized that on the return of the provisional treaty  after they should advise the ratifin he should not have the seal put to it till the two houses should vote the money he asked me if the treaty stipulating a sum  ratified by him with the advice of the senate would not be good under the constn  obligatory on the repres to furnish the money i answered it certainly would  that it would be the duty of the representatives to raise the money but that they might decline to do what was their duty  i thot it might be incautious to commit himself by a ratifin with a foreign nation where he might be left in the     lurch in the execution it was possible too to conceive a treaty which it wd nt be their duty to provide for he said that he did not like throwing too much into democratic hands that if they would not do what the constn called on them to do the government would be at an end  must then assume another form he stopped here  i kept silence to see whether he would say anything more in the same line or add any qualifying expression to soften what he had said but he did neither i had observed that wherever the agency of either or both houses would be requisite subsequent to a treaty to carry it into effect it would be prudent to consult them previously if the occasion admitted that thus it was we were in the habit of consulting the senate previously when the occasion permitted because their subseqt ratifin would be necessary that there was the same reason for consulting the lower house previously where they were to be called on afterwards  especially in a case of money as they held the purse strings  would be jealous of them however he desired me to strike out the intimation that the seal would not be put till both houses should have voted the money apr   the president called on me before breakfast  first introduced some other matters then fell on the representn bill which he had now in his possn for the  0th day i had before given him my opn  in writing that the method of apportionmt was     contrary to the constn he agreed that it was contrary to the common understanding of that instrument  to what was understood at the time by the makers of it that yet it would bear the constn which the bill put  he observed that the vote for  against the bill was perfectly geographical a northern agt a southern vote  he feared he should be thought to be taking side with a southern party i admitted this motive of delicacy but that it should not induce him to do wrong urged the dangers to which the scramble for the fractionary members would always lead he here expressed his fear that there would ere long be a separation of the union that the public mind seemed dissatisfied  tending to this he went home sent for randolph the atty genl desired him to get mr madison immediately  come to me  if we three concurred in opn that he should negative the bill he desired to hear nothing more about it but that we would draw the instrument for him to sign they came our minds had been before made up we drew the instrumt randolph carried it to him  told him we all concurred in it he walked with him to the door and as if he still wished to get off he said  you say you approve of this yourself yes sir says randolph i do upon my honor he sent it in to the h of representatives instantly a few of the hottest friends of the bill expressed passion but the majority were satisfied  both in and out of doors it gave pleasure to have at length an instance of the negative being exercised written this the  th of april     notes of a conversation with mr hammond june        having recd mr hammonds letter of june   informing me that my letter of may    should be sent to his court for their instructions i immediately went to his house he was not at home i wrote him a note inviting him to come and dine with me alone that we might confer together in a familiar way on the subject of our letters and consider what was to be done he was engaged but said he would call on me any hour the next day i invited him to take a solo dinner the next day he accepted and came after the cloth was taken off  the servants retired i introduced the conversation by adverting to that part of his letter wherein he disavowed any intentional deception if he had been misinformed  had misstated any facts assuring him that i acquitted him of every suspicion of that kind that he had been here too short a time to be acquainted with facts himself or to know the best sources for getting at them that i had found great difficulty myself in the investigation of facts  with respect to the proceedings of the courts particularly had been indebted to the circumstance of congress being in session so that i could apply to the members of the different states for information respecting their states i told him that each party having now stated the matters between the two nations in the point of view in which they appeared to each had hoped that we might by the way of free conversation abridge what   0 remained that i expected we were to take for our basis that the treaty was to be fully executed that on our part we had pronounced our demands explicitly to have the upper posts delivered up  the negroes paid for that they objected infractions on our part which we denied that we ought to proceed to investigate the facts on which we differed that this was the country in which they could alone be investigated and if it should be found we had unjustifiably broken the treaty the case was of a nature to admit of a proper compromise—he said that he believed the question had never been understood by his court admitted they had as yet heard only one side of it  that from a party which entertained strong feelings against us i think he said the refugees that the idea would be quite new to his court of their having committed the first infractions and of the proceedings on the subject of their debts here being on the ground of retaliation that this gave to the case a complexion so entirely new and different from what had been contemplated that he should not be justified in taking a single step that he should send my letter to the ministers that they would be able to consider facts  dates see if they had really been the first infractors and say what ground they would take on this new state of the case that the matter was now for the first time carried into mutual discussion that the close of my letter contained specific propositions to which they would of course give specific answers adapted to the new statement of things brought forward i replied that as to the fact of their committing the first infraction     it could not be questioned confessed that i believe the ministry which signed the treaty meant to execute it that ld shelburnes plan was to produce a new coalescence by a liberal conduct towards us that the ministry which succeeded thought the treaty too liberal and wished to curtail its effect in the course of executing it but that if every move and countermove was to cross the atlantic it would be a long game indeed he said no that he thought they could take their ultimate ground at once on having before them a full view of the facts and he thought it fortunate that mr bond from whom he got most of his information and ld dorchester would be on the spot to bring things to rights  he imagined he could receive his instructions before november—i told him that i apprehended that ld dorchester would not feel a disposition to promote conciliation seeing himself marked personally as an infractor and mentioned to him the opinions entertained here of the unfriendliness of mr bonds mind towards us—he justified mr bond believed him candid and disposed to conciliate besides mr bond he had received information from their other consuls and the factors of the merchants who assured him that they could furnish proofs of the facts they communicated to him  which he had advanced on their authority that he should now write to them to produce their authority he admitted that the debt to british subjects might be considered as liquidated from the potowmac northward that s carolina was making a laudable effort to pay hers and that the only important object now was that of     virginia amounting by his list to two millions sterling that the attention of the british merchants from north to south was turned to the decision of the case of jones  walker which he hoped would take place at the present session  let them see what they had to depend on i told him that i was sorry to learn that but two judges had arrived in richmond and that unless the third arrived they would not take it up i desired him to observe that the question in that case related only to that description of debts which had been paid into the treasury that without pretending to know with any accuracy what proportion of the whole debt of virginia had been paid into the treasury i believed it was a small one but the case of jones  walker would be a precedent for those debts only that as to the great residuary mass there were precedents enough as it appeared they were in a full course of recovery and that there was no obstacle real or apparent he did not appear to have adverted to the distinction and shewed marks of satisfaction on understanding that the question was confined to the other portion of the debts only he thought that the collection there being once under a hopeful way would of itself change the ground on which our difference stands he observed that the treaty was of itself so vague and inconsistent in many of its parts as to require an explanatory convention he instanced the two articles one of which gave them the navigation of the mississippi and the other bounded them by a due west line from the lake of the wood which being now understood to pass beyond the most northern     sources of the mississippi intercepted all access to that river that to reconcile these articles that line should be so run as to give them access to the navigable waters of the mississippi and that it would even be for our interest to introduce a third power between us  the spaniards he asked my idea of the line from the lake of the woods and of now settling it i told him i knew of no objection to the settlement of it that my idea of it was that if it was an impassable line as proposed in the treaty it should be rendered passable by as small  unimportant an alteration as might be which i thought would be to throw in a line running due north from the northernmost source of the mississippi till it should strike the western line from the lake of the woods that the article giving them a navigation in the mississippi did not relate at all to this northern boundary but to the southern one  to the secret article respecting that that he knew that our provisional treaty was made seven weeks before that with spain that at the date of ours their ministers had still a hope of retaining florida in which case they were to come up to the   d degree  in which case also the navigation of the mississippi would have been important but that they had not been able in event to retain the country to which the navigation was to be an appendage it was evident to me that they had it in view to claim a slice on our northwestern quarter that they may get into the mississippi indeed i thought it presented as a sort of makeweight with the posts to compensate the great losses their citizens had sustained by the infractions charged on us i had     hinted that i had not been without a hope that an early possession of the posts might have been given us as a commencement of full execution of the treaty he asked me if i had conceived that he was authorized to write to the governor of canada to deliver us the posts—i said i had—he smiled at that idea and assured me he had by no means any such authority—i mentioned what i had understood to have passed between him  genl dickinson which was related to me by mr hawkins to wit that the posts might be delivered upon the assurance of the recovery of their debts in virginia he said that if any such thing as that had dropped from him it must have been merely as a private  unauthorized opinion for that the opinion of his court was that the retention of the posts was but a short compensation for the losses which their citizens had sustained  would sustain by the delay of their admission into our courts putting together this expression and his frequent declarations that the face of the controversy was now so totally changed from what it was understood to be at his court that no instructions of his could be applicable to it i concluded that his court had entertained no thought of ever giving up the posts and had framed their instructions to him on a totally different hypothesis—he asked what we understood to be the boundary between us and the indians—i told him he would see by recurring to my report on the north western territory  and by tracing the line there described on hutchinss     map—what did i understand to be our right in the indian soil   a right of preemption of their lands that is to say the sole  exclusive right of purchasing from them whenever they should be willing to sell   a right of regulating the commerce between them and the whites—did i suppose that the right of preemption prohibited any individual of another nation from purchasing lands which the indians should be willing to sell certainly we consider it as established by the usage of different nations into a kind of jus gentium for america that a white nation settling down and declaring that such and such are their limits makes an invasion of those limits by any other white nation an act of war but gives no right of soil against the native possessors—did i think the right of regulating the commerce went to prohibit the british traders from coming into the indian territory that has been the idea he said this would be hard on the indians i observed that whichever way the principle was established it would work equally on both sides the line i did not know whether we would gain or lose by mutual admission or exclusion he said they apprehended our intention was to exterminate the indians  take the lands i assured him that on the contrary our system was to protect them even against our own citizens that we wish to get lines established with all of them and have no views even of purchasing any more lands from them for a long time we consider them as a mare chaussee or police for scouring the woods on our borders and preventing their being a cover for rovers and robbers     he wished the treaty had established an independent nation between us to keep us apart he was under great apprehensions that it would become a matter of bidding as it were between the british and us who should have the greatest army there who should have the greatest force on the lakes that we holding posts on this side the water  they on the other souldiers looking constantly at one another would get into broils  commit the two nations in war i told him we might perhaps regulate by agreement the force to be kept on each side—he asked what was our view in keeping a force there that he apprehended if we had these posts we should be able to hinder vessels from passing i answered that i did not know whether the position of the present posts was such as that no vessel could pass but within their gunshot but that each party must have a plenty of such positions on the opposite sides exclusively of the present posts that our view in possessing these posts was to awe the indians to participate in the fur trade to protect that trade protect it against whom against the indians he asked what i imagined to be their motives for keeping the posts to influence the indians to keep off a rival nation and the appearance of having a rival nation to monopolize the fur trade he said he was not afraid of rivals if the traders would have fair play he thought it would be better that neither party should have any military posts but only trading houses i told him that the idea of having no military post on either side was new to me that it had never been mentioned among the members of the     executive that therefore i could only speak for myself  say that primâ facie it accorded well with two favorite ideas of mine of leaving commerce free  never keeping an unnecessary souldier but when he spoke of having no military post on either side there might be difficulty in fixing the distance of the nearest posts he said that tho his opinion on this subject was only a private one  he understood mine to be so also yet he was much pleased that we two seemed to think nearly alike as it might lead to something he said that their principal object in the fur trade was the consumption of the goods they gave in exchange for the furs i answered that whether the trade was carried on by english or americans it would be with english goods and the route would be not through canada but by the shorter channels of the hudson or the potowmac it is not pretended that the above is in the exact order or the exact words of the conversation this was often desultory and i can only answer for having given generally the expression and always the substance of what passed th jefferson june        july  0      my lre of —  to the president directed to him at mt vernon had not found him there but came to him here he told me of this  that he would take an occasion of speaking with me on the subject he did so this day he began by observing that he had put it off from day to day     because the subject was painful to wit his remaining in office which that letter sollicited he said that the decln he had made when he quitted his military command of never again acting in public was sincere that however when he was called on to come forward to set the present govmt in motion it appeared to him that circumstances were so changed as to justify a change in his resoln he was made to believe that in   years all would be well in motion  he might retire at the end of two years he found some things still to be done at the end of the  d year he thought it was not worth while to disturb the course of things as in one year more his office would expire  he was decided then to retire now he was told there would still be danger in it certainly if he thought so he would conquer his longing for retirement but he feared it would be said his former professions of retirement had been mere affectation  that he was like other men when once in office he could not quit it he was sensible too of a decay of his hearing perhaps his other faculties might fall off  he not be sensible of it that with respect to the existing causes of uneasiness he thought there were suspicions against a particular party which had been carried a great deal too far there might be desires but he did not believe there were designs to change the form of govmt into a monarchy that there might be a few who wished it in the higher walks of life particularly in the great cities but that the main body of the people in the eastern states were as steadily for republicanism as in the southern that the pieces lately published      particularly in freneaus paper seemed to have in view the exciting opposition to the govmt that this had taken place in pennsylve as to the excise law accdg to informn he had recd from genl hand that they tended to produce a separation of the union the most dreadful of all calamities and that whatever tended to produce anarchy tended of course to produce a resort to monarchical government he considered those papers as attacking him directly for he must be a fool indeed to swallow the little sugar plumbs here  there thrown out to him that in condemning the admn of the govmt they condemned him for if they thought there were measures pursued contrary to his sentiment they must conceive him too careless to attend to them or too stupid to understand them that tho indeed he had signed many acts which he did not approve in all their parts yet he had never put his name to one which he did not think on the whole was eligible that as to the bank which had been an act of so much complaint until there was some infallible criterion of reason a difference of opinion must be tolerated he did not believe the discontents extended far from the seat of govmt he had seen  spoken with many people in maryld  virginia in his late journey he found the people contented  happy he wished however to be better informed on this head if the discontent were more extensive than he supposed it might be that the desire that he should remain in the government was not general my observns to him tended principally to enforce the topics of my lre i will not therefore repeat   0 them except where they produced observns from him i said that the two great complaints were that the national debt was unnecessarily increased  that it had furnished the means of corrupting both branches of the legislature that he must know  everybody knew there was a considerable squadron in both whose votes were devoted to the paper  stockjobbing interest that the names of a weighty number were known  several others suspected on good grounds that on examining the votes of these men they would be found uniformly for every treasury measure  that as most of these measures had been carried by small majorities they were carried by these very votes that therefore it was a cause of just uneasiness when we saw a legislature legislating for their own interests in opposition to those of the people he said not a word on the corruption of the legislature but took up the other point defended the assumption  argued that it had not increased the debt for that all of it was honest debt he justified the excise law as one of the best laws which could be past as nobody would pay the tax who did not chuse to do it with respect to the increase of the debt by the assumption i observed to him that what was meant  objected to was that it increased the debt of the general govmt and carried it beyond the possibility of paiment that if the balances had been settled  the debtor states directed to pay their deficiencies to the creditor states they would have done it easily and by resources of taxation in their power and acceptable to the people by a direct tax in the south  an excise in the     north still he said it would be paid by the people finding him really approving the treasury system i avoided entering into argument with him on those points gunston hall sep  0    ex relatione g mason the constn as agreed to till a fortnight before the convention rose

⅔ of the legislature in any vote it was done these articles were changed accordingly  from that moment the two s states and the   northern ones joined pen jers  del  made the majority   to   against

settling our debt would have been something in this way he would have laid as much tax as could be paid without oppressing the people particularly he would have laid an impost of about the amount of the first laid by congress but somewhat different in several of its articles he would have suspended all application of it one year during which an office should have been open to register unalienated certificates at the end of the year he would have appropriated his revenue  st to pay the civil list   the interest of these certif   instalments of the principal   a surplus to buy up the alienated certificates still avoiding to make any other provision for these last by the time the unalienated certificates should have been all paid he supposed half the alienated ones would have been bought up at market he would then have proceeded to redeem the residue of them bladensbg oct   this morning at mt vernon i had the following conversation with the president he opened it by expressing his regret at the resolution in which i appeared so fixed in the lre i had written him of retiring from public affairs he said that he should be extremely sorry that i should do it as long as he was in office and that he could not see where he should find another character to fill my office that as yet he was quite undecided whether to retire in march or not his inclinations led him strongly to do it nobody disliked more the ceremonies of his office and he had not the least taste or     gratification in the execution of its functions that he was happy at home alone and that his presence there was now peculiarly called for by the situation of majr washington  whom he thought irrecoverable  should he get well he would remove into another part of the country which might better agree with him that he did not believe his presence necessary that there were other characters who would do the business as well or better still however if his aid was thought necessary to save the cause to which he had devoted his life principally he would make the sacrifice of a longer continuance that he therefore reserved himself for future decision as his declaration would be in time if made a month before the day of election he had desired mr lear to find out from conversation without appearing to make the inquiry whether any other person would be desired by any body he had informed him he judged from conversations that it was the universal desire he should continue  the expectation that those who expressed a doubt of his continuance did it in the language of apprehension and not of desire but this says he is only from the north it may be very different in the south i thought this meant as an opening to me to say what was the sentiment in the south from which quarter i came i told him that as far as i knew there was but one voice there which was for his continuance that as to myself i had ever preferred the pursuits of private life to those of public which had nothing in them agreeable to me i explained to him the     circumstances of the war which had first called me into public life and those following the war which had called me from a retirement on which i had determd that i had constantly kept my eye on my own home and could no longer refrain from returning to it as to himself his presence was important that he was the only man in the u s who possessed the confidce of the whole that govmt was founded in opinion  confidence and that the longer he remained the stronger would become the habits of the people in submitting to the govmt  in thinking it a thing to be maintained that there was no other person who would be thought anything more than the head of a party he then expressed his concern at the difference which he found to subsist between the sec of the treasury  myself of which he said he had not been aware he knew indeed that there was a marked difference in our political sentiments but he had never suspected it had gone so far in producing a personal difference and he wished he could be the mediator to put an end to it that he thought it important to preserve the check of my opinions in the administration in order to keep things in their proper channel  prevent them from going too far that as to the idea of transforming this govt into a monarchy he did not believe there were ten men in the u s whose opinions were worth attention who entertained such a thought i told him there were many more than he imagined i recalled to his memory a dispute at his own table a little before we left philada between genl schuyler on one side  pinkney  myself on the other     wherein the former maintained the position that hereditary descent was as likely to produce good magistrates as election i told him that tho the people were sound there were a numerous sect who had monarchy in contempln that the secy of the treasury was one of these that i had heard him say that this constitution was a shilly shally thing of mere milk  water which could not last  was only good as a step to something better that when we reflected that he had endeavored in the convention to make an english constn of it and when failing in that we saw all his measures tending to bring it to the same thing it was natural for us to be jealous and particular when we saw that these measures had established corruption in the legislature where there was a squadron devoted to the nod of the treasury doing whatever he had directed  ready to do what he should direct that if the equilibrium of the three great bodies legislative executive  judiciary could be preserved if the legislature could be kept independant i should never fear the result of such a government but that i could not but be uneasy when i saw that the executive had swallowed up the legislative branch he said that as to that interested spirit in the legislature it was what could not be avoided in any government unless we were to exclude particular descriptions of men such as the holders of the funds from all office i told him there was great difference between the little accidental schemes of self interest which would take place in every body of men  influence their votes and a regular system for forming a corps of interested     persons who should be steadily at the orders of the treasury he touched on the merits of the funding system observed that there was a difference of opinion about it some thinking it very bad others very good that experience was the only criterion of right which he knew  this alone would decide which opn was right that for himself he had seen our affairs desperate  our credit lost and that this was in a sudden  extraordinary degree raised to the highest pitch i told him all that was ever necessary to establish our credit was an efficient govmt  an honest one declaring it would sacredly pay our debts laying taxes for this purpose  applying them to it i avoided going further into the subject he finished by another exhortation to me not to decide too positively on retirement  here we were called to breakfast oct         i had sent to the president joseph ignatius de viar  joseph de jaudeness  letter of the   th inst whereupon he desired a consultation of hamilton knox e r  myself on these points   what notice was to be taken hereof to spain   whether it should make part of the communicn to the legislature i delivered my opinion that it ought to be communicated to both houses because the communications intended to be made being to bring on the question whether they would declare     war against any  which of the nations or parts of the nations of indns to the south it would be proper this information should be before them that they might know how far such a declaration would lead them there might be some who would be for war agt the indians if it were to stop there but who would not be for it if it was to lead to a war agt spain i thot it should be laid before both houses because it concerned the question of declaring war which was the function equally of both houses i thot a simple acknolegmt of the rect of the lre should be made by me to the spanish chargés expressing that it contained some things very unexpected to us but that we should refer the whole as they had proposed to the negotiators at madrid this would secure to us a continuation of the suspension of indian hostilities which the govr of n orleans said he had brought about till the result of the negocian at madrid should be known would not commit us as to running or not running the line imply any admission of doubt about our territorial right  avoid a rupture with spain which was much to be desired while we had similar points to discuss with gr br hamilton declared himself the advocate for peace war would derange our affairs greatly throw us back many years in the march towards prosperity be difficult for us to pursue our countrymen not disposed to become souldiers a part of the union feeling no interest in the war would with difficulty be brought to exert itself and we had no navy he was for everything which would procrastinate the event a year even was a great gain to a nation     strengthening as we were it laid open to us too the chapter of accidents which in the present state of europe was a pretty pregnant one that while however he was for delaying the event of war he had no doubt it was to take place between us for the object in question that jealousy  perseverance were remarkable features in the character of the span govmt with respect to their american possns that so far from receding as to their claims against us they had been strengthening themselves in them he had no doubt the present communication was by authority from the court under this impression he thought we should be looking forward to the day of rupture  preparing for it that if we were unequal to the contest ourselves it behoved us to provide allies for our aid that in this view but two nations could be named france  eng france was too intimately connected with spain in other points  of too great mutual value ever to separate for us her affairs too were such that whatever issue they had she could not be in a situation to make a respectable mediation for us england alone then remained it would not be easy to effect it with her however he was for trying it and for sounding them on the proposition of a defensive treaty of alliance the inducements to such a treaty on their part might be   the desire of breaking up our former connections which we knew they had long wished   a continuance of the statu quo in commerce for  0 years which he believed would be desirable to them   an admission to some navigable part of the mississipi by some line   0 drawn from the lake of the woods to such navigable part he had not he said examined the map to see how such a line might be run so as not to make too great a sacrifice the navign of the missis being a joint possn we might then take measures in concert for the joint security of it he was therefore for immediately sounding them on this subject thro our minister at london yet so as to keep ourselves unengaged as long as possible in hopes a favorable issue with spain might be otherwise effected but he was for sounding immediately  for not slipping an opportunity of securing our object e r concurred in general with me he objected that such an alliance could not be effected without pecuniary considn probably which we could not give and what was to be their aid if men our citizens would see their armies get foothold in the u s with great jealousy it would be difficult to protect them even the french during the distresses of the late war excited some jealous sentiments hamilton said money was often but not always demanded  the aid he should propose to stipulate would be in ships—knox non dissentiente the president said the remedy would be worse than the disease and stated some of the disagreeable circumstances which would attend our making such overtures knoxs indirect hints in favor of this alliance brought to my recollection his conversn of yesterday  that he wished it nov    hamilton called on me to speak about     our furnishing supplies to the french colony of st domingo  he expressed his opn that we ought to be cautious  not go too far in our application of money to their use lest it should not be recognized by the mother country he did not even think that  some kinds of govt they might establish would give a sufficient sanction i observed that the national convent was now met  would certainly establish a form of govmt that as we had recognized the former govmt because establd by authority of the nation so we must recognize any other which should be establd by the authority of the nation he said we had recognized the former because it contained an important member of the antient to wit the king  wore the appearance of his consent but if in any future form they should omit the king he did not     know that we could with safety recognize it or pay money to its order nov         blodgets calculation of the circulating medium of philadelphia the bank of u s their whole stock              ½ of

indians at the proposed treaty rather than to admit a mediation     by gr br but to admit the presence of govr simcoe  not as a party if that was insisted on  that i should make a verbal communication to mr hammond in substance as on the back hereof which i previously read to the president dec    i made the communication to mr hammond he said the attendance of govr simcoe was a circumstance only mentioned by him but not desired that he would decline it without difficulty declared it to be their most ardent wish that peace should take place for their fur trade was entirely interrupted  he urged as decisive proofs of the sincerity of their wish   that they had kept the late indian council together   weeks at a very great expense waiting for the   nations   that the indians at that council were so perfectly satisfied of their desire that they should make peace that they had not so much as mentioned in council the applying to the british for any supplies i immediately communicated this to the president heads of conversation with mr hammond dec         that i communicated to the president his information of the consent of the western indians to hold conferences of peace with us in the presence of govr simcoe took care to apprize him of the informality of the conversn—yt it was accidl—private—the present     to be considered equally so—unnecessary to note to him that nothing like a mediation was suggested   because so informal a conversn cd not include so formal a thing as a mediation   bec an establd principle of public law among the white nations of america that while the indians included within their limits retain all other natl rights no other white nation can become their patrons protectors or mediators nor in any shape intermeddle between them  those within whose limits they are that gr br wd not propose an example wch wd authorize us to cross our boundary  take under our protection the indians within her limits   because should the treaty prove ineffectual it wd singularly commit the friendship of the two nations that the idea of govr simcoes attendance was presented only as a thing desird by the indians that the consequences of this had been considd it is not necessary in order to effect a peace our views so just so moderate that we have no fear of effecting peace if left to ourselves if it cannt be effected it is much better that nobody on the part of engld shd hve ben present—for however our govmt is persuaded of the sincerity of yr assurances yt y hve not excited the indians yet our citizens in general are not so it will be impossible to persuade them the negocns were not defeatd by brit agents that therefore tho we do not pretend to make the exclus of govr simcoe a sine quâ non provided he be there as a spectator not as a party     yet we shd consider his declining to attend either by himself or any other person as an instance of their frdshp  as an evidence of it particularly calculated to make due impression on the minds of our citizens that the place aux glaise fixed on by the indians is extremely inconvent to us because of the distance and difficulty of transportg provns there  00000 rations will probably be requisite if  000 indians attend that if we had time we would have proposed some other place e g the maumee towns but there not being time we shall do our best to make provn   we shall collect  carry

model  drawings of some mills for sawing stone after shewing them he in the course of subsequent conversation asked me if there were not some good manufactories of porcelain in germany that he was in want of table china  had been speaking to mr shaw who was going to the east indies to bring him a set but he found that it would not come till he should be no longer in a situation to want it he took occasion a second time to observe that shaw said it would be   years at least before he could have the china here before which time he said he should be where he should not need it i think he asked the question about the manufactories in germany merely     to have an indirect opportunity of telling me he meant to retire and within the limits of two years dec    hammond says the person is here to whom the   nations delivered the invtn for simcoe to attend who says they insisted on it  would consider his nonattendance as an evidence that he does not wish for peace but he says that simcoe has not the least idea of attending—that this gentleman says he may procure in upper canada any quantity of provns which the people will sett up express during winter  that he will return  carry our

g morris should be written to on this subject he went into the circumstances of dissatisfaction between spain gr brit  us  observed there was no nation on whom we could rely at all times but france and that if we did not prepare in time some support in the event of rupture with spain  england we might be charged with a criminal negligence     i was much pleased with the tone of these observations it was the very doctrine which had been my polar star and i did not need the successes of the republican arms in france lately announced to us to bring me to these sentiments for it is to be noted that on saturday last the   d i received mr shorts letters of oct       with the leyden gazettes to oct    giving us the first news of the retreat of the d of brunswic and the capture of spires  worms by custine and that of nice by anselme i therefore expressed to the president my cordial approbation of these ideas told him i had meant on that day as an opportunity of writing by the british packet would occur immediately to take his orders for removing the suspension of paiments to france which had been imposed by my last lre to g morris but was meant as i supposed only for the interval between the abolition of the late constn by the dethronement of the king and the meeting of some other body invested by the will of the nation with powers to transact their affairs that i considered the national convention then assembled as such a body and that therefore we ought to go on with the paiments to them or to any government they should establish that however i had learned last night that some clause in the bill for providing reimbursement of the loan made by the bank to the u s had given rise to a question before the house of representatives yesterday which might affect these paiments a clause in that bill proposing that the money formerly borrowed in amstdm to pay the french debt  appropriated by law    0 august   c        s   to that purpose lying dead as was suggested should be taken to pay the bank and the presidt be authorized to borrow   millions of dol more out of which it should be replaced and if this should be done the removal of our suspension of paiment as i had been about to propose would be premature he expressed his disapprobation of the clause above mentioned thought it highly improper in the legislature to change an appropriation once made and added that no one could tell in what that would end i concurred but observed that on a division of the house the ayes for striking out the clause were    the noes    whereon the speaker gave his vote against striking out which dividing the house the clause for the disappropriation remained of course i mentd suspicions that the whole of this was a trick to serve the bank under a great existing embarrassment that the debt to the bank was to be repd by instalments that the  st instalment was of  00000 d only or rather   0000 d because  0000 of the  00000 d would be the u states own dividend of the instalment yet here were  000000 to be paid them at once  to be taken from a purpose of gratitude  honor to which it had been appropriated dec  0    i took the occasion furnished by pinckneys letter of sep    asking instrns how to conduct himself as to the french revolution to lay down the catholic principal of republicanism to witthat every people may establish what form of government they please and change it as they please the will of the nation being the only thing essential   0 i was induced to do this in order to extract the presidents opn on the question which divided hamilton  myself in the conversn of nov    and the previous one or the first week of nov on the suspension of paimts to france and if favorable to mine to place the principles of record in the letter books of my office i therefore wrote the letter of dec  0 to pinckney  sent it to the president  he returned me his approbation in writing in his note of the same date which see feb        i waited on the president with letters  papers from lisbon after going through these i told him that i had for some time suspended speaking with him on the subject of my going out of office because i had understood that the bill for intercourse with foreign nations was likely to be rejected by the senate in which case the remaining business of the department would be too inconsiderable to make it worth while to keep it up but that the bill being now passed i was freed from the considerations of propriety which had embarrassed me that c nearly in the words of a letter to mr t m randolph of a few days ago  and that i should be willing if he had taken no arrangemts to the contrary to continue somewhat longer how long i could not say perhaps till summer perhaps autumn he said so far from takeng arrangements on the subject he had never mentioned to any mortal the design of retiring which i had expressed to him till yesterday having heard that i had given up my house  that it was rented by another thereupon he mentd it to mr e     randolph  asked him as he knew my retirement had been talked of whether he had heard any persons suggested in conversations to succeed me he expressed his satisfn at my change of purpose  his apprehensions that my retirement would be a new source of uneasiness to the public he said govr lee had that day informed of the genl discontent prevailing in virga of which he never had had any conception much less sound informn that it appeared to him very alarming he proceeded to express his earnest wish that hamilton  myself could coalesce in the measures of the govmt and urged here the general reasons for it which he had done to me on two former conversns he said he had proposed the same thing to ham who expresd his readiness and he thought our coalition would secure the general acquiescence of the public i told him my concurrence was of much less importce than he seemed to imagine that i kept myself aloof from all cabal  correspondence on the subject of the govmt  saw  spoke with as few as i could that as to a coalition with mr hamilton if by that was meant that either was to sacrifice his general system to the other it was impossible we had both no doubt formed our conclusions after the most mature consideration and principles conscientiously adopted could not be given up on either side my wish was to see both houses of congr cleansed of all persons interested in the bank or public stocks  that a pure legislature being given us i should always be ready to acquiesce under their determns even if contrary to my own opns for that i subscribe to the principle that the will of the     majority honestly expressed should give law i confirmed him in the fact of the great discontents to the south that they were grounded on seeing that their judgmts  interests were sacrificed to those of the eastern states on every occn  their belief that it was the effect of a corrupt squadron of voters in congress at the command of the treasury  they see that if the votes of those members who had an interest distinct from  contrary to the general interest of their constts had been withdrawn as in decency  honesty they should have been the laws would have been the reverse of what they are in all the great questions i instanced the new assumption carried in the h of repr by the speakers votes on this subject he made no reply he explained his remaing in office to have been the effect of strong solicitations after he returned here declaring that he had never mentd his purpose of going out but to the heads of depnts  mr madison he expressed the extreme wretchedness of his existence while in office and went lengthily into the late attacks on him for levees c—and explained to me how he had been led into them by the persons he consulted at new york and that if he could but know what the sense of the public was he would most cheerfully conform to it feb       e r tells j mad  myself a curious fact which he had from lear when the presidt went to n y he resisted for   weeks the efforts to introduce levees  at length he yielded  left it to     humphreys and some others to settle the forms accdly an antichamber  presence room were provided  when those who were to pay their court were assembled the president set out preceded by humphreys after passing thro the antichamber the door of the inner room was thrown in  humphreys entered first calling out with a loud voice the president of the u s the president was so much disconcerted with it that he did not recover it the whole time of the levee and when the company was gone he said to humphreys well you have taken me in once but by god you shall never take me in a second time there is reason to believe that the rejection of the late additional assumption by the senate was effected by the president thro lear operating on langdon beckley knows this feb  0      colo w s smith called on me to communicate intelligence from france he had left paris nov   he says the french ministers are entirely broken with gouvr morris shut their doors to him  will never receive another communication from him they wished smith to be the bearer of a message from the presidt to this effect but he declined  they said in that case they would press it thro their own minister here he says they are sending genet here with full powers to give us all the privileges we can desire in their countries  particularly in the w indies that they even contemplate     to set them free the next summer that they propose to emancipate s america and will send    ships of the line there next spring  miranda at the head of the expedn that they desire our debt to be paid them in provns and have authorized him to negotiate this in confirmn of this he delivers a letter to the presidt from lebrun min for forn affrs in which lebrun says that colo smith will communicate plans worthy of his the prs great mind  he shall be happy to receive his opn as to the means the most suitable to effect it i had   or   days ago received from ternant extracts from the lres of his ministers complaing of both g morris  mr short i sent them this day to the presidt with an extract from a private lre of mr short justifying himself  i called this eveng on the presidt he said he considd the extracts from ternant as very serious in short as decisive that he saw that g morris cd be no longer contind there consistent with the public good that the moment was critical in our favor  ot not to be lost that he was extremely at a loss what arrangement to make i asked him whether g morris  pinckney mt not change places he sd that wd be a sort of remedy but not a radical one that if the french ministry conceived g m to be hostile to them if they hd bn jealous merely on his proposing to visit london they wd nevr be satisfd with us at placing him at london permanently he then observed that tho i had unfixed the day on which i had intendd to resign yet i appeared fixed in doing it at no great distance of time that in this case he cd     not but wish that i wd go to paris that the moment was important i possessed the confidence of both sides  might do great good that he wished i could do it were it only to stay there a year or two i told him that my mind was so bent on retirement that i could not think of launching forth again in a new business that i could never again cross the atlantic and that as to the opportunity of doing good this was likely to be the scene of action as genet was bringing powers to do the business here but that i could not think of going abroad he replied that i had pressed him to continue in the public service  refused to do the same myself i said the case was very different he united the confidce of all america and was the only person who did so his services therefore were of the last importance but for myself my going out would not be noted or known a thousand others could supply my place to equal advantage therefore i felt myself free and that as to the mission to france i thought pinckney perfectly proper he desired me then to consider maturely what arrangemt shd be made smith in speaking of morris said that at his own table in presence of his company  servts he cursed the french ministers as a set of damned rascals said the king wd still be replaced on his throne he said he knew they had written to have him recalled  expected to be recalled he consulted smith to know whether he cd bring his furniture here duty free smith has mentd the situatn of g morris freely to others here smith said also that the ministers told him they     meant to begin their attack at the mouth of the missi and to sweep along the bay of mexico southwardly and that they would have no objns to our incorporating into our govmt the two floridas feb         notes on the proceedings of yesterday see the formal opinions given to the president in writing  signed   st qu we were all of opinion that the treaty shd proceed merely to gratify the public opinion  not from any expectation of success i expressed myself strongly that the event was so unpromising that i thought the preparations for a campaign should go on without the least relaxation and that a day should be fixed with the commrs for the treaty beyond which they should not permit the treaty to be protracted by which day orders shd be given for our forces to enter into action the president took up the thing instantly after i had said this and declared he was so much in the opn that the treaty would end in nothing that he then in the presence of us all gave orders to genl knox not to slacken the preparations for the campaign in the least but to exert every nerve in preparing for it knox said something about the ultimate day for continuing the negotias i acknoleged myself not a judge on what day the campaign should begin but that whatever it was that day should determine the treaty knox said he thought a winter campaign was always the most efficacious against the indians i was of opn since gr britain insisted on furnishing provns that     we should offer to repay hamilton thot we should not  d qu i considered our right of preemption of the indian lands not as amounting to any dominion or jurisdn or paramountship whatever but merely in the nature of a remainder after the extingmt of a present right which gave us no present right whatever but of preventing other nations from taking possession and so defeating our expectancy that the indians had the full undivided  independant sovereignty as long as they chose to keep it  that this might be forever that as fast as we extended our rights by purchase from them so fast we extended the limits of our society  as soon as a new portion became encircled within our line it became a fixt limit of our society that the executive with either or both branches of the legislature could not alien any part of our territory that by the l of nations it was settled that the unity  indivisibility of the society was so fundamental that it could not be dismembered by the constituted authorities except   where all power was delegated to them as in the case of despotic govmts or   where it was expressly delegated that neither of these delegations had been made to our general govmt  therefore that it had no right to dismember or alienate any portion of territory once ultimately consolidated with us and that we could no more cede to the indians than to the english or spaniards as it might according to acknolegd principles remain as irrevocably and eternally with the one as the other but i thought that as we had a right to sell  settle lands once     comprehended within our lines so we might forbear to exercise that right retaining the property till circumstances should be more favorable to the settlement and this i agreed to do in the present instance if necessary for peace hamilton agreed the doctrine of the law of nations as laid down in europe but that it was founded on the universality of settlement there conseqly that no lopping off of territory cd be made without a lopping off of citizens which required their consent but that the law of nations for us must be adapted to the circumstance of our unsettled country which he conceived the presidt  senate may cede that the power of treaty was given to them by the constn without restraining it to particular objects conseqly that it was given in as plenipotentiary a form as held by any sovereign in any other society—e r was of opn there was a difference between a cession to indns  to any others because it only restored the ceded part to the condn in which it was before we bought it and consequently that we might buy it again hereafter therefore he thought the exec  senate could cede it knox joined in the main opn the presidt discovd no opn but he made some efforts to get us to join in some terms which could unite us all and he seemed to direct those efforts more towards me but the thing could not be done  d qu we agreed in idea as to the line to be drawn to wit so as to retain all lands appropriated or granted or reserved  th qu we all thought if the senate should be     consulted  consequently apprized of our line it would become known to hammond  we should lose all chance of saving anything more at the treaty than our ultimatum qu whether we should furnish the   millns of livres desired by france to procure provns i was of opn we ot to do it the one part as an arrearage abt    000 the residue as an advance towards our payments to be made in paris in sep  nov next e r was for furnishing the whole sum asked but under such blind terms that if the present french government should be destroyed  the former one reestablished it might not be imputed to us as a proof of our taking part with the present but might be excused under a pretext that we thought we might owe it knox of the same opn hamilton saw the combinn of powers agt france so strong as to render the issue very doubtful he therefore was agt going beyond the    000 d understood to be in arrear the presidt at this meeting mentd the declaration of some person in a paper of fenno  that he would commence an attack on the character of dr franklin he said the theme was to him excessively disagreeable on other considerations but most particularly so as the party seemed to do it as a means of defending him the presidt agt the late attacks on him that such a mode of defence would be peculiarly painful to him  he wished it could be stopped hamilton  e r undertook to speak to fenno to suppress it without mentiong it as the presidents   0 wish both observed that they had heard this declarn mentd in many companies  that it had excited universal horror  detestation the paper in fenno must lie between two persons viz adams  izard because they are the only persons who could know such facts as are there promised to be unfolded adams is an enemy to both characters and might chuse this ground as an effectual position to injure both izard hated franklin with unparalleled bitterness but humbly adores the presidt because he is in loco regis if the paper proceeds we shall easily discover which of these two gentlemen is the champion in the meantime the first paper leads our suspicions more towards izard than adams from the circumstance of stile and because he is quite booby enough not to see the injury he would do to the president by such a mode of defence feb    knox e r and myself met at knoxs where hamilton was also to have met to consider the time manner  place of the presidents swearing in  hamilton had been there before  had left his opn with knox to wit that the presid shd ask a judge to attend him in his own house to administer the oath in the presence of the heads of deptmts which oath should be deposited in the secy of states office i concurred in this opn e r was for the presidents going to the senate chamber to take the oath attended by the marshal of the u s who     should then make proclmn c knox was for this and for adding the house of repr to the presence as they would not yet be departed our individl opns were written to be communicated to the presidt out of which he might form one in the course of our conversn knox stickling for parade got into great warmth and swore that our govmt must either be entirely new modeled or it would be knocked to pieces in less than  0 years and that as it is at present he would not give a copper for it that it is the presidents character  not the written constn which keeps it together same day conversn with lear he expressed the strongest confidence that republicanism was the universal creed of america except of a very few that republican adminn must of necessity immediately overbear the contrary faction said that he had seen with extreme regret that a number of gentlemen had for a long time been endeavoring to instil into the president that the noise agt the admn of the govmt was that of a little faction which wd soon be silent  which was detested by the people who were contented  prosperous that this very party however began to see their error and that the sense of america was bursting forth to their conviction mar        see in the papers of this date mr giless resolutions  he  one or two others were sanguine enough to believe that the palpableness of     these resolns rendered it impossible the house could reject them those who knew the composition of the house   of bank directors   holders of bank stock   stockjobbers   blind devotees   ignorant persons who did not comprehend them   lazy  goodhumored persons who comprehended  acknoleged them yet were too lazy to examine or unwilling to pronounce censure the persons who knew these characters foresaw that the   first descriptions making ⅓ of the house the   latter would make ½ of the residue and of course that they would be rejected by a majority of   to   but they thought that even this rejection would do good by shewing the public the desperate  abandoned dispositions with which their affairs were entrusted the resolns were proposed and nothing spared to present them in the fulness of demonstration there were not more than   or   who voted

meeting at the presids feb    in discussing the question whether we should furnish to france the  000000 desired hamilton in speaking on the subject used this expression when     mr genet arrives whether we shall receive him or not will then be a question for discussion  which expression i did not recollect till e r reminded me of it a few days after therefore on the  0th inst as the prest was shortly to set out for m vernon i observed to him that as genest might arrive in his absence i wishd to know beforehand how i should treat him whether as a person who wd or wd not be receivd he said he could see no ground of doubt but that he ought to be received on the   th he asked e rs opn on the subject saying he had consulted colo hamilton thereon who went into lengthy considns of doubt and difficulty and viewing it as a very unfortunate thing that the presidt shd have the decisn of so critical a point forced on him but in conclusion said since he was brot into that situan he did not see but that he must receive mr genest e r told the presidt he was clear he shd be recd  the presidt said he hd never hd any doubt on the subject in his mind—afterwards on the same day he spoke to me again on it and said mr genest should unquestionably be received but he thought not with too much warmth or cordiality so only as to to be satisfactory to him  i wondered at first at     this restriction but when e r afterwards communicated to me this conversn of the   th i became satisfied it was a small sacrifice to the opn of hamilton mar    mr beckley tells me that the merchants bonds for duties on   mo credit became due the  st inst to a very great amount that hamilton went to the bank on that day and directed the bank to discount for those merchts all their bonds at  0 days and that he would have the collectors credited for the money at the treasury hence the treasury lumping its receipts by the month in its printed accts these sums will be considered by the public as only recd on the last day conseqly the bank makes the months interest out of it beckley had this from a mercht who hd a bond discounted  who supposes a million of dollars were discounted at the bank here mr brown got the same informn from another mercht who supposed only  00000 d discounted here but they suppose the same orders went to all the branch banks to a great amount eod die mr brown tells me he has it from a mercht that during the last winter the directors of the bank ordd the freest discounts every man could obtain it money being so flush the   per cents run up to        then the directors sold out their private stocks when the discounted notes were becoming due they stopped discounts      not a dollar was to be had this reduced   per cents to      then the same directors bought in again apr      mr lear called on me  introduced of himself a conversation of the affairs of the u s he laughed at the cry of prosperity  the deriving it from the establmt of the treasury he said that so far from giving into this opn  that we were payg off our national debt he was clear the debt was growing on us that he had lately expressed this opn to the presidt who appeared much astonished at it i told him i had given the same hint to the p last summer  lately again had suggested that we were even depending for the daily subsistence of govmt on borrowed money he said that was certain  was the only way of accounting for what was become of the money drawn over from holland to this country—he regretted that the pr was not in the way of hearing full informn declared he communicated to him everything he could learn himself that the men who vaunted the present govmt so much on some occasions were the very men who at other times declared it was a poor thing  such a one as could not stand  he was sensible they only esteemed it as a stepping stone to something else and had availed themselves of the first moments of the enthusiasm in favor of it to pervert its principles  make of it what they wanted  that tho they raised the cry of antifederalism against those who censured the mode of admn yet he was satisfd whenever it should come to be tried that the very men whom they called antifederalists     were the men who would save the govmt  he looked to the next congress for much rectification eod die mr beckley tells me that a gentleman heartily a fiscalist called on him yesterday told him he had been to n york  into the prison with duer  with whome he hd mch conversn that pintard duers agent has about  00000 d worth of property in his hands  bids defiance that this embarrasses duer much who declares that if certain persons do not relieve him shortly he will unfold such a scene of villainy as will astonish the world apr    the president sends a set of questions to be considered   calls a meeting tho those sent me were in his own hand writing yet it was palpable from the style their ingenious tissu  suite that they were not the presidents that they were raised upon a prepared chain of argument in short that the language was hamiltons and the doubts his alone they led to a declaration of the executive that our treaty with france is void e r the next day told me that the day before the date of these questions hamilton went with him thro the whole chain of reasoning of which these questions are the skeleton  that he recognized them the moment he saw them we met the  st question whether we should receive the french minister genest was proposed  we agreed unanimously that he should be received     hamilton at the same time expressing his great regret that any incident had happd which should oblige us to recognize the govmt the next question was whether he shd be received absolutely or with qualificns here h took up the whole subject and went through it in the order in which the questions sketch it see the chain of his reasoning in my opn of apr    knox subscribed at once to hs opn that we ought to declare the treaty void  acknoleging at the same time like a fool that he is that he knew nothing about it i was clear it remained valid e r declared himself of the same opn but on hs undertaking to present to him the authority in vattel which we had not present and to prove to him that if the authority was admitted the treaty might be declared void e r agreed to take further time to consider it was adjourned we determd unanimly the last qu that congress shd nt be called there havg been an intimation by e r that in so great a question he shd chuse to give a written opn  this being approvd by the pres i gave in mine apr    h gave in his i believe knoxs was never thought worth offering or asking for e r gave his may   concurring with mine the presidt told me the same day he had never had a doubt about the validity of the treaty but that since a question had been suggested he thought it ot to be considered     that this being done i might now issue passports to sea vessels in the form prescribed by the french treaty i had for a week past only issd the dutch form to have issd the french wd have been presupposing the treaty to be in existence the presidt suggested that he thot it wd be as well that nothing should be sd of such a question havg been under considn may   written      may   the president shews me a draught of a lre from colo h  to the collectors of the customs desirg them to superintend their neighborhood watch for all acts of our citizens contrary to laws of neutrality or tending to infringe those laws  inform him of it  particularly to see if vessels should be building pierced for guns i told the pr that at a conference a few days before colo h  e r had concurred in opn agt me that for us to build and sell vessels fit for war would be a breach of neutrality but that i understood them as agreeing that no opn should go from the public on that question as not being now necessary that as to the  st part of the letter i did not of a sudden decide it to be improper—he on this returned the draught to ham with a desire that he e r  myself would confer on it may   we met as trustees of the sinkg fund for the opn i delivered see my note of may   to e r  for his see his answer of may  —on the   0 business of the sinkg fund we had meant to have come to a resoln to ask of the pres if there was any money under the loans at our disposal the occasion of laying it out being favble but h producd a lre just recd from our bankers informg him of the impossibility of effecting the new loan which had been ordered and of which i had not heard before on this i declared it is my opn that if the money on hand was not sfft to pay our next instllmt to france  also to purchase public debt of which i could not be a judge only knowg that our next instllmt wd be of bettween     00000 d  was approachg i should be against failing in the paymt which was a positive engagemt whereas the purchase of public debt was voluntary so nothing was done when the question was whether the proclmn of apr     should be issued e r observed that there should be a letter written by me to the ministers of the belligerent powers to declare that it should not be taken as conclusive evidence against our citizens in foreign courts of admiralty for contraband goods—knox suddenly adopted the opn before hamilton delivered his hamilton opposed it pretty strongly i thought it an indifferent thing but rather approved e rs opn the president was against it but observed that as there were three for it it should go this was the first instance i had seen of an opportunity to decide by a mere majority including his own vote may    lear called on me today speaking     of the lowness of stocks    i observed it was a pity we had not money to buy on publick acct he said yes  that it was the more provoking as   millions hd been borrowed for that purpose  drawn over here  yet were not here that he had no doubt those would take notice of the circumstance whose duty it was to do so—i suppose

r for ordering away the privateer  nothing more the president confirmed the last opinion  it seemed to be his own       may    i had sent to the president yesterday draughts of a letter from him to the provisory exec council of france and of one from myself to mr ternant both on the occasion of his recall i called on him today he said there was a word in one of them which he had never before seen in any of our public communications to wit our republic the letter prepared for him to the council begun thus the citizen ternant has delivered to me the letter wherein you inform me that yielding c you had determined to recall him from his mission as your min plen to our republic he had underscored the words our republic he said that certainly ours was a republican government but yet we had not used that stile in this way that if any body wanted to change its form into a monarchy he was sure it     was only a few individuals  that no man in the u s would set his face against it more than himself but that this was not what he was afraid of his fears were from another quarter that there was more danger of anarchy being introduced he adverted to a piece in freneaus paper of yesterday he said he despised all their attacks on him personally but that there never had been an act of the government not meaning in the executive line only but in any line which that paper had not abused he had also marked the word republic thus √ where it was applied to the french republic see the original paper he was evidently sore  warm and i took his intention to be that i should interpose in some way with freneau perhaps withdraw his appointment of translating clerk to my office but i will not do it his paper has saved our constitution which was galloping fast into monarchy  has been checked by no one means so powerfully as by that paper it is well  universally known that it has been that paper which has checked the career of the monocrats  the president not sensible of the designs of the party has not with his usual good sense and sang froid looked on the efforts and effects of this free press  seen that tho some bad things had passed thro it to the public yet the good have preponderated immensely june      mr beckley who is returned from n york within a few days tells me that while he was there s john temple consul genl of the northern states for gr br shewed him a letter from sr     gregory page turner  a member of parliament for a borough in yorkshire who he said had been a member for    years and always confidential for the ministers in which he permitted him to read particular passages of the following purport that the government were well apprized of the predominancy of the british interest in the u s that they considered col hamilton mr king  mr w smith of s carolina as the main supports of that interest that particularly they considered colo hamilton  not mr hammond as their effective minister here that if the antifederal interest that was his term at the head of which they considered mr jefferson to be should prevail these gentlemen had secured an asylum to themselves in england beckley cd not understand whether they had secured it themselves  or whether they were only notified that it was secured to them so that they understand that they may go on boldly in their machinations to change the govmt and if they should be overset  chuse to withdraw they will be secure of a pension in england as arnold deane c had sr john read passages of a letter which he did not put into beckleys hand as he did the other from ld grenville saying nearly the same things this letter mentions to sr john that tho they had divided the consulgeneralship and given the southern department to bond yet he sr john was to retain his whole salary by this it would seem as if     wanting to use bond they had covered his employment with this cloak mr beckley says that sr john temple is a strong republican—i had a proof of his intimacy with sr john in this circumstance sr john received his new commission of consul for the northern department and instead of sending it thro mr hammond got beckley to enclose it to me for his exequatur i wrote to sr john that it must come thro mr hammond enclosing it back to him he accordingly then sent it to mr hammond in conversation with the president today and speaking about genl greene he said that he  genl greene had always differed in opn about the manner of using militia greene always placed them in his front himself was of opn they should always be used as a reserve to improve any advantage for which purpose they were the finest fellows in the world he said he was on the ground of the battle of guilford with a person who was in the action  who explained the whole of it to him that general greenes front was behind a fence at the edge of a large field thro which the enemy were obliged to pass to get at them  that in their passage thro this they must have been torn all to peices if troops had been posted there who would have stood their ground  that the retreat from that position was through a thicket perfectly secure instead of this he posted the n caroline militia there who only gave one fire  fell back so that the whole benefit of their position was lost he thinks that the regulars with their field pieces would have hardly let a single man get through that field     eod die june   beckley tells me that he has the followg fact from govr clinton that before the proposn for the present general govmt i e a little before hamilton conceived a plan for establishing a monarchical govmt in the u s he wrote a draught of a circular letter which was to be sent to about — persons to bring it about one of these letters in hamiltons handwriting is now in possn of an old militia genl up the north river who at that time was thought orthodox enough to be entrusted in the execution this general has given notice to govr clinton that he has this paper and that he will deliver it into his hands  no ones else clinton intends the first interval of leisure to go for it and he will bring it to philade beckley is a man of perfect truth as to what he affirms of his own knolege but too credulous as to what he hears from others  june  0    mr brown gives me the following specimen of the phrenzy which prevailed at new york on the opening of the new govmt the first public ball which took place after the presidents arrival there colo humphreys colo w s smith  mrs knox were to arrange the ceremonials these arrangements were as follows a sopha at the head of the room raised on several steps whereon the presidt  mrs washington were to be seated the gentlemen were to dance in swords each one when going to dance was to lead his partner to the foot of the sopha make a low obeisance to the     presidt  his lady then go  dance  when done bring his partner again to the foot of the sopha for new obeisances  then to retire to their chairs it was to be understood too that gentlemen should be dressed in bags mrs knox contrived to come with the president  to follow him  mrs washington to their destination  she had the design of forcing an invitn from the presidt to a seat on the sopha she mounted up the steps after them unbidden but unfortunately the wicked sopha was so short that when the presidt  mrs washington were seated there was not room for a   person she was obliged therefore to descend in the face of the company  to sit where she could in other respects the ceremony was conducted rigorously according to the arrangements  the president made to pass an evening which his good sense rendered a very miserable one to him  june    beckley tells me that klingham  has been with him to day  relates to him the following fact a certificate of the old congress had been offered at the treasury  refused payment  so indorsed in red ink as usual this certificate came to the hands of francis the quondam clerk of the     treasury who on account of his being dipped in the infamous case of the baron glaubec hamilton had been obliged to dismiss to save appearances but with an assurance of all future service  he accdly got him establd in new york francis wrote to hamilton that such a ticket was offered him but he could not buy it unless he would inform him  give him his certificate that it was good hamilton wrote him a most friendly letter  sent him the certificate he bot the paper  came on here  got it recognized whereby he made   00 dollars klingham saw both the letter  certificate irving  a clerk in the treasury an irishman is the author of the pieces now coming out under the signature of veritas   attacking the president i have long suspected this detestable game was playing by the fiscal party to place the presidt on their side july        a meeting desired by a h at my office himself knox  myself met accdly he said that according to what had been agreed on in presence of the president in conseqce of mr genets declining to pay the   000 d at his command in   0 the treasury to the holders of the st domingo bills we had agreed to pay the holders out of other monies to that amount that he found however that these bills would amount to  0000 d and the question was whether he should assume  0000 to be paid out of the september instalment this he said wd enable holders to get discounts at the banks would therefore be equal to ready money  save them from bankruptcy unanimously agreed to we also agreed to a lre written by genl knox to govr mifflin to have a particular inquiry made whether the little sarah  is arming c or not i read lre from the presidt about the swallow lre of marck at n york compld of by the french consul agreed as the case was new to let it wait for the presidt  i read also govr lees lre abt the govr of s cs proclamn respectg pestilential disease in w indies we are all of opn the evidence is too slight for interferce  doubt the power to interfere therefore let it lie mr genet called on me and read to me very rapidly instrns he had prepared for michaud  who is going to kentucky an address to the inhab of louisiana  another to those of canada in these papers it appears that besides encouraging those inhabitants     to insurrection he speaks of two generals at kentucky who have proposed to him to go  take n orleans if he will furnish the exp about £ 000 sterl he declines advancing it but promises that sum ultimately for their expenses proposes that officers shall be commissd by himself in kentucky  louisiana that they shall rendezvous out of the territories of the u s suppose in louisiana  there making up a battalion to be called the— —of inhabitants of louisiana  kentucky and getting what indns they could to undertake the expedn against n orleans and then louisiana to be established into an independant state connected in commerce with france and the u s that two frigates shall go into the river mississippi and cooperate against n orleans the address to canada was to encourage them to shake off english yoke to call indians to their assistance and to assure them of the friendly disposns of their neighbors of the u s he said he communicated these things to me not as secy of state but as mr jeff i told him that his enticing officers  souldiers from kentucky to go against spain was really putting a halter about their necks for that they would assuredly be hung if they commd hostilities agt a nation at peace with the u s that leaving out that article i did not care what insurrections should be excited in louisiana he had about a fortnight ago sent me a commn for michaud as consul of france at kentucky  desired an exequatur i told him this could not be given that it was only in the ports of the u s they were entitled to consuls  that if france shd have a     consul at kentucky engld and spain would soon demand the same  we shd have all our interior country filled with foreign agents he acquiesced  asked me to return the commission  his note which i did but he desired i would give michaud a lre of introduction for govr shelby i sent him one a day or two after he now observes to me that in that letter i speak of him only as a person of botanical  natural pursuits but that he wished the govr to view him as something more as a french citizen possessing his confidence i took back the letter  wrote another see both july  0        the secretary of the treasury having communicated to general knox and myself that he had been informed that the little sarah had much augmented her arms and was greatly advanced in her preparations we concurred in opinion that the governor of pennsylvania should be desired to have a reexamination of the fact it was done and a report made that she had entered the port with only four guns and now had fourteen the next day being sunday the  th instant i received a letter from the governor by express informing me that he understood she would sail that day i went instantly to town he told me he had received the intelligence the night before and had sent mr dallas at midnight     to m genet mr dallas told me that on his proposing the subject of detaining the vessel he flew into a great passion talked extravagantly and concluded by refusing to order the vessel to stay as the governor had sent for general knox also i told him i would in the meantime go to m genet and speak with him on the subject i went on his coming into the room i told him i had called on the subject of the little sarah that our information was that she was armed contrary to the decision of the president which had been communicated to him and that she would sail that day and i requested that he would detain her till we could inquire into the fact and lay it before the president who would be here on wednesday he took up the subject instantly in a very high tone and went into an immense field of declamation and complaint i found it necessary to let him go on and in fact could do not otherwise for the few efforts which i made to take some part in the conversation were quiet ineffectual it is impossible for me to state the particulars of what he said such of the general topics as i can now recollect were these he charged us with having violated the treaties between the two nations and so went into the cases which had before been subjects of discussion complained that we suffered our flag to be insulted and disregarded by the english that they stopped all our vessels and took out of them whatever they suspected to be french property that they had taken all the provisions he had embarked in american vessels for the colonies that if we were not able to     protect their vessels in our ports nor their property on the high seas we ought to permit them to protect it themselves that they on the contrary paid the highest respect to our flag that though it was notorious that most of the cargoes sent from america were british property yet being in american vessels or pretended american vessels they never touched it and thus had no chance of retaliating on their enemies that he had been thwarted and opposed in everything he had had to do with the government that he found himself in so disagreeable a situation that he sometimes thought of packing up and going away as he found he could not be useful to his nation in any thing he dwelt on the friendly propositions he brought from his nation on the instructions and dispositions with which he came to do whatever would gratify us that to such propositions such a return ought not to have been made by the executive without consulting congress and that on the return of the president he would certainly press him to convene congress he had by this time got into a moderate tone and i stopped him at the subject of calling congress explained our constitution to him as having divided the functions of government among three different authorities the executive legislative and judiciary each of which were supreme in all questions belonging to their departments and independent of the others that all the questions which had arisen between him and us belonged to the executive department and if congress were sitting could not be carried to them nor would they take notice of them     he asked if they were not the sovereign i told him so they were sovereign in making laws only the executive was sovereign in executing them and the judiciary in construing them where they related to their department but said he at least congress are bound to see that the treaties are observed i told him no there were very few cases indeed arising out of treaties which they could take notice of that the president is to see that treaties are observed if he decides against the treaty to whom is a nation to appeal i told him the constitution had made the president the last appeal he made me a bow and said that indeed he would not make me his compliments on such a constitution expressed the utmost astonishment at it and seemed never before to have had such an idea he was now come into perfect good humor and coolness in which state he may with the greatest freedom be spoken with i observed to him the impropriety of his conduct in persevering in measures contrary to the will of the government and that too within its limits wherein unquestionably they had a right to be obeyed but said he i have a right to expound the treaty on our side certainly said i each party has an equal right to expound their treaties you as the agent of your nation have a right to bring forward your exposition to support it by reasons to insist on it to be answered with the reasons for our exposition where it is contrary and when after hearing and considering your reasons the highest authority in the nation has     decided it is your duty to say you think the decision wrong that you cannot take upon yourself to admit it and will represent it to your government to do as they think proper but in the meantime you ought to acquiesce in it and to do nothing within our limits contrary to it he was silent as to this and i thought was sensible it was right i brought him to the point of the little sarah and pressed his detaining of her till the presidents return why detain her said he because said i she is reported to be armed with guns acquired here he said the guns were all french property and surely we did not pretend to control them in the disposal of their own property that he could name to me the french vessels from which he had taken every gun i told him i would be obliged to him for any evidence of that fact with which he would furnish me and repeated my request to detain the vessel he was embarrassed and unwilling he said he should not be justified in detaining her i told him it would be considered a very serious offence indeed if she should go away that the government was determined on that point and thinking it was right would go through with it after some hesitation he said he could not make any promise it would be out of his duty but that he was very happy in being able to inform me that the vessel was not in readiness and therefore could not sail that day i asked him if i might rely that she would not be ready to sail before the return of the president he then spoke of her unreadiness indefinitely     as to time said she had many things to do yet and would not be ready for some time he did not know when and whenever i tried to fix it to the presidents return he gave the same answer that she would not be ready for some time but with the look and gesture which showed he meant i should understand she would not be gone before that time but said he she is to change her position and fall down the river today but she will not depart yet what said i will she fall down to the lower end of the town i do not exactly know where said he but somewhere there for the convenience of getting ready some things but let me beseech you not to permit any attempt to put men on board of her she is filled with highspirited patriots and they will unquestionably resist and there is no occasion for i tell you she will not be ready to depart for some time i told him then i would take it for granted she would not be ready before the presidents return that in the meantime we would have inquiries made into the facts and would thank him for information on the subject and that i would take care that the case should be laid before the president the day after his return he promised to give me a state of facts the next day i then returned to the governor told him what had passed and that i was satisfied that though the vessel was to fall somewhere down the river she would not sail he thereupon ordered the militia to be dismissed on repeating to him and mr dallas what m genet     had said we found it agreed in many particulars with what he had said to mr dallas but mr dallas mentioned some things which he had not said to me and particularly his declaration that he would appeal from the president to the people he did in some part of his declamation to me drop the idea of publishing a narrative or statement of transactions but he did not on that nor ever did on any other occasion in my presence use disrespectful expressions of the president he from a very early period showed that he believed there existed here an english party and ascribed to their misinformations industry and manœuvres some of the decisions of the executive he is not reserved on this subject he complains of the partiality of the information of tho seemployed by government who never let a single movement of a french vessel pass unnoticed nor ever inform of an english one arming or not till it is too late to stop her the next day monday i met the secretaries of the treasury and war in the governors office they proposed our ordering a battery to be erected on mud island immediately guns to be mounted to fire on the vessel and even to sink her if she attempted to pass i refused to concur in the order for reasons assigned in another paper the vessel was then at gloucester point whether any intention of this proposition got out i do not know but she very soon after fell down to chester on a suggestion that there were fifteen or twenty americans on board we desired mr rawle to take measures to prosecute them     a recapitulation of questions whereon we have given opinions  does the treaty with france leave us free to prohibit her from arming vessels in our ports th j h k  r unanimous it does as the treaty obliges us to prohibit the enemies of france from arming in our ports  leaves us free to prohibit france do not the laws of neutrality oblige us to prohibit her same persons unan they do how far may a prohibition now declared be retrospective to the vessels armed in charlestown before the prohibition to wit the citoyen genet  sans culottes  what is to be done with these prizes th j—it cannot be retrospective at all they may sell their prizes  continue to act freely as other armed vessels of france h  k—the prizes ought to be given up to the english  the privateers suppressed r—they are free to sell their prizes  the privateers shd be ordered away not to return here till they shall have been to the domns of their own sovereign  thereby purged the illegality of their origin this last opinion was adopted by the president our citizens who have joined in these hostilities agt nations at peace with the u s are they punishable e r gave an official opinion they were th j h  k joined in the opinion all thought it our duty to have prosecutions instituted against them that the laws might pronounce on their case in the  st instance two only were prosecuted merely to try   0 the question  to satisfy the complt of the british min  because it was thought they might have offended unwittingly but a subsequent armament of a vessel at new york taking place with full knolege of this prosecution all the persons engaged in it citizens  foreigners were ordd to be prosecutd may the prohibition extend to the means of the party arming or are they only prohibited from using our means for the annoyance of their enemy th j of opn they are free to use their own means i e to mount their own guns c h  k of opn they are not to put even their own implements or means into a posture of annoyance the president has as yet not decided this may an armed vessel arriving here be prohibited to employ their own citizens found here as seamen or mariners th j—they cannot be prohibited to recruit their own citizens h  knox—they may  ought to be prohibited no decision yet by the president it appears to me the president wished the little sarah had been stopped by military coercion that is by firing on her yet i do not believe he would have ordered himself had he been here tho he would be glad if we had ordered it the u s being a ship building nation may they sell ships prepared for war to both parties th j—they may sell such ships in their ports to both parties or carry them for sale to the domns of both parties e r of opn they could not sell them here  that if they attempted to carry them to the domns of the parties for sale they might be seized by the     way as contraband h of same opn except that he did not consider them as seizable for contraband but as the property of a power making itself a party in the war by an aid of such a nature  consequently that it would be a breach of neutrality h moves that the govmt of france be desired to recall mr genet knox adds  that he be in the meantime suspended from his functions th j proposes that his correspondence be communicated to his govmt with friendly observns presidt silent  july    th j h  k met at the presidents govr mifflin had appld to knox for the loan of   cannon to mount at mud isld informd him he shd station a guard of    militia there  asked what arrangemt for rations the genl govmt had taken knox told him nothing could be done as to rations  he wd ask the presidt for the cannon in the meantime he promd him to put the cannon on board a boat ready to send off as soon as permission was obtd the presidt declared his own opn first  fully that when the orders were given to the governrs to stop vessels armg c in our ports even by military force he took for granted the govrs wd use such diligence as to detect those projects in embryo  stop them when no force was requisite or a very small party of militia wd suffice that here was a demand from the governr of penve to land   cannon under pretext of executing orders of the genl govmt that if this was granted we shd be     immedly appld to by every other governor  that not for one place only but several  our cannon wd be dispersd all over the u s that for this reason we hd refusd the same request to the govrs of s c virgi  r i that if they erected batteries they must establish men for them  would come on us for this too he did not think the executive had a power to establish permanent guards he had never looked to anything permanent when the orders were given to the governors but only an occasional call on small parties of militia in the moments requirg it these sentiments were so entirely my own that i did little more than combat on the same grounds the opns of h  k the latter said he would be ready to lend an equal number to every govmt to carry into effect orders of such importance  h that he would be ready to lend them in cases where they happened to be as near the place where they were to be mounted hamilton submitted the purchase of a large quantity of salt petre which would outrun the funds destined to objects of that class by congress we were unanimous we ought to venture on it and to the procuring supplies of military stores in the present circumstances and take on us the responsibility to congress before whom it should be laid the president was fully of the same opn in the above case of the cannon the president gave no final order while i remained but i saw that he was so impressed with the disagreeableness of taking them out of the boat again that he would yield he spoke sharply to knox for having put     them in that position without consulting him  declared that but for that circumstance he would not have hesitated one moment to refuse them july       at a meetg at the presids genl knox tells us govr blount now in town has informed him that when mt florence ws in france certn members of ye execve council enquird of him what were the disposns of cumbld settlemt c towds spain mt florce told them unfriendly they then offd him a commissn to embody troops there to give him a quantity of blank commns to be filled up by him making officers of the republic of france those who shd command  undertake to pay the expences mt florce desird his name mt nt be used blount added that mt florce while in france pretendd to be a great friend to their revoln tho an enemy to it in his heart eod die lear calls on me i told him that irving an irishman  a writer in the treasury  who on a former occn hd given the most decisive proofs of his devotion to his principal was the author of the pieces signed veritas i wished he could get at some of irvings acquaintances and inform himself of the fact as the person who told me of it would not permit the name of his informer to be mend note beckley told me of it  he had it from swaine the printer to whom the pieces were delivd that i had long before suspected this excessive foul play in that party of writing themselves in the character of the most exaggerated democrats      incorporating with it a great deal of abuse on the president to make him believe it was that party who were his enemies  so throw him entirely into the scale of the monocrats lear said he no longer ago than yesterday expressed to the president his suspicions of the artifices of that party to work on him he mentd the following fact as a proof of their writing in the character of their adversaries to wit the day after the little incident of richets toasting the man of the people see the gazettes mrs washington was at mrs powels who mentd to her that when the toast was given there was a good deal of disapprobation appeared in the audience  that many put on their hats and went out on inquiry he had not found the fact true and yet it was put into —s paper  written under the character of a republican tho he is satisfied it is altogether a slander of the monocrats he mentd this to the presidt but he dd nt mentn to him the following fact which he knows that in n york the last summer when the parties of jay and clinton were running so high it was an agreed point with the former that if any circumstances should ever bring it to a question whether to drop hamilton or the president they had decided to drop the presidt he said that lately one of the loudest pretended friends to the govmt damned it  said it was good for nothing that it could not support itself  it was time to put it down  set up a better  yet the same person in speakg to the presidt puffed of that party as the only friends to the govmt he said he really feared that by their artifices  industry they would aggravate     the presidt so much agt the republicans as to separate him from the body of the people i told him wt the same cabals hd decided to do if the presidt hd refused his assent to the bk bill also wt brockhurst livingston  sd to —that hamiltons life was much more precious to the community than the presids july       at dr logans today genet told us that colo hamilton had never in a single instance addressed a letter to him as the minister of the republic of france but always as the minister of france july         a meeting at the prs of the   heads of depmts  e r a precious statement genet had told me about a fortnight ago that he had come here with instructions to let all his contracts to the lowest bidder of sufficient ability that he had been privately admonished however at the same time by some individuals who had been in america that if he meant to succeed he must put his contracts into the hands of rob morris c who were allpowerful in the government that he pd little regard to this and pursuing vigorously the plan of his instns he had failed as i knew meeting to every proposition for obtaining money the decided opposn of the secy of the treasury—knowing as i did how decidedly the sy of the tr hd been agt every the smallest advance beyond what was actually exigible  even for a day i was     attentive to him he continued that he had now found out that if he would put the contract into the hands of mr hamiltons friends he could get money  that he had already been in treaty with cuningham  nesbit had agreed with them on terms mutually acceptable tho not as good as in the way pointed out in his instrns  that mr hamilton had also agreed tho it was not yet in writing i could not help saying are you sure colo h is agreed i think it impossible i am sure says he and you shall see accordingly at this meeting colo h proposes to agree to pay the orders of mr genet to the amount of the instalments of this year that is to day to note at the treasury those orders as presented and to say to the persons that such a sum will be pd at the day of the instemt  he presented a lre ready cut and dry for the purpose the presidt came into it at once on acct of the distresses of the refugees from st domingo for whom some of it was to be used knox asked no other question than whether it was convent to the treasy i agreed to it on my old ground that i had no objection to an advance e r alone was afraid  insisted the secy of the try shd present a written paper to each holder of a bill letting them see that we would pay for the govmt of france on such a day such     a sum so that if a counterrvlution shd take place between this  the day to wit some day in sep  another in nov in time to be known here we shd not be held to pay to the holder but to the new govmt hamilt agreed to arrange this with e r which in private he will easily do at this meeting e r being called away on business i proposed an answer to genets lre of july   on french property taken by the english in american bottoms which was agreed to in toto—also an answer to his letter of june    covering protests of consuls about admiralty courts arresting their prizes to this it was thought some addns were necessary  particly knox proposed some notice shd be taken of the expressions towards the presidt personally so it was referred to another day the presidt mentiond that we must shortly determine what was to be done with mr genet that in his own opn his whole correspdce shd be sent to g mor with a temporate but strong representation of his conduct drawg a clear line between him  his nation expressg our frdship to the latter but insistg on the recall of genet and in the mean time that we should desire him either to withdraw or cease his functions hamilton hereon made a long speech exhorting the presidt to firmness representing that we were now in a crisis whereon the continuance of the govmt or its overthrow by a faction depended that we were still in time to give the tone to the public mind by laying the whole proceedings before them  that this shd be done in addition to what he had proposed that as yet the great body of the people cd be kept on     the right side by proper explanations but that if we let the incendiaries go on they would soon have taken side with them—knox told some little stories to aggrevate the pr to wit that mr king had told him that a lady had told him that she had heard a gentleman say that the pr was as great a tyrant as any of them  that it would soon be time to chase him out of the city—that mr stagg lately from n york had told him that the st tammany society now had meetings to the number of  00 persons  that consul hauterive appeared to be very intimate with them the president also desired us to reflect on the question of calling congress hamilton  knox told the president they had extorted from beach  a confession that pascal one of the secretaries of genet sent him the queries inserted in his paper   or   days ago  to one of which the visct noailles gave the lie in the paper of today he said talon  had never been but twice to his house which was to public dinners  that he had dined once with talon in a large company note given to the presidt july         mr genets declaration to the president at his reception that france did not wish to engage the u s in the present war by the clause of guarantee but left her free to pursue her own happiness in peace has been repeated to myself in conversation  to others and even in a public answer so as to place it beyond question     some days after the reception of mr genet which was may    i went to his house on business the atty genl went with me to pay his first visit after he withdrew mr genet told me mr ternant had delivered him my letter of may    on the   memorials of mr hammond he said something first of the case of the grange and then of the vessels armed at charleston he said that on his arrival there he was surrounded suddenly by frenchmen full of zeal for their country pressing for authority to arm with their own means for its assistance that they would fit out their own vessels provide everything man them and only ask a commission from him that he asked the opinion of govr moultrie on the subject who said he knew no law to the contrary but begged that whatever was to be done might be done without consulting him that he must know nothing of it c that hereupon he gave commission to the vessels that he was of opinion that he was justified not only by the opinions at charleston but by our treaties i told him the president had taken full advice on the subject had very maturely considered it and had come to the decision expressed in my letter he said he hoped the president had not so absolutely decided it but that he would hear what was to be said against it i told him i had no doubt but that the president out of respect to him  his country would receive whatever he should have to urge on the subject and would reconsider it with candour he said he would make it his business to write me a letter on the subject that he thought the arming the privateers was justifiable but that if the president  00 should finally decide otherwise tho he could not think it would be right yet he must submit for that assuredly his instructions were to do whatever would be agreeable to us he shewed indeed by his countenance his manner  words that such an acquiescence would be with reluctance but i was  am persuaded he then meant it mr genet called at my office on tuesday sennight or fortnight say july    or   but i think it was tuesday sennight  know it was on a tuesday because he went from thence to the presidents he was summing up to me the strength of the french naval force now arrived i took that occasion to observe to him that having such great means in his hands i thought he ought not to hesitate in abandoning to the orders of the government the little pickeroons which had been armed here unauthorized by them  which occasioned so much embarrassment  uneasiness that certainly their good dispositions must be worth more than the trifling services these little vessels could render he immediately declared that having such a force in his hands he had abandoned every idea of further armament in our ports that these small objects were now beneath his notice  he had accordingly written to the consuls to stop everything further of that kind but that as to those which had been fitted out before their honour would not permit them to give them up but he wished an oblivion of everything which had passed and that in future the measure so disagreeable to the government should not be pursued tho he thought it clearly justifiable by the treaty i  0  told him the government was of a different opinion that both parties indeed had equal right to construe the treaty that consequently he had done his duty in remonstrating against our construction but that since the government remained finally persuaded of the solidity of its own construction  had a right to act accordingly within their own limits it was now his duty as a diplomatic man to state the matter to his government to ask  await their orders  in the meantime to acquiesce  by no means to proceed in opposition within our limits it was at the same time he informed me that he had sent out the little democrat july         to obtain intelligence of the state of the coast  whether it was safe for the fleet to proceed round from norfolk to new york july         at a meeting at the presidents on acct of the british letter of marque ship jane said to have put up waste boards to have pierced   port holes  mounted   cannon which she brought in on new carriages which she did not bring in  consequently having    instead of    guns mounted it was agreed that a letter of marque or vessel armé en guerre  en marchandise is not a privateer  therefore not to be ordered out of our ports it was agreed by ham kn  myself that the case of such a vessel does not depend on the treaties but on the law of nations e r thought as she had a mixed character of merchant vessel  privateer she might be considered under the treaty but this being overruled the following paper was written  0  rules proposed by attorney general agreed   that all equipments purely for the accommodation of vessels as merchantmen be admitted agreed   that all equipments doubtful in their nature  applicable equally to commerce or war be admitted as producg too many minutiæ agreed   that all equipments solely adapted to military objects be prohibited rules proposed by the secretary of the treasury agreed   that the original arming  equiping of vessels for military service offensive or defensive in the ports of the u s be considered as prohibited to all negatived the sec of the treasy only holdg the opn   that vessels which were armed before their coming into our port shall not be permitted to augment these military equipments in the ports of the u s but may repair or replace any military equipments which they had when they began their voyage for the u s that this however shall be with the exception of privateers of the parties opposed to france who shall not refit or repair agreed   that for convenience vessels armed and commissioned before they came into our ports may engage their own citizens not being inhabitants of the u s   0  i subjoined the following i concur in the rules proposed by the atty genl as far as respects materials or means of annoyance furnished by us and i should be for an additional rule that as to means or materials brought into this country  belonging to themselves they are free to use them knox agreed to the a genl in toto consequently they were establd by the vote of three ham proposed to put questions on all the proposns separately  he took the paper and put questions on the   of the atty genl which were agreed he was going on with questions on his own proposns without askg us distinctly but by a sort of a look  a nod and noting in the margin i observed i did not understand that opion that we had agreed to the atty genl proposns he said it was to take a question on each distinctly knox observed that as we understood these rules to extend only to cases out of the treaty we had better express it i agreed  proposed to add some such words as these excepting always where the treaties shall have otherwise provided hamilton broke loose at this  pretended it was meant they should go to all cases all of us bore testimony agt this  that he himself had shewn that the present case was out of the treaties he said he would rather specify the exceptions expressly than leave them on the general terms i proposed so it was agreed to take till tomorrow to examine the treaties  specify the exceptions if it could be done while this was passing e r took the paper in his hand  read hams original notes as above and seeing that he had written agreed  0  opposite to his own hams  st proposn he observed to knox so that i overheard him that that had not been agreed which was the truth to his  d proposn we had all agreed in conversn but it had not been agreed to add it to the rules—it was pretty evident from hams warmth embarrasmt eagerness that he wanted to slip in some thing which might cover cases we had not in contemplation  a question then arose whether we should expressly say that these articles were meant to extend to cases out of the treaty—it was referred to the next day july  0 met at my office i proposed to add to the rules a proviso that they should not be understood to contravene as of right they could not the provisions of the art of our treaty with france the of that with the u n or the of that with prussia before ham  kn came into the room e r declared himself for a general reference or a verbal quotn of the words of the treaties  against all comments or substitution of new words when they arrived ham proposed a reference to the articles of the treaty by a description of the cases in shorter terms which he proposed as equivalent to those of the treaty e r said plumply  without one word of preface that he had been for a general reference to the treaties but if the special descriptions would give more satisfaction he would agree to it so he  hamilton drew their chairs together and made up the form  0  but it was agreed to be put off for more mature digestion th j aug   met at the presidents to consider what was to be done with mr genet all his correspondence with me was read over the following proposns were made   that a full statement of mr genets conduct be made in a letter to g morris  be sent with his correspondence to be communicated to the exec council of france the letter to be so prepared as to serve for the form of communication to the council agreed unan   that in that letter his recall be required agreed by all tho i expressed a preference of expressing that desire with great delicacy the others were for peremptory terms   to send him off this was proposed by knox but rejected by every other   to write a letter to to mr genet the same in substance with that written to g m and let him know we had applied for his recall i was against this because i thot it would render him extremely active in his plans and endanger confusion but i was overruled by the other three gent  the presidt   that a publication of the whole correspondence and statement of the proceedgs should be made by way of appeal to the people hamilton made a jury speech of ¾ of an hour as inflammatory  declamatory as if he had been speaking to a jury e r opposed it i chose to leave the contest between them adjourned to next day aug   met again hamilton spoke again ¾ of  0  an hour i answered on these topics object of the appeal—the democratic society—this the great circumstance of alarm afrd it wd extd its connections over the continent chiefly meant for the local object of the ensuing election of governor if left alone wd die after that is over if opposed if proscribed wd give it importce  vigor wd give it a new object and multitudes wd join it merely to assert the right of voluntary associations that the measure was calculated to make the pres assume the station of the head of a party instead of the head of the nation plan of the appeal—to consist of facts and the decisions of the pres as to facts we are agreed but as to the decisions there has been great differences of opn among us sometimes as many opns as persons this proves there will be ground to attack the decisions genet will appeal also it will become contest between the pres  genet—annonymous writers—will be same difference of opn in public as in our cabinet—will be same difference in congress for it must be laid before them—would therefore work very unpleasantly at home how would it work abroad—france—unkind—after such proofs of her frdshp shd rely on that frdshp  her justice why appeal to the world frdly nations always negotiate little differences in private—never appeal to the world but when they appeal to the sword confedcy of pilnitz was to overthrow the govmt of france the interference of france to disturb other govmts  excite insurrections was a measure of reprisal yet these princes have been able to make it believed to be the system of france  0  col ham supposes mr genets proceedgs here are in pursuance of that system and we are so to declare it to the world  to add our testimony to this base calumny of the princes what a triumph to them to be backed by our testimy what a fatal stroke at the cause of liberty—et tu brute we indispose the fr govmt and they will retract their offer of the treaty of commerce the president manifestly inclined to the appeal to the people  knox in a foolish incoherent sort of a speech introduced the pasquinade lately printed called the funeral of george w—n and james w—n  king  judge c where the president was placed on a guillotine the presidt was much inflamed got into one of those passions when he cannot command himself ran on much on the personal abuse which had been bestowed on him defied any man on earth to produce one single act of his since he had been in the govmt which was not done on the purest motives that he had never repented but once the having slipped the moment of resigning his office  that was every moment since that by god he had rather be in his grave than in his present situation that he had rather be on his farm than to be made emperor of the world and yet that they were charging him with  0  wanting to be a king that that rascal freneau sent him   of his papers every day as if he thought he would become the distributor of his papers that he could see in this nothing but an impudent design to insult him he ended in this high tone there was a pause some difficulty in resumg our question—it was however after a little while presented again  he said there seemed to be no necessity for deciding it now the propsns before agreed on might be put into a train of execution  perhaps events would show whether the appeal would be necessary or not he desired we would meet at my office the next day to consider what should be done with the vessels armed in our ports by mr genet  their prizes aug   we met the rules being now reduced on one paper i considered them and not finding any thing against the treaties as far as i could see they were agreed to  signed by us all—we proceeded to consider what should be done as to the french privateers arrived in our ports  their prizes taken since they were ordered away randolph recapitulated his old opinion hamilton proposed to suppress the privateers by military coercion  deliver the prizes to their owners i proposed to require from mr genet a delivery of the prizes to their owners otherwise that in consequence of the assurances we had given the british minister we should be bound to pay for them  must take credit for it with france and to inform him that we would allow no further asylum in our ports to the sd privateers these were the citoyen genet sans culottes vainqueur  0  de la bastille  petite democrate the two last had been armed subsequent to the prohibition my proposn was agreed to with an addition that the governors should be notified that the privateers were no longer permitted to stay in our ports the president wrote to take our ops whether congress should be called knox pronounced at once agt it randolph was against it hamilton said his judgment was against it but that if any two were for it or against it he would join them to make a majority i was for it we agreed to give separate ops to the presidt knox sd we shd have had fine work if congress had been sitting these two last months the fool thus let out the secret hamilton endeavored to patch up the indiscretion of this blabber by saying he did not know he rather thought they would have strengthened the executive arm it is evident they do not wish to lengthen the session of the next congress and probably they particularly wish it should not meet till genet is gone—at this meeting i received a lre from mr remson at n y informg me of the event of the combat between the ambuscade  the boston knox broke out into the most unqualified abuse of capt courtany hamilton with less fury but with the deepest vexation loaded him with censures both shewed the most unequivocal mortification at the event aug   the president concurs with ham  kn in notifying mr hammond what we propose to do as to restitution of the prizes made by the citoyen genet c or compensation because says he if you   0 notify it to the party to whom it will give displeasure we should do it to that also which will feel satisfaction from it he said he should have been for calling congress himself but he found the other gentlemen were against it aug        the president calls on me at my house in the country and introduces my letter of july    announcing that i should resign at the close of the next month he again expressed his repentance at not having resigned himself and how much it was increased by seeing that he was to be deserted by those on whose aid he had counted that he did not know where he should look to find characters to fill up the offices that mere talents did not suffice for the departmt of state but it required a person conversant in foreign affairs perhaps acquainted with foreign courts that without this the best talents would be awkward  at a loss he told me that colo hamilton had   or   weeks ago written to him informg him that private as well as public reasons had brought him to the determination to retire  that he should do it towards the close of the next session he said he had often before intimated dispositions to resign but never as decisively before that he supposed he had fixed on the latter part of next session to give an opportunity to congress to examine into his conduct that our going out at times so different increased his difficulty for if he had both places to fill at one he might consult both the particular talents  geographical situation of our     successors he expressed great apprehensions at the fermentation which seemed to be working in the mind of the public that many descriptions of persons actuated by different causes appeared to be uniting what it would end in he knew not a new congress was to assemble more numerous perhaps of a different spirit the first expressions of their sentiments would be important if i would only stay to the end of that it would relieve him considerably i expressed to him my excessive repugnance to public life the particular uneasiness of my situation in this place where the laws of society oblige me always to move exactly in the circle which i know to bear me peculiar hatred that is to say the wealthy aristocrats the merchants connected closely with england the new created paper fortunes that thus surrounded my words were caught multiplied misconstrued  even fabricated  spread abroad to my injury that he saw also that there was such an opposition of views between myself  another part of the admn as to render it peculiarly unpleasing and to destroy the necessary harmony without knowg the views of what is called the republican party here or havg any communication with them i could undertake to assure him from my intimacy with that party in the late congress that there was not a view in the republican party as spread over the u s which went to the frame of the government that i believed the next congress would attempt nothing material but to render their own body independant that that party were firm in their dispositions to support the government that the manœuvres of mr     genet might produce some little embarrassment but that he would be abandoned by the republicans the moment they knew the nature of his conduct and on the whole no crisis existed which threatened anything he said he believed the views of the republican party were perfectly pure but when men put a machine in to motion it is impossible for themto stop it exactly where they would chuse or to say where it will stop that the constn we have is an excellent one if we can keep it where it is that it was indeed supposed there was a party disposed to change it into a monarchical form but that he could conscientiously declare there was not a man in the u s who would set his face more decidedly against it than himself here i interrupted him by saying no rational man in the u s suspects you of any other disposn but there does not pass a week in which we cannot prove declns dropping from the monarchical party that our governmt is good for nothing it is a milk  water thing which cannot support itself we must knock it down  set up something of more energy—he said if that was the case he thought it a proof of their insanity for that the republican spirit of the union was so manifest and so solid that it was astonishg how any one could expect to move them he returned to the difficulty of naming my successor he said mr madison would be his first choice but that he had always expressed to him such a decision against public office that he could not expect he would undertake it mr jay would prefer his present office he sd that mr jay had a great     opinion of the talents of mr king that there was also mr smith of s carola e rutledge c but he observed that name whom he would some objections would be made some would be called speculators some one thing some another and he asked me to mention any characters occurrg to me i asked him if govr johnson of maryld had occurred to him he said he had that he was a man of great good sense an honest man  he believed clear of speculations but this says he is an instance of what i was observing with all these qualifications govr johnson from a want of familiarity with foreign affairs would be in them like a fish out of water everything would be new to him  he awkward in everything i confessed to him that i had considered johnson rather as fit for the treasury department yes says he for that he would be the fittest appointment that could be made he is a man acquainted with figures  having as good a knowledge of the resources of this country as any man i asked him if chancr livingston had occurred to him he said yes but he was from n york  to appoint him while hamilton was in  before it should be known he was going out would excite a newspaper conflagration as the ultimate arrangement would not be known he said mclurg had occurred to him as a man of first rate abilities but it is said that he is a speculator he asked me what sort of a man wolcott was i told him i knew nothing of him myself i had heard him characterized as a cunning man i asked him whether some person could not take my office par interim till he should make an apptment as mr     randolph for instance yes says he but there you would raise the expectation of keeping it and i do not know that he is fit for it nor what is thought of mr randolph i avoided noticing the last observation  he put the question to me directly i then told him that i went into society so little as to be unable to answer it i knew that the embarrassments in his private affairs had obliged him to use expedts which had injured him with the merchts  shopkeepers  affected his character of independance that these embarrassments were serious  not likely to cease soon he said if i would only stay in till the end of another quarter the last of dec it would get us through the difficulties of this year and he was satisfied that the affairs of europe would be settled with this campaign for that either france would be overwhelmed by it or the confederacy would give up the contest by that time too congress will have manifested its character  view i told him that i had set my private affairs in motion in a line which had powerfully called for my presence the last spring  that they had suffered immensely from my not going home that i had now calculated them to my return in the fall and to fail in going then would be the loss of another year  prejudicial beyond measure i asked him whether he could not name govr johnson to my office under an express arrangement that at the close of the session he should take that of the treasury he said that men never chose to descend that being once in a higher department he would not like to go into a lower one  and he     concluded by desiring that i would take   or   days to consider whether i could not stay in till the end of another quarter for that like a man going to the gallows he was willing to put it off as long as he could but if i persisted he must then look about him  make up his mind to do the best he could  so he took leave aug  0 we met at the presidents to examine by paragraphs the draught of a letter i had prepared to gouverneur morris on the conduct of mr genet there was no difference of opinion on any part of it except on this expression an attempt to embroil both to add still another nation to the enemies of his country  to draw on both a reproach which it is hoped will never stain the history of either that of liberty warring on herself h moved to strike out these words that of liberty warring on herself he urged generally that it would give offence to the combined powers that it amounted to a declaration that they were warring on liberty that we were not called on to declare that the cause of france was that of liberty that he had at first been with them with all his heart but that he had long since left them and was not for encouraging the idea here that the cause of france was the cause of liberty in general or could have either connection or influence in our affairs knox accordg to custom jumped plump into all his opinions the pr with a good deal of positiveness declared in favor of the expression that     he considered the pursuit of france to be that of liberty however they might sometimes fail of the best means of obtaining it that he had never at any time entertained a doubt of their ultimate success if they hung well together  that as to their dissensions there were such contradictory accts given that no one could tell what to believe i observed that it had been supposed among us all along that the present letter might become public that we had therefore   parties to attend to—  france   her enemies   the people of the u s that as to the enemies of france it ought not to offend them because the passage objected to only spoke of an attempt to make the u s a free nation war on france a free nation which would be liberty warring on herself and therefore a true fact that as to france we were taking so harsh a measure desiring her to recall her minister that a precedent for it could scarcely be found that we knew that minister would represent to his government that our executive was hostile to liberty leaning to monarchy  would endeavor to parry the charges on himself by rendering suspicions the source from which they flowed that therefore it was essential to satisfy france not only of our friendship to her but our attachment to the general cause of liberty  to hers in particular that as to the people of the u s we knew there were suspicions abroad that the executive in some of its parts was tainted with a hankering after monarchy an indisposition towards liberty  towards the french cause  that it was important by an explicit declaration to remove these suspicions  restore the confidence of     the people in their govmt r opposed the passage on nearly the same ground with h he added that he thought it had been agreed that this correspondence should contain no expressions which could give offence to either party i replied that it had been my opinion in the beginng of the correspondence that while we were censuring the conduct of the french minister we should make the most cordial declarations of friendship to them that in the first letter or two of the correspondence i had inserted expressions of that kind but that himself  the other two gentlemen had struck them out that i thereupon conformed to their opinions in my subseqt letters and had carefully avoided the insertion of a single term of friendship to the french nation and the letters were as dry  husky as if written between the generals of two enemy nations that on the present occasion how ever it had been agreed that such expressions ought to be inserted in the letter now under considn  i had accordly charged it pretty well with them that i had further thought it essential to satisfy the french  our own citizens of the light in which we viewed their cause and of our fellow feeling for the general cause of liberty and had ventured only four words on the subject that there was not from beginning to end of the letter one other expression or word in favor of liberty  i should think it singular at least if the single passage of that character should be struck out—the president again spoke he came into the idea that attention was due to the two parties who had been mentd france  the u s that as to the     former thinking it certain their affairs would issue in a government of some sort of considerable freedom it was the only nation with whom our relations could be counted on that as to the u s there could be no doubt of their universal attachmt to the cause of france and of the solidity of their republicanism he declared his strong attachment to the expression but finally left it to us to accommodate it was struck out of course and the expressions of affection in the context were a good deal taken down aug       in consequence of my note of yesterday to the presidt a meeting was called this day at his house to determine what should be done with the proposn of france to treat the importance of the matter was admitted and being of so old a date as may   d we might be accused of neglecting the interests of the u s to have left it so long unanswered  it could not be doubted mr genet would avail himself of this inattention the presidt declared it had not been inattention that it had been the subject of conversation often at our meetings and the delay had proceeded from the difficulty of the thing if the struggles of france should end in the old despotism the formation of such a treaty with the present governmt would be a matter of offence if it should end in any kind of free governmt he should be very unwilling by inattention to their advances to give offence  lose the opportunity of procuring terms so advantageous to our country he was therefore for writing to mr morris to get the powers of mr genet renewed to his successor as he had expressed     this opn to me the afternoon before i had prepared the draught of a letter accordly but how to explain the delay the secy of the treasury observed on the letter of the natl convention that as it did not seem to require an answer and the matters it contained would occasion embarrassmt if ansd he should be agt answering it that he shd be for writing to mr morris mentioning our readiness to treat with them  suggesting a renewal of mr genets powers to his successor but not in as strong terms as i had done in my draft of the letter not as a thing anxiously wished for by us lest it should suggest to them the asking a price  he was for my writing to mr genet now an answer to his letter of may    referring to the meeting of the senate the enterg on the treaty knox concurred with him the attorney genl also except that he was against suggesting the renewal of mr genets powers because that would amount to a declaration that we would treat with that government would commit us to lay the subject before the senate  his principle had ever been to do no act not unavoidably necessary which in the event of a counter revolution might offend the future governing powers of that country—i stated to them that having observed from our conversns that the proposns to treat might not be acceded to immedty i had endeavord to prepare mr genet for it by taking occasion in conversns to apprize him of the controul over treaties which our consn had given to the senate that tho this was indirectly done because not having been authorized to say anything official on the subject i did not   0 venture to commit myself directly yet on some subsequent conversn i found it had struck him exactly as i had wished for speaking on some other matter he mentd incidentally his propositions to treat and said however as i know now that you cannot take up that subject till the meeting of the senate i shall say no more about it now and so proceeded with his other subject which i do not now recollect i said i thought it possible by recalling the substance of these conversations to mr genet in a letter to be written now i might add that the executive had at length come to a conclusion that on acct of the importce of the matter they would await the meeting of the senate but i pressed strongly the urging mr morris to procure a renewal of genets powers that we might not lose the chance of obtaing so advantageous a treaty e r had argued agt our acceding to it because it was too advantageous so much so that they would certainly break it  it might become the cause of war i answd that it would be easy in the course of the negociations to cure it of its inequality by giving some compensation but i had no fear of their revoking it that the islanders themselves were too much interested in the concessions ever to suffer them to be revoked that the best thinkers in france had long been of opn that it would be for the intt of the mother country to let the colonies obtain subsistence wherever they could cheapest that i was confident the present struggles in france would end in a free govmt of some sort  that such a govmt would consider itself as growing out of the present one  respect its treaties the     presidt recurred to the awkwardness of writing a letter now to mr genet in answer to his of may    that it would certainly be construed as merely done with a design of exculpation of ourselves  he would thence inculpate us the more we reflected on this the more the justice of this observon struck us h  myself came into it knox still for the letter r half for it half against it according to custom it was at length agreed i should state the substance of my verbal observns to mr genet in a letter to mr morris and let them be considered as the answer intended for being from the secy of state they might be considd as official tho not in writing it is evident that taking this ground for their future justification to france  to the u s they were sensible they had censurably neglected these overtures of treaty for not only what i had said to mr genet was without authority for them but was never communicated to them till this day to rest the justification of delay on answers given it is true in time but of which they had no knolege till now is an ostensible justification only sep        at a meeting held some days ago some lres from the govr of georgia  were read with a consultation of officers  a considble expedn agt the creeks was proposed  we were all of opon no such expedn should be undertaken my reasons were that such a war mt bring on a span and even an english war that for this reason the aggressions     of the creeks had been laid before the last congress  they had not chosen to declare war that therefore the executive shd not take on itself to do it and that accdg to the opns of pickens  blount it was too late in the season i thought however that a temperate and conciliatory lre should be written to the govr in order that we might retain the disposn of the people of the state to assist in an expedn when undertaken the other gentlemen thought a strong letter of disapprobation shd be written such a one was this day produced strong  reprehendatory enough in which i thought were visible the personal enmities of kn  ham agt telfair gun  jackson the two last having been of the council of officers the letter passed without objection being of the complexion before determd waynes letter was read porposg that  00 militia should set out from fort pitt to attack certain miami towns while he marched agt the principal towns the presidt disapproved it because of the difficulty of concerted movements at  00 miles distance because these  00 men might  probably would have the whole force of the indns to contend with  because the object was not worth the risking such a number of men we all concurred it appeared to me further that to begin an expedn now from fort pitt the very  st order for which is to be given now when we have reason to believe wayne advanced as far as fort jefferson would be either too late for his movements or would retard them very injuriously—note the letters from the commrs     were now read announcing the refusal of the indns to treat unless the ohio were made the boundary  that they were on their return a lre from govr clinton read informg of his issuing a warrant to arrest govr galbaud  at the request of the french consul  that he was led to interfere because the judge of the district lived at albany it was proposed to write to the judge of the district that the place of his residence was not adapted to his duties  to clinton that galbaud was not liable to arrest ham said that by the laws of n y the govr has the powers of a justice of peace  had issued the warrant as such i was against writing lres to judiciary officers i thought them independt of the executive not subject to its coercion  therefore not obliged to attend to its admonitions the other three were for writing the lres they thot it the duty of the president to see that the laws were exd  if he found a failure in so important an officer to communicate it to the legislature for impeachmt e r undertook to write the lres  i am to sign them as if mine the presidt brot forward the subject of the posts and thought a new demand of answer should be made to mr hammond as we had not mr hammonds last answer of june  0 on that subject agreed to let it lie over to monday ham proposed that on monday we shd take into consideration the fortification of the rivers  ports of the u s and that tho the exec cd not undertake     to do it preparatory surveys shd be made to be laid before congr—to be considd on monday the lres to genet coverg a copy of mine to gov mor of — to the fr consuls threateng the revvocn of their exequaturs to mr pinckney on the addnl instrns of gr

ham wished not to narrow the ground of compensation so much as to cases after aug   knox joined him and by several observns showed he did not know what the question was he could not comprehend that the lre of aug   which promised compensn because we had not used all the means in our power for restr would not be contradicted by a refusal to compensate in cases after aug   where we should naturally use all the means in our power for restr  these means should be insufficient the letter was agreed to on rs opon  mine ham acquiescing knox opposing nov      at a conference at the presidents where i read several letters of mr genet on finishing one of them i asked what should be the answer the presidt thereupon took occasion to observe that mr genets conduct contind to be of so extraordy a nature that he meant to propose to our serious considn whether he should not have his functions discontd  be ordd away he went lengthily into observns on his conduct to raise against the executive       the people   the state govmts   the congress he showed he felt the venom of genets pen but declared he would not chuse his insolence should be regarded any further than as might be thought to affect the honor of the country hamilton  knox readily  zealously argued for dismissing mr genet randolph opposed it with firmness  pretty lengthily the presidt replied to him lengthily  concluded by saying he did not wish to have the thing hastily decided but that we should consider of it and give our opinions on his return from reading  lancaster accdly nov    we met at his house reed new volumes of genets lres recd since the presidents departure then took up the discussion of the subjects of communicn to congress   the proclmn e r read the statemt he had prepared hamilton did not like it said much about his own views that the presidt had a right to declare his opn to our citizens  foreign nations that it was not the interest of this country to join in the war  that we were under no oblign to join in it that tho the declr would not legally bind congress yet the presidt had a right to give his opn of it  he was agt any expln in the speech which should yield that he did not intend that foreign nations shd consider it as a decln of neutrality future as well as present that he understood it as meant to give them that sort of assurance  satisfaction  to say otherwise now would be a deception on them he was for the press using such expressions as should neither affirm his right to make such a decln to foreign nations nor yield it r  myself opposed the right     of the presidt to declare anything future on the qu shall there or shall there not be war  that no such thing was intended that hs constrn of the effect of the proclmn would have been a determn of the question of the guarantee which we both denied to have intended  i had at the time declared the executive incompetent to r said he meant that forn natns should understand it as an intimation of the prs opn that neutrality would be our interest i declared my meaning to have been that forn nations should understand no such thing that on the contrary i would have chosen them to be doubtful  to come  bid for our neutrality i admitted the presidt havg recd the natn at the close of congr in a state of peace was bound to preserve them in that state till congr shd meet again  might proclaim anything which went no farther the pres decld he nevr had an idea that he could bind congress agt declaring war or that anything containd in his proclmn could look beyd the first day of their meeting his main view was to keep our people in peace he apologized for the use of the term neutrality in his answers  justifd it by having submitted the first of them that to the merchts wherein it was used to our considn  we had not objected to the term he concluded in the end that colo h should prepare a paragraph on this subject for the speech  it should then be considered  we were here called to dinner after dinner the renvoi of genet was proposed by himself i opposed it on these topics france the     only nation on earth sincerely our friend—the measure so harsh a one that no precedt is producd where it has not been followed by war our messenger has now been gone    days conseqly we may hourly expect the return  to be relieved by their revocation of him were it now resolved on it would be   or  0 days before the matter on which the order shd be founded could be selected arranged discussed  forwarded this wd bring us within   or   days of the meeting of congress wd it not be better to wait  see how the pulse of that body new as it is would beat they are with us now probably but such a step as this may carry many over to genets side genet will not obey the order c c the presidt asked me what i would do if genet sent the accusn to us to be communicd to congr as he threatd in the lre to moultrie i sd i wd not send it to congr but eithr put it in the newsp or send it back to him to be publd if he pleased other questions  answers were put  returned in a quicker altercation than i ever before saw the president use hamilton was for the renvoi spoke much of the dignity of the nation that they were now to form their character that our conduct now would tempt or deter other forn min from treatg us in the same manner touched on the prs personal feelings— did not believe fr wd make it a cause of war if she did we ought to do what was right  meet the consequences c knox on the same side  said he thot it very possible mr genet would either declare us a departmt of france or levy troops here  endeavor to reduce us to obedce r     of my opn  argued chiefly on the resurrection of popularity to genet which might be prodd by this measure that at present he was dead in the public opn if we would but leave him so the presidt lamented there was not unanimity among us that as it was we had left him exactly where we found him  so it ended nov         e r tells me that ham in conversn with him yesterday said sir if all the people in america were now assembled  to call on me to say whether i am a friend to the french revolution i would declare that i have it in abhorrence nov    we met at the presidents the manner of explaining to congress the intentions of the proclmn was the matter of debate e r produced his way of stating it this expressed its views to have been   to keep our citizens quiet   to intimate to foreign nations that it was the prs opn that the interests  disposns of this country were for peace hamilton produced his statement in which he declared his intention to be to say nothing which could be laid hold of for any purpose to leave the proclamation to explain itself he entered pretty fully into all the argumentation of pacificus he justified the right of the presidt to declare his opinion for a future neutrality  that there existed no circumstances to oblige the u s to enter into the war on account of the guarantee and that in agreeing to the proclmn he meant it to be understood as conveying both those declarations viz neutrality  that     the casus fœderis on the guarantee did not exist notwithstanding these declns of the presidt he admitted the congress might declare war in like manner they might declare war in the face of a treaty  in direct infraction of it among other positions laid down by him this was with great positiveness that the constn having given power to the presidt  senate to make treaties they might make a treaty of neutrality which should take from congress the right to declare war in that particular case and that under the form of a treaty they might exercise any powers whatever even those exclusively given by the constn to the h of representatives r opposed this position  seemed to think that where they undertook to do acts by treaty as to settle a tariff of duties which were exclusively given to the legislature that an act of the legislature would be necessary to confirm them as happens in england when a treaty interferes with duties establd by law—i insisted that in givg to the prest  senate a power to make treaties the constn meant only to authorize them to carry into effect by way of treaty any powers they might constitutionally exercise i was sensible of the weak points in this position but there were still weaker in the other hypotheses and if it be impossible to discover a rational measure of authority to have been given by this clause i would rather suppose that the cases which my hypothesis would leave unprovided were not thought of by the convention or if thought of could not be agreed on or were thought on and deemed unnecessary to be invested in the government of this last description   0 were treaties of neutrality treaties of offensive  defensive c in every event i would rather construe so narrowly as to oblige the nation to amend and thus declare what powers they would agree to yield than too broadly  indeed so broadly as to enable the executive and senate to do things which the constn forbids on the question which form of explaining the principles of the proclmn should be adopted i declared for rs tho it gave to that instrumt more objects than i had contemplated k declared for hs the presidt said he had had but one object the keeping our people quiet till congress should meet that nevertheless to declare he did not mean a decln of neutrality in the technical sense of the phrase might perhaps be crying peccavi before he was charged however he did not decide between the two draughts nov    at the presidents present k r  th j subject the heads of the speech one was a proposition to congress to fortify the principal harbors i opposed the expediency of the general governments undertaking it  the expediency of the presidents proposing it it was amended by substituting a proposition to adopt means for enforcg respect to the jurisdn of the u s within its waters it was proposed to recommend the establishmt of a military academy i objected that none of the specified powers given by the constn to congress would authorize this it was therefore referred for further considn  inquiry k was for both propositions r agt the former but said nothing     as to the latter the presidt acknold he had doubted of the expedcy of undertakg the former and as to the latter tho it would be a good thing he did not wish to bring on anything which might generate heat  ill humor it was agreed that rand should draw the speech  the messages nov    we met at the presidents i read over a list of the papers copying to be communicated to congress on the subject of mr genet it was agreed that genets lre of aug    to the president mine of aug    and genets of nov to myself  the atty genl desiring a prosecution of jay  king  should not be sent to the legislature on a general opn that the discussion of the fact certified by jay  king had better be left to the channel of the newspapers  in the private hands in which it now is than for the presidt to meddle in it or give room to a discussion of it in congress e r had prepared a draught of the speech the clause recommending fortifications was left out but that for a military academy was inserted i opposed it as unauthorized by the constitn h  k approved it without discussion e r was for it saying that the words of the constn authorizing congress to lay taxes c for the common defence might comprehend it the president said he would not chuse to recommend anything against the constn     but if it was doubtful he was so impressed with the necessity of this measure that he would refer it to congress  let them decide for themselves whether the constn authorized it or not it was therefore left in i was happy to see that r had by accident used the expression our republic in the speech the president however made no objection to it and so as much as it had disconcerted him on a former occasion with me it was now put into his own mouth to be pronounced to the two houses of legislature no material alterations were proposed or made in any part of the draught after dinner i produced the draught of messages on the subject of france  england proposing that that relative to spain should be subsequent  secret h objected to the draught in toto said that the contrast drawn between the conduct of france  england amounted to a decln of war he denied that fr had ever done us favors that it was mean for a nation to acknolege favors that the dispositions of the people of this country towards france he considered as a serious calamity that the executive ought not by an echo of this language to nourish that disposn in the people that the offers in commerce made us by france were the offspring of the moment of circumstances which wd not last  it was wrong to receive as permanent things merely temporary that he could demonstrate that gr br shewed us more favors than france in complaisance to him i whittled down the expressions without opposition struck out that of favors antient      recent from france softened some terms  omitted some sentiments respecting gr br he still was against the whole but insisted that at any rate it should be a secret communication because the matters it stated were still depending these were   the inexecution of the treaty   the restraining our corn commerce to their own ports  those of their friends knox joined hamilton in everything randolph was for the communications that the documents respecting the  st should be given in as public but that those respecting the  d should not be given to the legislature at all but kept secret i began to tremble now for the whole lest all should be kept secret i urged especially the duty now incumbent on the presidt to lay before the legislature  the public what had passed on the inexecution of the treaty since mr hammonds answer of this month might be considered as the last we should ever have that therefore it could no longer be considered as a negotiation pending i urged that the documents respecting the stopping our corn ought also to go but insisted that if it should be thot better to withhold them the restriction should not go to those respecting the treaty that neither of these subjects was more in a state of pendency than the recall of mr genet on which nevertheless no scruples had been expressed the presidt took up the subject with more vehemence than i have seen him shew and decided without reserve that not only what had passed on the inexecution of the treaty should go in as public in which h  k had divided in opinion from r  myself but also that those respecting the     stopping our corn should go in as public wherein h k  randolph had been against me this was the first instance i had seen of his deciding on the opn of one against that of three others which proved his own to have been very strong dec      beckly tells me he had the following fact from lear langdon cabot  some others of the senate standing in a knot before the fire after the senate had adjourned  growling together about some measure which they had just lost ah said cabot things will never go right till you have a president for life and an hereditary senate langdon told this to lear who mentioned it to the president the presidt seemed struck with it  declared he had not supposed there was a man in the u s who could have entertained such an idea  march the  d      i arrived at philadelphia to qualify as vicepresident and called instantly on mr adams who lodged at franciss in fourth street the next morning he returned my visit at mr madisons where i lodged he found me alone in my room and shutting the door himself he said he was glad to find me alone for that he wished a free conversation with me he entered immediately on an explanation of the situation of our affairs with france and the danger of rupture with that nation a rupture which would convulse the attachments of this country that he was impressed     with the necessity of an immediate mission to the directory that it would have been the first wish of his heart to have got me to go there but that he supposed it was out of the question as it did not seem justifiable for him to send away the person destined to take his place in case of accident to himself nor decent to remove from competition one who was a rival in the public favor that he had therefore concluded to send a mission which by its dignity should satisfy france and by its selection from the three great divisions of the continent should satisfy all parts of the united states in short that he had determined to join gerry and madison to pinckney and he wished me to consult mr madison for him i told him that as to myself i concurred in the opinion of the impropriety of my leaving the post assigned me and that my inclinations moreover would never permit me to cross the atlantic again that i would as he desired consult mr madison but i feared it was desperate as he had refused that mission on my leaving it in general washingtons time though it was kept open a twelvemonth for him he said that if mr madison should refuse he would still appoint him and leave the responsibility on him i consulted mr madison who declined as i expected i think it was on monday the  th of march mr adams and myself met at dinner at general washingtons and we happened in the evening to rise from table and come away together as soon as we got into the street i told him the event of my negotiation with mr madison he immediately said that on consultation some objections to that     nomination had been raised which he had not contemplated and was going on with excuses which evidently embarrassed him when we came to fifth street where our road separated his being down market street mine off along fifth and we took leave and he never after that said one word to me on the subject or ever consulted me as to any measures of the government the opinion i formed at the time on this transaction was that mr adams in the first moments of the enthusiasm of the occasion his inauguration forgot party sentiments and as he never acted on any system but was always governed by the feeling of the moment he thought for a moment to steer impartially between the parties that monday the  th of march being the first time he had met his cabinet on expressing ideas of this kind he had been at once diverted from them and returned to his former party views july      murray is rewarded for his services by an appointment to amsterdam w smith of charleston to lisbon august the   th about the time of the british treaty hamilton and talleyrand bishop of autun dined together and hamilton drank freely conversing on the treaty talleyrand says mais vraiment monsieur hamilton ce nest pas bien honnete after making the senate ratify the treaty to advise the president to reject it the treaty says hamilton is an execrable one and jay was an old woman for making it but the whole credit of saving     us from it must be given to the president after circumstances had led to a conclusion that the president also must ratify it he said to the same talleyrand though the treaty is a most execrable one yet when once we have come to a determination on it we must carry it through thick and thin right or wrong talleyrand told this to volney who told it to me there is a letter now appearing in the papers from pickering to monroe dated july the   th      which i am satisfied is written by hamilton he was in philadelphia at that time oct       littlepage who has been on one or two missions from poland to spain told that when gardoqui returned from america he settled with his court an account of secret service money of  00000 dollars ex relatione colo munroe      dec    langdon tells me that at the  d election of pr  v p of u s when there was a considble vote given to clinton in opposn to mr adams he took occasion to remark it in conversn in the senate chamber with mr a who gritting his teeth said damn em damn em damn em you see that an elective govmt will not do he also tells me that mr a in a late conversn said republicanism must be disgraced sir the chevr yruho  called on him at braintree and conversing on french affairs and yruho expressing his belief of their stability in opposn to mr adamss the latter lifting up      shaking his finger at him said i ll tell you what the french republic will not last   months this i had from yruho harper lately in a large company was saying that the best thing the friends of the french could do was to pray for the restoration of their monarch then says a bystander the best thing we could do i suppose would be to pray for the establishmt of a monarch in the u s our people says harper are not yet ripe for it but it is the best thing we can come to  we shall come to it something like this was said in presence of findlay     tenche coxe tells me that a little before hamilton went out of office or just as he was going out taking with him his last conversn and among other things on the subject of their differences for my part says he i avow myself a monarchist i have no objection to a trial being made of this thing of a republic but c      jan   i receive a very remarkable fact indeed in our history from baldwin  skinner before the establishment of our present government a very extensive combination had taken place in n york  the eastern states among that description of people who were partly monarchical in principle or frightened with shays rebellion  the impotence of the old congress delegates in different places had actually had consultations on the subject of seizing on the powers of a government  establishing them     by force had corresponded with one another and had sent a deputy to genl washington to solicit his cooperation he calculated too well to join them the new convention was in the meantime proposed by virginia  appointed these people believed it impossible the states should ever agree on a government as this must include the impost and all the other powers which the states had a thousand times refused to the general authority they therefore let the proposed convention go on not doubting its failure  confiding that on its failure would be a still more favorable moment for their enterprise they therefore wished it to fail  especially when hamilton their leader brought forward his plan of govmt failed entirely in carrying it  retired in disgust from the convention his associates then took every method to prevent any form of govmt being agreed to but the well intentioned never ceased trying first one thing then another till they could get something agreed to the final passage  adoption of the constitution completely defeated the views of the combination and saved us from an attempt to establish a govmt over us by force this fact throws a blaze of light on the conduct of several members from n y  the eastern states in the convention of annapolis  the grand convention at that of annapolis several eastern members most vehemently opposed madisons proposition for a more general convention with more general powers they wished things to get more  more into confusion to justify the violent measure they proposed the idea of establishing a govmt by reasoning    0 agreemt they publicly ridiculed as an utopian project visionary  unexampled one of the secretaries says that a resolution was formed to give no office to any person who did not approve of the proceedings of the executive and that it was determined to recall monroe whose conduct was not consonant with the views of the executive davy said they expressed very hostile dispositions towards france and he wished logan to apprise adet of it who he observed was a good kind of man ought to know it  to put his government on their guard feb   mr baldwin tells me that in a conversn yesterday with goodhue on the state of our affairs goodhue said i ll tell you what i have made up my mind on this subject i would rather the old ship should go down than not meaning the union of the states mr hillhouse coming up well says mr baldwin i ll tell my old friend hillhouse what you say  he told him well says goodhue i repeat that i would rather the old ship should go down if we are to be always kept pumping so mr hillhouse says baldwin you remember when we were learning logic together at school there was the case categorical  the case hypothetical mr goodhue stated it to me first as the case categorical i am glad to see that he now changes it to the case hypothetical by adding if we are always to be kept pumping so baldwin went on then to remind goodhue what an advocate he had been for our tonnage duty wanting to make it   doll instead of      0 cents and how impatiently he bore the delays of congress in proceeding to retaliate on gr br before mr madisons proposns came on goodhue acknowledged that his opinions had changed since that feb       i dined this day with mr adams the presidt the company was large after dinner i was sitting next to him  our conversn was first on the enormous price of labor  house rent  other things we both concurred in ascribing it chiefly to the floods of bank paper now afloat and in condemning those institns we then got on the constitn  in the course of our conversn he said that no republic could ever last which had not a senate  a senate deeply  strongly rooted strong enough to bear up against all popular storms  passions that he thought our senate as well constituted as it could have been being chosen by the legislatures for if these could not support them he did not know that could do it that perhaps it might have been as well for them to be chosen by the state at large as that would insure a choice of distinguished men since none but such could be known to a whole people that the only fault in our senate was that it was not durable enough that hitherto it had behaved very well however he was afraid they would give way in the end that as to trusting to a popular assembly for the preservn of our liberties it was the merest chimera imaginable they never had any rule of     decision but their own will that he would as lieve be again in the hands of our old committees of safety who made the law  executed it at the same time that it had been observed by some writer i forget whom he named that anarchy did more mischief in one night than tyranny in an age and that in modern times we might say with truth that in france anarchy had done more harm in one night than all the despotism of their kings had ever done in  0 or  0 years the point in which he views our senate as the colossus of the constitn serves as a key to the politics of the senate who are two thirds of them in his sentiments and accounts for the bold line of conduct they pursue mar   mr tazewell tells me that when the appropriations for the british treaty were on the carpet and very uncertain in the lower house there being at that time a number of bills in the hands of commees of the senate none reported  the senate idle for want of them he in his place called on the commees to report and particularly on mr king who was of most of them king said that it was true the commes kept back their reports waiting the event of the question about appropriation that if that was not carried they considered legislation as at an end that they might as well break up  consider the union as dissolved tazewell expressed his astonmt at these ideas  called on king to know if he had misapprehended him king rose again  repeated the same words the next day cabot took an occasion in debate  so awkward a one as to shew     it was a thing agreed to be done to repeat the same sentiments in stronger terms and carried further by declaring a determination on their side to break up and dissolve the govmt mar    in conversn with baldwin  brown of kentucky brown says that in a private company once consisting of hamilton king madison himself  some one else making a fifth speaking of the federal government oh says hamilton say the federal monarchy let us call things by their right names for a monarchy it is baldwin mentions at table the following fact when the bank bill was under discussion in the h of r judge wilson came in  was standing by baldwin baldwin reminded him of the following fact which passed in the grand convention among the enumerated powers given to congress was one to erect corpons it was on debate struck out several particular powers were then proposed among others rob morris proposed to give congress a power to establish a national bank gouvernr morris opposed it observing that it was extremely doubtful whether the constn they were framing could ever be passed at all by the people of america that to give it its best chance however they should make it as palatable as possible  put nothing into it not very essential which might raise up enemies that his colleague rob morris well knew that a bank was in their state pensve the very watch word of party that a bank had been the great bone of contention between the two parties of the state     from the establmt of their constn having been erected put down  erected again as either party preponderated that therefore to insert this power would instantly enlist against the whole instrument the whole of the antibank party in pensve whereupon it was rejected as was every other special power except that of giving copyrights to authors  patents to inventors the general power of incorporating being whittled down to this shred wilson agreed to the fact mr hunter of s carola who lodges with rutledge tells me that rutledge j rutledge junr was explaining to him the plan they proposed to pursue as to war measures when otis came in rutledge addressed otis now sir says he you must come forward with something liberal for the southern states fortify their harbours  build gallies in order to obtain their concurrence otis said we insist on convoys for our european trade  guarda costas on which condn alone we will give them gallies  fortificns rutledge observed that in the event of war mchenry  pickering must go out wolcott he thought might remain but the others were incapable of conducting a war otis said the eastern people would never abandon pickering he must be retained mchenry might go they considered together whether genl pinckney wd accept the office of secy of war they apprehended he would not it was agreed in this conversn that sewall had more the ear of the president than any other person mar    when the bill for appropriations was     before the senate anderson moved to strike out a clause recognizing by way of appropriation the appmt of a commee by the h of r to sit during their recess to collect evidence on blounts case denying they had power but by a law to authorize a commee to sit during recess tracy advocated the motion  said we may as well speak out the commee was appointed by the h of r to take care of the brit minister to take care of the span min to take care of the sec of state in short to take care of the pres of the u s they were afraid the pres  secy of state wd not perform the office of collecting evidence faithfully that there would be collusion c therefore the house appointed a commee of their own we shall have them next sending a commee to europe to make a treaty c suppose that the h of r should resolve that after the adjmt of congress they should continue to sit as a commee of the whole house during the whole recess this shows how the appointment of that committee has been viewed by the presidents friends apr   dr rush tells me he had it from mrs adams that not a scrip of a pen has passed between the late  present presidt since he came into office apr    new instructions of the british govmt to their armed ships now appear which clearly infringe their treaty with us by authorizing them to take our vessels carrying produce of the french colonies from those colonies to europe  to take vessels bound to a blockaded port see them in browns paper of apr    in due form     the presidt has sent a govmt brig to france probably to carry despatches he has chosen as the bearer of these one humphreys the son of a ship carpenter ignorant under age not speaking a word of french most abusive of that nation whose only merit is the having mobbed  beaten bache on board the frigate built here for which he was indicted  punished by fine apr    at a dinner given by the bar to the federal judges chase  peters present about    lawyers and wm tilghman in the chair this toast was given our king in old england observe the double entendre on the word king du ponceau who was one of the bar present told this to tenche coxe who told me in presence of h tazewell dallas was at the dinner so was colo charles sims of alexandria who is here on a lawsuit v genl irving may   the presidt some time ago appd steele of virga a commr to the indians  now secretary of the mississippi territory steele was a counsellor of virga and was voted out by the assembly because he turned tory he then offered for congress  was rejected by the people then offered for the senate of virga  was rejected the presidt has also appd joseph hopkinson commr to make a treaty with the oneida indns he is a youth of about    or    and has no other merit than extreme toryism  the having made a poor song to the tune of the presidents march           jan in a conversation with dr ewen who told the presidt one of his sons was an aristocrat the other a democrat the p asked if it was not the youngest who was the democrat yes said ewen well said the presidt a boy of    who is not a democrat is good for nothing  he is no better who is a democrat at  0 ewen told hurt and hurt told me jan    logan tells me that in his conversation with pickering on his arrival the latter abused gerry very much said he was a traitor to his country  had deserted the post to which he was appointed that the french temporized at first with pinckney but found him too much of a man for their purpose logan observing that notwithstandg the pacific declarns of france it might still be well to keep up the military ardor of our citizens  to have the militia in good order the militia said p the militia never did any good to this country except in the single affair of bunker hill that we must have a standing army of  0000 men which being stationed in different parts of the continent might serve as rallying points for the militia  so render them of some service—in his conversation with mr adams logan mentioned the willingness of the french to treat with gerry and do you know why said mr a why sir said l because said mr a they know him to have been an antifederalist against the constn   00 jan   information from tenche coxe mr liston had sent   letters to the govr of canada     by one sweezy he had sent copies of them together with a third original by one cribs sweezy was arrested being an old horse thief and his papers examd t coxe had a sight of them as soon as a rumor got out that there were letters of mr liston disclosed but no particulars yet mentioned mr liston suspecting that cribs had betrayed him thought it best to bring all his three letters  lay them before pickering secy of state pickering thot them all very innocent in his office they were seen by a mr hodgden of n jersey commissy of military stores and the intimate friend of pickering it happens that there is some land partnership between pickering hodgden  coxe so that the latter is freely  intimately visited by hodgden who moreover speaks freely with him on political subjects they were talking the news of the day when mr coxe observd that these intercepted lres of liston were serious things nothing being yet out but a general rumor hodgden asked which he thought the most serious coxe said the  d for he knew yet of no other h said he thot little of any of them but that the  d was the most exceptionable this struck coxe who not betraying his ignorance of a  d lre asked generally what part of that he alluded to hodgden said to that wherein he assured the govr of canada that if the french invaded canada an army would be marched from these states to his assistance after this it became known that it was sweezy who was arrested  not cribs so that mr liston had made an unnecessary disclosure of his  d letter to mr pickering who however keeps his     secret for him in the beginning of the conversn between hodgden  coxe coxe happened to name sweezy as the bearer of the letters that s not his name says hodgden for he did not know that   of the lres had been sent by sweezy also his name is cribs this put coxe on his guard and set him to fishing for the new matter jan  0 dr rush tells me that he had it from saml lyman that during the x y z congress the federal members held the largest caucus they have ever had at which he was present  the question was proposed  debated whether they should declare war against france  determined in the negative lyman was against it he tells me that mr adams told him that when he came on in the fall to trenton he was there surrounded constantly by the opponents of the late mission to france that hamilton pressing him to delay it said why sir by christmas louis the xviii will be seated on his throne—mr a by whom h by the coalition mr a ah then farewell to the independce of europe if a coalition moved by the finger of england is to give a government to france there is an end to the independance of every country    genl sam smith says that pickering wolcott  mchenry wrote a joint letter from trenton to the president then at braintree dissuading him from the mission to france stoddard refused to join in it stoddard says the instructions are such that if   0 the directory have any disposition to reconciliation a treaty will be made he observed to him also that ellsworth looks beyond this mission to the presidential chair that with this view he will endeavor to make a treaty  a good one that davie has the same vanity  views all this communicated by stoddard to s smith    baer  harrison g otis told j nicholas that in the caucus mentioned ante  0th there wanted but   votes to produce a declaration of war baer was against it    w c nicholas tells me that in a conversn with dexter   or   days ago he asked dexter whether it would not be practicable for the states to agree on some uniform mode of chusing electors of a president dexter says i suppose you would prefer an election by districts yes said n i think it would be best but would nevertheless agree to any other consistent with the constn dexter said he did not know what might be the opn of his state but his own was that no mode of election would answer any good purpose that he should prefer one for life on that reasoning said n you should prefer an hereditary one no he said we are not ripe for that yet i suppose added he this doctrine is not very popular with you no said n it would effectually damn any man in my state so it would in mine said d but i am under no inducement to bely my sentiment i have nothing to ask from anybody i had rather be at home than here therefore     i speak my sentiments freely mr nicholas a little before or after this made the same proposition of a uniform election to ross who replied that he saw no good in any kind of election perhaps says he the present one may last awhile on the whole mr n thinks he perceives in that party a willingness  a wish to let everything go from bad to worse to amend nothing in hopes it may bring on confusion and open a door to the kind of govermt they wish—in a conversn with gunn who goes with them but thinks in some degree with us gunn told him that the very game which the minority of pennve is now playing with mckean see substitute of minority in lower house  address of senate in upper was meditated by the same party in the federal govmt in case of the election of a republican president  that the eastern states wd in that case throw things into confusion  break the union that they have in a great degree got rid of their paper so as no longer to be creditors  the moment they cease to enjoy the plunder of the immense appropriations now exclusively theirs they would aim at some other order of things jan    mr smith a merchant of hamburg gives me the following informn the st andrews club of n york all of scotch tories gave a public dinner lately among other guests a hamilton was one after dinner the  st toast was the pres of the u s it was drank without any particular approbation the next was george the iii hamilton started up on his feet  insisted on a bumper        cheers the whole company accordly rose  gave the cheers one of them tho a federalist was so disgusted at the partiality shown by h to a foreign sovereign over his own president that he mentioned it to a mr schwarthouse an american mercht of n york who mentioned it to smith mr smith also tells me that calling one evening on mr evans then speaker of the h of rep of pensylve  asking the news evans said harper had been just there  speaking of the presidents setting out to braintree said he prayed to god that his horses might run away with him or some other accident happen to break his neck before he reached braintree this was indignation at his having named murray c to negotiate with france evans approved of the wish feb   dr rush tells me that he had it from asa green that when the clergy addressed genl washington on his departure from the govmt it was observed in their consultation that he had never on any occasion said a word to the public which showed a belief in the xn religion and they thot they should so pen their address as to force him at length to declare publicly whether he was a christian or not they did so however he observed the old fox was too cunning for them he answered every article of their address particularly except that which he passed over without notice rush observes he never did say a word on the subject in any of his public papers except in his valedictory letter to the governors of the states when he resigned his commission in the army     wherein he speaks of the benign influence of the christian religion i know that gouverneur morris who pretended to be in his secrets  believed himself to be so has often told me that genl washington believed no more of that system than he himself did   00 march heretical doctrines maintained in senate on the motion against the aurora that there is in every legal body of men a right of self preservation authorizing them to do whatever is necessary for that purpose by tracy read  lawrence that the common law authorizes the proceeding proposed agt the aurora  is in force here by read that the privileges of congress are and ought to be indefinite by read tracy sais he would not say exactly that the common law of england in all its extent is in force here but common sense reason  morality which are the foundations of the common law are in force here and establish a common law he held himself so nearly half way between the common law of england and what everybody else has called natural law  not common law that he could hold to either the one or the other as he should find expedient mar    conversing with mrs adams on the subject of the writers in the newspapers i took occasion to mention that i never in my life had directly or indirectly written one sentence for a newspaper     which is an absolute truth she said that mr adams she believed had pretty well ceased to meddle in the newspapers since he closed the pieces on davila this is the first direct avowal of that work to be his tho long  universally understood to be so mr douse of dedham in massachusetts of which town fisher ames is corrects information i had formerly received of the very great fortune made by ames by speculating in the funds he believes he did a great deal for his friends gore  mason but that his own capital was so small that he could not do much for himself he supposes him worth at present about  0000 doll some of which he doubts not was made while in the legislature by speculation but that he has a practice at the bar worth about  000£ a year lawful  living frugally he lays by some of that a great deal of his capital has been absorbed by building a very elegant house he says he is a man of the most irritable  furious temper in the world a strong monarchist mar    the jury bill before the senate mr read says that if from any circumstances of inaptitude the marshall cannot appoint a jury analogously with the state juries the common law steps in  he may name them according to that and mar    same bill mr chipman speaking of the case of vermont where a particular mode of naming jurors was in force under a former law of that state when the law of the u s passed declaring that juries shall be appointed in their courts in the several states in the mode now in use in the same state vermont     has since altered their mode of naming them mr chipman admits the federal courts cannot adopt the new mode but in that case he says their marshal may name them according to the rules of the common law now observe that that is a part of the common law which vermont had never adopted but on the contrary had made a law of their own better suited to their circumstances mar    freneau in charleston had the printing of the laws in his paper he printed a pamphlet of pinckneys lres on robbins case pickering has given the printing of the laws to the tory paper of that place tho not of half the circulation the printing amounted to about  00 d a year mar    same subject dexter maintained that the com law as to crimes is in force in the courts of the u s chipman says that the principles of com right are common law and he says the com   of england is in force here there being no law in vermont for appointing juries which the marshal can follow he sais he may appoint them as provided by the com   of england tho that part of the com   was never adopted in vermont mar    mr john marshall has said here that had he not been appointed minister to france he was desperate in his affairs and must have sold his estate  that immediately that that appointment was the greatest godsend that could ever have befallen a man i have this from j brown  s t mason     mar    mr perez morton of mass tells me that thatcher on his return from the warcongress declared to him he had been for a decln of war against france  many others also but that on counting noses they found they could not carry it  therefore did not attempt it mar    judge breckenridge gives me the following informn he and mr ross were originally very intimate indeed he says he found him keeping a little latin school and advised  aided him in the study of law  brought him forward after ross became a senator and particularly at the time of the western insurrection they still were in concert after the british treaty ross on his return informed him there was a party in the u s who wanted to overturn the govmt who were in league with france that france by a secret article of treaty with spain was to have louisiana and that gr brit was likely to be our best friend  dependce on this informn he breckenridge was induced to become an advocate for the british treaty during this intimacy with ross he says that genl collot in his journey to the western country called on him  frequently that he led breckenridge into conversns on their grievances under the govmt  particularly the western expedn that he spoke to him of the advges that country would have in joining france when she should hold louisiana showed him a map he had drawn of that part of the country pointed out the passes in the mountain  the facility with which they might hold them against the u s  with     which france could support them from n orleans he says that in these conversns collot let himself out without common prudence he says michaud to whom i at the request of genet had given a letter of introduction to the govr of kentucky as a botanist which was his real profession called on him that michaud had a commissarys commission for the expedn which genet had planned from that quarter against the spaniards that — the late spanish commandant of st genevieve with one powers an englishman called on him that from all these circumstances together with rosss stories he did believe that there was a conspiracy to deliver our country or some part of it at least to the french that he made notes of what passed between himself  collot and the others and lent them to mr ross who gave them to the president by whom they were deposited in the office of the board of war that when he complained to ross of this breach of confidence he endeavored to get off by compliments on the utility  importance of his notes they now cooled towards each other  his opposn to rosss election as governor has separated them in truth tho not entirely to appearance dr rush tells me that within a few days he has heard a member of congress lament our separation from gr brit  express his sincere wishes that we were again dependant on her   00 apr    jury bill under considn mr dexter  hillhouse  mr read insisted in the fullest and most explicit terms that the common law     of england is in force in these states and may be the rule of adjudication in all cases where the laws of the u s have made no provision mr livermore seemed to urge the same tho he seemed to think that in criminal cases it might be necessary to adopt by an express law mr tracy was more reserved on this occasion he only said that congress might by a law adopt the provisions of the common law on any subject by a reference to that without detailing the particulars as in this bill it was proposed that the marshals should summon juries accdg to the practice of the common law   00 dec    —majr wm munson bearer of

of lowell  he said he was in the beginning of the revolution a timid whig but as soon as he found we were likely to prevail he became a great office hunter and in the very breath of speaking of lowell he stopped says he i will give you a piece of informn which i do not venture to speak of to others there was a mr hale in mass a reputable worthy man who becoming a little embarrassed in his affairs i aided him which made him very friendly to me he went to canada on some business the governor there took great notice of him on his return he took occasion to mention to me that he was authorized by the govr of canada to give from   to      000 guineas each to himself  some others to induce them not to do anything to the injury of their country but to befriend a good connection between england  it hitchburn said he would think of it and asked hale to come  dine with him tomorrow after dinner he drew hale fully out he told him he had his doubts but particularly that he should not like to be alone in such a business on that hale named to him   others who were to be engaged two of whom said hitchburn are now dead and two living hitchburn when he had got all he wanted out of hale declined in a friendly way but he observed those   men from that moment to espouse the interests of engld in every point  on every occasion tho he did not name the men to me yet as the speaking of lowell was what brought into his head to tell me this anecdote i concluded he was one from other circumstances respecting stephen higginson of whom he spoke i conjectured him to be the other living one dec    in another conversn i mentioned to colo hitchburn that tho he had not named names i had strongly suspected higginson to be one of hales men he smiled  said if i had strongly suspected any man wrongfully from his information he would undeceive me that there were no persons he thought more strongly to be suspected himself than higginson  lowell i considered this as saying they were the men higginson is

authorized to make the offer he said he was authorized smith told this to livingston  to w c nicholas who confirms it to me bayard in like manner tempted livingston not by offering any particular

with me whose company and conversation had always been fascinating to him that since those great families had become hostile to him and had excited the calumnies which i had seen published that in this hamilton had joined and had even written some of the pieces against him that his attachment to me had been sincere and was still unchanged altho many little stories had been carried to him  he supposed to me also which he despised but that attachments must be reciprocal or cease to exist and therefore he asked if any change had taken place in mine towards him that he had chosen to have this conversn with myself directly  not through any intermediate agent he reminded me of a letter     written to him about the time of counting the votes say feb   0  mentioning that his election had left a chasm in my arrangements that i had lost him from my list in the admn c he observed he believed it would be for the interest of the republican cause for him to retire that a disadvantageous schism would otherwise take place but that were he to retire it would be said he shrunk from the public sentence which he never would do that his enemies were using my name to destroy him and something was necessary from me to prevent and deprive them of that weapon some mark of favor from me which would declare to the world that he retired with my confidence i answered by recapitulating to him what had been my conduct previous to the election of   00 that i never had interfered directly or indirectly with my friends or any others to influence the election either for him or myself that i considered it as my duty to be merely passive except that in virginia i had taken some measures to procure for him the unanimous vote of that state because i thought any failure there might be imputed to me that in the election now coming on i was observing the same conduct held no councils with anybody respecting it nor suffered any one to speak to me on the subject believing it my duty to leave myself to the free discussion of the public that i do not at this moment know nor have ever heard who were to be proposed as candidates for the public choice except so far as could be gathered from the newspapers that as to the attack excited against him in the newspapers i had noticed it but as the     passing wind that i had seen complaints that cheetham employed in publishing the laws should be permitted to eat the public bread  abuse its second officer that as to this the publishers of the laws were appd by the secy of the state witht any reference to me that to make the notice general it was often given to one republican  one federal printer of the same place that these federal printers did not in the least intermit their abuse of me tho receiving emoluments from the govmts and that i have never thot it proper to interfere for myself  consequently not in the case of the vice president that as to the letter he referred to i remembered it and believed he had only mistaken the date at which it was written that i thought it must have been on the first notice of the event of the election of s carolina and that i had taken that occasion to mention to him that i had intended to have proposed to him one of the great offices if he had not been elected but that his election in giving him a higher station had deprived me of his aid in the administration the letter alluded to was in fact mine to him of dec      00 i now went on to explain to him verbally what i meant by saying i had lost him from my list that in genl washingtons time it had been signified to him that mr adams the v president would be glad of a foreign embassy that genl washington mentd it to me expressed his doubts whether mr adams was a fit character for such an office  his still greater doubts indeed his conviction that it would not be justifiable to send away the person who in case of his death was provided by the constn to take his place   0 that it would moreover appear indecent for him to be disposing of the public trusts in apparently buying off a competitor for the public favor i concurred with him in the opinion and if i recollect rightly hamilton knox  randolph were consulted  gave the same opinions that when mr adams came to the admn in his first interview with me he mentioned the necessity of a mission to france and how desirable it would have been to him if he could have got me to undertake it but that he conceived it would be wrong in him to send me away and assigned the same reasons genl washington had done and therefore he should appoint mr madison c that i had myself contemplated his colo burrs appointment to one of the great offices in case he was not elected v p but that as soon as that election was known i saw it could not be done for the good reasons which had led genl w  mr a to the same conclusion and therefore in my first letter to colo burr after the issue was known i had mentioned to him that a chasm in my arrangements had been produced by this event i was thus particular in rectifying the date of this letter because it gave me an opportunity of explaining the grounds on which it was written which were indirectly an answer to his present hints he left the matter with me for consideration  the conversation was turned to indifferent subjects i should here notice that colo burr must have thot that i could swallow strong things in my own favor when he founded his acquiescence in the nominn as v p to his desire of promoting my honor the being with me whose company  conversn had always been     fascinating to him c i had never seen colo burr till he came as a member of senate his conduct very soon inspired me with distrust i habitually cautioned mr madison against trusting him too much i saw afterwards that under genl ws and mr as admns whenever a great military appmt or a diplomatic one was to be made he came post to philada to shew himself  in fact that he was always at market if they had wanted him he was indeed told by dayton in   00 he might be secy at war but this bid was too late his election as v p was then foreseen with these impressions of colo burr there never had been an intimacy between us and but little association when i destined him for a high appmt it was out of respect for the favor he had obtained with the republican party by his extraordinary exertions and successes in the n y election in   00   0  feb

of them except mr gallatin who would rather no communication on the subject should be made however he suggested several alterations in the message which were made information being received that the spaniards prohibit our vessels passing up the mobille i proposed for their considn whether i should communicate it to congress we all were against it except mr madison  genl dearborne who rather leaned to a communcion but acquiescd the reasons against it     were that it would open anew the sluices of invective which had lately been uttered there the lateness of the period congress being to adjourn in   days the impossibility of their administering a remedy in that time  the hope that we might get along till we could hear from paris   0  april    about a month ago colo burr called on me  entered into a conversation in which he mentioned that a little before my coming into office i had written to him a letter intimating that i had destined him for a high employ had he not been placed by the people in a different one that he had signified his willingness to resign as v president to give aid to the admn in any other place that he had never asked an office however he asked aid of nobody but could walk on his own legs  take care of himself that i had always used him with politeness but nothing more that he aided in bringing on the present order of things that he had supported the admn  that he could do me much harm he wished however to be on differt ground he was now disengaged from all particular business willing to engage in something should be in town some days if i should have anything to propose to him i observed to him that i had always been sensible that he possessed talents which might be employed greatly to the advantage of the public  that as to myself i had a confidence that if he were employed he would use his talents for the public good but that he must be sensible the public had withdrawn their confidence from him  that in a government like     ours it was necessary to embrace in its admn as great a mass of public confidce as possible by employing those who had a character with the public of their own  not merely a secondary one through the exve he observed that if we believed a few newspapers it might be supposed he had lost the public confidence but that i knew how easy it was to engage newspapers in anything i observed that i did not refer to that kind of evidence of his having lost the public confidence but to the late presidential election when tho in possn of the office of v p there was not a single voice heard for his retaining it that as to any harm he could do me i knew no cause why he should desire it but at the same time i feared no injury which any man could do me that i never had done a single act or been concerned in any transaction which i feared to have fully laid open or which could do me any hurt if truly stated that i had never done a single thing with a view to my personal interest or that of any friend or with any other view than that of the greatest public good that therefore no threat or fear on that head would ever be a motive of action with me he has continued in town to this time dined with me this day week  called on me to take leave   or   days ago i did not commit these things to writing at the time but i do it now because in a suit between him  cheetham he has had a deposn of mr bayard taken which seems to have no relation to the suit nor to any other object but to calumniate me bayard pretends to have addressed to me during the pending of the presidl election in feb   0  through genl saml smith certain     condns on which my election might be obtained  that genl smith after conversing with me gave answers from me this is absolutely false no proposn of any kind was ever made to me on that occasion by genl smith nor any answer authorized by me and this fact genl smith affirms at this moment for some matters connected with this see my notes of feb          0  made at the moment but the following transactions took place about the same time that is to say while the presidential election was in suspense in congress which tho i did not enter at the time they made such an impression on my mind that they are now as fresh as to their principal circumstances as if they had happened yesterday coming out of the senate chamber one day i found gouverneur morris on the steps he stopped me  begun a conversn on the strange  portentous state of things then existing and went on to observe that the reasons why the minority of states were so opposed to my being elected were that they apprehended that   i should turn all federalists out of office   put down the navy   wipe off the public debt        that i need only to declare or authorize my friends to declare that i would not take these steps and instantly the event of the election would be fixed i told him that i should leave the world to judge of the course i meant to pursue by that which i had pursued hitherto believing it to be my duty to be passive  silent during the present scene that i should certainly make no terms should never go     into the office of president by capitulation nor with my hands tied by any conditions which should hinder me from pursuing the measures which i should deem for the public good it was understood that gouverneur morris had entirely the direction of the vote of lewis morris of vermont who by coming over to m lyon would have added another vote  decided the election about the same time i met with mr adams walking in the pensylve avenue we conversed on the state of things i observed to him that a very dangerous experiment was then in contemplation to defeat the presidential election by an act of congress declaring the right of the senate to naming a president of the senate to devolve on him the govmt during any interregnum that such a measure would probably produce resistance by force  incalculable consequences which it would be in his power to prevent by negativing such an act he seemed to think such an act justifiable  observed it was in my power to fix the election by a word in an instant by declaring i would not turn out the federal officers not put down the navy nor sponge the national debt finding his mind made up as to the usurpation of the government by the president of the senate i urged it no further observed the world must judge as to myself of the future by the past and turned the conversation to something else about the same time dwight foster of massachusetts called on me in my room one night  went into a very long conversation on the state of affairs the drift of which was to let me understand that the fears abovementioned were the only obstacles to my election     to all of which i avoided giving any answer the one way or the other from this moment he became most bitterly  personally opposed to me  so has ever continued i do not recollect that i ever had any particular conversn with genl saml smith on this subject very possibly i had however as the general subject  all its parts were the constant themes of conversation in the private tête à têtes with our friends but certain i am that neither he nor any other republican ever uttered the most distant hint to me about submitting to any conditions or giving any assurances to anybody and still more certainly was neither he nor any other person ever authorized by me to say what i would or would not do see a very exact statement of bayards conduct on that occasion in a piece among my notes of   0  which was published by g granger with some

missisipi  orleans to the district attorney of kentucky — of tennissee — of louisiana to have him strictly watched and on his  0  committing any overt act unequivocally to have him arrested and tried for treason misdemeanor or whatever other offence the act may amount to and in like manner to arrest and try any of his followers committing acts against the laws we think it proper also to order some of the gunboats up to fort adams to stop by force any passage of suspicious persons going down in force genl wilkinson being expressly declared by burr to eaton to be engaged with him in this design as his lieutenant or first in command and suspicions of infidelity in wilkinson being now become very general a question is proposed what is proper to be done as to him on this account as well as for his disobedience of orders received by him june    at st louis to descend with all practicable despatch to n o to mark out the site of certain defensive works there and then repair to take command at natchitoches on which business he did not leave st louis till sep — consideration adjourned oct   —it is agreed unanimously to call for captain preble  decatur to repair to n orleans by land or sea as they please there to take command of the force on the water  that the argus    gunboats from n y   from norfolk    from charleston shall be ordered there if on a consultation between mr gallatin  mr smith the appropriations shall be found to enable us that preble shall on consuln with govr claiborne have great discretionary powers that graham shall be sent thro kentucky on burrs trail with discretionary powers to consult  0  confidentially with the governors  to arrest burr if he has made himself liable he is to have a commission of govr of louisiana and doctr browne is to be removed letters are to be written by post to govr claiborne the govr of misipi and colo freeman to be on their guard against any surprise of our ports or vessels by him the question as to genl wilkinson postponed till prebles departure for further information   —a mail arrived yesterday from the westward and not one word is heard from that quarter of any movements by colo burr this total silence of the officers of the govmt of the members of congress of the newspapers proves he is committing no overt act against law we therefore rescind the determination to send preble decatur the argus or the gunboats  instead of them send off the marines which are here to reinforce or take the place of the garrison at n o with a view to spanish operns  instead of writing to the govrs c we send graham on that rout with confidential authority to enquire into burrs movements put the govrs c on their guard to provide for his arrest if necessary  to take on himself the govmt of louisiana letters are still to be written to claiborne freeman  the govr of misipi to be on their guard nov  —present the   heads of department agreed on instructions to genl wilkinson which see   —present at first the   heads of depmt but after a while genl dearborne withdrew unwell  0  dispatches from genl wilkinson to myself of oct    by a confidential officer lt smith shew that overtures have been made to him which decide that the present object of the combination  is an expedition by sea against vera cruz and by comparing the contents of a letter from cowles meade to the secy of state with the information from lt smith that a mr swartwout from n york brother of the late marshal had been at genl wilkinsons camp we are satisfied that swartwout has been the agent through whom overtures have been made to wilkinson we came to the following determination that a proclamation be issued see it and that orders go as follows to pittsbg if we have a military officer there write to him to be vigilant in order to discover whether there are any preparns making or boats or arms or other military stores or means providing by any persons against whom there is reasonable ground to suspect that they have in contemplation a military enterprise against any of the territories of spain contrary to the stat june      c  0 and to stop all bodies of armed men who may be assembled to descend the ohio under circumstances and appearances so different from those of common emigrants as to induce a reasonable suspicion that they are a part of a combination of persons believed to have such an enterprise in view to have them bound to the observance of the peace  good behavior or put in a course of legal prosecution accding to the strength of the evidence  for this purpose to call in the aid of the militia—if we have no officer there  0  then write to genl nevill—marietta mr gallatin is to write to the collector to proceed to sieze the gunboats building in that neighborhood  suspected to be destined for this enterprise  to call in the aid of the militia genl dearborne to write to govr tiffin to furnish a guard of militia sufficient for the detention of the boats  to write to genl jackson supposed to be the genl of the brigade on the virginia side of the river to furnish any aid of militia which may be necessary from the left bank of the river—louisville genl dearborne to write to the govr of kentucky of the same tenor as to the officer at pittsbg—massac genl dearborne to give orders to capt bissell of the same tenor  particularly to stop armed vessels suspected on good grounds to be proceeding on this enterprise  for this purpose to have in readiness any boats he can procure fitted for enabling him to arrest their passage—chickasaw bluffs give same orders as to bissell—fort adams do—new orleans genl wilkinson to direct the stations of the armed vessels  if the arrangements with the spaniards will permit him to withdraw let him dispose of his force as he thinks best to prevent any such expedition or any attempt on n o or any of the posts or military stores of the u s he is also to arrest persons coming to his camp  proposing a concurrence in any such enterprise or suspected of being in camp with a view to propogate such propositions this addition is made by genl dearborne with my approbn dec   —see a message agreed on unanimously  0  to furnish money for distressed french—not sent turreau withdrawing request dec   —present the   heads of department being informed that the cambrian one of the vessels proscribed by the proclamation of may last is in

favorable for making a stand  they will probably yield  the more probably as their negociators had agreed to an article that they would not impress on the high seas or in other than their own ports

provided to be guarded in common by a few men only  to be manned when necessary by militia  —places which from their importance require some stronger defence but which from the forts already built the difficulty of access and the strength of their adjacent population need only repairs some inconsiderable additions to their works and garrisons      —places which from their importance  ease of access by land or water may be objects of attack  which from the weakness of their population difficulties of defence c will need particular attention and provision in distributing the sea ports into these classes their importance so far as depends on their tonnage collection of import exports domestic  foreign may be obtained from a table prepared by the secy of the treasy which see  st class may be taken from that table readily—perhaps some places not in that may require some defence  d class portsmouth n h on each of these we conferred successively and came so far to a general understanding of

alexandria  washington norfolk savanna new orleans july   —the existing appropriations for fortifications being not more than sufficient for new york charleston and new orleans it is thought best to employ them entirely on those places and leave the others till further appropriations it is thought that the secretary of the navy should purchase on credit timber  other materials for a great number of gunboats suppose  00 but that they should chiefly be of those kinds which may be useful for the navy should congress not authorize the building gunboats also that he should purchase on credit  00 tons of saltpetre   00 tons of sulphur on the presumption that congress will sanction it our stock of swords pistols  mortars being not sufficient the secretary at war will take measures for procuring a supply of the two former articles and will keep troxall constantly employed in making mortars until a sufficient stock be provided the secretary of the navy will take immediate measures for procuring from london  00 telescopes     of about  0 guinea price for the establishment of telegraphs it is agreed that about   000 regular troops will be requisite for garrisons and about as many more as a disposable force making in the whole  0000 regulars it is also recommended to the secretary of the navy to recruit the whole number of marines allowed by law to wit about   00 principally for the service of the gunboats on the question under what circumstances i may order decatur to attack the british vessels in our waters it is the opinion that if they should blockade any place preventing vessels from entering or going out or proceed systematically in taking our vessels within our waters that the gunboats should attack them if they can do it with a good prospect of success but decatur is not to do this without orders from me should they attack norfolk or enter elizabeth river decatur may attack them without waiting orders in endeavoring to obtain information of the

instead of   00 must be ordered agt niagara       00 only instead of   00 agt kingston that in the message at the opening of congress the treaty and negotiations should not be laid before them because

to n y is reserved for further consideration enquiring in the meantime how early she could be ready to go—it is considered that in case of war these frigates would serve as receptacles for enlisting seamen to fill the gunboats occasionally after agreeing as above proceeding to consider how the crew of the constitution should be paid off the navy funds being exhausted before the meeting of

here who told him he had had a vessel condemned at halifax and was going to england to prosecute the appeal that being acquainted with mr erskine  known also to mr rose since his arrival he had informed them  they had desired him to be the bearer of their dispatches which would be   0 ready on the   th these dispatches he said would be delivered to him in a box would contain all their communicns to their govmt consequently their operations here intrigues spies friends information their own views prospects  designs that he believed his appeal would cost him as much as he should recover that he was now a ruined man had been cruelly treated by england therefore wished to quit that country  become an american that for a proper reward he did not say what he would take the papers out of the box which should be delivered him deliver them to us fill the box with blank papers return to n york  making some excuse for not going he would send the box to its address he said we should be on our guard for that those ministers had many spies in washington and one in the presidents house who informed them of everything passing this man is known to have been much attended to by erskine to have been at his parties at those of taylor c my answer to mr dawson was that the govmt would never be concerned in any transaction of that character that moral duties were as obligatory on nations as on individuals that even in point of interest a character of good faith was of as much value to a nation as an individual and was that by which it would gain most in the long run that however he might assure hall that we would keep his secret mr dawson had consulted with mr nicholas on this communication and after i had given him the above answer i mentioned it to mr madison who approved of it     apr   0 —present the   secretaries having now  00 gunboats building and about  0 in service we agreed that  0 should be stationed at n orleans with  0 men in each about half a dozen be kept in different places for enforcing the embargo with   or  0 men each of the residue keep on the stocks as many as we can by agreement for preservn and to all the rest allow   men each let the frigates  sloop remain where they are with about  0 or  0 men each to keep them clean which will reduce the number of seamen to less than  00 the original establishment as the law on which the proclamation is founded expires with the end of this session it is rather believed that its renewal would not renew the proclamn and as it would be disagreeable either to renew or revoke it we conclude to let it go off in that doubtful way which may afford a reason for not proceeding to actual hostilities agt brit armed vessels entering our waters we agree to renew the call for the  00000 militia and volunteers june  0 0 —present the   secretaries  atty genl    applications for permission to send vessels out for property agreed as general rules   that no permission shall be granted after the of    none to europe because of the danger of the capture or detention of the vessels  money can be drawn thence so easily by bills  to such advantage by the favble exchange   none to asia or the continent of africa except mogadore   none to s america beyond the line from such distances vessels could not return before war may     take place agreed to continue the reguln of mr gallatins circular of may  0 except that it may be relaxed as to vessels usually employed in the coasting trade this has a special view to the relief of n c that her corn  lumber may be sent coastwise the chesapeake being manned may be sent on a cruise from st marys to passamaquoddy   gunboats are to be built on l champlain and   on l ontario—as many as convenient of the troops now raising are to be rendezvoused along l

her orders of nov  jan shall we suspend the embargo laws as to her answ unanimously we shall   if she revokes the ord of nov alone answ we shall suspend the atty govt alone dissenting   if she revokes the ord of nov as to our own produce only answ unan not to suspend but in that case to call congress at an earlier day if france repeals her berlin  milan decrees and restores the property sequestered shall we suspend the embargo laws as to her answ call congress and declare the embargo laws as to france suspended in    days mr madison is strongly opposed to this latter part the suspension because it     lets our vessels fall into the hands of england  so predetermines the question of war if the embargo is suspended as to one of the powers it must be so as to the whole world except the other power and all other nations having similar decrees or orders existing against us oct    present the   secretaries intruders on the new purchase south of tenissee   on the indian lands choctaw  cherokee on each side of that purchase   on the n side of red river agreed unanimously as to the first to appoint a register  he to give notice to all the intruders to come in and make a declarn that they have no claim to the lands  that a military be sent in the spring to remove all who do not there is a colo harrison claiming  surveying under coxe who probably will not disclaim right  will therefore be removeable without disturbing the others who are said to be industrious men of property  disposed to obey the laws the land office can be opened in the spring which will settle everything  —as to intruders on the indn lands give notice to depart  if they do not remove them in the spring by military force except from doubleheads land   as to those on red river let them alone  get congress to extend the land law to them as they are conveniently situated to support n orleans unanimously agreed to order the detachment of  00000 men under the law of last session to be ready early in the spring that we may be prepared for any change in our foreign relations     unanimously agreed in the sentiments which should be unauthoritavely expressed by our agents to influential persons in cuba  mexico to wit if you remain under the dominion of the kingdom and family of spain we are contented but we should be extremely unwilling to see you pass under the dominion or ascendancy of france or england in the latter cases should you chuse to declare independence we cannot now commit ourselves by saying we would make commmon cause with you but must reserve ourselves to act accdg to the then existing circumstances but in our proceedings we shall be influenced by friendship to you by a firm belief that our interests are intimately connected and by the strongest repugnance to see you under subordination to either france or england either politically or commercially anderson our consul going to havana is to be instructed accordingly so is hughes who is going to mexico in quest of pikes men   burling is to be sent to the city of mexico under pretext of searching for pikes men also but in truth to communicate these sentiments to proper characters claiborne is to be intrusted with them also to communicate accding to the occasions he may find nov   0 —conversn with mr erskine he was much alarmed at the conversn out of doors looking like a decln of war with gr br he spoke declaring that if he was an american he would so view the thing as the most rational for us     to let our commerce go out  take its chance  that we should defend it against all equally indeed he seemed to think it best we should declare against all he said this would be viewed as so equal that no rancorous war would be waged by either  peace would be easy at any time i told him that there were but   alternatives   war   embargo   submission and that no american would look a moment at the last he agreed it i told him i thot it possible france mt repeal her decrees as to us yet i did not understand from mr pinckneys communicns that engld would even then revoke her decree he declared in the most explicit terms she would i then explaind that the french repeal mt only go to the high sea he observed that he did not know that that cd produce a repeal from engld because the exclusion of her merchandise wd remain i observed to him that i thot engld operated on much by misrepresentns  from the errors of strangers who associated with but one party he cleared himself of that by saying he mixed much with both  cd not be supposed to have any interest but in coming at the truth  communicating it i noted to him the tone in the conversn of mr canning in the month of june when mr p inferred the orders wd be revoked  the month of july when he was totally off i intimated to him my suspicions that the halifx endpedn was intended to support a hoped insurrection in boston  he protested at once decidedly agt the error of that suspicion that his     govmt could not be so uninformed as to think of countenancing the taking adverse possn of a place they could not hold many days  that assuredly they had not a single hostile view towards this country  that the people of england were equally averse to a rupture with us he spoke of the situation of spain  that bonaparte would soon be ousted there lamented the state of the world  i joined him in that  said that if either bonaparte or his king were to die we should have peace he said the pr of wales was as much an antibonapartian as anybody that he was persuaded there could be no safety in a peace with him which would let their navy go down  bonapartes get up i observed that went to a principle of eternal war he sd no that that danger would be lessened by bonaps death or by such a spirit of insurrection in the north as had appeared in spain i told him i was going out of the admn  therefore might say to him things which i would not do were i to remain in i wished to correct an error which i at first thot his govrnt above being led into from newspapers but i apprehended they had adopted it this was the supposed partiality of the admn  particularly myself in favr of france  agt england i observed that when i came into the admn there was nothing i so much desired as to be on a footing of intimate frdshp with england that i knew as long as she was our friend no enemy could hurt that i would have sacrificed much to have effected it  therefore wished mr king to have continued there as a favorable instrument that if there had been     an equal disposn on their part i thot it might have been effected for altho the question of impressmts was difficult on their side  insuperable with us yet had that been the sole question we might have shoved along in the hope of some compromise that indeed there was a ground of accomodn which his ministry had on two occns yielded to for a short time but retracted that during the admn of mr addington and the short one of mr fox i had hoped such a frdshp practicable but that during all other admns i had seen a spirit so adverse to us that i now despaired of any charge that he might judge from the communicns now before congress whether there had been any partiality to france to whom he wd see we had never made the proposition to revoke the embargo immedly which we did to england and again that we had remonstrated strongly to them on the style of mr champagnys letter but had not to england on that of canning equally offensive that the letter of canning now reading to congress was written in the high ropes  would be stinging to every american breast he admitted mr canning wrote strongly  spoke strongly always taking the highest ground i told him it was an unhappy talent that nothing enabled a man to get along in business so well as a smooth temper  smooth style i observed that if we wished war with england as the federalists charged us  i feared his govmt might believe nothing would have been so easy when the chesapeake was attacked  when even the feds themselves would have concurred but on the contrary that our endeavors     had been to cool down our countrymen  carry it before their govrmt he said it would have been very unjust to have made an individual act the ground of war which his govrnt might  did disavow i agreed to that but added that the same class of men had committed  were in the habit of committing so many atrocious insults on us that it was impossible not to feel them deeply that i did not charge his govrmt with approving all this because i believed that they could not controul them that the officers were allied to the highest families in the kingdom were supported by such an aristocracy as that no minister dare move against one unless he had acted as a coward  then the nation would support the minister in shooting him he said i was much mistaken in supposing the govrmt could not controul the officers of the navy that there was such a multitude of applicants to enter the navy as placed the whole very much under the power of the govmt  besides that they had such a number of officers beyond what they could employ as made it easy for a minister to leave any one unemployed i told him in the course of the conversn that this country would never return to an intercourse with engld while those orders of council were in force in some part of it also i told him that mr madison who it was now pretty well seen wd be my successor to which he assented had entertained the same cordial wishes as myself to be on a friendly footing with england i committed all this to writing the moment mr erskine left me i

was at colo peter randolphs about a fortnight ago  my schooling falling into discourse he said he thought it would be to my advantage to go to the college  was desirous i should go as indeed i am myself for several reasons in the first place as long as i stay at the mountains the loss of one fourth of my time is inevitable by companys coming here  detaining me from school and likewise my absence will in a great measure put a stop to so much company  by that means lessen the expences of the estate in housekeeping and on the other hand by going to the college i shall get a more universal acquaintance which may hereafter be serviceable to me  i suppose i can pursue my     studies in the greek  latin as well there as here  likewise learn something of the mathematics i shall be glad of your opinion thomas jefferson dec         fairfield john page to john page  fairfield december         dear page —this very day to others the day of greatest mirth and jollity sees me overwhelmed with more and greater misfortunes than have befallen a descendant of adam for these thousand years past i am sure and perhaps after excepting job since the creation of the world i think his misfortunes were somewhat greater than mine for although we may be pretty nearly on a level in other respects yet i thank my god i have the advantage of brother job in this that satan has not as yet put forth his hand to load me with bodily afflictions you must know dear page that i am now in a house surrounded with enemies who take counsel together against my soul and when i lay me down to rest they say among themselves come let us destroy him i am sure if there is such a thing as a devil in this world he must have been here last night and have had some hand in contriving what happened to me do you think the cursed rats at his instigation i suppose did not eat up my pocketbook which was in my pocket within a foot of my head and not contented with plenty for the present they carried     away my jemmyworked silk garters and half a dozen new minuets i had just got to serve i suppose as provision for the winter but of this i should not have accused the devil because you know rats will be rats and hunger without the addition of his instigations might have urged them to do this is something worse and from a different quarter had not happened you know it rained last night or if you do not know it i am sure i do when i went to bed i laid my watch in the usual place and going to take her up after i arose this morning i found her in the same place its true but quantum mutatus ab illo all afloat in water let in at a leak in the roof of the house and as silent and still as the rats that had eat my pocketbook now you know if chance had had anything to do in this matter there were a thousand other spots where it might have chanced to leak as well as this one which was perpendicularly over my watch but ill tell you its my opinion that the devil came and bored the hole over it on purpose well as i was saying my poor watch had lost her speech i should not have cared much for this but something worse attended it the subtle particles of the water with which the case was filled had by their penetration so overcome the cohesion of the particles of the paper of which my dear picture and watchpaper were composed  that in attempting to take them     out to dry them good god mens horret referre my cursed fingers gave them such a rent as i fear i never shall get over this cried i was the last stroke satan had in reserve for me he knew i cared not for anything else he could do to me and was determined to try this last most fatal expedient multis fortunæ vulneribus percussus huic uni me imparem sensi et penitus succubui i would have cried bitterly but i thought it beneath the dignity of a man and a man too who had read των οντων τα μεν εφἡμιν τα δ εϰ εφ ημιν however whatever misfortunes may attend the picture or lover my hearty prayers shall be that all the health and happiness which heaven can send may be the portion of the original and that so much goodness may ever meet with what may be most agreeable in this world as i am sure it must be in the next and now although the picture be defaced there is so lively an image of her imprinted in my mind that i shall think of her too often i fear for my peace of mind and too often i am sure to get through old coke this winter for god knows i have not seen him since i packed him up in my trunk in williamsburg well page i do wish the devil had old coke for i am sure i never was so tired of an old dull scoundrel in my life what are there so few inquietudes tacked to this momentary life of ours that we must need be loading ourselves with a thousand more or as brother     job says who by the bye i think began to whine a little under his afflictions are not my days few cease then that i may take comfort a little before i go whence i shall not return even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death but the old fellows say we must read to gain knowledge and gain knowledge to make us happy and admired mere jargon is there any such thing as happiness in this world no and as for admiration i am sure the man who powders most perfumes most embroiders most and talks most nonsense is most admired though to be candid there are some who have too much good sense to esteem such monkeylike animals as these in whose formation as the saying is the tailors and barbers go halves with god almighty and since these are the only persons whose esteem is worth a wish i do not know but that upon the whole the advice of these old fellows may be worth following you cannot conceive the satisfaction it would give me to have a letter from you write me very circumstantially everything which happened at the wedding was she there because if she was i ought to have been at the devil for not being there too if there is any news stirring in town or country such as deaths courtships or marriages in the circle of my acquaintance let me know it remember me affectionately to all the young ladies of my acquaintance particularly the miss burwells and miss potters and tell them that though that heavy earthly part of me my body be absent the better half of me my soul is ever with them and that my     best wishes shall ever attend them tell miss alice corbin that i verily believe the rats knew i was to win a pair of garters from her or they never would have been so cruel as to carry mine away this very consideration makes me so sure of the bet that i shall ask everybody i see from that part of the world what pretty gentleman is making his addresses to her i would fain ask the favour of miss becca burwell to give me another watchpaper of her own cutting which i should esteem much more though it were a plain round one than the nicest in the world cut by other hands—however i am afraid she would think this presumption after my suffering the other to get spoiled if you think you can excuse me to her for this i should be glad if you would ask her tell miss sukey potter that i heard just before i came out of town that she was offended with me about something what it is i do not know but this i know that i never was guilty of the least disrespect to her in my life either in word or deed as far from it as it has been possible for one to be i suppose when we meet next she will be endeavouring to repay an imaginary affront with a real one but she may save herself the trouble for nothing that she can say or do to me shall ever lessen her in my esteem and i am determined always to look upon her as the same honesthearted goodhumored agreeable lady i ever did tell—tell—in short tell them all ten thousand things more than either you or i can now or ever shall think of as long as we live my mind has been so taken up with thinking of my acquaintances that till this moment i almost     imagined myself in williamsburg talking to you in our old unreserved way and never observed till i turned over the leaf to what an immoderate size i had swelled my letter—however that i may not tire your patience by further additions i will make but this one more that i am sincerely and affectionately dear page your friend and servant p s i am now within an easy days ride of shadwell whither i shall proceed in two or three days thomas jefferson jan  0      shadwell john page to john page shadwell jan  0th      dear page —to tell you the plain truth i have not a syllable to write to you about for i do not conceive that any thing can happen in my world which you would give a curse to know or i either all things here appear to me to trudge on in one and the same round we rise in the morning that we may eat breakfast dinner and supper and go to bed again that we may get up the next morning and do the same so that you never saw two peas more alike than our yesterday and today under these circumstances what would you have me say would you that i should write nothing but truth i tell you i know nothing that is true or would you rather that i should write you a pack of lies why unless they were more ingenious than i am able to invent they would furnish you with little amusement what can i do then nothing but ask you the news in your world how have you done since i saw you   0 how did nancy look at you when you danced with her at southalls have you any glimmering of hope how does r b do had i better stay here and do nothing or go down and do less or in other words had i better stay here while i am here or go down that i may have the pleasure of sailing up the river again in a fullrigged flat inclination tells me to go receive my sentence and be no longer in suspense but reason says if you go and your attempt proves unsuccessful you will be ten times more wretched than ever in my last to you dated fairfield dec    i wrote to you of the losses i had sustained in the present i may mention one more which is the loss of the whites of my eyes in the room of which i have got reds which gives me such exquisite pain that i have not attempted to read anything since a few days after jack walker went down and god knows when i shall be able to do it i have some thoughts of going to petersburg if the actors go there in may if i do i do not know but i may keep on to williamsburg as the birth night will be near i hear that ben harrison has been to wilton let me know his success have you an inclination to travel page because if you have i shall be glad of your company for you must know that as soon as the rebecca the name i intend to give the vessel above mentioned is completely finished i intend to hoist sail and away i shall visit particularly england holland france spain italy where i would buy me a good fiddle and egypt and return through the british provinces to the northward home this to be sure would take     us two or three years and if we should not both be cured of love in that time i think the devil would be in it after desiring you to remember me to acquaintances below male and female i subscribe myself dear page your friend and servant thomas jefferson july         shadwell john page to john page shadwell july   th      dear page —yours of may  0th came safe to hand the rival  you mentioned i know not whether to think formidable or not as there has been so great an opening for him during my absence i say has been because i expect there is one no longer since you have undertaken to act as my attorney you advise me to go immediately and lay siege in form you certainly did not think at the time you wrote this of that paragraph in my letter wherein i mentioned to you my resolution of going to britain and to begin an affair of that kind now and carry it on so long a time in form is by no means a proper plan no no page whatever assurances i may give her in private of my esteem for her or whatever assurances i may ask in return from her depend on it—they must be kept in private necessity will oblige me to proceed in a method which is not generally thought fair that of treating with a ward before obtaining the approbation of her guardian i say necessity will oblige me to it because i never can bear to remain in suspense so long a time if i am     to succeed the sooner i know it the less uneasiness i shall have to go through if i am to meet with a disappointment the sooner i know it the more of life i shall have to wear it off and if i do meet with one i hope in god and verily believe it will be the last i assure you that i almost envy you your present freedom and if belinda will not accept of my service it shall never be offered to another that she may i pray most sincerely but that she will she never gave me reason to hope with regard to my not proceeding in form i do not know how she may like it i am afraid not much that her guardians would not if they should know of it is very certain but i should think that if they were consulted after i return it would be sufficient the greatest inconvenience would be my not having the liberty of visiting so freely this is a subject worth your talking over with her and i wish you would and would transmit to me your whole confab at length i should be scared to death at making her so unreasonable a proposal as that of waiting until i return from britain unless she could first be prepared for it i am afraid it will make my chance of succeeding considerably worse but the event at last must be this that if she consents i shall be happy if she does not i must endeavour to be as much so as possible i have thought a good deal on your case and as mine may perhaps be similar i must endeavour to look on it in the same light in which i have often advised you to look on yours perfect happiness i believe was never intended by the deity to be the lot of one of his creatures in this     world but that he has very much put in our power the nearness of our approaches to it is what i have steadfastly believed the most fortunate of us in our journey through life frequently meet with calamities and misfortunes which may greatly afflict us and to fortify our minds against the attacks of these calamities and misfortunes should be one of the principal studies and endeavours of our lives the only method of doing this is to assume a perfect resignation to the divine will to consider that whatever does happen must happen and that by our uneasiness we cannot prevent the blow before it does fall but we may add to its force after it has fallen these considerations and others such as these may enable us in some measure to surmount the difficulties thrown in our way to bear up with a tolerable degree of patience under this burthen of life and to proceed with a pious and unshaken resignation till we arrive at our journeys end when we may deliver up our trust into the hands of him who gave it and receive such reward as to him shall seem proportioned to our merit such dear page will be the language of the man who considers his situation in this life and such should be the language of every man who would wish to render that situation as easy as the nature of it will admit few things will disturb him at all nothing will disturb him much if this letter was to fall into the hands of some of our gay acquaintance your correspondent and his solemn notions would probably be the subjects of a great deal of mirth and raillery but to you i think     i can venture to send it it is in effect a continuation of the many conversations we have had on subjects of this kind and i heartily wish we could now continue these conversations face to face the time will not be very long now before we may do it as i expect to be in williamsburg by the first of october if not sooner i do not know that i shall have occasion to return if i can rent rooms in town to lodge in and to prevent the inconvenience of moving my lodgings for the future i think to build no castle though i assure you only a small house which shall contain a room for myself and another for you and no more unless belinda should think proper to favour us with her company in which case i will enlarge the plan as much as she pleases make my compliments to her particularly as also to sukey potter judy burwell and such others of my acquaintance as enquire after me i am dear page your sincere friend thomas jefferson      richmond william fleming to william fleming  richmond       dear will —from a crowd of disagreeable companions among whom i have spent three or four of the most tedious hours of my life i retire into gunns bedchamber to converse in black and white with an absent friend i heartily wish you were here     that i might converse with a christian once more before i die for die i must this night unless i should be relieved by the arrival of some sociable fellow but i will now endeavor to forget my present sufferings and think of what is more agreeable to both of us last saturday i left ned carters where i had been happy in other good company but particularly that of miss jenny taliaferro and though i can view the beauties of this world with the most philosophical indifference i could not but be sensible of the justice of the character you had given me of her she is in my opinion a great resemblance of nancy wilton but prettier i was vastly pleased with her playing on the spinnette and singing but could not help calling to mind those sublime verses of the cumberland genius   oh i was charmed to see   orpheus music all in thee when you see patsy dandridge tell her god bless her i do not like the ups and downs of a country life today you are frolicking with a fine girl and tomorrow you are moping by yourself thank god i shall shortly be where my happiness will be less interrupted i shall salute all the girls below in your name particularly s—y p—r  dear will i have thought of the cleverest plan of life that can be imagined you exchange lands for edgehill or i mine for fairfields you marry s—y p—r i marry r—a b—l join and get a pole chair and a pair of keen horses practise the law in the same     courts and drive about to all the dances in the country together how do you like it well i am sorry you are at such a distance i cannot hear your answer but however you must let me know it by the first opportunity and all the other news in the world which you imagine will affect me i am dear will yours affectionately thomas jefferson oct        willimsburg john page to john page williamsburg october        dear page —in the most melancholy fit that ever any poor soul was i sit down to write to you last night as merry as agreeable company and dancing with belinda in the apollo could make me i never could have thought the succeeding sun would have seen me so wretched as i now am i was prepared to say a great deal i had dressed up in my own mind such thoughts as occurred to me in as moving language as i knew how and expected to have performed in a tolerably creditable manner but good god when i had an opportunity of venting them a few broken sentences uttered in great disorder and interrupted with pauses of uncommon length were the too visible marks of my strange confusion the whole confab i will tell you word for word if i can when i see you which god send may be soon affairs at w and m  are in the greatest confusion walker mclurg and wat jones are expelled pro     tempore or as horrox softens it rusticated for a month lewis burwell warner lewis and one thompson have fled to escape flagellation i should have excepted warner lewis who came off of his own accord jack walker leaves town on monday the court is now at hand which i must attend constantly so that unless you come to town there is little probability of my meeting with you any where else for god sake come i am dear page your sincere friend thomas jefferson jan         devilsburg john page to john page devilsburg  january         the contents of your letter have not a little alarmed me and really upon seriously weighing them with what has formerly passed between — and myself i am somewhat at a loss what to conclude your semper saltat semper ridet semper loquitur semper solicitat c appear a little suspicious but good god it is impossible i told you our confab in the apollo but i believe i never told you that we had on another occasion i then opened my mind more freely and more fully i mentioned the necessity of my going to england and the delays which would consequently be occasioned by that i said in what manner i should conduct myself till then and explained my reasons which appears to give that satisfaction i could have wished in short i managed in such a manner that i was tolerably easy myself without doing anything which could     give αδνιλεβς friends the least umbrage were the whole that passed to be related to them i asked no question which would admit of a categorical answer but i assured αδνιλεβ that such questions would one day be asked—in short were i to have ananother interview with him i could say nothing now which i did not say then and were i with a view of obtaining one licentiam solicitandi aliis quibus degit postulare it would be previously necessary to go the rounds cum custodibus and after all this he could be in no other situation than he is at present after the proofs i have given of my sincerity he can be under no apprehension of a change in my sentiments and were i to do as my friends advise me i would give no better security than he has at present he is satisfied that i shall make him an offer and if he intends to accept of it he will disregard those made by others my fate depends on αδνιλεβς present resolutions by them i must stand or fall—if they are not favorable to me it is out of my power to say anything to make them so which i have not said already so that a visit could not possibly be of the least weight and it is i am sure what he does not in the least expect i hear you are courting f—y b—l  but shall not listen to it till i hear it from you when i was up the country i wrote a letter to you dated fairfield dec         let me know if you have received such a one as i suppose you do not use your statutes of britain if you can lend them to me till i can provide myself with a copy it will infinitely oblige me adieu dear page     thomas jefferson jan         devilsburg john page to john page devilsburg january

such a one god send mine of jan    to you may not have shared the same fate for by your letter i am uncertain whether you have received it or not you therein say you hope to have received an answer from me by this time by which i judge it has miscarried but you mention mine of dec    which put me in spirits again as i do not know how you should have got intelligence that i had wrote such a one unless you had seen my letter of jan    in which it was mentioned—yes there is one other way by which you might have received such intelligence my letter of jan    may have been opened and the person who did it may have been further incited by curiosity to ask you if you had received such a letter as they saw mentioned therein but god send and i hope this is not the case sukey potter to whom i sent it told me yesterday she delivered it to mr t nelson the younger who had delivered it to you—i hope with his own hand i wish i had followed your example and wrote it in latin and that i had called my dear campana in die instead of αδνιλεβ we must fall on some scheme of communicating our thoughts to each other which shall be totally unintelligible to every one but to ourselves i will send you some of these days sheltons tachygraphical   0 alphabet and directions jack walker is engaged to betsey moore and desired all his brethren might be made acquainted with his happiness but i hear he will not be married this year or two put campana in die in mind of me tell him i think as i always did i have sent my horses up the country so that it is out of my power to take even an airing on horseback at any time my paper holds out no longer so must bid you adieu thomas jefferson mar  0      wmsburg william fleming to william fleming  wmsburg march  0         oclock at night dear will —as the messenger who delivered me your letter informs me that your boy is to leave town tomorrow morning i will endeavor to answer it as circumstantially as the hour of the night and a violent headach with which i have been afflicted these two days will permit with regard to the scheme which i proposed to you some time since i am sorry to tell you it is totally frustrated by miss r bs marriage with jacquelin ambler which the people here tell me they daily expect i say the people here tell me so for can you believe it i have been so abominably indolent as not to have seen her since last october wherefore i cannot affirm that i knew it from herself though am as well satisfied that it is true as if she had told me well the lord bless her i say but s—y p—r is still left for you i have given her a description of the gentleman     who as i told her intended to make her an offer of his hand and asked whether or not he might expect it would be accepted she would not determine till she saw him or his picture now will as you are a piece of a limner i desire that you will seat yourself immediately before your lookingglass and draw such a picture of yourself as you think proper and if it should be defective blame yourself mind that i mentioned no name to her you say you are determined to be married as soon as possible and advise me to do the same no thank ye i will consider of it first many and great are the comforts of a single state and neither of the reasons you urge can have any influence with an inhabitant and a young inhabitant too of wmsburgh who told you that i reported you was courting miss dandridge and miss dangerfield it might be worth your while to ask whether they were in earnest or not so far was i from it that i frequently bantered miss j—y t—o  about you and told

devilsburg april  th      dear page —this letter will be conveyed to you by the assistance of our friend warner lewis poor fellow never did i see one more sincerely captivated in my life he walked to the indian camp with her yesterday by which means he had an opportunity of giving her two or three love squeezes by the hand and like a true arcadian swain has been so enraptured ever since that he is company for no one b—y  has at last bestowed her hand on b—d and whether it was for money beauty or principle will be so nice a dispute that no one will venture to pronounce two days before the wedding i was not a little surprised on going to the door at my house to see him alight from his horse he stepped up to me and desired the favour of me to come to mr yates at such a time it was so unexpected that for some time i could make no reply at last i said yes and turned about and walked back into my    room i accordingly attended and to crown the joke when i got there was dubbed a bridesman there were many other curious circumstances too tedious to mention here jack walker is expected in town tomorrow how does your pulse beat after your trip to the isle of wight what a high figure i should have cut had i gone when i heard who visited you there i thought i had met with the narrowest escape in the world i wonder how i should have behaved—i am sure i should have been at a great loss if your mistress can spare you a little time your friends here would be very glad to see you particularly small and myself as every thing is now ready for taking the height of this place above the water of the creeks flemings relapse will justly afford you great matter of triumph after rallying you so much on being in love adieu dear page p s walker is just arrived—he goes out of town

pleads that the church     of the plaintiff became void by the death of the incumbent that the plaintiff and i s each pretending a right presented two several clerks that the church being thus rendered litigious he was not obliged by the ecclesiastical law to admit either until an inquisition de jure patronatus in the ecclesiastical court that by the same law this inquisition was to be at the suit of either claimant and was not ex officio to be instituted by the bishop and at his proper costs that neither party had desired such an inquisition that six months passed whereon it belonged to him of right to present as on a lapse which he had done the plaintiff demurred a question was how far the ecclesiastical law was to be respected in this matter by the common law court and prisot c

passage to prove that the scriptures or christianity is a part of the common law  nd because prisot says ceo est common ley sur quel touts manners leis sont fondés now it is true that the ecclesiastical law so far as admitted in england derives its authority from the common law but it would not be true that the scriptures so derive their authority  rd the whole case and arguments     shew that the question was how far the ecclesiastical law in general should be respected in a common law court and in bros abr of this case littleton says les juges del common ley prendra conusans quid est lex ecclesiae vel admiralitatis et hugus modi  th because the particular part of the ecclesiastical law then in question viz the right of the patron to present to his advowson was not founded on the law of god but subject to the modification of the lawgiver and so could not introduce any such general position as finch pretends yet wingate in      thinks proper to erect this false quotation into a maxim of the common law expressing it in the very words of finch but citing prisot wing max   next comes sheppard in      who states in it the same words of finch and quotes the y b finch and wingate   shep abr tit religion in the case of the king and taylor sir matthew hale lays it down in these words christianity is parcel of the laws of england   ventr       keb  0  but he quotes no authority it was from this part of the supposed common law that he derived his authority for burning witches so strong was this doctrine become in      by additions and repetitions from one another that in the case of the king v woolston the court would not suffer it to be debated whether to write against christianity was punishable in the temporal courts at common law saying it had been so settled in taylors case ante   stra     therefore wood in his institute lays it down that all blasphemy and profaneness are offences by the common law and     cites strange ubi supra wood  0  and blackstone about      repeats in the words of sir matthew hale that christianity is part of the laws of england citing ventr and stra ubi supra   bl    lord mansfield qualified it a little by saying in the case of the chamberlain of london v evans      that the essential principles of revealed religion are part of the common law but he cites no authority and leaves us at our peril to find out what in the opinion of the judge and according to the measures of his foot or his faith are those essential principles of revealed religion obligatory on us as a part of the common law thus we find this string of authorities when examined to the beginning all hanging on the same hook a perverted expression of prisots or on nothing for they all quote prisot or one another or nobody thus finch quotes prisot wingate also sheppard quotes prisot finch and wingate hale cites nobody the court in woolstons case cite hale wood cites woolstons case blackstone that and hale and lord mansfield like hale ventures it on his own authority in the earlier ages of the law as in the year books for instance we do not expect much recurrence to authorities by the judges because in those days there were few or none such made public but in later times we take no judges word for what the law is further than he is warranted by the authorities he appeals to his decision may bind the unfortunate individual who happens to be the particular subject of it but it cannot alter the law although the common law be termed lex non scripta     yet the same hale tells us when i call those parts of our laws leges non scriptæ i do not mean as if all those laws were only oral or communicated from the former ages to the latter merely by word for all these laws have their several monuments in writing whereby they are transferred from one age to another and without which they would soon lose all kind of certainty they are for the most part extant in records of pleas proceedings and judgments in books of reports and judicial decisions in tractates of learned mens arguments and opinions preserved from antient times and still extant in writing hales com law    authorities for what is common law may therefore be as well cited as for any part of the lex scripta and there is no better instance of the necessity of holding the judges and writers to a declaration of their authorities than the present where we detect them endeavoring to make law where they found none and to submit us at one stroke to a whole system no particular of which has its foundation in the common law or has received the esto of the legislator for we know that the common law is that system of law which was introduced by the saxons on their settlement in england and altered from time to time by proper legislative authority from that to the date of the magna charta which terminates the period of the common law or lex non scripta and commences that of the statute law or lex scripta this settlement took place about the middle of the fifth century but christianity was not introduced till the seventh century the conversion of the first christian king     of the heptarchy having taken place about the year     and that of the last about     here then was a space of two hundred years during which the common law was in existence and christianity no part of it if it ever therefore was adopted into the common law it must have been between the introduction of christianity and the date of the magna charta but of the laws of this period we have a tolerable collection by lambard and wilkins probably not perfect but neither very defective and if any one chooses to build a doctrine on any law of that period supposed to have been lost it is incumbent on him to prove it to have existed and what were its contents these were so far alterations of the common law and became themselves a part of it but none of these adopt christianity as a part of the common law if therefore from the settlement of the saxons to the introduction of christianity among them that system of religion could not be a part of the common law because they were not yet christians and if having their laws from that period to the close of the common law we are able to find among them no such act of adoption we may safely affirm though contradicted by all the judges and writers on earth that christianity neither is nor ever was a part of the common law another cogent proof of this truth is drawn from the silence of certain writers on the common law bracton gives us a very complete and scientific treatis of the whole body of the common law he wrote this about the close of the reign of henry iii a very few years after the date of the magna charta we may   0 consider this book as the more valuable as it was written about the time which divides the common and statute law and therefore gives us the former in its ultimate state bracton too was an ecclesiastic and would certainly not have failed to inform us of the adoption of christianity as a part of the common law had any such adoption ever taken place but no word of his which intimates anything like it has ever been cited fleta and britton who wrote in the succeeding reign of e i are equally silent so also is glanvil an earlier writer than any of them to wit temp h   but his subject perhaps might not have led him to mention it it was reserved for finch five hundred years after in the time of charles ii by a falsification of a phrase in the year book to open this new doctrine and for his successors to join fullmouth in the cry and give to the fiction the sound of fact justice fortescue aland who possessed more saxon learning than all the judges and writers before mentioned put together places this subject on more limited ground speaking of the laws of the saxon kings he says the ten commandments were made part of their law and consequently were once part of the law of england so that to break any of the ten commandments was then esteemed a breach of the common law of england and why it is not so now perhaps it may be difficult to give a good reason pref to fortescues rep xvii the good reason is found in the denial of the fact houard in his coutumes anglonormandes      notices the falsification of the laws of alfred by prefixing     to them four chapters of the jewish law to wit the  0th   st   nd and   rd chapters of exodus to which he might have added the   th of the acts of the apostles v    to    and precepts from other parts of the scripture these he calls hors dœuvre of some pious copyist this awkward monkish fabrication makes the preface to alfreds genuine laws stand in the body of the work and the very words of alfred himself prove the fraud for he declares in that preface that he has collected these laws from those of ina of offa aethelbert and his ancestors saying nothing of any of them being taken from the scripture it is still more certainly proved by the inconsistencies it occasions for example the jewish legislator exodus xxi          copied by the pseudo alfred §    makes murder with the jews death but alfred himself ll ccvi punishes it by a fine only called a weregild proportioned to the condition of the person killed it is remarkable that hume append i to his history examining this article of the laws of alfred without perceiving the fraud puzzles himself with accounting for the inconsistency it had introduced to strike a pregnant woman so that she die is death by exod xxi       and pseud alfr §    but by the ll alfred ix the offender pays a weregild for both the woman and child to smite out an eye or a tooth exod xxi   –   pseud alfred §     0 if of a servant by his master is freedom to the servant in every other case retaliation but by alfred ll xl a fixed indemnification is paid theft of an ox or a sheep by the jewish law xxii exod   was repaid     five fold for the ox and four fold for the sheep by the pseudograph §    double for the ox and four fold for the sheep but by alfred ll xvi he who stole a cow and calf was to repay the worth of the cow and  0s for the calf goring by an ox was the death of the ox and the flesh not to be eaten exod xxi    pseud alfr §    by ll alfr xxiv the wounded person had the ox this pseudograph makes municipal laws of the ten commandments §  – 0 regulate concubinage §    makes it death to strike or to curse father or mother §       give an eye for an eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burning for burning wound for wound stripe for stripe §    sells the thief to repay his theft §    obliges the fornicator to marry the woman he has lain with §    forbids interest on money §       make the laws of bailment and very different from what lord holt delivers in coggs v bernard and what sir william jones tells us they were and punishes witchcraft with death §  0 which sir matthew hale   p c ch    declares was not a felony before the stat   jac c    it was under that statute that he hung rose cullender and amy duny    car        on whose trial he declared that there were such creatures as witches he made no doubt at all for  st the scriptures had affirmed as much  nd the wisdom of all nations had provided laws against such persons—and such hath been the judgment of this kingdom as appears by that act of parliament which hath provided punishments proportionable to the quality of the offence and we must certainly allow greater weight to this position     that it was no felony till jamess statutes deliberately laid down in his h p c a work which he wrote to be printed and transcribed for the press in his lifetime than to the hasty scriptum that at common law witchcraft was punished with death as heresy by writ de heretico comburendo in his methodical summary of the p c pa   a work not intended for the press nor fitted for it and which he declared himself he had never read over since it was written preface unless we understand his meaning in that to be that witchcraft could not be punished at common law as witchcraft but as a heresy in either sense however it is a denial of this pretended law of alfred now all men of reading know that these pretended laws of homicide concubinage theft retaliation compulsory marriage usury bailment and others which might have been cited from this pseudograph were never the laws of england not even in alfreds time and of course that it is a forgery yet palpable as it must be to a lawyer our judges have piously avoided lifting the veil under which it was shrouded in truth the alliance between church and state in england has ever made their judges accomplices in the frauds of the clergy and even bolder than they are for instead of being contented with the surreptitious introduction of these four chapters of exodus they have taken the whole leap and declared at once that the whole bible and testament in a lump make a part of the common law of the land the first judicial declaration of which was by this sir matthew hale and thus they incorporate into the english     code laws made for the jews alone and the precepts of the gospel intended by their benevolent author as obligatory only in foro conscientiæ and they arm the whole with the coercions of municipal law  they do this too in a case where the question was not at all whether christianity was a part of the laws of england but simply how far the ecclesiastical law was to be respected by the common law courts of england in the special case of a right of presentment thus identifying christianity with the ecclesiastical law of england thomas jefferson aug         staunton

  0 on behalf of the plaintiff it was insisted  st that if he could be detained in servitude by his firstmaster     he could not be aliened but  nd that he could not be detained in servitude   it was observed that the purpose of the act was to punish and deter women from that confusion of species which the legislature seems to have considered as an evil and not to oppress their innocent offspring that accordingly it had made cautious provision for the welfare of the child by leaving it to the discretion of the church wardens to choose out a proper master and by directing that that master should provide for it sufficient food clothing and lodging and should not give immoderate correction for these purposes the master enters into covenants with the church wardens and to admit he had a power after this to sell his ward would be to admit him a power of discharging himself of his covenants     nor is this objection answered by saying that the covenants of the first master are transferred to the alienee because he may be insolvent of the damages which should be recovered against him and indeed they might be of such a nature as could not be atoned for either to the servant or to society such for instance would be a corruption of morals either by the wicked precept or example of the master or of his family the truth is the master is bound to the servant for food raiment and protection and is not at liberty by aliening his charge to put it out of his own power to afford them when wanting the servant may as well set up a right of withdrawing from his master those personal services which he in return is bound to yield him again the same trust which is created by express compact in favor of the first mulatto is extended by the law to her issue the legislature confiding that the choice of a master for the first mulatto by the church wardens would be prudent vest the issue in him also without further act to be done and the master at the time he takes the mother knowing that her issue also is to be under her servitude on the same conditions does by accepting her tacitly undertake to comply with those conditions raised by the law in their favor these servants bear greater resemblance to apprentices than to slaves thus on the death of the first master they go to his executor as an apprentice would and not to his heir as a slave the master is chosen in both cases from an opinion of his peculiar propriety for that charge and the performances of his duty in both cases is secured by mutual covenants now it     is well known that an apprentice can not be aliened and that not from any particular provision of the legislature but from the general nature of the connection and engagements between them there being as was before observed a trust reposed in the diligence and discretion of the master and a trust by our law cannot be assigned it adheres to the person as closely as does his integrity and he can no more transfer the one than the other to a purchaser but  nd it was insisted that the plaintiff being a mulatto of the third generation would not be detained in servitude under any law whatever the grand position now to be proved being that one law had reduced to servitude the first mulatto only the immediate offspring of a white woman by a negro or mulatto man that a second law had extended it to the children of that mulatto but that no law had yet extended it to her grandchildren or other issue more remote than this to prove this a general statement of these laws was premised act of   0  c    s    if any woman servant shall have a bastard child by a negro or mulatto or if a free christian white woman shall have such bastard child by a negro or mulatto in both the said cases the churchwardens shall bind the said child to be a servant until it shall be of thirty one years of age in other parts of the act it is declared who shall be slaves and what a manumission of them from sect    to    are regulations solely relative to slaves among which is sect    baptism of slaves doth not exempt them from bondage and all children shall be bond or free     according to the condition of their mothers and the particular directions of this act act      c   s    where any female mulatto or indian by law obliged to serve till the age of thirty or thirty one years shall during the time of her servitude have any child born of her body every such child shall serve the master or mistress of such mulatto or indian until it shall attain the same age the mother of such child was obliged by law to serve unto in      the assembly revising and digesting the whole body of our acts of assembly in act    s   incorporate the clauses before cited without any addition or alteration and in      c   s      the law of      is reenacted with some new matter which does not effect the present question now it is plain the plaintiff does not come within the description of the act of   0  s    that only reducing to servitude the child of a white woman by a negro or mulatto man this was the predicament of the plaintiffs grandmother i suppose it will not be pretended that the mother being a servant the child would be a servant also under the law of nature without any particular provision in the act under the law of nature all men are born free every one comes into the world with a right to his own person which includes the liberty of moving and using it at his own will this is what is called personal liberty and is given him by the author of nature because necessary for his own sustenance the reducing the mother to servitude was a violation of the law of nature surely then the same law cannot prescribe a     continuance of the violation to her issue and that too without end for if it extends to any it must to every degree of descendants puff b   c   s     supports this doctrine for having proved that servitude to be rightful must be founded on either compact or capture in war he proceeds to shew that the children of the latter only follow the condition of the mother for which he gives this reason that the person and labor of the mother in a condition of perfect slavery as he supposes to be that of the captive in war being the property of the master it is impossible she should maintain it but with her masters goods by which he supposes a debt contracted from the infant to the master but he says in cases of servitude founded on contract the food of the future issue is contained or implied in their own maintenance which their master owes them as a just debt and consequently their children are not involved in a necessity of slavery this is the nature of the servitude introduced by the act of   0  the master deriving his title to the service of the mother entirely from the contract entered into with the churchwardens that the bondage of the mother does not under the law of nature infer that of her issue as included in her is further obvious from this consideration that by the same reason the bondage of the father would infer that of his issue for he may with equal and some anatomists say with greater reason be said to include all his posterity but this very law admits there is no such descent of condition from father to child when it imposes servitude on the child of a slave which would have been unnecessary if the     condition had descended of course again if it be a law of nature that the child shall follow the condition of the parent it would introduce a very perplexing dilemma as where the one parent is free and the other a slave here the child is to be a slave says this this law by inheritance of the fathers bondage but it is also to be free says the same law by inheritance of its mothers freedom this contradiction proves it to be no law of nature but the   th section of the act will perhaps be cited as the entailing condition of the mother on the child where it says that children shall be bond or free according to the condition of the mother and the particular direction of this act now that the word bond in this clause relates to slaves only i am justified in asserting not only from common parlance but also from its sense in other parts of this very act and that on the other hand it considers those who were to be free after a temporary servitude as described under the word free in this very section    it says baptism of slaves does not exempt them from bondage here then in the very sentence now under consideration the word bondage is used to express perpetual slavery and we cannot conceive they meant to use it in two different senses in the same sentence so in clause nineteen of the same act it says to prevent that abominable mixture of white men or women with negroes or mulattoes whatever white man or woman being free shall intermarry with a negro or mulatto c shall be committed to prison c now unless the act means to include white servants and apprentices under the denomination     of freemen then a white servant or apprentice may intermarry with a negro or mulatto but this is making the act miss of its purpose which was to prevent the abominable mixture of white men or women with negroes or mulattoes but to put it out of dispute the next clause twenty says that if any minister shall notwithstanding presume to marry a white man or woman with a negro or mulatto he shall incur such a penalty here then the prohibition is extended to whites in general without saying free whites as the former clause did but these two clauses are plainly coextensive and consequently the word free in the nineteenth was intended to include the temporary white servants taken in by the twentieth clause under the general appellation of white men or women so that this act where it speaks of bondmen means those who are perpetual slaves and where of freemen those who are to be free after a temporary servitude as well as those who are so now indeed to suppose where the act says the children of a bondwoman shall be bond that it means the children of a temporary servant shall be temporary servants would infer too much for it would make temporary servants of the children of white servant women or of white apprentice women which yet was never pretended the conclusion i draw from this is that since the temporary service of a white woman does not take from her the appellation of a freewoman in the sense of this act and her children under this very clause are free as being the children of a free woman neither does the temporary servitude of a mulatto     exclude her from the same appellation and her children also shall be free under this clause as the children of a free woman so that the meaning of this clause is that children shall be slaves where slavery was the condition of the mother and free where freedom either immediate or remote was her condition excepting only the instance of the mulatto bastard which this act makes a servant though the mother was free this is the case alluded to by the last words of the clause according to the particular direction of this act because in this case the act had made a temporary servant of the child though the mother was not so then comes the act of      directing that where any female mulatto or indian by law obliged to serve till thirty or thirty one shall have a child during her servitude such child shall serve the same master to the same age this act does itself prove that the child was not obliged to serve under the former law of   0  which had imposed servitude on the mother and consequently that the clause children shall be bond or free according to the condition of the mother affected the children of slaves only for wherefore else was this law made if the children of a mulatto held in temporary servitude were to follow the condition of the mother and be temporary servants under the law of   0  that of      was wholly unnecessary but on the contrary when we find an assembly within eighteen years after the law of   0  had been passed the one half or whom would probably be the same members who had passed that law when we see these people i say enacting expressly     that the children should be temporary servants it is a strong proof the makers of the first law had not intended they should be so expositio contemporanea est optima is a maxim in our law because such exposition is supposed to be taken from the makers of the law themselves who best knew their own intention and it is doubly conclusive where the makers themselves pass a new act to testify their intention so that i hold it certain the act of   0  did not extend to the children of the first mulatto or that of      would not have been made that the act of      did not extend to the plaintiff is apparent from its words where any female mulatto by law obliged to serve till thirty one that is the plaintiffs grandmother shall during the time of her servitude have a child born of her body that is the plaintiffs mother such a child shall serve till thirty one this act describes the plaintiffs mother then as the subject on which to operate the common sense of mankind would surely spare me the trouble of proving the word child does not include the grandchild greatgrandchild greatgreatgrandchild c in infinitum or if that would not the act itself precludes me by declaring it meant only a child born of her body so that as the law of   0  has made a servant of the first mulatto that of      extends it to her children the act of      is the next in course at this time all our acts were revised and digested and sent in one volume to receive his majestys approbation these two laws being found to be on the same subject were then incorporated without any alteration this   0 however could not affect their meaning which is still to be sought after by considering the component acts in their separate state at any rate it cannot affect the condition of the plaintiff who was born in      which was six years before it was made the same may be said of the law of      which is copied from      with only the addition of some new matter foreign to the present question so that on the laws of   0  and      alone it is to be determined with respect to which i have endeavored to shew that the first of them subjected to servitude the first mulatto only that this did not under the law of nature affect the liberty of the children because under that law we are all born free because the servitude of the mother was founded on compact which implies maintenance of her children so as to have them under no obligation to the master and because this descent of condition from parent to child would introduce a contradiction where the one parent is free and the other in servitude that as little are they affected by the words of the act children shall be bond or free according to the condition of the mother because that act uses the word bond so as to shew it means thereby those only who are perpetual slaves and by the word free those who are entitled to freedom in præsenti or in futuro and consequently calling the mother free says her children shall be free because it would make servants of the children of     white servants

july       0 charlottesville thomas adams to thomas adams  merchant charlottesville july       0 dear sir —i take the liberty of interceding for your friendly aid to mr james ogilvie a gentleman of my acquaintance now in london purposing last fall to go to britain for orders he made the usual application to the commissary for his recommendatory letter to the bishop this man partly from an evil disposition to defeat the wishes of some gentlemen no     favorites of his who bore a warm friendship to mr ogilvie and partly from that elation of mind which usually attends preferment without merit and which has no other object in view but to hang out to the world its own importance peremptorily refused his recommendation the cause of refusal which he assigned unfortunately gave the lie to his own conduct of a few weeks before he thought ogilvie not qualified for the sacred function because he did not possess a critical knowledge of the greek tho but a very few weeks before he had thought his sadler properly qualified who was not only a stranger to the characters but perhaps even to the present existence of that language he did however condescend to promise ogilvie that he would not oppose his ordination with the bishop a promise which seems to have been made with no other than the wanton purpose of sporting with truth for tho ogilvie sailed within a few days after receiving this promise the commissarys letter found means to be before him and to lodge with the bishop a caveat against his ordination here then the matter rests till his friends can take proper measures for counteracting the designs of this worthy representative of episcopal faith and as he is obliged to remain in london in the meantime and probably went unprovided for so long a stay i would ask the favor of you and i shall deem it a very great one to procure him credit with your mercantile friends in london for any monies of which he may be in need for the repaiment of which i enter myself security i do not know that i can profer you any reward for this favor other than the sublime pleasure     of relieving distressed merit a pleasure which can be properly felt by the virtuous alone i would hope at the same time that the receipt of interest might prevent any pecuniary injury from such advancements should you find it convenient to lend such assistance you will be pleased to give mr ogilvie notice of it by a letter directed to him at mrs ballards hungerford street in the strand i would also beg in that case that you would embrace the first opportunity of doing it as we are totally in the dark what may be the necessaries of his situation you will be pleased to excuse the freedom and perhaps impropriety of this application my feelings are warm in the cause of this gentleman and having no connections or correspondence on that side of the water i apply to the single friendship from which i could hope effectual aid to any person there in whose welfare i am interested nevertheless if this aid should be attended with inconvenience i expect and insist that you shall decline it with the same freedom with which i ask it and be assured that i am with much sincerity your friend  humble servt thomas jefferson july       0 albemarle peyton randolph to peyton randolph albemarle july       0 honorable sir —i am to beg the favor of your friendly interposition in the following case which i hope you will think sufficient to excuse the freedom of the application some time last fall mr jas ogilvie purposing to go for orders made the usual application     to the commissary for his recommendatory letter to the bishop the commissary finding him somewhat deficient in his greek expressed some doubts whether he could recommend him ogilvie to remove them did without thought to be sure make use of a very unfortunate argument mentioning to the commissary the case of stevenson who without understanding a word of greek had been lately recommended the commissary took flame at the hint and peremptorily refused his recommendation in several subsequent visits ogilvie attempted to soften him and did at length prevail so far as to obtain a promise that he would not oppose his ordination with the bishop with this assurance and with an actual nomination to a parish in his pocket he took his departure but whether the commissarys frame is such as that he does not feel the obligations of an engagement or whether he really thought he had done wrong in entering it i cannot say but before ogilvie reached london he had lodged a letter with the bishop in which were these words mr ogilvie applied to me last spring for a recommendation to your lordships for holy orders for reasons which then existed i refused him he has now applied to me a second time as these reasons are not removed i have denied him again but he goes home in opposition nothing could have been more artfully contrived  to do him a prejudice the bishop observed to colo mercer who had espoused ogilvies interest with some warmth that had mr horrocks mentioned his objections it would have left him to judge whether they were such as he might have overlooked but that a     charge so general laid his whole character open to censure in such a manner as to put it out of his power to vindicate it this young gentleman seems to have been guided thro life by the hand of misfortune itself some hard fatality which presides over all his measures has rendered abortive every scheme which either his prudence or the anxiety of his friends have ever proposed for his advancement his present undertaking was peculiarly unfortunate before he went to london he paid a visit to his father a presbyterian minister in aberdeen who received him with all the joy with which an absence of many years could inspire a parent yet so wonderful is the dominion of bigotry over her votaries that on the first information of his purpose to receive episcopal ordination he shut him from his doors and abjured every parental duty thus rejected by that hand from which he had expected some assistance necessary even for the short residence on that side of the water which he had then in contemplation he hastened to london and there received the last stroke which fortune had in reserve for him the distresses of his situation operating on a mind uncommonly sensible to the pains as well as to the pleasures of life may be conceived even by those to whom fortune has been kinder there he still remains then and there he must remain for it is his last stake till the commissary can be prevailed on either to withdraw his opposition or to explain the grounds of it or till we can take such other measures as may counteract its malignity the former is the easier and shorter relief to ogilvies distress and it is not impossible     but that the commissary may by this time be disposed to assist him for this purpose i have ventured to ask your interposition with him on behalf of this gentleman in whose cause i have warm feelings this liberty i have taken with you not on any assumed rights of friendship or acquaintance but merely on the principles of common humanity to which his situation seems to recommend him and on the hope that you will think with the good man in the play homo sum humani nil a me alienum puto i have no interest at our episcopal palace and indeed any application if known to come from me would rather be of disservice i flatter myself your interposition there would have certain effect and assure you it would lay me under lasting obligations i suppose the most certain assistance would be a letter from the commissary to the bishop but one thing i must conjure you to do to see the letter yourself that you may judge whether it be really friendly or not i confess to you mr speaker that i put not the least confidence in the most solemn promises of this reverend gentleman and unless yourself can be assured of the security of his endeavors i had rather proceed at once in such measures as may answer our purpose tho in opposition after your application i have one further favor to ask of you that if it is unsuccessful you will give me notice by a line lodged in the post office if successful as i doubt not but it will be you would be so kind as to inclose his letter under cover to ogilvie and direct to him at mrs ballards hungerford street in the strand london as this would be a more speedy communication of relief to     him than sendg the letter via albemarle i have no proffers to make you in return for all this trouble fortune seems to have reserved your obligations for herself you have nothing to ask i nothing to give i can only assure you then that i sincerely rejoice in the independence of your situation i mean an independence on all but your own merit than which i am sure you cannot have a more permanent dependence i am sir with much truth your very humble servt end of volume i   each volume will

mean to treat giving our enemy notice of our intentions before we had taken any steps to execute them the event however was that the question was postponed it is to be renewed on monday when i mean to move that it should be postponed for   weeks or months in the mean time the plan of confederation  the scheme of treaty may go on i dont know whether i shall succeed in this motion i think not it is

different account is given of this by john adams as follows the committee had several meetings in which were proposed the articles of which the declaration was to consist and minutes made of them the committee then appointed mr jefferson and me to draw them up in form and clothe them in a proper dress the subcommittee met and considered the minutes making such observations on them as then occurred when mr jefferson desired me to take them to my lodgings and make the draught this i declined and gave several reasons for declining   that he was a virginian and i a massachusettensian   that he was a southern man and i a northern one   that i had been so obnoxious for my early and constant zeal in promoting the measure that any draught of mine would undergo a more severe scrutiny and criticism in congress than one of his composition   and lastly and that would be reason enough if there were no other i had a great opinion of the elegance of his pen and none at all of my own i therefore insisted that no hesitation should be made on his part he accordingly took the minutes and in a day or two produced to me his draught whether i made or suggested any correction i remember not the report was made to the committee of five by them examined but whether altered or corrected in any thing i cannot recollect but in substance at least it was reported to congress where after a severe criticism and striking out several of the most oratorical paragraphs it was adopted on the fourth of july      and published to the world—autobiography of john adams you inquire why so young a man as mr jefferson was placed at the head of the committee for preparing a declaration of independence i answer it was the frankfort advice to place virginia at the head of every thing mr richard henry lee might be gone to virgina to his sick family for aught i know but that was not the reason of mr jeffersons appointment there were three committees appointed at the same time one for the declaration of independence another for preparing the articles of confederation another for preparing a treaty to be proposed to france mr lee was chosen for the committee of confederation and it was not thought convenient that the same person should be upon both mr jefferson came into congress in june      and brought with him a reputation for literature science and a happy talent of composition writings of his were handed about remarkable for the peculiar felicity of expression though a silent member in congress he was so prompt frank explicit and decisive upon committees and in conversation not even samuel adams was more so that he soon seized upon my heart and upon this occasion i gave him my vote and did all in my power to procure the votes of others i think he had one more vote than any other and that placed him at the head of the committee i had the next highest number and that placed me the second the committee met discussed the subject and then appointed mr jefferson and me to make the draft i suppose because we were the two first on the list the subcommittee met jefferson proposed to me to make the draft i said i will not you should do it oh no why will you not you ought to do it i will not why reasons enough what can be your reasons reason first—you are a virginian and a virginian ought to appear at the head of this business reason second—i am obnoxious suspected and unpopular you are very much otherwise reason third—you can write ten times better than i can well said jefferson if you are decided i will do as well as i can very well when you have drawn it up we will have a meeting a meeting we accordingly had and conned the paper over i was delighted with its high tone and the flights of oratory with which it abounded especially that concerning negro slavery which though i knew his southern brethren would never suffer to pass in congress i certainly never would oppose there were other expressions which i would not have inserted if i had drawn it up particularly that which called the king tyrant i thought this too personal for i never believed george to be a tyrant in disposition and in nature i always believed him to be deceived by his courtiers on both sides of the atlantic and in his official capacity only cruel i thought the expression too passionate and too much like scolding for so grave and solemn a document but as franklin and sherman were to inspect it afterwards i thought it would not become me to strike it out i consented to report it and do not now remember that i made or suggested a single alteration we reported it to the committee of five it was read and i do not remember that franklin or sherman criticised any thing we were all in haste congress was impatient and the instrument was reported as i believe in jeffersons handwriting as he first drew it congress cut off about a quarter of it as i expected they would but they obliterated some of the best of it and left all that was exceptionable if anything in it was i have long wondered that the original draught has not been published i suppose the reason is the vehement philippic against negro slavery—john adams to timothy pickering aug         to this jefferson replied you have doubtless seen timothy pickerings fourth of july observations on the declaration of independence if his principles and prejudices personal and political gave us no reason to doubt whether he had truly quoted the information he alleges to have received from mr adams i should then say that in some of the particulars mr adams memory has led him into unquestionable error at the age of eightyeight and fortyseven years after the transactions of independence this is not wonderful nor should i at the age of eighty on the small advantage of that difference only venture to oppose my memory to his were it not supported by written notes taken by myself at the moment and on the spot he says the committee of five to wit doctor franklin sherman livingston and ourselves met discussed the subject and then appointed him and myself to make the draught that we as a subcommittee met and after the urgencies of each on the other i consented to undertake the task that the draught being made we the subcommittee met and conned the paper over and he does not remember that he made or suggested a single alteration now these details are quite incorrect the committee of five met no such thing as a subcommittee was proposed but they unanimously pressed on myself alone to undertake the draught i consented i drew it but before i reported it to the committee i communicated it separately to doctor franklin and mr adams requesting their corrections because they were the two members of whose judgments and amendments i wished most to have the benefit before presenting it to the committee and you have seen the original paper now in my hands with the corrections of doctor franklin and mr adams interlined in their own handwritings their alterations were two or three only and merely verbal i then wrote a fair copy reported it to the committee and from them unaltered to congress this personal communication and consultation with mr adams he has misremembered into the actings of a subcommittee pickerings observations and mr adams in addition that it contained no new ideas that it is a common place compilation its sentiments hacknied in congress for two years before and its essence contained in otis pamphlet may all be true of that i am not to be the judge richard henry lee charged it as copied from lockes treatise on government otis pamphlet i never saw and whether i had gathered my ideas from reading or reflection i do not know i know only that i turned to neither book nor pamphlet while writing it i did not consider it as any part of my charge to invent new ideas altogether and to offer no sentiment which had ever been expressed before—letter to j madison aug  0        george read opposing and thomas mckean   cæsar rodney   dickinson and robert morris did not attend wilson changed his vote and with franklin and morton outvoted willing and humphreys   july  th   monday july  st no sitting was held on saturday   the resolution for independence was under discussion on the  st of july the declaration on july  d  d and  th   the question whether the declaration was signed on the  th of july as well as on the  d of august has been a much vexed one but a careful study of it must make almost certain that it was not the ms journal of congress that printed by order of congress being fabricated and altered merely required its authentication which we know from other cases was by the signatures of the president and secretary who accordingly signed it by order and in behalf of the congress and the printed copies at once sent out had only these signatures it is also certain that several of the members then in congress would have refused to sign it on that day and that the congress therefore had good cause to postpone the signing till certain of the delegations should receive new instructions or be changed and also till its first effect on the people might be seen for these reasons the declaration was not even entered in the journal though a blank was left for it and when it was inserted at a later period the list of signers was taken from the engrossed copy though had there been one signed on the  th of july it would certainly have been the one printed from as including the men who were in congress on that day and who voted on the question instead of one signed by a number of men who were neither present nor members when the declaration was adopted moreover though the printed journal afterwards led john adams to believe and state that the declaration was signed on the  th we have his contemporary statement on july  th that as soon as an american seal is prepared i conjecture the declaration will be subscribed by all the members and we have the positive denial of mckean that no person signed it on that day and this statement is substantiated by the later action of congress in specially permitting him to sign what he certainly would have already done on the  th had there been the opportunity opposed to these direct statements and probabilities we have jeffersons positive statement three times repeated that such a signing took place but as he follows his nearly contemporary one with the statements that it was signed by every member present except mr dickinson when we have proof positive that all the new york delegates refused to even vote much less sign and that dickinson was not even present in congress on that day it is evident that this narrative is not wholly trustworthy   i expected you had in the preamble to our form of government exhausted the subject of complaint agt geo  d  was at a loss to discover what congress would do for one to their declaration of independence without copying but find you have acquitted your selves very well on that score—e pendleton to jefferson july    i am also obliged by ye original declaration of independence which i find your brethren have treated as they did ye manifesto last summer—altered it much for the worse their hopes of a reconciliation might restrain them from plain truths then but what could cramp them now—e pendleton to jefferson aug  0        this is printed just as jefferson prepared it for the press by comparing it with the text as printed post under july        it will be seen that he took the liberty of somewhat changing and even expunging portions   this is an interlineation made at a later period—apparently after the question as to the signing of the declaration was raised jefferson has also written the following on a slip and pasted it on the sheet some erroneous statements of the proceedings on the declaration of independence having got before the public in latter times mr samuel a wells asked explanations of me which are given in my letter to him of may       before and now again referred to i took notes in my place while these things were going on and at their close wrote them out in form and with correctness and from   to   of the two preceding sheets are the originals then written as the two following are of the earlier debates on the confederation which i took in like manner   in the works of john adams ii     are printed his memoranda of the debates on the confederation wherein he has recorded the following sentences from jeffersons speeches on that subject article    the limits of the southern colonies are fixed moves an amendment that all purchases of lands not within the boundaries of any colony shall be made by congress of the indians in a great council article    what are reasonable limits what security have we that the congress will not curtail the present settlements of the states i have no doubt that the colonies will limit themselves article    thinks the congress will have a short meeting in the fall and another in the spring article    explains it to mean the indians who live in the colony these are subject to the laws in some degree    i protest against the right of congress to decide upon the right of virginia virginia has released all claims to lands settled by maryland c   robert treat paine   he therefore proposed struck out in ms by author   seconded the proposition struck out in ms by author   so far going beyond mr chases proposition struck out in ms by author   here end the notes which jefferson states were taken while these things were going on and at their close were written out in form and with correctness much of their value depends on the date of their writing but there is nothing to show this except negative evidence the sheets were all written at the same time which makes the writing after aug        while the misstatements as to the signing and as to dickinsons presence would seem almost impossible unless greater time even than this had elapsed between the occurrence and the notes the ms is moreover considerably corrected and interlined which would hardly be the case if merely a transcript of rough notes   ordered that leave be given to bring in a bill for the establishment of courts of justice within this commonwealth and that mr

bill as passed which was to the effect that by mutual agreement of the parties the case could be submitted to the judge without the calling of a jury but otherwise a jury trial should be given such having been the law before the extinction of the courts by the revolutionary conflict moreover with the rough draft of the bill already alluded to is a separate paper in pendletons handwriting containing his amendments to the bill which does not alter in any way the jury system in the original bill   this is erroneously stated the earliest step towards this limitation was the permission of the house of delegates nov        to john henry and starke to introduce a bill to prohibit the importation of slaves on nov   d henry introduced a bill which was read for a first and second time on that day and then postponed from time to time till the end of the session in the next session the matter was taken up de novo on oct         by the house of delegates ordering the committee of trade

jeffersons account of this convention and as it assembled to consider the commercial condition of the states and the delegates excepting those from new jersey were strictly limited to that question by their commissions it is hardly likely that their discussions extended to the question of a republican or kingly government   it is hardly necessary to state that hamilton left the convention because by the secession of his two colleagues from new york his state was no longer able to vote his return and signing of the constitution as an individual act met with the gravest criticism within his own state   according to maclays journal     and to jacksons speech annals        these expresses and vessels were despatched immediately after the presentation of hamiltons report jan   th and long before his recommendations were embodied in a bill a résumé of his report was printed in fennos gazette for jan  0th and in full in the issue for jan   th and these were extensively copied in the country press it was therefore in the period gained by these expresses over the regular mail that the certificates were filched but it should be borne in mind that from the memorials of the public creditors of pennsylvania and new jersey the resolution of the house of representatives and the address of washington all of which had had extensive circulation the public were already aware of the probable payment of these certificates which is further shown by the steady rise in their value even before hamiltons report was presented   jefferson has here made the curious errors of separating the funding and assumption act and of supposing the latter was over before he reached new york hamiltons report was debated in the house of representatives from february to april and it was not till

came into place  that i should consider the national convention called but not met as we had yet heard to be a legitimate body hamilton doubted whether it would be a legitimate body and whether if the

legislation that has ever occurred in english jurisprudence or perhaps in any other it is that of the adoption in mass of the whole code of another nation and its incorporation into the legitimate system by usurpation of the judges alone without a particle of legislative will having ever been called on or exercised towards its introduction or confirmation it is not dated but in his letter to thomas cooper of feb  0      jefferson in enclosing an abbreviated and somewhat altered copy as an extract from his common place book     writes of it in my letter of january    i promised you a sample from my commonplace book of the pious disposition of the english judges to connive at the frauds of the clergy a disposition which has often rendered them faithful allies in practice when i was a student of the law now half a century ago after getting through coke littleton whose matter cannot be abridged i was in the habit of abridging and commonplacing what i read meriting it and of sometimes mixing my own reflections on the subject i now enclose you the extract from these entries which i promised they were written at a time of life when i was bold in the pursuit of knowledge never fearing to follow truth and reason to whatever results they led and bearding every authority which stood in their way this must be the apology if you find the conclusions bolder than historical facts and principles will warrant accept with them the assurances of my great esteem and respect   in the already alluded to copy of this sent to thomas cooper in      the remainder of this by what is clearly a long subsequent interpolation is made to read as follows in doing this too they have not even used the connecticut caution of declaring as is done in their blue laws that the laws of god shall be the laws of their land except where their own contradict them but they swallow the yea and nay together finally in answer to fortescue alands question why the ten commandments should not be a

mr pendleton asked me to draw the resolutions which i did they were accepted by the house and pendleton nicholas myself and some others were appointed a committee to prepare the address the committee desired me to do it but when presented it was thought to pursue too strictly the diction of the resolutions and that their subjects were not amplified mr nicholas chiefly objected to it and was desired by the committee to draw one more at large which he did with amplification enough and it was accepted being a young man as well as a young member it made on me an impression proportioned to the sensibility of that time of life   probably mr william fontaine of hanover county   by this term he no doubt designated mr dabney carr his brotherinlaw   this and jeffersons argument in the case

department of state being an opinion endorsed on the power of the general court to established fees—e pendleton and t jefferson may        this latter is entirely in the handwriting of pendleton leaving it a matter of uncertainty what part was supplied by jefferson the two former owe their preservation to their incorporation in a collection of law reports which was prepared for publication by jefferson some time before his death and published in      under the title of reports of cases determined in the general court of virginia from    0 to    0 and from      to      therein he says of this case this case was referred to the determination of the court on facts stated by the counsel for both parties which were that the plaintiffs grandmother was a mulatto begotten of a white woman by a negro man after the year   0  and bound by the churchwardens under the law of that date to serve to the age of thirtyone that after the year      but during her servitude she was delivered of the plaintiffs mother who during her servitude to wit in      was delivered of the plaintiff and he again was sold by the person to whom his grandmother was bound to the defendant who now claims his service till he shall be thirtyone years of age    wythe for the defendant was about to answer but the court interrupted him and gave judgement in favor of his client   this and the following letter
