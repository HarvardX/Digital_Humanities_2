now adapted to the improved edition of that poem       the vision of the maid of orleans   the first book      orleans was hushd in sleep stretchd on her couch   the delegated maiden lay with toil   exhausted and sore anguish soon she closed   her heavy eyelids not reposing then   for busy phantasy in other scenes   awakened whether that superior powers   by wise permission prompt the midnight dream   instructing so the passive   faculty   or that the soul escaped its fleshly clog   flies free and soars amid the invisible world   and all things are that   seem                                 along a moor   barren and wide and drear and desolate   she roamd a wanderer thro the cheerless night   far thro the silence of the unbroken plain   the bitterns boom was heard hoarse heavy deep   it made most fitting music to the scene   black clouds driven fast before the stormy wind   swept shadowing thro their broken folds the moon   struggled sometimes with transitory ray   and made the moving darkness visible   and now arrived beside a fenny lake   she stands amid its stagnate waters hoarse   the long sedge rustled to the gales of night   an ageworn bark receives the maid impelld   by powers unseen then did the moon display   where thro the crazy vessels yawning side   the muddy wave oozed in a female guides   and spreads the sail before the wind that moand   as melancholy mournful to her ear   as ever by the dungeond wretch was heard   howling at evening round the embattled towers   of that hellhouse   of france ere yet sublime   the almighty people from their tyrants hand   dashd down the iron rod                            intent the maid   gazed on the pilots form and as she gazed   shiverd for wan her face was and her eyes   hollow and her sunk cheeks were furrowed deep   channelld by tears a few grey locks hung down   beneath her hood then thro the maidens veins   chill crept the blood for as the nightbreeze passd   lifting her tattcrd mantle coild around   she saw a serpent gnawing at her heart    the plumeless bat with short shrill note flits by   and the nightravens scream came fitfully   borne on the hollow blast eager the maid   lookd to the shore and now upon the bank   leaps joyful to escape yet trembling still   in recollection                      there a mouldering pile   stretchd its wide ruins oer the plain below   casting a gloomy shade save where the moon   shone thro its fretted windows the dark yew   withering with age branched there its naked roots   and there the melancholy cypress reard   its head the earth was heavd with many a mound   and here and there a halfdemolishd tomb    and now amid the ruins darkest shade   the virgins eye beheld where pale blue flames   rose wavering now just gleaming from the earth   and now in darkness drownd an aged man   sat near seated on what in longpast days   had been some sculpturd monument now fallen   and halfobscured by moss and gathered heaps   of withered yewleaves and earthmouldering bones   and shining in the ray was seen the track   of slimy snail obscene composed his look   his eye was large and rayless and fixd full   upon the maid the blue flames on his face   streamd a pale light his face was of the hue   of death his limbs were mantled in a shroud    then with a deep heartterrifying voice   exclaimd the spectre welcome to these realms   these regions of despair o thou whose steps   by grief conducted to these sad abodes   have pierced welcome welcome to this gloom   eternal to this everlasting night   where never morning darts the enlivening ray   where never shines the sun but all is dark   dark as the bosom of their gloomy king    so saying he arose and by the hand   the virgin seized with such a deathcold touch   as froze her very heart and drawing on   her to the abbeys inner ruin led   resistless thro the broken roof the moon   glimmerd a scatterd ray the ivy twined   round the dismantled column imaged forms   of saints and warlike chiefs mosscankerd now   and mutilate lay strewn upon the ground   with crumbled fragments crucifixes fallen   and rusted trophies and amid the heap   some monuments defaced legend spake   all human glory vain                          the loud blast roard   amid the pile and from the tower the owl   screamd as the tempest shook her secret nest   he silent led her on and often pausd   and pointed that her eye might contemplate   at leisure the drear scene                               he dragged her on   thro a low iron door down broken stairs   then a cold horror thro the maidens frame   crept for she stood amid a vault and saw   by the sepulchral lamps dim glaring light   the fragments of the dead                              look here he cried   damsel look here survey this house of death   o soon to tenant it soon to increase   these trophies of mortality for hence   is no return gaze here behold this skull   these eyeless sockets and these unfleshd jaws

seat of life                                  so spake despair   the vaulted roof echoed his hollow voice   and all again was silence quick her heart   panted he drew a dagger from his breast   and cried again haste damsel to repose   one blow and rest for ever on the fiend   dark scowld the virgin with indignant eye   and dashd the dagger down he next his heart   replaced the murderous steel and drew the maid   along the downward vault                             the damp earth gave   a dim sound as they passd the tainted air   was cold and heavy with unwholesome dews   behold the fiend exclaimd how gradual here   the fleshly burden of mortality   moulders to clay then fixing his broad eye   full on her face he pointed where a corpse   lay livid she beheld with loathing look   the spectacle abhorrd by living man    look here despair pursued this loathsome mass   was once as lovely and as full of life   as damsel thou art now those deepsunk eyes   once beamd the mild light of

   fearfully   the maid lookd down and saw the well known face   of theodore in thoughts unspeakable   convulsed with horror oer her face she claspd   her cold damp hands shrink not the phantom cried   gaze on for ever gaze more firm he graspd   her quivering arm this lifeless mouldering clay   as well thou knowst was warm with all the glow   of youth and love this is the arm that cleaved   salisburys proud crest now motionless in death   unable to protect the ravaged frame   from the foul offspring of mortality   that feed on heroes tho long years were thine   yet never more would life

with life                        the maid stood motionless   and wistless what she did with trembling hand   received the dagger starting then she cried   avaunt despair eternal wisdom deals   or peace to man or misery for his good   alike designd and shall the creature cry   why hast thou done this and with impious pride   destroy the life god gave                                the fiend

embitters death    such maiden are the pangs that wait the hour   of calmest dissolution yet weak man   dares in his timid piety to live   and veiling fear in superstitions garb   he calls her

            whilst he spake his eye   dwelt on the maidens cheek and read her soul   struggling within in trembling doubt she stood   even as the wretch whose famishd entrails crave   supply before

oer thy form   exposed unmantled the brute multitude   shall gaze and thou shalt hear the ribald taunt   more painful than the circling flames that scorch   each quivering member wilt thou not in vain   then wish my friendly aid then wish thine ear   had drank my words of comfort that thy hand   had graspd the dagger and in death preserved   insulted modesty                       her glowing cheek

guntram king of the franks was liberal to the poor and he himself experienced the wonderful effects of divine liberality for one day as he was hunting in a forest he was separated from his companions and arrived at a little stream of water with only one comrade of tried and approved fidelity here he found himself opprest by drowsiness and reclining his head upon the servants lap went to sleep the servant witnessed a wonderful thing for he saw a little beast bestiolam creep out of the mouth of his sleeping master and go immediately to the streamlet which it vainly attempted to cross the servant drew his sword and laid it across the water over which the little beast easily past and crept into a hole of a mountain on the opposite side from whence it made its appearance again in an hour and returned by the same means into the kings mouth the king then awakened and told his companion that he had dreamt that he was arrived upon the bank of an immense river which he had crossed by a bridge of iron and from thence came to a mountain in which a great quantity of gold was concealed when the king had concluded the servant related what he had beheld and they both went to examine the mountain where upon digging they discovered an immense weight of gold  i stumbled upon this tale in a book entitled sphinx theologicophilosophica authore johanne heidfeldio ecclesiaste ebersbachiano       the same story is in matthew of westminster it is added that guntram applied the treasures thus found to pious uses  for the truth of this theory there is the evidence of a monkish miracle when thurcillus was about to follow st julian and visit the world of souls his guide said to him let thy body rest in the bed for thy spirit only is about to depart with me and lest the body should appear dead i will send into it a vital breath  the body however by a strange sympathy was affected like the spirit for when the foul and fetid smoke that arose from tithes witheld had nearly suffocated thurcillus and made him cough twice those who were near his body said that it coughed twice about the same time  matthew paris   footnote   the bastille the expression is in one of fullers works an author from whose quaintness and ingenuity i have always found amusement and sometimes assistance   footnote   these lines strongly resemble a passage in the pharonnida of william chamberlayne a poet who has told an interesting story in uncouth rhymes and mingled sublimity of thought and beauty of expression with the quaintest conceits and most awkward inversions                     on a rock more high   than natures common surface she beholds   the mansion house of fate which thus unfolds   its sacred mysteries a trine within   a quadrate placed both these encompast in   a perfect circle was its form but what   its matter was for us to wonder at   is undiscovered left a tower there stands   at every angle where times fatal hands   the impartial parcæ dwell i the first she sees   clotho the kindest of the destinies   from immaterial essences to cull   the seeds of life and of them frame the wool   for lachesis to spin about her flie   myriads of souls that yet want flesh to lie   warmd with their functions in whose strength bestows   that power by which man ripe for misery grows    her next of objects was that glorious tower   where that swiftfingered nymph that spares no hour   from mortals service draws the various threads   of life in several lengths to weary beds   of age extending some whilst others in   their infancy are broke some blackt in sin   others the favorites of heaven from whence   their origin candid with innocence   some purpled in afflictions others dyed   in sanguine pleasures some in glittering pride   spun to adorn the earth whilst others wear   rags of deformity but knots of care   no thread was wholly free from next to this   fair glorious tower was placed that black abyss   of dreadful atropos the baleful seat   of death and horrour in each room repleat   with lazy damps loud groans and the sad sight   of pale grim ghosts those terrours of the night   to this the last stage that the winding clew   of life can lead mortality unto   fear was the dreadful porter which let in   all guests sent thither by destructive sin   it is possible that i may have written from the recollection of this passage the conceit is the same and i willingly attribute it to chamberlayne a poet to whom i am indebted for many hours of delight and whom i one day hope to rescue from undeserved oblivion         the vision of the maid of orleans   the second book    she spake and lo celestial radiance beamd amid the air such odors wafting now as erst came blended with the evening gale from edens bowers of bliss an angel form stood by the maid his wings etherial white flashd like the diamond in the noontide sun dazzling her mortal eye all else appeard her theodore               amazed she saw the fiend was fled and on her ear the wellknown voice sounded tho now more musically sweet than ever yet had thrilld her charmed soul when eloquent affection fondly told the daydreams of delight                           beloved maid lo i am with thee still thy theodore hearts in the holy bands of love combind death has no power to sever thou art mine a little while and thou shalt dwell with me in scenes where sorrow is not cheerily tread thou the path that leads thee to the grave rough tho it be and painful for the grave is but the threshold of eternity  favourd of heaven to thee is given to view these secret realms the bottom of the abyss thou treadest maiden here the dungeons are where bad men learn repentance souls diseased must have their remedy and where disease is rooted deep the remedy is long perforce and painful                         thus the spirit spake and led the maid along a narrow path dark gleaming to the light of faroff flames more dread than darkness soon the distant sound of clanking anvils and the lengthened breath provoking fire are heard and now they reach a wide expanded den where all around tremendous furnaces with hellish blaze flamed dreadful at the heaving bellows stood the meagre form of care and as he blew to augment the fire the fire augmented scorchd his wretched limbs sleepless for ever thus he toild and toild of toil to reap no end but endless toil and neverending woe  an aged man went round the infernal vault urging his workmen to their ceaseless task white were his locks as is the wintry snow on hoar plinlimmons head a golden staff his steps supported powerful talisman which whoso feels shall never feel again the tear of pity or the throb of love touchd but by this the massy gates give way the buttress trembles and the guarded wall guarded in vain submits him heathens erst had deified and bowed the suppliant knee to plutus nor are now his votaries few tho he the blessed teacher of mankind hath said that easier thro the needles eye shall the huge camel   pass than the rich man enter the gates of heaven ye cannot serve your god and worship mammon                             missioned maid so spake the angel know that these whose hands round each white furnace ply the unceasing toil were mammons slaves on earth they did not spare to wring from poverty the hardearnd mite they robbd the orphans pittance they could see wants asking eye unmoved and therefore these ranged round the furnace still must persevere in mammons service scorched by these fierce fires and frequent deluged by the oerboiling ore yet still so framed that oft to quench their thirst unquenchable large draughts of molten   gold they drink insatiate still with pain renewed pain to destroy                    so saying her he led forth from the dreadful cavern to a cell brilliant with gemborn light the rugged walls part gleamd with gold and part with silver ore a milder radiance shone the carbuncle there its strong lustre like the flamy sun shot forth irradiate from the earth beneath and from the roof a diamond light emits rubies and amethysts their glows commixd with the gay topaz and the softer ray shot from the sapphire and the emeralds hue and bright pyropus                     there on golden seats a numerous sullen melancholy train sat silent maiden these said theodore are they who let the love of wealth absorb all other passions in their souls that vice struck deeplyrooted like the poisontree that with its shade spreads barrenness around these maid were men by no atrocious crime blackend no fraud nor ruffian violence men of fair dealing and respectable on earth but such as only for themselves heapd up their treasures deeming all their wealth their own and given to them by partial heaven to bless them only therefore here they sit possessed of gold enough and by no pain tormented save the knowledge of the bliss they lost and vain repentance here they dwell loathing these useless treasures till the hour of general restitution                           thence they past and now arrived at such a gorgeous dome as even the pomp of eastern opulence could never equal wandered thro its halls a numerous train some with the redswoln eye of riot and intemperancebloated cheek some pale and nerveless and with feeble step and eyes lacklustre                       maiden said her guide these are the wretched slaves of appetite curst with their wish enjoyed the epicure here pampers his foul frame till the palld sense loaths at the banquet the voluptuous here plunge in the tempting torrent of delight and sink in misery all they wishd on earth possessing here whom have they to accuse but their own folly for the lot they chose yet for that these injured themselves alone they to the house of penitence may hie and by a long and painful regimen to wearied nature her exhausted powers restore till they shall learn to form the wish of wisdom and almighty goodness grants that prize to him who seeks it                                   whilst he spake the board is spread with bloated paunch and eye fat swoln and legs whose monstrous size disgraced the human form divine their caterer hight gluttony set forth the smoaking feast and by his side came on a brother form with fiery cheek of purple hue and red and scurfywhite mixd motley his gross bulk like some huge hogshead shapend as applied him had antiquity with mystic rites adord to him the sons of greece and thine imperial rome on many an altar pourd the victim blood with godlike titles graced bacchus or dionusus son of jove deemd falsely for from follys ideot form he sprung what time

the noble domes of princes and statewearied ministers maddening he reigns and when the affrighted mind casts oer a long career of guilt and blood its eye reluctant then his aid is sought to lull the worm of conscience to repose he too the halls of country squires frequents but chiefly loves the learned gloom that shades thy offspring rhedycina and thy walls granta nightly libations there to him profuse are pourd till from the dizzy brain triangles circles parallelograms moods tenses dialects and demigods and logic and theology are swept by the red deluge                    unmolested there he reigns till comes at length the general feast septennial sacrifice then when the sons of england meet with watchful care to chuse their delegates wise independent men unbribing and unbribd and culld to guard their rights and charters from the encroaching grasp of greedy power then all the joyful land join in his sacrifices so inspird to make the important choice                               the observing maid addressd her guide these theodore thou sayest are men who pampering their foul appetites injured themselves alone but where are they the worst of villains viperlike who coil around the guileless female so to sting the heart that loves them                            them the spirit replied a long and dreadful punishment awaits for when the prey of want and infamy lower and lower still the victim sinks even to the depth of shame not one lewd word one impious imprecation from her lips escapes nay not a thought of evil lurks in the polluted mind that does not plead before the

her vacant face a smile that promisd premature assent tho her regret behind a meagre fiend disciplind sorely                     here they entered in and now arrived where as in study tranced she sat the mistress of the dome her face spake that composed severity that knows no angry impulse no weak tenderness resolved and calm before her lay that book that hath the words of life and as she read sometimes a tear would trickle down her cheek tho heavenly joy beamd in her eye the while  leaving her undisturbd to the first ward of this great lazarhouse the angel led the favourd maid of orleans kneeling down on the hard stone that their bare knees had worn in sackcloth robed a numerous train appeard hardfeatured some and some demurely grave yet such expression stealing from the eye as tho that only naked all the rest was one close fitting mask a scoffing fiend for fiend he was tho wisely serving here mockd at his patients and did often pour ashes upon them and then bid them say their prayers aloud and then he louder laughed for these were hypocrites on earth revered as holy ones who did in public tell their beads and make long prayers and cross themselves and call themselves most miserable sinners that so they might be deemd most pious saints and go all filth and never let a smile bend their stern muscles gloomy sullen men barren of all affection and all this to please their god forsooth and therefore scorn grinnd at his patients making them repeat their solemn farce with keenest raillery tormenting but if earnest in their prayer they pourd the silent sorrows of the soul to heaven then did they not regard his mocks which then came painless and humility soon rescued them and led to penitence that she might lead to heaven                      from thence they came where in the next ward a most wretched band groand underneath the bitter tyranny of a fierce daemon his coarse hair was red pale grey his eyes and bloodshot and his face wrinkled by such a smile as malice wears in ecstacy wellpleased he went around plunging his dagger in the hearts of some or probing with a poisond lance their breasts or placing coals of fire within their wounds or seizing some within his mighty grasp he fixd them on a stake and then drew back and laughd to see them writhe                              these said the spirit are taught by cruelty to loath the lives they led themselves here are those wicked men who loved to exercise their tyrant power on speechless brutes bad husbands undergo a long purgation here the traffickers in human flesh here too are disciplined till by their suffering they have equalld all the miseries they inflicted all the mass of wretchedness caused by the wars they waged the towns they burnt for they who bribe to war are guilty of the blood the widows left in want the slave or led to suicide or murdered by the foul infected air of his close dungeon or more sad than all his virtue lost his very soul enslaved and driven by woe to wickedness                                 these next whom thou beholdest in this dreary room so sullen and with such an eye of hate each on the other scowling these have been false friends tormented by their own dark thoughts here they dwell in the hollow of their hearts there is a worm that feeds and tho thou seest that skilful leech who willingly would heal the ill they suffer judging of all else by their own evil standard they suspect the aid be vainly proffers lengthening thus by vice its punishment                          but who are these the maid exclaimd that robed in flowing lawn and mitred or in scarlet and in caps like cardinals i see in every ward performing menial service at the beck of all who bid them                       theodore replied these men are they who in the name of christ did heap up wealth and arrogating power did make men bow the knee and call themselves most reverend graces and right reverend lords they dwelt in palaces in purple clothed and in fine linen therefore are they here and tho they would not minister on earth here penanced they perforce must minister for he the lowly man of nazareth hath said his kingdom is not of the world so saying on they past and now arrived where such a hideous ghastly groupe abode that the maid gazed with halfaverting eye and shudderd each one was a loathly corpse the worm did banquet on his putrid prey yet had they life and feeling exquisite tho motionless and mute                           most wretched men are these the angel cried these joan are bards whose loose lascivious lays perpetuate who sat them down deliberately lewd so to awake and pamper lust in minds unborn and therefore foul of body now as then they were of soul they here abide long as the evil works they left on earth shall live to taint mankind a dreadful doom yet amply merited by that bad man who prostitutes the sacred gift of song and now they reached a huge and massy pile massy it seemd and yet in every blast as to its ruin

measured line   the good old term appears oh it looks ill   when delicate tongues disclaim old terms of kin   sirring and madaming as civilly   as if the road between the heart and lips   were such a weary and laplandish way   that the poor travellers came to the red gates   half frozen trust me cousin margaret   for many a day my memory has played   the creditor with me on your account   and made me shame to think that i should owe   so long the debt of kindness but in truth   like christian on his pilgrimage i bear   so heavy a pack of business that albeit   i toil on mainly in our twelve hours race   time leaves me distanced loath indeed were i   that for a moment you should lay to me   unkind neglect mine margaret is a heart   that smokes not yet methinks there should be some   who know how warm it beats i am not one   who can play off my smiles and courtesies   to every lady of her lap dog tired   who wants a plaything i am no sworn friend   of halfanhour as apt to leave as love   mine are no mushroom feelings that spring up   at once without a seed and take no root   wiseliest distrusted in a narrow sphere   the little circle of domestic life   i would be known and loved the world beyond   is not for me but margaret sure i think   that you should know me well for you and i   grew up together and when we look back   upon old times our recollections paint   the same familiar faces did i wield   the wand of merlins magic i would make   brave witchcraft we would have a faery ship   aye a new ark as in that other flood   that cleansed the sons of anak from the earth   the sylphs should waft us to some goodly isle   like that where whilome old apollidon   built up his blameless spell and i would bid   the sea nymphs pile around their coral bowers   that we might stand upon the beach and mark   the faroff breakers shower their silver spray   and hear the eternal roar whose pleasant sound   told us that never mariner should reach   our quiet coast in such a blessed isle   we might renew the days of infancy   and life like a long childhood pass away   without one care it may be margaret   that i shall yet be gathered to my friends   for i am not of those who live estranged   of choice till at the last they join their race   in the family vault if so if i should lose   like my old friend the pilgrim this huge pack   so heavy on my shoulders i and mine   will end our pilgrimage most pleasantly   if not if i should never get beyond   this vanity town there is another world   where friends will meet and often margaret   i gaze at night into the boundless sky   and think that i shall there be born again   the exalted native of some better star   and like the rude american i hope   to find in heaven the things i loved on earth           the cross roads  the circumstance related in the following ballad happened about forty years ago in a village adjacent to bristol a person who was present at the funeral told me the story and the particulars of the interment as i have versified them     the cross roads     there was an old man breaking stones     to mend the turnpike way   he sat him down beside a brook   and out his bread and cheese he took     for now it was midday    he lent his back against a post     his feet the brook ran by   and there were watercresses growing   and pleasant was the waters flowing     for he was hot and dry    a soldier with his knapsack on     came travelling oer the down   the sun was strong and he was tired   and of the old man he enquired     how far to bristol town    half an hours walk for a young man     by lanes and fields and stiles   but you the footpath do not know   and if along the road you go     why then tis three good miles    the soldier took his knapsack off     for he was hot and dry   and out his bread and cheese he took   and he sat down beside the brook     to dine in company    old friend in faith the soldier says     i envy you almost   my shoulders have been sorely prest   and i should like to sit and rest     my back against that post    in such a sweltering day as this     a knapsack is the devil   and if on tother side i sat   it would not only spoil our chat     but make me seem uncivil    the old man laughd and moved i wish     it were a greatarmd chair   but this may help a man at need   and yet it was a cursed deed     that ever brought it there    theres a poor girl lies buried here     beneath this very place   the earth upon her corpse is prest   this stake is driven into her breast     and a stone is on her face    the soldier had but just lent back     and now he half rose up   theres sure no harm in dining here   my friend and yet to be sincere     i should not like to sup    god rest her she is still enough     who sleeps beneath our feet   the old man cried no harm i trow   she ever did herself tho now     she lies where four roads meet    i have past by about that hour     when men are not most brave   it did not make my heart to fail   and i have heard the nightingale     sing sweetly on her grave    i have past by about that hour     when ghosts their freedom have   but there was nothing here to fright   and i have seen the glowworms light     shine on the poor girls grave    theres one who like a christian lies     beneath the churchtrees shade   id rather go a long mile round   than pass at evening thro the ground     wherein that man is laid    theres one that in the churchyard lies     for whom the bell did toll   he lies in consecrated ground   but for all the wealth in bristol town    i would not be with his soul    didst see a house below the hill     that the winds and the rains destroy   twas then a farm where he did dwell   and i remember it full well     when i was a growing boy    and she was a poor parish girl     that came up from the west   from service hard she ran away   and at that house in evil day     was taken in to rest    the man he was a wicked man     and an evil life he led   rage made his cheek grow deadly white   and his grey eyes were large and light     and in anger they grew red    the man was bad the mother worse     bad fruit of a bad stem   twould make your hair to standonend   if i should tell to you my friend     the things that were told of them    didst see an outhouse standing by     the walls alone remain   it was a stable then but now   its mossy roof has fallen through     all rotted by the rain    the poor girl she had servd with them     some halfayear or more   when she was found hung up one day   stiff as a corpse and cold as clay     behind that stable door    it is a very lonesome place     no hut or house is near   should one meet a murderer there alone   twere vain to scream and the dying groan     would never reach mortal ear    and there were strange reports about     that the coroner never guest   so he decreed that she should lie   where four roads meet in infamy     with a stake drove in her breast    upon a board they carried her     to the place where four roads met   and i was one among the throng   that hither followed them along     i shall never the sight forget    they carried her upon a board     in the cloaths in which she died   i saw the cap blow off her head   her face was of a dark dark red     her eyes were starting wide    i think they could not have been closed     so widely did they strain   i never saw so dreadful a sight   and it often made me wake at night     for i saw her face again    they laid her here where four roads meet     beneath this very place   the earth upon her corpse was prest   this post is driven into her breast     and a stone is on her face            the sailor  who had served in the slave trade  in september      a dissenting minister of bristol discovered a sailor in the neighbourhood of that city groaning and praying in a hovel the circumstance that occasioned his agony of mind is detailed in the annexed ballad without the slightest addition or alteration by presenting it as a poem the story is made more public and such stories ought to be made as public as possible     the sailor  who had served in the slavetrade     he stoptit surely was a groan     that from the hovel came   he stopt and listened anxiously     again it sounds the same    it surely from the hovel comes     and now he hastens there   and thence he hears the name of christ     amidst a broken prayer    he entered in the hovel now     a sailor there he sees   his hands were lifted up to heaven     and he was on his knees    nor did the sailor so intent     his entering footsteps heed   but now the lords prayer said and now     his halfforgotten creed    and often on his saviour calld     with many a bitter groan   in such heartanguish as could spring     from deepest guilt alone    he askd the miserable man     why he was kneeling there   and what the crime had been that causd     the anguish of his prayer    oh i have done a wicked thing     it haunts me night and day   and i have sought this lonely place     here undisturbd to pray    i have no place to pray on board     so i came here alone   that i might freely kneel and pray     and call on christ and groan    if to the mainmast head i go     the wicked one is there   from place to place from rope to rope     he follows every where    i shut my eyesit matters not     still still the same i see   and when i lie me down at night     tis always day with me    he follows follows every where     and every place is hell   o godand i must go with him     in endless fire to dwell    he follows follows every where     hes still abovebelow   oh tell me where to fly from him     oh tell me where to go    but tell me quoth the stranger then     what this thy crime hath been   so haply i may comfort give     to one that grieves for sin    o i have done a cursed deed     the wretched man replies   and night and day and every where     tis still before my eyes    i saild on board a guineaman     and to the slavecoast went   would that the sea had swallowed me     when i was innocent    and we took in our cargo there     three hundred negroe slaves   and we saild homeward merrily     over the ocean waves    but some were sulky of the slaves     and would not touch their meat   so therefore we were forced by threats     and blows to make them eat    one woman sulkier than the rest     would still refuse her food   o jesus god i hear her cries     i see her in her blood    the captain made me tie her up     and flog while he stood by   and then he cursd me if i staid     my hand to hear her cry    she groand she shriekdi could not spare     for the captain he stood by   dear god that i might rest one night     from that poor womans cry    she twisted from the blowsher blood     her mangled flesh i see   and still the captain would not spare     oh he was worse than me    she could not be more glad than i     when she was taken down   a blessed minutetwas the last     that i have ever known    i did not close my eyes all night     thinking what i had done   i heard her groans and they grew faint     about the rising sun    she groand and groand but her groans grew     fainter at morning tide   fainter and fainter still they came     till at the noon she died    they flung her overboardpoor wretch     she rested from her pain   but wheno christ o blessed god     shall i have rest again    i saw the sea close over her     yet she was still in sight   i see her twisting every where     i see her day and night    go where i will do what i can     the wicked one i see   dear christ have mercy on my soul     o god deliver me    to morrow i set sail again     not to the negroe shore   wretch that i am i will at least     commit that sin no more    o give me comfort if you can     oh tell me where to fly   and bid me hope if there be hope     for one so lost as i    poor wretch the stranger he replied     put thou thy trust in heaven   and call on him for whose dear sake     all sins shall be forgiven    this night at least is thine go thou     and seek the house of prayer   there shalt thou hear the word of god     and he will help thee there             jaspar  the stories of the two following ballads are wholly imaginary i may say of each as john bunyan did of his pilgrims progress     it came from mine own heart so to my head   and thence into my fingers trickled   then to my pen from whence immediately   on paper i did dribble it daintily     jaspar      jaspar was poor and want and vice     had made his heart like stone   and jaspar lookd with envious eyes     on riches not his own    on plunder bent abroad he went     towards the close of day   and loitered on the lonely road     impatient for his prey    no traveller came he loiterd long     and often lookd around   and pausd and listend eagerly     to catch some coming sound    he sat him down beside the stream     that crossed the lonely way   so fair a scene might well have charmd     all evil thoughts away    he sat beneath a willow tree     that cast a trembling shade   the gentle river full in front     a little island made    where pleasantly the moonbeam shone     upon the poplar trees   whose shadow on the stream below     playd slowly to the breeze    he listendand he heard the wind     that waved the willow tree   he heard the waters flow along     and murmur quietly    he listend for the travellers tread     the nightingale sung sweet   he started up for now he heard     the sound of coming feet    he started up and graspt a stake     and waited for his prey   there came a lonely traveller     and jaspar crost his way    but jaspars threats and curses faild     the traveller to appal   he would not lightly yield the purse     that held his little all    awhile he struggled but he strove     with jaspars strength in vain   beneath his blows he fell and groand     and never spoke again    he lifted up the murdered man     and plunged him in the flood   and in the running waters then     he cleansed his hands from blood    the waters closed around the corpse     and cleansed his hands from gore   the willow waved the stream flowed on     and murmured as before    there was no human eye had seen     the blood the murderer spilt   and jaspars conscience never knew     the avenging goad of guilt    and soon the ruffian had consumd     the gold he gaind so ill   and years of secret guilt passd on     and he was needy still    one eve beside the alehouse fire     he sat as it befell   when in there came a labouring man     whom jaspar knew full well    he sat him down by jaspars side     a melancholy man   for spite of honest toil the world     went hard with jonathan    his toil a little earnd and he     with little was content   but sickness on his wife had fallen     and all he had was spent    then with his wife and little ones     he shared the scanty meal   and saw their looks of wretchedness     and felt what wretches feel    that very morn the landlords power     had seized the little left   and now the sufferer found himself     of every thing bereft    he lent his head upon his hand     his elbow on his knee   and so by jaspars side he sat     and not a word said he    naywhy so downcast jaspar cried     comecheer up jonathan   drink neighbour drink twill warm thy heart     come come take courage man    he took the cup that jaspar gave     and down he draind it quick   i have a wife said jonathan     and she is deadly sick    she has no bed to lie upon     i saw them take her bed   and i have childrenwould to god     that they and i were dead    our landlord he goes home to night     and he will sleep in peace   i would that i were in my grave     for there all troubles cease    in vain i prayd him to forbear     tho wealth enough has he   god be to him as merciless     as he has been to me    when jaspar saw the poor mans soul     on all his ills intent   he plied him with the heartening cup     and with him forth he went    this landlord on his homeward road     twere easy now to meet   the road is lonesomejonathan     and vengeance man is sweet    he listend to the tempters voice     the thought it made him start   his head was hot and wretchedness     had hardened now his heart    along the lonely road they went     and waited for their prey   they sat them down beside the stream     that crossed the lonely way    they sat them down beside the stream     and never a word they said   they sat and listend silently     to hear the travellers tread    the night was calm the night was dark     no star was in the sky   the wind it waved the willow boughs     the stream flowed quietly    the night was calm the air was still     sweet sung the nightingale   the soul of jonathan was soothd     his heart began to fail    tis weary waiting here he cried     and now the hour is late   methinks he will not come to night     tis useless more to wait    have patience man the ruffian said     a little we may wait   but longer shall his wife expect     her husband at the gate    then jonathan grew sick at heart     my conscience yet is clear   jasparit is not yet too late     i will not linger here    how now cried jaspar why i thought     thy conscience was asleep   no more such qualms the night is dark     the river here is deep    what matters that said jonathan     whose blood began to freeze   when there is one above whose eye     the deeds of darkness sees    we are safe enough said jaspar then     if that be all thy fear   nor eye below nor eye above     can pierce the darkness here    that instant as the murderer spake     there came a sudden light   strong as the midday sun it shone     though all around was night    it hung upon the willow tree     it hung upon the flood   it gave to view the poplar isle     and all the scene of blood    the traveller who journies there     he surely has espied   a madman who has made his home     upon the rivers side    his cheek is pale his eye is wild     his look bespeaks despair   for jaspar since that hour has made     his home unshelterd there    and fearful are his dreams at night     and dread to him the day   he thinks upon his untold crime     and never dares to pray    the summer suns the winter storms     oer him unheeded roll   for heavy is the weight of blood     upon the maniacs soul           lord william      no eye beheld when william plunged     young edmund in the stream   no human ear but williams heard     young edmunds drowning scream    submissive all the vassals ownd     the murderer for their lord   and he the rightful heir possessed     the house of erlingford    the ancient house of erlingford     stood midst a fair domain   and severns ample waters near     rolld through the fertile plain    and often the wayfaring man     would love to linger there   forgetful of his onward road     to gaze on scenes so fair    but never could lord william dare     to gaze on severns stream   in every wind that swept its waves     he heard young edmund scream    in vain at midnights silent hour     sleep closed the murderers eyes   in every dream the murderer saw     young edmunds form arise    in vain by restless conscience driven     lord william left his home   far from the scenes that saw his guilt     in pilgrimage to roam    to other climes the pilgrim fled     but could not fly despair   he sought his home again but peace     was still a stranger there    each hour was tedious long yet swift     the months appeard to roll   and now the day returnd that shook     with terror williams soul    a day that william never felt     return without dismay   for well had conscience kalendered     young edmunds dying day    a fearful day was that the rains     fell fast with tempest roar   and the swoln tide of severn spread     far on the level shore    in vain lord william sought the feast     in vain he quaffd the bowl   and strove with noisy mirth to drown     the anguish of his soul    the tempest as its sudden swell     in gusty howlings came   with cold and deathlike feelings seemd     to thrill his shuddering frame    reluctant now as night came on     his lonely couch he prest   and wearied out he sunk to sleep     to sleep but not to rest    beside that couch his brothers form     lord edmund seemd to stand   such and so pale as when in death     he graspd his brothers hand    such and so pale his face as when     with faint and faltering tongue   to williams care a dying charge     he left his orphan son    i bade thee with a fathers love     my orphan edmund guard   well william hast thou kept thy charge     now take thy due reward    he started up each limb convulsd     with agonizing fear   he only heard the storm of night     twas music to his ear    when lo the voice of loud alarm     his inmost soul appals   what ho lord william rise in haste     the water saps thy walls    he rose in haste beneath the walls     he saw the flood appear   it hemmd him round twas midnight now     no human aid was near    he heard the shout of joy for now     a boat approachd the wall   and eager to the welcome aid     they crowd for safety all    my boat is small the boatman cried     this dangerous haste forbear   wait other aid this little bark     but one from hence can bear    lord william leapd into the boat     hastehaste to yonder shore   and ample wealth shall well reward     ply swift and strong the oar    the boatman plied the oar the boat     went light along the stream   sudden lord william heard a cry     like edmunds drowning scream    the boatman pausd methought i heard     a childs distressful cry   twas but the howling wind of night     lord william made reply    haste hasteply swift and strong the oar     haste haste across the stream   again lord william heard a cry     like edmunds drowning scream    i heard a childs distressful scream     the boatman cried again   nay hasten onthe night is dark     and we should search in vain    oh god lord william dost thou know     how dreadful tis to die   and canst thou without pity hear     a childs expiring cry    how horrible it is to sink     beneath the chilly stream   to stretch the powerless arms in vain     in vain for help to scream    the shriek again was heard it came     more deep more piercing loud   that instant oer the flood the moon     shone through a broken cloud    and near them they beheld a child     upon a crag he stood   a little crag and all around     was spread the rising flood    the boatman plied the oar the boat     approachd his resting place   the moonbeam shone upon the child     and showd how pale his face    now reach thine hand the boatman cried     lord william reach and save   the child stretchd forth his little hands     to grasp the hand he gave    then william shriekd the hand he touchd     was cold and damp and dead   he felt young edmund in his arms     a heavier weight than lead    the boat sunk down the murderer sunk     beneath the avenging stream   he rose he screamd no human ear     heard williams drowning scream          a ballad  shewing how an

babes     the fiends have been my slaves   i have nointed myself with infants fat     and feasted on rifled graves    and the fiend will fetch me now in fire     my witchcrafts to atone   and i who have rifled the dead mans grave     shall never have rest in my own    bless i intreat my winding sheet     my children i beg of you   and with holy water sprinkle my shroud     and sprinkle my coffin too    and let me be chaind in my coffin of stone     and fasten it strong i implore   with iron bars and let it be chaind     with three chains to the church floor    and bless the chains and sprinkle them     and let fifty priests stand round   who night and day the mass may say     where i lie on the ground    and let fifty choristers be there     the funeral dirge to sing   who day and night by the tapers light     their aid to me may bring    let the church bells all both great and small     be tolld by night and day   to drive from thence the fiends who come     to bear my corpse away    and ever have the church door barrd     after the even song   and i beseech you children dear     let the bars and bolts be strong    and let this be three days and nights     my wretched corpse to save   preserve me so long from the fiendish throng     and then i may rest in my grave    the old woman of berkeley laid her down     and her eyes grew deadly dim   short came her breath and the struggle of death     did loosen every limb    they blest the old womans winding sheet     with rites and prayers as due   with holy water they sprinkled her shroud     and they sprinkled her coffin too    and they chaind her in her coffin of stone     and with iron barrd it down   and in the church with three strong chains     they chaind it to the ground    and they blest the chains and sprinkled them     and fifty priests stood round   by night and day the mass to say     where she lay on the ground    and fifty choristers were there     to sing the funeral song   and a hallowed taper blazed in the hand     of all the sacred throng    to see the priests and choristers     it was a goodly sight   each holding as it were a staff     a taper burning bright    and the church bells all both great and small     did toll so loud and long   and they have barrd the church door hard     after the even song    and the first night the tapers light     burnt steadily and clear   but they without a hideous rout     of angry fiends could hear    a hideous roar at the church door     like a long thunder peal   and the priests they prayd and the choristers sung     louder in fearful zeal    loud tolld the bell the priests prayd well     the tapers they burnt bright   the monk her son and her daughter the nun     they told their beads all night    the cock he crew away they flew     the fiends from the herald of day   and undisturbd the choristers sing     and the fifty priests they pray    the second night the tapers light     burnt dismally and blue   and every one saw his neighbours face     like a dead mans face to view    and yells and cries without arise     that the stoutest heart might shock   and a deafening roaring like a cataract pouring     over a mountain rock    the monk and nun they told their beads     as fast as they could tell   and aye as louder grew the noise     the faster went the bell    louder and louder the choristers sung     as they trembled more and more   and the fifty priests prayed to heaven for aid     they never had prayed so before    the cock he crew away they flew     the fiends from the herald of day   and undisturbd the choristers sing     and the fifty priests they pray    the third night came and the tapers flame     a hideous stench did make   and they burnt as though they had been dipt     in the burning brimstone lake    and the loud commotion like the rushing of ocean     grew momently more and more   and strokes as of a battering ram     did shake the strong church door    the bellmen they for very fear     could toll the bell no longer   and still as louder grew the strokes     their fear it grew the stronger    the monk and nun forgot their beads     they fell on the ground dismayd   there was not a single saint in heaven     whom they did not call to aid    and the choristers song that late was so strong     grew a quaver of consternation   for the church did rock as an earthquake shock     uplifted its foundation    and a sound was heard like the trumpets blast     that shall one day wake the dead   the strong church door could bear no more     and the bolts and the bars they fled    and the tapers light was extinguishd quite     and the choristers faintly sung   and the priests dismayd panted and prayed     till fear froze every tongue    and in he came with eyes of flame     the fiend to fetch the dead   and all the church with his presence glowed     like a fiery furnace red    he laid his hand on the iron chains     and like flax they moulderd asunder   and the coffin lid that was barrd so firm     he burst with his voice of thunder    and he bade the old woman of berkeley rise     and come with her master away   and the cold sweat stood on the cold cold corpse     at the voice she was forced to obey    she rose on her feet in her winding sheet     her dead flesh quivered with fear   and a groan like that which the old woman gave     never did mortal hear    she followed the fiend to the church door     there stood a black horse there   his breath was red like furnace smoke     his eyes like a meteors glare    the fiendish force flung her on the horse     and he leapt up before   and away like the lightnings speed they went     and she was seen no more    they saw her no more but her cries and shrieks     for four miles round they could hear   and children at rest at their mothers breast     started and screamed with fear      the surgeons warning  the subject of this parody was given me by a friend to whom also i am indebted for some of the stanzas  respecting the patent coffins herein mentioned after the manner of catholic poets who confess the actions they attribute to their saints and deity to be but fiction i hereby declare that it is by no means my design to depreciate that useful invention and all persons to whom this ballad shall come are requested to take notice that nothing here asserted concerning the aforesaid coffins is true except that the maker and patentee lives by st martins lane   the surgeons warning   the doctor whispered to the nurse   and the surgeon knew what he said and he grew pale at the doctors tale   and trembled in his sick bed  now fetch me my brethren and fetch them with speed   the surgeon affrighted said the parson and the undertaker   let them hasten or i shall be dead  the parson and the undertaker   they hastily came complying and the surgeons prentices ran up stairs   when they heard that their master was dying  the prentices all they entered the room   by one by two by three with a sly grin came joseph in   first of the company  the surgeon swore as they enterd his door   twas fearful his oaths to hear now send these scoundrels to the devil   for gods sake my brethren dear  he foamd at the mouth with the rage he felt   and he wrinkled his black eyebrow that rascal joe would be at me i know   but zounds let him spare me now  then out they sent the prentices   the fit it left him weak he lookd at his brothers with ghastly eyes   and faintly struggled to speak  all kinds of carcasses i have cut up   and the judgment now must be but brothers i took care of you   so pray take care of me  i have made candles of infants fat   the sextons have been my slaves i have bottled babes unborn and dried   hearts and livers from rifled graves  and my prentices now will surely come   and carve me bone from bone and i who have rifled the dead mans grave   shall never have rest in my own  bury me in lead when i am dead   my brethren i intreat and see the coffin weighd i beg   lest the plumber should be a cheat  and let it be solderd closely down   strong as strong can be i implore and put it in a patent coffin   that i may rise no more  if they carry me off in the patent coffin   their labour will be in vain let the undertaker see it bought of the maker   who lives by st martins lane  and bury me in my brothers church   for that will safer be and i implore lock the church door   and pray take care of the key  and all night long let three stout men   the vestry watch within to each man give a gallon of beer   and a keg of hollands gin  powder and ball and blunderbuss   to save me if he can and eke five guineas if he shoot   a resurrection man  and let them watch me for three weeks   my wretched corpse to save for then i think that i may stink   enough to rest in my grave  the surgeon laid him down in his bed   his eyes grew deadly dim short came his breath and the struggle of death   distorted every limb  they put him in lead when he was dead   and shrouded up so neat and they the leaden coffin weigh   lest the plumber should be a cheat  they had it solderd closely down   and examined it oer and oer and they put it in a patent coffin   that he might rise no more  for to carry him off in a patent coffin   would they thought be but labour in vain so the undertaker saw it bought of the maker   who lives by st martins lane  in his brothers church they buried him   that safer he might be they lockd the door and would not trust   the sexton with the key  and three men in the vestry watch   to save him if they can and should he come there to shoot they swear   a resurrection man  and the first night by lanthorn light   thro the churchyard as they went a guinea of gold the sexton shewed   that mister joseph sent  but conscience was tough it was not enough   and their honesty never swerved and they bade him go with mister joe   to the devil as he deserved  so all night long by the vestry fire   they quaffd their gin and ale and they did drink as you may think   and told full many a tale  the second night by lanthorn light   thro the churchyard as they went he whisperd anew and shewd them two   that mister joseph sent  the guineas were bright and attracted their sight   they lookd so heavy and new and their fingers itchd as they were bewitchd   and they knew not what to do  but they waverd not long for conscience was strong   and they thought they might get more and they refused the gold but not   so rudely as before  so all night long by the vestry fire   they quaffd their gin and ale and they did drink as you may think   and told full many a tale  the third night as by lanthorn light   thro the churchyard they went he bade them see and shewd them three   that mister joseph sent  they lookd askance with eager glance   the guineas they shone bright for the sexton on the yellow gold   let fall his lanthorn light  and he lookd sly with his roguish eye   and gave a welltimd wink and they could not stand the sound in his hand   for he made the guineas chink  and conscience late that had such weight   all in a moment fails for well they knew that it was true   a dead man told no tales  and they gave all their powder and ball   and took the gold so bright and they drank their beer and made good cheer   till now it was midnight  then tho the key of the church door   was left with the parson his brother it opened at the sextons touch   because he had another  and in they go with that villain joe   to fetch the body by night and all the church lookd dismally   by his dark lanthorn light  they laid the pickaxe to the stones   and they moved them soon asunder they shovelld away the hardprest clay   and came to the coffin under  they burst the patent coffin first   and they cut thro the lead and they laughd aloud when they saw the shroud   because they had got at the dead  and they allowed the sexton the shroud   and they put the coffin back and nose and knees they then did squeeze   the surgeon in a sack  the watchmen as they past along   full four yards off could smell and a curse bestowed upon the load   so disagreeable  so they carried the sack apickaback   and they carvd him bone from bone but what became of the surgeons soul   was never to mortal known          the victory     harkhow the churchbells thundering harmony   stuns the glad ear tidings of joy have come   good tidings of great joy two gallant ships   met on the elementthey met they fought   a desperate fightgood tidings of great joy   old england triumphed yet another day   of glory for the

name   no proud historians page will chronicle   peace to his honest soul i read his name   twas in the list of slaughter and blest god   the sound was not familiar to mine ear   but it was told me after that this man   was one whom lawful violence   had forced   from his own home and wife and little ones   who by his labour lived that he was one   whose uncorrupted heart could keenly feel   a husbands love a fathers anxiousness   that from the wages of his toil he fed   the distant dear ones and would talk of them   at midnight when he trod the silent deck   with him he valued talk of them of joys   that he had knownoh god and of the hour   when they should meet again till his full heart   his manly heart at last would overflow   even like a childs with very tenderness   peace to his honest spirit suddenly   it came and merciful the ball of death   for it came suddenly and shattered him   and left no moments agonizing thought   on those he loved so well

little island where he dwelt   or rather a lone rock barren and bleak   short scanty herbage spotting with dark spots   its gray stone surface never mariner   approachd that rude and uninviting coast   nor ever fisherman his lonely bark   anchored beside its shore it was a place   befitting well a rigid anchoret   dead to the hopes and vanities and joys   and purposes of life and he had dwelt   many long years upon that lonely isle   for in ripe manhood he abandoned arms   honours and friends and country and the world   and had grown old in solitude that isle   some solitary man in other times   had made his dwellingplace and henry found   the little chapel that his toil had built   now by the storms unroofed his bed of leaves   windscattered and his grave oergrown with grass   and thistles whose white seeds winged in vain   withered on rocks or in the waves were lost   so he repaired the chapels ruined roof   cleard the grey lichens from the altarstone   and underneath a rock that shelterd him   from the sea blasts he built his hermitage    the peasants from the shore would bring him food   and beg his prayers but human converse else   he knew not in that utter solitude   nor ever visited the haunts of men   save when some sinful wretch on a sick bed   implored his blessing and his aid in death   that summons he delayed not to obey   tho the night tempest or autumnal wind   maddened the waves and tho the mariner   albeit relying on his saintly load   grew pale to see the peril so he lived   a most austere and selfdenying man   till abstinence and age and watchfulness   exhausted him and it was pain at last   to rise at midnight from his bed of leaves   and bend his knees in prayer yet not the less   tho with reluctance of infirmity   he rose at midnight from his bed of leaves   and bent his knees in prayer but with more zeal   more selfcondemning fervour raisd his voice   for pardon for that sin till that the sin   repented was a joy like a good deed    one night upon the shore his chapel bell   was heard the air was calm and its far sounds   over the water came distinct and loud   alarmed at that unusual hour to hear   its toll irregular a monk arose   the boatmen bore him willingly across   for well the hermit henry was beloved   he hastened to the chapel on a stone   henry was sitting there cold stiff and dead   the

  grandmother                  you must have heard        your mother children often tell of her        she used to weed in the garden here and worm        your uncles dogs   and serve the house with coal        and glad enough she was in winter time        to drive her asses here it was cold work        to follow the slow beasts thro sleet and snow        and here she found a comfortable meal        and a brave fire to thaw her for poor moll        was always welcome   harry                    ohtwas bleareyed moll        the collier womana great ugly woman        ive heard of her   grandmother                    ugly enough poor soul        at ten yards distance you could hardly tell        if it were man or woman for her voice        was rough as our old mastiffs and she wore        a mans old coat and hatand then her face        there was a merry story told of her        how when the pressgang came to take her husband        as they were both in bed she heard them coming        drest john up in her nightcap and herself        put on his clothes and went before the captain   jane        and so they prest a woman   grandmother                            twas a trick        she dearly loved to tell and all the country        soon knew the jest for she was used to travel        for miles around all weathers and all hours        she crossed the hill as hardy as her beasts        bearing the wind and rain and winter frosts        and if she did not reach her home at night        she laid her down in the stable with her asses        and slept as sound as they did   harry                              with her asses   grandmother        yes and she loved her beasts for tho poor wretch        she was a terrible reprobate and swore        like any trooper she was always good        to the dumb creatures never loaded them        beyond their strength and rather i believe        would stint herself than let the poor beasts want        because she said they could not ask for food        i never saw her stick fall heavier on them        than just with its own weight she little thought        this tenderheartedness would be her death        there was a fellow who had oftentimes        as if he took delight in cruelty        illused her asses he was one who lived        by smuggling and for she had often met him        crossing the down at night she threatened him        if he tormented them again to inform        of his unlawful ways wellso it was        twas what they both were born to he provoked her        she laid an information and one morn        they found her in the stable her throat cut        from ear to eartill the head only hung        just by a bit of skin   jane        oh dear oh dear   harry        i hope they hung the man   grandmother        they took him up        there was no proof no one had seen the deed        and he was set at liberty but god        whoss eye beholdeth all things he had seen        the murder and the murderer knew that god        was witness to his crime he fled the place        but nowhere could he fly the avenging hand        of heaven but nowhere could the murderer rest        a guilty conscience haunted him by day        by night in company in solitude        restless and wretched did he bear upon him        the weight of blood her cries were in his ears        her stifled groans as when he knelt upon her        always he heard always he saw her stand        before his eyes even in the dead of night        distinctly seen as tho in the broad sun        she stood beside the murderers bed and yawnd        her ghastly wound till life itself became        a punishment at last he could not bear        and he confessd   it all and gave himself        to death so terrible he said it was        to have a guilty conscience   harry                     was he hung then   grandmother        hung and anatomized poor wretched man        your uncles went to see him on his trial        he was so pale so thin so holloweyed        and such a horror in his meagre face        they said he lookd like one who never slept        he beggd the prayers of all who saw his end        and met his death with fears that well might warn        from guilt tho not without a hope in christ   footnote   i know not whether this cruel and stupid custom is common in other parts of england it is

coffin   as i past across the lane   came sudden on my view it was not here   a sight of every day as in the streets   of the great city and we pausd and askd   who to the grave was going it was one   a village girl they told us who had borne   an eighteen months strange illness and had pined   with such slow wasting that the hour of death   came welcome to her we pursued our way   to the house of mirth and with that idle talk   that passes oer the mind and is forgot   we wore away the time but it was eve   when homewardly i went and in the air   was that cool freshness that discolouring shade   that makes the eye turn inward then i heard   over the vale the heavy toll of death   sound slow it made me think upon the dead   i questioned more and learnt her sorrowful tale   she bore unhusbanded a mothers name   and he who should have cherished her far off   saild on the seas selfexild from his home   for he was poor left thus a wretched one   scorn made a mock of her and evil tongues   were busy with her name she had one ill   heavier neglect forgetfulness from him   whom she had loved so dearly once he wrote   but only once that drop of comfort came   to mingle with her cup of wretchedness   and when his parents had some tidings from him   there was no mention of poor hannah there   or twas the cold enquiry bitterer   than silence so she pined and pined away   and for herself and baby toild and toild   nor did she even on her death bed rest   from labour knitting with her outstretchd arms   till she sunk with very weakness her old mother   omitted no kind office and she workd   hard and with hardest working barely earnd   enough to make life struggle and prolong   the pains of grief and sickness thus she lay   on the sick bed of poverty so worn   with her long suffering and that painful thought   that at her heart lay rankling and so weak   that she could make no effort to express   affection for her infant and the child   whose lisping love perhaps had solaced her   with a strange infantine ingratitude   shunnd her as one indifferent she was past   that anguish for she felt her hour draw on   and twas her only comfoft now to think   upon the grave poor girl her mother said   thou hast suffered much aye mother there is none   can tell what i have suffered she replied   but i shall soon be where the weary rest   and she did rest her soon for it pleased god   to take her to his mercy   footnote   it is proper to remark that the story related in this eclogue is strictly true i met the funeral and learnt the circumstances in a village in hampshire the indifference of the child was mentioned to me indeed no addition whatever has been made to the story i should have thought it wrong to have weakened the effect of a faithful narrative by adding any thing         eclogue iv   the sailors mother    woman           sir for the love of god some small relief           to a poor woman   traveller           whither are you bound

boywhen first he went to sea           i felt what it would come tosomething told me           i should be childless soon but tell me sir           if it be true that for a hurt like his           there is no cure please god to spare his life           tho he be blind yet i should be so thankful           i can remember there was a blind man           lived in our village one from his youth up           quite dark and yet he was a merry man           and he had none to tend on him so well           as i would tend my boy   traveller           of this be sure           his hurts are lookd to well and the best help           the place affords as rightly is his due           ever at hand how happened it he left you           was a seafaring life his early choice   woman           no sir poor fellowhe was wise enough           to be content at home and twas a home           as comfortable sir i even tho i say it           as any in the country he was left           a little boy when his poor father died           just old enough to totter by himself           and call his mothers name we two were all           and as we were not left quite destitute           we bore up well in the summer time i worked           sometimes afield then i was famed for knitting           and in long winter nights my spinning wheel           seldom stood still we had kind neighbours too           and never felt distress so he grew up           a comely lad and wonderous well disposed           i taught him well there was not in the parish           a child who said his prayers more regular           or answered readier thro his catechism           if i had foreseen this but tis a blessing           we dont know what were born to   traveller                          but how came it           he chose to be a sailor   woman                          you shall hear sir           as he grew up he used to watch the birds           in the corn childs work you know and easily done           tis an idle sort of task so he built up           a little hut of wickerwork and clay           under the hedge to shelter him in rain           and then he took for very idleness           to making traps to catch the plunderers           all sorts of cunning traps that boys can make           propping a stone to fall and shut them in           or crush them with its weight or else a springe           swung on a bough he made them cleverly           and i poor foolish woman i was pleased           to see the boy so handy you may guess           what followed sir from this unlucky skill           he did what he should not when he was older           i warnd him oft enough but he was caught           in wiring hares at last and had his choice           the prison or the ship   traveller           the choice at least           was kindly left him and for broken laws           this was methinks no heavy punishment   woman           so i was told sir and i tried to think so           but twas a sad blow to me i was used           to sleep at nights soundly and undisturbd           now if the wind blew rough it made me start           and think of my poor boy tossing about           upon the roaring seas and then i seemd           to feel that it was hard to take him from me           for such a little fault but he was wrong           oh very wronga murrain on his traps           see what theyve brought him too   traveller                          well well take comfort           he will be taken care of if he lives           and should you lose your child this is a country           where the brave sailor never leaves a parent           to weep for him in want   woman                          sir i shall want           no succour long in the common course of years           i soon must be at rest and tis a comfort           when grief is hard upon me to reflect           it only leads me to that rest the sooner   footnote   the stinkpots used on board the french ships in the engagement between the mars and lhercule some of our sailors were shockingly mangled by them one in particular as described in the eclogue lost both his eyes it would be policy and humanity to

told me that she was forced to crawl abroad           and pick the hedges just to keep herself           from perishing with cold because no neighbour           had pity on her age and then she cried

that this would fix thine eye   this woodbine wreathing round the broken porch   its leaves just withering yet one autumn flower   still fresh and fragrant and yon hollyhock   that thro the creeping weeds and nettles tall   peers taller and uplifts its columnd stem   bright with the broad roseblossoms i have seen   many a fallen convent reverend in decay   and many a time have trod the castle courts   and grassgreen halls yet never did they strike   home to the heart such melancholy thoughts   as this poor cottage look its little hatch   fleeced with that grey and wintry moss the roof   part mouldered in the rest oergrown with weeds   houseleek and long thin grass and greener moss   so nature wars with all the works of man   and like himself reduces back to earth   his perishable piles                          i led thee here   charles not without design for this hath been   my favourite walk even since i was a boy   and i remember charles this ruin here   the neatest comfortable dwelling place   that when i read in those dear books that first   woke in my heart the love of poesy   how with the villagers erminia dwelt   and calidore for a fair shepherdess   forgot his quest to learn the shepherds lore   my fancy drew from this the little hut   where that poor princess wept her hopeless love   or where the gentle calidore at eve   led pastorella home there was not then   a weed where all these nettles overtop   the garden wall but sweetbriar scenting sweet   the morning air rosemary and marjoram   all wholesome herbs and then that woodbine wreathd   so lavishly around the pillared porch   its fragrant flowers that when i past this way   after a truant absence hastening home   i could not chuse but pass with slackend speed   by that delightful fragrance sadly changed   is this poor cottage and its dwellers charles   theirs is a simple melancholy tale   theres scarce a village but can fellow it   and yet methinks it will not weary thee   and should not be untold                              a widow woman   dwelt with her daughter here just above want   she lived on some small pittance that sufficed   in better times the needful calls of life   not without comfort i remember her   sitting at evening in that open door way   and spinning in the sun methinks i see her   raising her eyes and darkrimmd spectacles   to see the passer by yet ceasing not   to twirl her lengthening thread or in the garden   on some dry summer evening walking round   to view her flowers and pointing as she leand   upon the ivory handle of her stick   to some carnation whose oerheavy head   needed support while with the wateringpot   joanna followed and refreshd and trimmd   the drooping plant joanna her dear child   as lovely and as happy then as youth   and innocence could make her                                  charles it seems   as tho i were a boy again and all   the mediate years with their vicissitudes   a halfforgotten dream i see the maid   so comely in her sunday dress her hair   her bright brown hair wreathd in contracting curls   and then her cheek it was a red and white   that made the delicate hues of art look loathsome   the countrymen who on their way to church   were leaning oer the bridge loitering to hear   the bells last summons and in idleness   watching the stream below would all look up   when she passd by and her old mother charles   when i have beard some erring infidel   speak of our faith as of a gloomy creed   inspiring fear and boding wretchedness   her figure has recurrd for she did love   the sabbathday and many a time has crossd   these fields in rain and thro the winter snows   when i a graceless boy wishing myself   by the fireside have wondered why she came   who might have sate at home                                one only care   hung on her aged spirit for herself   her path was plain before her and the close   of her long journey near but then her child   soon to be left alone in this bad world   that was a thought that many a winter night   had kept her sleepless and when prudent love   in something better than a servants slate   had placed her well at last it was a pang   like parting life to part with her dear girl    one summer charles when at the holydays   returnd from school i visited again   my old accustomed walks and found in them   a joy almost like meeting an old friend   i saw the cottage empty and the weeds   already crowding the neglected flowers   joanna by a villains wiles seduced   had played the wanton and that blow had reachd   her mothers heart she did not suffer long   her age was feeble and the heavy blow   brought her grey hairs with sorrow to the grave    i pass this ruind dwelling oftentimes   and think of other days it wakes in me   a transient sadness but the feelings charles   that ever with these recollections rise   i trust in god they will not pass away         the end
