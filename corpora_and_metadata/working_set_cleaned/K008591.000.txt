to mr gray on his odes i repine not gray that our weak dazzled eyes thy daring heights and brightness shun how few can track the eagle to the skies or like him gaze upon the sun ii the gentle reader loves the gentle muse that little dares and little means who humbly sips her learning from reviews or flutters in the magazines iii no longer now from learnings sacred store our minds their health and vigor draw homer and pindar are revered no more no more the stagyrite is law iv though nursed by these in vain thy muse appears to breath her ardors in our souls in vain to sightless eyes and deadend ears the lightning gleams and thunder rolls v yet droop not gray nor quit thy heavenborn art again thy wondrous powers reveal wake slumbering virtue in the britons heart and rouse us to reflect and feel vi with ancient deeds our longchilld bosoms fire those deeds which mark elizas reign make britons greeks again  then strike the lyre and pindar shall not sing in vain
