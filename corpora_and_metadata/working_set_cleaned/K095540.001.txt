brethren into egypt judah married a wie who boe him two sons the eldest he named er and the second onan  er he married to a wise whose name was thamar  but er wickedly defiling his nuptial bed by frustrating the end of marriage was snatched away by a sudden death the reason why er first did this wicked action and what it was he did is hereafter shown  now amongst he jews it was a law that if a brother died without children the next brother was bound to many the widow to raise up children to his brothers name and therefore judah obliged his second son onan to take his deceased brothers widow tha to wife  but onan knowing that the children if he should have any were not to be deemed his but his brothers frustrated also the end of marriage by defiling himself  semen fundbat in terram et

what makes also this treise more necessary for the world is because there is no person guilty of this vice but had much rather instruct themselves by reading a book upon it privately in their chamber

it may have brought upon them  the particulars of a young nobleman who being highly solicited by the greatest of temptations to be defiled yet with the most heroic constancy preserved his purity  and

how to remedy it tho inveterate and of long date  the true difference stated between a gleet whether caused by the vicious practice of selfdefilement or proceeding from any venereal disorder or its

confident yet nevertheless being apprehensive of his servants incapacity of keeping the secret he cut his servants tongue out that he might be sure that he should not divulge it and afterward kept him to live with him with his tongue thus cut out  how the secrecy and impunity that attends the commission of this crime of selfdefilement above all others are the real cause of it in many sober young men who have been otherwise of so modest a behavior as not to have dared with any ill design to almost have looked a woman in the face and of such bashfulness as has secured them from all other acts of impurity yet have been in private most extravagantly guilty of this  so that whatever good qualities they otherwise may have had this one infamous ungovernable appetite has unhappily obscured and clouded them all  of relapsing into this vice  of impurity in women  where is largely treated  of those young women whose exterior modesty has been such as that they would almost die rather than consent to any thing out of marriage or betray their weakness to any man living yet have lived in the commission of actions so ill that they cannot afterward think of them with easiness of mind but by reason of their secrecy have been unhappily betrayed into them when nothing else in the world could ever have tempted them to do an ill thing  what the usual misfortune of impurity is in women viz a draining weakness etc and how to remedy it  of other worse consequences and more deplorable effects of impurity in women much more than in men  the particulars of a young lady who at the age of    being taught ill actions by a wicked companion at a boarding school entirely ruined her constitution thereby also  of another young lady in the like circumstances who so far ruined her self by impurity that she died  of those young women who by early impurities give occasion to their husbands when they come to be married wrongfully to suspect more than they were ever guilty of  of those

and therefore cases relating to this vice in all sorts of persons whether by a persons defileing himself or causing himself to be defiled by another are treated quite in another manner here in english than sanchez has treated them in his elaborate folios de matrimonio in latin  of the bewitching and intoxicating slavery of this vice  of this crime in single women  haters  of those wicked clubs and societies of womenhaters and others etc who meet together to defile themselves  and of whom st paul thus speaks to the romans chapter   verse       nam faeminae eorum immutaverunt naturalem usum in eum usum qui est contra naturam similiter autem and masculi relicto naturali usu faeminae exarcerunt in desideriis suis in invicem masculi in masculos turpitudinem operantes etc  these are also those wicked persons which st paul in another place calls effeminate and abusers of themselves with mankind molles and masculorum concubitores etc   cor c   v   and declares them abandoned and given over to lewdness and a reprobate sense  traditi sunt in reprobum sensum in immunditiam and passiones ignominiae ut contumeliis afficiant corpora sua in semetipsis to abuse and defile their bodies etc  of the various steps and degrees tending to this vice  of the great danger of curiosity in regard to this vice  and how words looks and touches lead to it out of mons ostervalds treatise of uncleanness

this crime  how nothing more conduces to a healthy old age than the abstaining from selfdefilements during youth  of the complaints that uxores may reasonably make whose husbands are guilty of this vice  and  whether they may therefore refuse to cohabit with them  whether by reason of any impediment to the debitum conjugale this crime can ever be any ways excusable  how out of every hundred

latin greek or englis throughout these contents are fully examined and discussed in english in the volumes of this work  with whatever other matters can relate to the commission of this crime together with the most usual cases relating to single and married persons who have been extravagantly in private with themselves guilty of it  in order to retrieve the guilty from that abyss of misery this wretched vice above others involves its slaves in  price one shilling and six pence each volume  appendix a rational account of the cause nature symptoms and cure of the gout  chap i the reasons for publishing this treatise it may perhaps be wondered at why a subject of so very nice a nature as this is should here be undertaken sine in all manner of crimes of impurity and uncleanness silence is generally much more advisable than even so much as once to mention them  and this for fear of putting that into any persons mind which it were much better they could for ever either forget or be wholly ignorant of as long as they live  but as this branch of uncleanness viz sinning with a persons own self is the most general of any sin of impurity whatsoever by consequence some instructions concerning it are the most of any wanted in the world in order to awake the guilty and deterr the innocent and unwary from falling into it through inadvertence or ignorance  there are a great many admirable treatises extant on the several other branches and sins of impurity but very few if any really serious ones upon this  now why less should have been written on this one sin than others seems to proceed from the nature of the crime it self and the difficulty of managing it with such prudence and caution as neither to omit what is necessary to be said nor to say any thing that may seem indecent  and this is the true reason of the scarceity of books on this sin in particular and yet never was more need of dissuasive instructions against it than now when debauchery is become so barefaced that the generality of mankind are neither afraid nor ashamed to glory in it  so that when people come to this height of uncleanness it is high time to warn them of their folly and danger lest almighty gods anger break in by a sudden death upon them and there be no escaping  upon enquiry then how it comes to pass that this miserable unhappy sin of selfdefilement reigns so in all places as it does it must be owned that one of the chief reasons is the great scarceity of serious instructive books to give assistance in relation to it  for certainly if persons did but rightly understand the hainousness of this sin and the convincing reasons and motives there are for refraining from it it would be much rarer than it is but the misery is christians are not sufficiently informed of this matter  authors that have writ of the sins of impurity have out of a well designed indeed modesty only treated of this sin in general so that there are scarce any books extant that sufficiently supply the want of instruction about it in particular insomuch that whilst there ar plenty of wicked books that encourage this abominable vice there are hardly any for reclaiming persons from it  this observation makes it justly to be conclude that a dissuasive discourse against this reigning sin in particular cannot fail of being very useful to the world  and this more especially since there is no guilty person but had much rather instruct themselves by reading a book privately in their chamber by themselves on this sin than they can well bear to hear another speak to them about it it being a subject of so very a shocking nature that no one cares either to speak or be spoken to of it  the reason of this is because although persons may be so far abandoned as sometimes to make their brags of other sins yet they always dread being known to be guilty of this it is so very shameful odious and unnatural  and therefore in treating this sin the case is not the same as in treating on other moral subjects  for in handling other subjects a man may safely say whatever he thinks any ways advantageous to his design and has nothing to hinder him from mentioning whatever he apprehends necessary and proposing his arguments in their utmost extent and force making them as plain as possible and answering all difficulties relating to them  but in arguing against this sin of selfdefilement the same liberty is not to be taken but a writer is extremely confined and is obliged to express himself with all circumspection and caution for fear of intrenching upon modesty whilst he endeavors to make himself understood  for which reason whoever treats this subject is obliged to abstain from pressing his reasonings near so home or from enforcing his proofs with that degree of plainness they might otherwise have had  and therefore in treating of this particular branch of impurity some points might be much more enlarged and many objections more particularly considered  but then this would necessitate the touching upon some things which decency forbids  whatever then decency commands throughout this treatise to be mentioned only in general shall be nevertheless so ordered by principles that shall be laid down as to give sufficient room to every attentive but more particularly every guilty reader fully to understand and themselves supply and therefore this subject how dirty soever it may in it self be shall here be wrapped up in the clean clothing that possibly it can  to diswade against an action that is above others  first so very heinous and unnatural in its self  secondly so very abominable and displeasing before almighty god  and thirdly so highly pernicious to persons selves and families both as to body and soul requires no arguments which are not entirely agreeable to truth and can stand the test of the strictest reason to the greatest of libertines as in the following chapters will fully appear  all which being duly considered  it would be very deplorable if young and ignorant people should remain without warning and assistance against so powerful so treacherous and domestic and enemy as the sin of selfdefilement is merely for want of being better instructed concerning the abomination of it  youth are in greater danger of this sin than of any other there being far stronger incitements and temptations to it as being within our selves than to any other sin whatsoever the fuel and treacherous inticement to it always accompanying us wherever we go  for let us change never so much from one place to another we always carry our selves and our own corrupt vicious inclinations along with us changing only the place but not the man and therefore horace justly says caelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt  those who even pass the seas change only the climate ut make no more change to the corrupt inclinations of he man than a change of mere clothes only does and every one is fully convinced that habitus non facit monachum  the occasions of other sins may be avoided and run away from but we cannot run away from our selves  and therefore it is betraying our selves that is our greatest danger as is admirably and with an uncommon inction expressed by a late pious author in the following lymn  oh my soul how many snares lie spread before our feet in all our joys in all our cares some danger still we meet sometimes the sin does us overtake and on our weakness win sometimes our selves our ruin make and we overtake the sin o save us lord from all such darts that seek our souls to slay save us from us and our false hearts lest we our selves betray for here the main danger lies in our betraying our own selves and drawing our own selves into sin and therefore with good reason every one ought earnestly to beg of almighty god to save us from us that is our selves from our selves  man having no greater enemy against himself than himself as our savior expressly tells us math chap  0 v    inimici hominis domestici ejus every mans worst enemy is from his own self  all which makes it a matter of just lamentation that a vice so odious in its nature and so pernicious in its consequences should have such forcible means to insinuate it self so far among the flourishing  i e the youthful part of mankind as to become so general as it is and no instructive books to deter from it extant  it being almost certain that many delinquents would never have been such if they had but had some good book to have read on this subject that might have informed and instructed them of and pointed out to them the heinousness of this sin in particular and the deplorable consequences that follow it to the ruin of body and posterity in this world and of soul in the next  hence it is hoped that putting this book into the world may prove a prevalent means to hinder many a one from being falsely lulled a sleep and indulging themselves in this abominable vice by furnishing them with the strongest considerations how heinous a crime it is what terrible effects follow from it how it basely defiles every persons body that commits it tortures and racks the mind ruins so many hail flourishing constitutions and leads the ready way to the paths of death and eternal destruction  so that notwithstanding the state of sodom and gomorrah was so very deplorable as every one that has but read the   th chapter of genesis knows it to be on account of their enormous lewdnesses and unnatural debaucheries  yet our blessed savior tells us that the condition of christians who act these abominations with themselves will be far worse in the day of judgment  the thought of which how much soever any abandoned onanian may divert and put off from himself for the present yet it will one day to their eternal wailling and sorrow come upon them unless they truly repent  now to any considering person can the momentary satisfying of a filthy passion be ever worth all this misery  since as an ancient author truly says it is only momentaneum quod delectat but it is aeternum quod cruciat  for one only moments pleasure every onanian incurs an eternity of wailing torments misery and sorrow  whoever acts such vile things is perfectly his own slave and is led on by his own passion as the scripture says as an ox goes to the slaughter or as a bird hastens to the snare to his own death and destruction  these ways are the ways of ruin and at best can end in nothing but grief and repentance if ever any onanian be so happy as to grieve and repent for them  o dear bought moment of pleasure a bargain the most to be regretted that certainly ever any poor sinner made to purchase so many evils and such a train of miseries for one only moments satisfaction in the acquiring of which every onanian shows himself much more stupid than a silly fly in a candle that has some cause to take the flame to be sweet because it is beautiful  for the little fly seeing the flame hovers greedily about it to try whether it be as sweet as it seems fair and carried away with this fancy perishes at the first trial  but a poor onanian knows very well that what he is going about is extremely filthy and ill in it self highly offensive to almighty god and utterly ruinous to his own person and yet will commit the horrid fact  o man what art thou an ancient poet had reason to say video meliora proboque deteriora sequor he sees and knows that the filthy action he is going about will be his ruin and yet he is resolved he will do it  and all this for want of rightly considering the miserable state this sin involves him in which seriously rongly and homely to represent to him is the design and purpose of this book and the motive for writing on his difficult subject  but as it is so hard a matter to write on a subject of so nice a nature as this is within the reach of the meanest capacities without danger of encroachments upon the bounds of decency and the risque of giving offense to chaste minds notwithstanding it may proceed from a design to promote virtue and discourage vice  therefore this subject shall be here so treated as to be rather less intelligible to some by leaving several things to every readers private consideration than by any overfreedom of expression to run the hazard of putting that into any chaste mind which every person ought with the utmost christian courage and care to stifle and destroy  subjects of this nature being as dr baynard calls it res faeda dictu an action unfit to be even mentioned and therefore the scripture calls it a detestable thing  and what if mere necessity in order to deter the world from it did not urge st paul exhorting the ephesians a people wholly abandoned to their lust and impurity forbids even to be so much as named amongst christians let all uncieanness be not once named amongst you chapter   ver   nee nominetur in vobis says the vulgate edition  for which reason if ever caution care waryness and circumspection is necessary in the treating of any moral subject in the world it is most certainly in this wherein st paul thought he could express the enormity of the crime in no stronger a manner than by imposing a perpetual silence of it amongst all christians  it is not to be doubted but those persons who are conscious to themselves of having unhappily bartered and exchanged away their innocence for a momentary satisfaction as esau did his birthright for the present transient sensuality of a mess of pottage and by consequence have the misfortune to find themselves concerned in this present treatise will sufficiently understand the meaning of it without much explication and it is to them it is recommended with a hearty desire of their most serious consideration of what is contained in it  and as for those whom it no way concerns and by consequence who understand it not o happy ignorance their unspotted innocence is to be congratulated  rara avis in terris it shall be endeavored that nothing be said here which may endanger then loosing it but rather confirm their happy keeping it  all possible care then shall be taken throughout this treatise that no expression be used which may either shock the most modest class of mankind or sully or give offense to even the chastest mind  chap ii of the heinousness and abomination of the sin of selfdefilement by the word selfdefilement is here meant that unnatural and shameful action by which persons of either sex endeavor to cause procure and imitate with themselves that sensual carnal pleasure which alm god has ordered to attend only a married state for the propagation of mankind the hainousness of which action fully appears from that remarkable instance in the holy scripture of its severe punishment by almighty god in the person of onan in the eighth and thirtieth chapter of genesis verse the  0th expressed in these words and therefore the lord slew him because he had done a detestable thing  ideo percussit eum dominus quod rem detestabilem faceret says the vulgate edition  the cambridge edition of the bible has it thus and the thing which he did displeased the lord wherefore he slew him  so that the very name of onan is fully sufficient to put the reader at once in mind both of the sin and the dreadful punishment inflicted on him for it  the other particulars of this unhappy man onan in the perpetration of this detestable action as the holy scripture purposely calls it to make it to be the more abhorred and detested by all mankind as long as the world endures shall not be here mentioned but every reader is referred to the serious perusal of the just now cited chapter of genesis where every one may read the whole history at length as also of his brother er who was likewise slain for the same fact transmitted as dreadful examples to all succeeding ages to deter from an action so unnatural in it self that no brute is ever known to do it but only to his shame be it spoken unhappy man  and therefore it is very reasonable to believe that a great many persons would never fall into this sin if they were but throly convinced of the grievousness of it and the deplorable consequences to the body in this world as well as to the soul in the next which follow from it  which makes it highly necessary that persons should be apprised how crying an offense it is in order to keep them from it  in order then to this it is remarkable that there is no place in the whole scripture where sins of impurity and uncleanness are condemned but this unhappy one here treated of is in a more particular manner than others pointed out to us with a conclusion that nothing defiled nor who acts with themselves such abominable things shall ever enter the kingdom of god but are to have their share and part hi the lake that burns with fire and brimstone  and to give us still a more thorough conviction of the particular deformity filthyness baseness and unnaturalness that there is in this vice above others  st paul speaking of it in the heathens says that they being a people wholly given up and abandoned to their lewdness and uncleanness by this particular vice above others dishonored their own bodies romans      and therefore gives a singular charge to the christians he wrote to never to imitate them in the commission of this detestable action be not deceived says he   cor chapter   0 neither the effeminate nor the abominable shall ever inherit the kingdom of god  the vulgate edition of the bible has it thus molles an ugly word enough regnum dei non possidebnt  the cambridge edition of the english bible has it thus neither the effeminate nor abusers of themselves shall ever inherit the kingdom of god   cor   0  where the words abusing a persons self are used to express with as much modesty as is possible the unnatural action this treatise is here writ against  for of all the actions which a rational creature can possibly commit within the whole latitude and exten of his liberty and power there is no one by which persons so egregiously abuse and basely dishonor themselves as by this one vile action of selfdefilement  and therefore st paul says that the heathens by these unclean filthy actions not only abused and defiled but shamefully dishonored their own bodies  this singularly modest man st paul was indeed loath to rake so particularly into the nature of the action as to express it in any manner whatsoever and therefore  first tells the christians of the church at ephesus c   ver    that he was even ashamed to mention and speak of those things the heathens did in secret meaning the crime of selfdefilement which was so common amongst them  but finding himself under a necessity of speaking plainly to them lest they should not understand his meaning he chose out at least the modestest words to explain himself by to them that he could  not at all doubting but that those christians who should hear his letters read as they usually were especially on sundays amongst the primitive christians in their assemblies would fusty understand his meaning and what sin it was he forewarned them against  and concludes with a modest repetition in general of all he had said before in these words that all those who do such things shall never inherit the kingdom of god  therefore he charges them every one to possess preserve and keep his vessel that s their bodies in holiness and honor as if he should have said that all sorts of persons without exception ought to be extremely watchful over their own bodies and never to abuse nor defile them by such unnatural actions  again  st paul who throughout his whole mission had always to do with an abominably lustful and luxurious set of men as fully appears from those unnatural vices he reprehends in the inhabitants of rome corinth galatia ephesus colossia thesalonica and those other provinces abandoned to luxury which he writ his letters to thought he could produce no more powerful argument to dissuade them from this foul sin than to tell them that their bodies being the temples of the holy ghost by consequence to defile and abuse such a temple must be the highest offense against to almighty god  his argument is this  that if material temples and churches built only of stone and mortar and dediated to the external worship only of god almighty are in no wise to be profaned  much less spiritual ones such as our bodies are in which the spirit and grace of almighty god and an immortal soul honored with his own image inhabits  this argument of this great apostle and reclaimer of those lustful luxurious people gives us clearly to understand that whenever any person commits any filthy and immodest action with themselves their body is then profaned sullied and defiled and no more a temple or place for god almightys grace to reside in  and least persons should object that hereby they do no injury to any but themselves their bodies being their own and at their own disposal this great preacher of purity st paul foreseeing this their objection tells them expressly that their bodies are not their own nor at their own disposal no more than when a person has bought any thing the thing so bought belongs no more to the person who sold it and therefore st paul tells all christians that they are bought and redeemed with a great pric  this consideration made st austin cry out o quam lugenda perversitas ut quis animam quam christus sanguine suo redemit propter unius momenti delectationem diabolo vendat sermon   0 o madness to sell that soul which christ has bought for one moment of pleasure  and to show that when st paul mentioned this he alluded particularly to the sin here treated of he presently adds these words and therefore we ought to serve god in our bodies which are gods as well as our souls  again as the greatest punishment that can be inflicted is the taking away any ones life so when an offense is so punished it most certainly shows that such a crime is of a most heinous and grievous nature  almighty god in the scriptures threatens a great many sins with several sorts of punishments some of longer some of shorter durance but this sin of onan had immediate death inflicted for it which is the greatest proof of god almightys being highly offended at it  and if any one examines the whole scripture through where mention is made of vices and sins they will find that there is not any other crime so many times inveighed against as sins of uncleanness  a most detestable and unnatural degree of which is a persons defiling their own selves and against which st paul is continually preaching accusing the heathens of this sin in particular and tells them of their dishonouring their own bodies by it  hence a learned divine says of it  that the crime in it self is monstrous and unnatural  in its practice filthy base and odious to extremity  its guilt is crying and its consequences ruinous  it destroys conjugal affection perverts natural inclination ends to extinguish the hopes of posterity brings on a numerous train of diseases on the body in this world and utterly ruins the soul for all eternity in the next  which made st paul expressly write to the inhabitants of corinth about this matter knowing them to be a people exorbitantly addicted to this vice and tells them   cor c   v   be not deceived says this great apostle neither fornicators nor adulterers nor abusers of themselves shall ever inherit the kingdom of god  the same he writes to the people of galatia and thos of ephesus after having told them that it was a shame even so much as only to speak of the things which the did in secret  meaning this private ugly sin with themselves and tells them still in the same language that those tha do such vile abominable unnatural actions shall nev enter into the kingdom of god  chap iii of the blindness and some other circumstances attending the commission of this sin the blindness here meant is that spiritual blindness and unconcernedness with which miserable onanians repeat this crime  for as for those particular pernicious effects which this sin has proper to it self above all other vices on the sight and eyes of the body by draining off those animal spirits which are so the peculiar strength of the optic nerves as that persons addicted to this vice will find their sight and eyes to fail them a deal sooner than otherwsie they would to their great grief and sorrow afterward when it is too late this subjects shall be particularly treated of hereafter  st paul speaking of the sin here treated of attributes the commission of it to blindness and insensibility  and says that the gentiles being past feeling had given themselves over to act all uncleanness with themselves with greediness  and for this reason st austin calls spiritual blindness a just punishment of almighty god upon sins of impurity spargit deus paenales caecitates super illicitas little cupiditates almighty god throws a darkness on the understanding as a particular punishment for this sin  and hence it is that of those great numbers that are guilty of it very few ever come to be truly sensible of it but are lulled asleep in it and eternally loose their soul  a loss to balance which our savior expressly tells us that even the gaining of the whole world is not an equivalent what profit is it to a man to gain the whole world if he loses his own soul math chap    verse     the saving of which is every ones greatest affair and every ones only affair that he came into this world for  it is the unum necessarium that one thing which our savior declares to be only necessary for all mankind  it is not necessary to be great to be rich and abound with the things of this world but it is absolutely necessary to be saved and yet onanians are so stupidly blind as to exchange this thing so necessary to wit the saving themselves for all eternity for the gratifying this lust  now what spiritual darkness must surround such a person that is thus stark blind in this necessary concern and so clear sighted in other things that are trifles  yet there is one thing more contradictory still which is that a person shall with all the unconcernedness of mind imaginable fall into and repeat this crime over and over again which he knows in his conscience is a deadly sin and not only cuts off at once without bearing any manner of dispute in the matter his right for ever to the kingdom of heaven but condemns him to the eternal fire and torments of hell  and yet at the same time out of a principle of religion and christianity would not take a false oath nor renounce his religion for all the world  again how many are there in the world who are punctually just men in their dealings no swearers no drunkards nor addicted to any visible vice and firmly believe all the truths of christian religion and yet fall victims to themselves and the filthy cravings of their own beastly bodies by living in this abominable sin  but what will all this avail them quid prodest says an ancient author si quis catholice credat and gentiliter vivat petr dam what good does any persons believing as a christian do him if he acts like a heathen and does not use that faith as a guide and rule for his actions  how can any person reconcile their faith with such a practice and how can they make such a practice and their reason agree it is very surprising that men of sense and wisdom who reason so well about every thing else should reason so very falsely in this  a poor blind onanian freely owns his action to be a very great crime highly offensive to god almighty and if unrepented of most certainly throws him for all eternity into hell fire all this he will argue over with the strongest of reasoning and eloquene with himself and yet will habitually live in this odious sin  from whence can this stupidity and contradicting thus his own reason proceed he believes the mysteries of christian religion and is ready to die rather than renounce this faith although they are not only above his understanding but even seem to shock his reason  and at the same equally believes these abominable actions he lives in the commission of to be grievous sins and that the doing of them condemns him for all eternity to hell fire and yet will do them  whence come these so very unaccountable contradictions thus between an onanians life and his faith  the reason of this can be nothing else but because the believing the mysteries of christian religion does not contradict nor thwart his passions  so that although it is as equally certain that an onanian will be eternally lost for the commission of these abominable actions as he would be if he renounced his faith and turned heathen both being alike grounded on the same infallible authority viz the word of god  yet because the one does not contradict his passions and the other does therefore for the sake of a moments pleasure he will thus contradict and act against his own reason and give himself for all his life time after such vast room for grief and repentance  what a sort of faith shall we call this  it is a dead faith which can no more save an impenitent onanian than the most moral good works will save an obstinate heathen now let an onanian ask himself seriously whether he really believes all this or not  if he does not believe any thing of this then he does in other things a great deal too much by being a just man in his dealings where safe opportunities of gain by frauds offer themselves without ever being detected  by not being a drunkard a swearer an adulterer etc all which corrupt nature inclines to  and if he does really believe these truths then it is beyond dispute that he does not do near enough  what then is this faith what is this offending god almighty this soul and its being either saved for all eternity or lost for all eternity that is so much talked of  it is in reality nothing else but this that a great many say they believe the truths of christian religion because they will be of the fashion of the country where they live  so that in rigor such persons calling themselves christians is no more than conforming to custom and fashion  for else as no man ever in his senses would travel any particular road if he was credibly informed and firmly believed that there were highwaymen and robbers in that very road that would murder him  so either this is the exact condition of every onanian or else his faith the gospel and christian religion must seem to him as a fable our savior an impostor and st paul a liar and a cheat thus to persuade men from and threaten them out of their pleasure and taking their swing in this world for a mere nothing in the next  and if a heathen was to be asked his opinion of such a person that says he believes what the christian religion teaches and yet acts so contrary to it he would presently answer that either he does not really believe or else that he is a madman to act so opposite to his faith  chap iv of the great damages the sin of selfdefilement brings upon a persons self and family the damage this grievous sin brings upon many a family fully appears from those numbers of families so frequently extinct for want of heirs  which misfortune were it to be traced up to its origin is owing to nothing else but that impotency in one sex and barrenness in the other caused by those unnatural actions here treated of by which the strength of youth has been so nipt in its bud by having been so profusely squandred away that very few can afterward much boast of the fruits of a married state  and although it be supposed that such persons ever have children which nevertheless happens not often they are most commonly weak puny little sickly things that either die soon or if they happen by chance and mere force more of physic than the kitchen to live and grow up they prove generally but tender sickly persons always ailing and complaining of one malady or another  what a pleasure is it to see says an ancient author a man at the age of fourscore with a wife of the same antiquity both blessed with healthy hail constitutions fresh wholesome looks sound minds and perfect quick senses mens sana in corporo sano as juvenal describes with active strait upright limbs  walking without the adventitious support of either stick or staff with pleasant cheerful tempers residing over a healthful numerous progeny perhaps to the third or fourth generations  and all these blessings owing under almighty god to the temperance and continence of their youths  when if we do but turn our eyes upon licentious and voluptuous livers we shall find them surrounded with a whole legion and complication of diseases  lean jaws hagged pale livid looks hollow eyes sunk into their heads feeble hams legs without calves limping and hobling with a stick gouty uactive limbs continually complaining of weaknesses and pains in their reins and small of their backs in fine worn and wasted away in the prime of their years by having thus ruined and abused their bodies by these selfdefilements  and if they happen to arrive at any advanced years hey are usually harrassed with some draining weakness or another such as an habitual gleet etc  or wasted away with a consumption their spirits sunk body decayed strength spent and exhausted  all which complication of evils makes them shift about restless from place to place for the change of air and trial of this and the other bath always consulting one physician or another and yet after all upon the least rigor of any season or any small accident continually in fear of giving up their corrupted breath  and all this from having enervated exhausted consumed and worn out their bodies and strength by these detestable actions and sins of their youth here meant and thereby now become the scon and jest of others and a perfect trouble and torment to themselves  what a melancholy reflection must it be for such a person to think now on these vile filthy actions of their life past who being hardly come at half the age they might reasonably have expected to arrive at find themselves now enervated consumed drained wasted and out by this detestable habit of selfdefilement  what a dismal thing is it for a person thus to see themselves on a sudden become old and perfectly worn out by having thus destroyed and ruined themselves oftentimes before they are even  0 years of age  again of those unhappy and unthinking persons who have by these actions in their lives past thus prostraed and enervated their strength very few ever come to that vigor and robustness which otherwise they would have arrived at and continued so to a good old age  besides stranguries gleets gonorrhoeas etc far more difficult to be cured than those very same ailments when otherwise contracted from some ill distemper or its cure  so that well suppose two persons to be afflicted with what is commonly called a gleet either in men or a draining weakness in women by either of which is understood an involuntary and almost constant efflux or coming away of matter from a human body  in one of these persons these infirmities whether in a man or woman well suppose to be purely the effect of either some former ill distemper or its cure  in the other person well suppose these infirmities to proceed purely from the weakness of the parts whose tone springiness and strength has been enervated and destroyed as will hereafter be showed by those unnatural actions here treated of  this last gleet or weakness whether in man or woman is much harder to cure and the constitution broke thereby much more difficult to repair than the former  the reason of this will be obvious to every person who does but consider that the actions by which person thus defile themselves being altogether unnatural by consequence are so many repeated violences strains an forces upon and against nature  and therefore the seminal vessels and parts continguou to them are so extremely relaxed and weakened thereby that it is no wonder that the whole constitution pay so dearly for it afterward as the generality of person too fatally experience who ever in their lives past have been guilty of this abominable practice  insomuch that a great many young persons of either sex who were strong hail and lusty before they abandoned themselves to this vice have been so worn out by it as to become old before half their years came on  for by thus robbing and violently forcing from themselves their strength and empoverishing their spirits by depriving their bodies of its balmy and vital juice by this detestable vice they have become so dry and emaciated as to be sent to their graves a great many years sooner than otherwise they would have been  and indeed nothing is so common as the experience that this sin brings upon its slaves not only various aches and pains about the body headachs dizzynesse and such a wasting of the spirits as to impair the very vitals and bring rottenness upon the bones  but numbers of persons who were healthy and well before they gave themselves over to this vile habit have been so weakened and drained by it as to have been brought into a visible consumption and so far gone as to puzzle sometimes the best of physicians to set them on their legs again their case has been so desperate  from all which it plainly appears that no sin draws i votaries into a greater abyss of miseries and ruin tha this and therefore it is of the utmost consequence tha all possible endeavous be used to keep persons from it  in order to which as nothing can be more prevalent than for persons seriously to consider that the time will come when they shall be one day laid on a deathbed and must bid adieu to all these and other pleasures the subject of the next chapter shall be to represent lively t the reader the condition of an onanian on a dying bed  chap v of the condition of an onanian on a dying bed in order to fix the better your imagination of this melancholy and dreadful time suppose your self now upon your deathbed in your last sickness having but a few hours more to live reduced as one day you will be to the last extremity of weakness  your soul oppressed and over whelmed with fear your heart already seized by the convulsions of death your breath failing your color changed your eyes just ready to close themselves for ever to time and open in a new state to eternity of which you know nothing  suppose your self again abandoned by all you so dearly loved and just upon the point of leaving the world and expiring either by your self alone or at best in the arms of some domestic relation or friend  these things being thus supposed consider next how strangely a lustful dying person is now changed  he who a few days ago was strong and in perfect health and in the full enjoyment of his pleasures is now all on a sudden confined to his bed reduced to exremity unable to help himself incapable of pleasure the pursuit of which has been his only aim and now forced o abandon all and to be abandoned by all  so that the separation whereby a sensualist is by death nathed from his pleasures is still the more terrible to him inasmuch as the more any one has loved their pleaus the greater grief will it be to him to part with them and the more he has sought after them in his life ime the more bitter will death be to him  every one that does but seriously reflect on this must ry out lord what is man tho he enjoys never so much pleaure since a few hours sickness are thus able to make him useless o all the world and render all the world of no use to him  what will be able to comfort this unhappy person in his dreadful hour when the remembrance of his past ameful defilements leaves only a mortal regret behind them and the fear of suture pains makes him already egin to feel them  when every thing conspires to terrify and fright him  how do the tears of friends cut him to the heart  with what fear has he recourse to desperate remedies and what a terror is it to find those remedies prove ineffectual and he who but a few days ago had a constitution that promised the enjoyment of pleasures for many years has not now even hours to enjoy them  but to calm his frights a clergyman is desired to come and pray with him and does this allay his trouble  he trembles and is confounded at the remembrance of his past shameful actions which he now blushes at  how dismal must his apprehensions be after so many repeated selfdefilements to think that now he has but a few hours more to live and is going to have his destiny determined either of being saved or lost for all eternity  and in this agony he is now with the assistance of this his spiritual friend to prepare for death  but is this a fit time for it when he is just going to expire when fear and trouble has weakened his reason how can he go about so great a work  a work that requires the greatest leisure application and tranquillity of mind that is possible and for which all the saints have ever thought their whole lives too short and this sick man has it now all upon his hands to dispatch on a sudden in a hurry and in a few hours  and also at a time the most improper of any for it when his ills and pains render him so incapable of applying even to any small affairs that his physician absolutely forbids it and now at this time he has the great and intricate account of his soul to adjust and make up  if it is so difficult a thing to prepare for death as it is whilst a person is in health and has his head clear and free to think how hard not to say almost impossible must it be on a sick bed when the head is racked with pains and cannot apply and the whole body so disordered that  quiet free thought can scarce be had  so that he has put off his repentance to a time tha is no time for him a time of sickness being to tim at all for such a person as this to prepare for death in  what should we think of a captain of a ship wh never enquires whether his anchors and cables be in  readiness and fit for service till he is just perishin in a violent storm and upon the point of sinking  what should we think of a governor who neglects t repair the breaches of his town and lets his magazine remain empty till he is close besieged and the trenche opened  death is a dangerous voyage a dying man is going to sail from time to eternity among rocks and tempests  it is a sudden siege where his enemy blocks him up in a moment and can he think this a fit time to prepare himself in to fight no no whoever puts off their conversion to this time most wretchedly cheats themselves  and for this reason our savior bids us be ready when the hour comes and not then to prepare our selves  but let us consider a little farther what passes between this dying person and his spiritual friend  he now speaks not his own sentiments but only repeats what the clergyman puts in his mouth not knowing perhaps what he says or what he ought to say  the merits and passion of jesus christ himself which in this last hour is the great consolation of a good man on a deathbed now only serves to ubraid this sinner  with whom then shall he now find ease  his friends and relations retire leaving him and the clergyman by themselves for a while alone  consider now what thoughts this distressed person will have when the divine only stays to exhort him to fix his eyes on jesus christ crucified and to inform him that being now past all hopes of recovery and bereft of all creatures jesus christ alone must be his only refuge and consolation  jesus christ crucified must be now dear brother says the divine your only hope etc  you must seek strength in his death against the fear of yours place then your confidence in this comfortable object in the thoughts of which i leave you to your self and the clergyman withdraws for a while  this is the end of all those shameful pleasures which lustful persons with so much greediness pursue  did it ever enter into such a persons thoughts on his deathbed to regret that he had not in his life pleased himself and gratified his brutish craving passios more  every dying person will repent his having pleased him self too much but never that he did not more  but alas there is now no more world for him he has acted his part on the stage of it and must now notwithstanding all his unwillingness go off from it  and as actors go off a stage with applause more or less according to the merits of their performance so this dying man goes off the stage of this life loaded with his selfdefilements and impurities as our blessed savior foretold of impenitent christians john chap   v    that they shall die in their sins  what comfort will this person find now in thinking of jesus christ who has during his life had so little resemblance to him whilst in health how often has he perhaps made a jest of the great truths of christian religion and now he must notwithstanding all his rallery in a few hours appear before the great founder of it  the divine visits him again and prays by him and says  lord save this thy servant  and the dying person answers if he can tho perhaps very faintly and with trembling and stammering lips  which  put  his  trust  in  thee  he utters this indeed with his trembling lips but his weakness and fears do so cloud his reason that he scarce has liberty to use it and by consequence scarce knows what he says  next what terror must it be to him to hear the clergyman go on with those words  we commend the soul of this thy servant into thy hands o lord etc  to him who loved his pleasures and the world so much as he has done  nay who perhaps never loved any thing else but his pleasures and never made one serious real step toward heaven in all his life  again what a terror must those words give him  go christian soul out of this world  profciscere ammo christiana de hoc mundo etc  there is no more for you to do in it  you must leave it but how and why  by force and because your pleasures leave you and not you them  st austin speaking to you in this condition tells you sermon    non vis relinquere mundum relinquet te mundus  you are unwilling to leave the world and your pleasures but that is nothing the world will now leave you  there is no avoiding it a dying person cannot help it  there is no appeal  you must go christian soul out of this world etc you must leave it  but  the divine goes on accept o lord his tears etc  what tears  alas tears and sorrow from his unwillingness to die and leave the world and his pleasures and because he can enjoy them no longer nothing else  lord in what a condition is this dying man  if he has yet his senses left the remembrance of his past actions rifle his very soul and tear him to pieces  the shameful action now leaves him being no more capable of it and not he the action  o death how terrible is thy memory to this poor wretch thus drowned and absorpt in his own guilt  chap vi some farther considerations of the condition of this onanian on his dyingbed this almost distracted sensualist being now upon the brink of having his eternal doom decided his past actions tear him with inexpressible remorse  every one of his past defilements appears now to him as big as a mountain and in all its deformity and ghastly shape which before he cheated himself in the commission of by the deceiving name of weakness and frailty  how dismal must the apprchensions of this dying leacher be when he reflects that he has now but a few hours more to live and if not sincerely reconciled to almighty god by a true repentance is for ever lost  what must this sinner do at this dreadful hour  in which st peter tells us that the very saints themselves are not secure   epistle chapter   v    if the rightcous scarcely are saved where shall the wicked appear  in this terrible extremity all that he has ever in his life time heard of judgment of hell of eternity and other awakening truths of christian religion comes now all on a sudden fresh into his mind and fright him  and it is wonderful that he who some few days ago was so full of doubts and uncertainties as to religion and who made almost a jest of christanity and the purity of the gospel and would believe so little should now be so fully convinced of these truths and all on a sudden believe so much for no people in the world believe more or have stronger faith than dying men  but what does this convincing faith avail an impenitent onanian then the devils believe as much as any christians  but as st james says     their faith only serves to make them tremble doemones credunt and contrennscunt  and just in the same case is this person on a dyingbed  what lie was so unwilling to believe all his life time he cannot help believing now so that a deathbed will give him a lively faith when nothing else will  this person whilst he was well and in health made nothing of ridiculeing piety and religion  let him now carry on the jest with his wit and rallery if he can no no a deathbed teaches a true lesson convinces the most obstinate and opens their eyes  o mos bonum est judicium tuum says the wise man eccles     if ever a mans judgment is impartial twill be on a deathbed then the mind is filled with cruel remorse the conscience is terribly awakened past defilements come fresh in to the mind and seizes it with inexpressible consternation  and it is then that every sensualist will begin to open their eyes and to judge of things after quite another manner than ever they did before and would give all the whole world were it at their disposal that they could now call their past actions back again  now terror and remorse begin to show themselves and the dying man is seized with inexpressible anguish  now he would forsake his sin now he condemns himself  now he is willing to open his case to his spiritual friend who before could never be brought to it  but alas it is now too late he has no more time left he is a dying  he is now of no more use to the world nor it to him he may with good reason cry out  now my soul the day is gone which in the morn was thine now it is glass no more shall run it is sun no longer shine true alas the day is gone o we it only so but it is lost as well as done to my eternal woe aust dev the example of the good thelfs repentance has very little room here to encourage any delay to such persons of their conversion because as st aug justly says  the scripture comfortably furnishes us with this example of one true death bed repentance that we may not despair  but alas it is the only one throughout the whole scripture that we may not presume and to convince us what a height of folly not to say madness it is and how extremely dangerous to live in the habitual commission of this abominable sin with any such ill grounded hopes  so that whatever person does so most miserably imposes upon and abominably cheats himself at last with only an appearance of conversion and repentance  if therefore any deluded sensualists find themselves disposed to take any encouragement in remaining in the habit of this detestable vice from the example of those so very few who have risen again and sincerely and truly repented after terrible falls  let such know that they have much more reason to tremble at the remembrance of infinite numbers of others who have fallen in like manner and never did rise but have been utterly undone by it and eternally lost  if a person could die twice an unprepared first death might be repaired by a second but he can die but once and an eternity of happiness or misery depends upon this once and being once only ill done is for ever ill done and never can be repaired  any one then who goes on in his sin with the design of repenting on a deathbed puts it off to a time the most unfit for it of all his whole life and which is to be feared will prove no time at all for him  if a good death consisted only in a few tears in having a few friends to pray by one in having the assistance of a divine in a remorse of conscience a design to amend and even in receiving the holy sacrament this persons madness would not be near so great  but alas how many daily die with all these very same helps and many more and yet die miserably and are now irreparably lost for all eternity  and could but any of them return upon earth to tell us how all this came to pass and could possibly be with so many helps their answer would be that they died miserably because they did not prepare before hand by quitting this sin in time when they might  they would also tell us that those helps they had on their death beds were only opera operata mere outward works which to them were of no effect for want of requisite inward dispostions and a real conversion of the heart and a leaving off this abominable sin whilst they were in health whereas their professing with their lips outwardly to detest renounce and leave this sin now at a time when the sin leaves them deserves no manner of thanks to them at all for it  and that this is evidently true fully appears from those who do by a singular mercy of almighty god recover from great fits of sicknesses after all imaginable protestations whilst they were sick of mending their lives in case of recovery but when recovered think no more on it but return again like a dog to his vomit to their old ways which is a convincing proof how little deathbed protestations and designs are to be depended on  so that it is not having a sorrow upon a deathbed that is merely enough numbers having gone oat of this world perfectly bathed in tears and in appearance sorrowful and yet have been eternally lost  and the reason of this has been because their sorrow was for leaving the world and all they loved in it and nor for having offended almighty god  again  how can any one imagine that he shall be able upon a deathbed to hate what he has all his life time so loved so doated upon and so eagerly pursued  and yet every dying person that does not truly abominate his darling and beloved sin above any thing in the world and this for the love of almighty god who is highly offended thereby will be eternally lost  this is as true as that he has committed the sin which when once committed the delinquent is always certain of but entirely uncertain of the pardon of it  will it be easy for this man now all on a sudden to detest and abhor what he has always so much loved and who perhaps never made so much as one serious act of repentance for it in his whole life  will it be easy for one who has doated on this sin all his life now to abhor it because death tears him from it and because he now is no more able to commit it  no no deceive not your self every onanian whoever you are that reads this book this will one day be your own case really and in fact as now it is in imagination  oh the miserable state will such a one say to himself whereto i find my self now reduced oh that whilst i was in health i had left off this sin  but i have brought my self now by continuing in it to that pass that i am morally speaking unable to repent for it and now after all i am come to my last day i am laid upon that bed from whence i shall rise no more but must go to appear before my god loaded and defiled with these my repeated crimes  consider again what long and languishing farewells your soul will give to her body and this world  she will then take her leave of all those past shameful actions she has so long been enslaved to together with an eternal farewell to riches vanities company pleasures pastimes friends neighbors kindred children husband wife and in sine to every creature and at last even to her own body which she is now about to leave pale hideous and loathsome  and thus the poor onanian expires and becomes a mournful but indeed a very moving sight to deter lustful persons from the commission of those unnatural actions which have now given so much trouble to this poor deceased wretchs soul at present and rendered his doom so uncertain for the future  chap vii of the condition of an onanian departed this life this sensualist being after all now dead although resore the most accomplished and beautiful person in the world now inspires nothing but horror  immediately all is silent the corpse is covered the curtains are drawn and every one retires with a faintly as they go lord have mercy upon his soul  and the usual compliment now made him is  he is gone poor man he was no bobys enemy but his own gods peace be with him they will say and that is all he is gone after all his pleasure and has carried all his actions for his pasport along with him  and the best they can say is we hope he has made his peace with god etc oh peace how uncertain and doubt full art thou to this poor wretch that never perhaps thought of thee till reduced to a dyingbed  where is now the beauty the galantry and good mien of this person what is become of all his pleasures  but above all what is become of his soul  alas of this we have all the reason in the world from his foregoing conduct to apprehend but badly  what now becomes of this body so often defiled  it begins already to grow offensive and burdensome  so that notwithstanding all its former charms and beauty every body now flies it nor would any one now lie but one only night alone in a bed with it on any account whatsoever  husband wife children relations friends neighbors servants are all in a hurry to get rid of it  those who loved it best are now most desirous to have it conveyed away and put out of sight  they all make have to nail it up and put it into the ground and so get rid of it and would not for any thing so much as only look at it a few weeks after  thus this person is forgot almost as soon as gone every one returns to his business your friends seek other friends take new measures and hardly think any more of you  they concern themselves no more about you than if you had never been they often undo all you had done and in a little time you are no more talked off  all the pleasures of this sensualist thus end in a shroud a coffin the grave worms rottenness and corruption  but the immortal soul of this so often defiled body is gone into a new region and amongst new company to be judged and have its definitive sentence pasted upon it either to go to the right hand or to the left  alas whither shall yours go what way shall it take  no other than that which it has begun here in this world  the sentence passed on unrepenting onanians is this go ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels math       ponder well every one that reads this these weighty words go says the judge a word of eternal banishment from happiness  he calls them cursed o how dreadful a curse must this be a general curse including all woes an irrevocable curse comprehending all times  the judge adds into everlasting fire oh eternity of pains how dreadful will thou be to this poor sensualist that has done little else but indulged himself in pleasure  men are so used to hear talk of hell that it very little affects them whereas if every onanian was but truly sensible what hell is he would tremble at the very thought of committing an action that so certainly insures it to him  in order then to make every one that may read this book as sensible of this state of misery as our gross conceptions and material comparisons can make it  imagine that you see in the center of the earth a vast gulf and lake of fire and flames and those two unhappy men er and onan together with all others who have impenitently imitated them in the perpetration of this abominable fact plunged and roling in it all covered and transpersed with fire which they not only suck in with their breath but which enters also at their eyes and ears their mouths and nostrils casting forth dreadful flames their skin scorched their flesh blood humors and brains boiling up with the violence of the burning their bones and marrow all transparent with fire like a piece of iron taken red hot out of a furnace and all the parts of their bodies glowing with fire  having here put er along with his brother onan the reader doubtless will desire to know whether or not the crime of er was the same as that of onan the holy scripture mentioning only of him that er judahs first born was wicked in the sight of the lord and the lord slew him genesis      and afterward verse  0 in the cambridge edition of the english bible speaking of the punishment of onan says that the lord slew him also  commentators on this place of the scripture all agree that the crime of these two brothers er and onan was exactly the same as to the fact but only different as to the motive er would not have his wife thamar bear children to preserve her beauty  onan would not have her bear a child by him because according to the law it would not be called by his name nor esteemed his thus st austin lib    contra eaustum cap    consentiunt hebraei and christiani tam er quam onan peccasse eodem peccato mollitiei quod est contra naturam generationis sed er fecit ne scilicet puerperia aliquid de pulchritudine suae uxoris decerperet onan vero ex alio motivo ut ex scriptura patet  but to return to our subject  how glad would these two unhappy men be to suffer only from our fire but alas there is no comparison between it and the fire of hell  st austin compares our fire to it as only a painted fire our fire is lightsome theirs is dark and horrible  ours is the effect of the goodness and bounty of god theirs is the product of his incensed omnipotence  again represent to your self a man tormented with the gout or some other violent pain  what torment does he feel how does he cry out  how willingly would he die to put an end to his torture and yet he suffers only in some one part of his body he has the liberty of complaining and the satisfaction of seeing himself pitied  but what would he undergo if every member and part of his body suffered the same torment  and if instead of helping and pitying him every standerby should abuse and upbraid him without any liberty of complaining  in hell the damned do not only suffer the pains to which we are subject in this life they suffer all these and infinitely more their torments are universal violent complicated and unsupportable and yet they must and do in every instant of time feel them all and in the midst of them all they cannot receive or even so much as hope for any respite ease or comfort  what would only one poor single drop of water be against such a sea and torrent of flames and yet such a poor refreshment such a mere nothing is and ever will ce denied them as it was to the rich man in hell who egd it of lazarus luke       the sick find some ease in tumbling and removing from one place to another but unhappy onan together with his brother er and their followers are now at this time that you read this in this fire immovable as at rock  but all this is the least part of their suffering for notwithstanding all these torments are so excessive yet it would be an inexpressible comfort to them if they were but ever to have an end but what adds infinitely to their miseries is their knowledge that all these torments will be for all eternity and never are to have an end  so that notwithstanding all their horror there is no manner of hopes that they will ever end or diminish  what are now the thoughts of those two miserable men onan and his brother er who have now been in all these torments almost four thousand years  for these two young men were cut off by alm god for these wickednesses in the prime of their youths about the year of the world two thousand twenty nine neither er nor onan being  0 years old when this happened to them and therefore ought to be a particular example to all young persons and they know that they are no nearer to the end of their sufferings than they were the very first moment they began them  was miserable onan together with his brother er obliged to fill only the hollow of a mans hand with each of their tears and each of them to drop but one single tear at the end of every thousand years what a terrible duration would this be onan would have now shed but three tears toward it and his unhappy brother er just as many but if each of them were obliged at the same rate of one single tear for every thousand years to make a brook or a river with their tears or even to fill the sea what a prodigious length of time would this require our imaginations are lost and confounded our thoughts are stunned in so vast a duration  and yet all this great and inconceivable extent of time is nothing to eternity and that duration which these unhappy wretches are to suffer  a time will come when onan and every one of his imitators will be able to say that one tear for every thousand years that i have been in hell would have been equal to the sea would have drowned the world and would have filled up the immence space between heaven and earth and yet i am to begin again to shed the same quantity of tears over and over and ever again having an eternity of torments to suffer even millions of ages after the world shall be ended  so that there will be a time when onan himself will be able to say that having already shed as many tears at the rate of one only single tear for every thousand years as would fill the whole sea as many times over again as there are in all the fields and meadows in the world and throughout the whole universe blades of grass and corn in the fields leaves on the trees grains of sand in the sea and upon its shore and stars in the firmament yet i am now after all this to begin my work over and over again  the same also will one day every onanian be able as well as onan himself with inconceivable regret to say and all this for a base pleasure of only a moment  our imagination is perfectly lost and our thoughts are swallowed up stunned and confounded in the view of such a vast extent of duration insomuch that after millions of ages as many times multiplied unhappy onan will still have his work to begin over again as fresh and as much a new as the very first moment he entered there and every onanian the same  o dreadful oh incomprehensible eternity  was onan to burn only as many millions of ages as there have passed minutes since the creation of the world which is now five thousand seven hundned and seventy odd years ago his pains would at least one time have an end but he knows his torments will never end  when every one that is in hell reflects on this and compares it with the inconsiderable time his pleasure for which he is condemned lasted when he was in this world what must his rage be  where are now those great men who have for past ages enjoyed all this world could give them  what are they the better for all their sensuality debauchery and pleasure if they are damned  all pleasure is now past and gone as if it had never been but the soul will for ever be and that miserably too if not prevented by a true repentance  if these reflections make no impression upon an onanian that reads this if this eternity does not touch him can he call himself a rational creature  but to represent to the reader in epitome all these awakening truths together nothing is more proper than a version  mutatis mutandis for the exigency of and application to our present subject of a certain celebrated latin hymn on the terrible day of judgment beginning dies irae dies illa etc  come it will that dreadful day which shall the world in ashes lay as david and the sybills say a trumpet first will rend the skies and all wherever laid must rise to appear before this great assize how will the selfdefiled grow pale to see their judge with sword and scale ready to weigh the crimes of all before that judge whose hand whose eye none can endure yet none can fly they must appear to live or die nature and death shall with surprise behold the pale offender rise before his judge with guilty eyes the great account book then shall li open to every offenders eye to try his selfdefilements by then sits the judge upon his throne and makes all selfdefilements known when each onanian knows his own each selfabuse will open lie no crime so secret then can fly this judges fierce allseeing eye thus sits the judge himself and tries no shifting from his angry eyes no crime escapes whoere deserves it dies o then poor i what shall i do to save me from this dreadful blow when saints themselves are scarce secure from woe thou mighty formidable king thou mercys unexhausted spring to poor onanians pity bring forget not what my ransom cost nor let my dearbought soul be lost in storms of guilty terror tossed surrounded with amazing fears whose load my soul with anguish bears i sigh i weep accept my tears true it is i am guilty ere thou try me my selfdefilements now descry me but mercy lord mercy do not deny me thy granting magdalen relief and opening heaven to the thief has given me hope now give relief reject not my unworthy prayer preserve me from that dangerous snare which death and gaping hell prepare and then those great assizes done and all the cursed in the fire thrown say come ye blessed meaning me for one lord this i beg on bended knee with heart contrite as ashes be that thou take care both of my end and me from what then has been here said let every onanian consider the uncertainty of the day of his death  and let him say oh my soul thou must one day out of this so often defied body but when shall that day be  shall it be in winter or in summer  in city or in country by day or by night  shall it be suddenly or on notice given thee  by sickness or by accident shall thou have leisure and time to repent and make thy peace with god or not  shall thou have the assistance of a spiritual friend  alas of all this we know nothing  only certain it is that we are to die and that always sooner and less prepared than we imagine  and that then the world will end in regard of you  having now thus far laid before the reader these dismal consequences attending this wretched sin in order effectually to deter persons from it  it may not be amiss next to consider of some assistance for those unhappy persons who have fallen into it and thereby suffered a share of those inconveniences abovementioned  chap viii what the usual misfortune is that attends the sin of selfdefilement and how to remedy it the common ill effect the habit of this vice of selfdefilement has on the body is to bring persons of either sex insensibly into a gleet or other such draining weaknesses as hereafter will be shown  which disorders are the forerunners of various pains aches and other ailments about the body wastes the spirits decays the strength causes particular pains and dizzyness in the head and so wears out the body as to bring it in the end into a consumption  and what also is to be much lamented is that these ailments are of such an out of the way kind from common distempers to say nothing of the shame that attends them which usually keeps persons from discovering their condition to another in order to obtain a cure that the best physicians are oftentimes puzzled with them  and for these reasons it is that so many unhappy persons are daily ruined and their constitutions utterly broke and spoiled by these sort of gleets and weaknesses caused by this wretched sin of selfdefilement for want of the right and proper method of curing them  as then a great many persons will doubtless read this book in hopes of relief from it the next thing to be considered shall be of the most rational method of cure according to the principles of anatomy and physic of these gleets and draining weaknesses in either sex consequent from and caused by a habit of this vice  and which cannot fail of being very acceptable to every reader laboring under them because there is no treatise hitherto extant that has so treated of this matter as to assist persons satisfactorily in their cure  but as to be able to cure a distemper there must be a perfect knowledge had of its cause or else it is only guess work and acting in the dark  says hippocrates he that knows best the cause of an allment or distemper is the most likely person best to cure it which made that great physician celsus afterward say that recte curaturum quem prima origo causoe non fefellerit  therefore in order to explicate how it comes to pass that a gleet etc is thus so usually caused by this abominable vice and thereby be led into the truest method of its cure and prevent the ruin of numbers of persons and their families whom this wretched sin of selfdefilement has been the bane of it will first of all be absolutely necessary to examine into the anatomy of that particular part of the body where these gleets are situated as  first to examine its inward structure and make   dly what alterations this sin of selfdefilement is capable of causing in this its inward make and structure and how it comes to cause them   dly what effects such alterations caused by this sin are likely to produce  and lastly whether or no these effects are such as persons addicted to this vice find in themselves who have by it brought such a gleet or weakness upon them  which observations being premised we shall afterward enquire how it happens that such a change of state of these mucous glands viz from an elastick springy and strong state to a limber loose and flaccid one can produce and be the cause of that quantity of matter which drips and comes away in the course of a gleet caused by the vicious habit of this sin of selfdefilement  or in other terms but the meaning is still the same whether or no the productive cause of a gleet ie the relaxation of the orifices or mouths of the mucous glands in the urethra can so far increase the quantity of liquor naturally produced by these glands as to be such as is experienced by persons who have a gleet etc upon them  hence the motive of proceeding thus with our present subject is first the great inconvenience that persons afflicted with a gleet lie under from the quantities of physic exhibited to them for their cure which even it self is a disease and often serves for little else than breaking a sound constitution or making a bad one worse  secondly the great uneasyness notwithstanding a daily change of linen which such persons harrassd thus with a gleet or other such weakness oftentimes for a long while labor under by reason of such a dripping continually upon them and which tho for the present may give no other trouble than as it is opposite to cleanliness being no pleasant companion to a clean neat person yet will in time impair and break the best of constitutions and most certainly bring on a consumption being a constant drain and wast of the animal spirits as in the second volume will be clearly showed  chap ix some few anatomical obsevations necessary to be taken notice of in order to a right knowledge of the true cuse seat and nature of gleets etc caused by this vice or otherwise by a gleet or other such draining weakness which onanians have by their wicked practice drawn upon themselves is here understood an involuntary and almost constant efflux or dripping away of matter from a human body and that in much the same quantity whether the person be asleep or awake this gleet being of just the same kind as any other gleet following any ill distemper such as the secret disease and its cure etc  from this definition it naturally offers it self to our consideration to enquire into the cause of this efflux or coming away of matter and how it happens that such a quantity of it should thus involuntarily come away  which difficulty will easily be removed by examining ti ard anatomical structure and make of that particular pa where this weakness is situated which is the only thing that can give light to our present question  and then to examine if there is naturally any liquor separated in that part capable of becoming the matter of that epidemical weakness and common companion of persons habituated to this vice usually called a gleet  it is observable by anatomy that in the nervospongious substance of the urethra or urinary passage there are several glandulous openings like so many little pinholes first discovered by that great anatomist mr cowper which serve as so many excretory ducts or channels designed by nature constantly to convey and furnish a certain viscid clammy mucous kind of liquor or moisture into the urinary passage the use of which liquor is to lubricate and besmear by its viscidity the pipe or passage and thereby to preserve and defend it from being fretted and corroded by the sharp salts of the urine which is daily passing through it and which without this defensative liquor would certainly be fretted and become raw and by consequence sore as any fleshy part would be that should have such a salt sharp fretting liquor as urine so often passing over it unless it were preserved by some such proper defensative as the continual anointing or besmearing it with some such smooth soft unctuous substance would be  insomuch that were it not for this slimy liquor or moisture that nature is continually supplying the urinary passage with by means of those glandulous openings just now mentioned to keep it thus moist it would in a little time become so fretted and raw by the sharpness of the urine daily passing through it that all mankind in general would have a perpetual scalding and heat of urine upon them  by which is not here meant that the urine in it self would be hotter in that supposition than it is now but that the passage being raw and sore for want of that defensative slimy moisture which now protects it it would be fretted by the saltness of the urine and so would smart and seem as it were to burn and scald whenever the urine passed through it just as any other raw sore place divested of its scarfskin would smart and seem to burn if one should throw urine or salt water upon it  this being thus established from the nice anatomical inspection of the inward structure and make of the urethra  we are next to consider what changes and alterations these glandulous openings in the passage are subject to and capable of and then whether or no such changes can furnish us with such a large supply of matter as is experienced involuntarily to drip away from persons who have that weakness commonly called a gleet upon them  our next endeavor then must be to examine how the urethra only and the glandulous openings abovementioned which it contains are able to furnish so great a quantity of matter as is observed to be involuntarily discharged in the course of any sore of gleet  in order to which we must consider that nature designing these glands in the urethra constantly to furnish and supply a certain moisture to the whole pipe or passage which may defend it from being fretted by the sharp urine so frequently passing through it as has been already hewed the orifices or mouths of these glands in entire ealthy sound hail persons are in some measure to use he comparison servata always debita proportione like the sphincter muscles of the anus bladder etc  by which is meant that the openings of these glands otwithstanding their being so very small have a certain springiness and elasticity proportionable to their bigness and size belonging to them by which they are endowed with a certain power of straitning contracting and drawing themselves together more or less upon every emission of that abovementioned moisture nature designs them to supply the urethra with just as the sphincter muscle of the bladder is endowed with a power of retaining holding and keeping in the urine  and by this means it is that so much and no more of this moisture is thrown out of these lands into the urethra than is just necessary for the lubricating and moistening it preparatively for the passage of the urine  so that as by reason of the strength and vigor of the sphinctermuscle for example of the bladder the neck and mouth of it is endowed with a power of straitening contracting and closing it self together after every emission of urine every one experiences in themselves a power of either holding or letting go their water  so much in the same manner by reason of the strength and vigor of the orifices of these glandules they are endowed with a not unlike power of straitening contracting and drawing themselves together which the reader is desired always to suppose to be in a degree proportionable to their bigness after every emission of the mucous slimy liquor they contain  which strength being once lost the power of retaining and keeping in this liquor is also lost with it  the state then and condition of these glandulous openings or as dr drake calls them mucous glands from their thus furnishing and supplying the passage with this mucous slimy liquor being thus considered in healthy persons  our next enquiry must be into the state of them in persons afflicted with a gleet or other such draining weakness after a vicious habit of this sin or otherwise  which state we shall soon be apprised of by considering that when a person has been addicted to this vice by a frequent pressure upon and a violent and unnatural use forcing and irritation of these glands by the abominable act of this sin this unnatural forcing practice has rendered them flaccid limber weak and loose which before were healthy vigorous springy and strong  the truth of these assertions abstracting from the reasonableness they carry along with them will appear by giving an account of the state of these glands as they have been observed in some anatomical dissections made of that particular part where all gleets are seated that is the urethra or urinary passage  that great anatomist mr cowper tells us that to inform himself the better in this point he disected the urinary passage of several criminals some of which were healthy sound persons the others were executed with gleets upon em having been lustful libidinous wicked men  in the healthy found persons he found these glandulous openings to be so firm as to have had even a perfect elasticity or springiness belonging to them  insomuch that upon pressing them but not without this pressure he says they discharged a certain quantity of transparent viscous slimy liquor such as it shows it self and ought to be in statu sano whereas if these glands had not had such a firmness and strength in which consisted their power of retaining or letting go the viscid slimy liquor they contain this liquor would have slipped out of them without any such pressure at all  and by consequence its not owzing out but upon such a pressure was an evident mark of their springiness and strength he also observed the whole urethra to be besmeared and lined with a viscous slimy unctuous moisture which was discharged from these glaudulous openings or little bags in order to lubricate the passage  but in the urethra of those criminals executed with a gleet upon them the case was quite different  he observed the mucous glands all along the urinary passage to be limber flaccid flabby and loose very much stretched and dilated and their orifices by the help of a a nice microscope to be visibly open stretched dilated and distended and thereby totally destitute of their strength and vigor from whence he concluded that they were also entirely deprived of their retentive faculty and springyness having no power left of contracting themselves upon any emission of that mucous slimy liquor they contain as those other glands could do in the criminals that were executed in perfect health  this will appear still more clear by an example of persons who have a diabetes upon them  for from the loss of the springiness and tone of the sphincter muscle of the bladder the neck and mouth of it is so weakened and relaxed as to be deprived of its retentive faculty through a want of that power of contracting and drawing it self together after any emission of urine which healthy persons experience in themselves  from whence it follows that the urine comes away involuntarily from them being altogether deprived of both that expulsive as well as retentive power which healthy persons have  chap x how the abovementioned weakness of the mucous glands and their orifices in the urethra are the only cause of all sorts of gleets etc the springiness and retentive faculty of the mucous glands in the urethra of healthy found persons consisting in their strength and power of either dilating or contracting their orifices or ostiola as in the foregoing chapter has been showed by which power of retaining or letting out the viscous slimy moisture they contain they discharge just so much and no more of it than is just necessary for the lubricating and besmearing the passage  it must of necessity follow that when these glands are by a violent and unnatural straining and forceing of them by the vicious habit of selfdefilement so weakened as to become limber flaccid flabby and loose they must be deprived of this retentive power or faculty also  insomuch that although these glands in healthy sound persons are naturally so springy and strong as to discharge and let out into the urethra just so much and no more of the slimy liquor designed by nature to besmear and as it were to cover over the whole tube or passage and thereby defend it from the sharpness of the urine  yet in persons who have a gleet or other such weakness upon them from this vicious practice the case is not so  for the offices or ostiola of these glands in these persons are so weakened and relaxed by the violence and repeated unnatural forceing of them as to be in a manner always open by which means the mucous liquor they contain is continually slipping out of them into the urethra the openings of these glands not having springiness nor strength lest to contract themselves and thereby to keep it in as formerly they could  by which means the contained liquor involuntarily and continually comes out into the urethra and by sucessive quantities of it pushing one after another thus drips and ownes away involuntarily from the body  the difficulty then that now remains is to conceive how such very small glands and their orifices can furnish such a quantity of matter as is daily experienced to flow away in some glets and how the mucous liquor which naturally is discharged our of these glands into the urethra in healthy persons should be increased to such a degree as it is in persons who have a gleet  to clear this matter it cannot but be allowed that these mucous glands as little as they are may naturally discharge into the urethra for its lubrication as much of this liquor in one minute as may weigh at least one quarter of a grain this in an hour will be    grains or a quarter of a dram in    hours or a natural day it will amount to   drams which is   quarters of an ounce a quantity sufficient in all reason to give that uneasiness to the person as well as wetness to the linen which is usually experienced by those under die uncomfortable circumstances of a gleet upon them  if you ask how these glands in the urethra can discharge so great a quantity of fluid in the time of a gleet above what they do in their natural state  the answer is that it is manifest from the animal economy that if any gland or excretory duct be weakened and deprived of its retentive faculty the quantity of liquor that it discharges by reason of chat weakness is considerably augmented in proportion to the degree of weakness with which these glands or ducts are affected  just as a little powder of spanish flies applied any where by breaking through the texture of the outward scarfskin does so weaken the glands as soon to excite a blister and by its thus weakening the glands under the scarfskin makes them discharge a quantity of matter immensly greater than what would naturally flow away otherwise from that part by insensible perspiration only  much in the same manner the orifices of these glands being weakened and relaxed by the unnatural forcing action of this sin have thereby lost their retentive faculty and therefore cannot hold in the liquor they contain but lets more of it slip away than the mere lubrication of the urethra requires and therefore it continually is discharging it self by that dripping commonly called a gleet  thus the true origin and cause of not only those particular gleets and weaknesses which are the consequences of the vicious practice of self defilement but also of any other gleet are clearly explicated without recourse to any other part or parts that have no manner of claim to fall under our present consideration as for example the seminal vessels or the prostatae or the parastatae which terms will be explicated in the second volume  and which parts having been erroneously thought to furnish the matter of a gleet has been the reason that the vulgar so commonly tho very improperly call almost every gleet a gonorrhaea whereas they are widely different  the only seat of a gleet being no other than the mere urinary passage and not at all farther up in the body  whereas that efflux of matter that is really and truly a gonorrhaea comes from the seminal vessels themselves as will be clearly showed in the next volum  hence all the difficulties about a gleet or other such draining weakness in either sex whether proceeding from the vicious habit of the odious sin of selfdefilement or from any ill distemper or its cure either of these gleets being of the same nature are overcome in a few words its symptoms become obvious upon a small principle so clear in anatomy as to carry not only evidence along with it but also more clearly explicates all the symptoms and effects of it than hitherto has been done  these gleets then being of just the lame nature and by consequence to be cured by just the same method as other gleets and weaknesses are which are contracted by either a former ill distemper such as the secret disease and its cure in either sex but more frequently in women after hard and difficult labors colds contracted in lyingsin wrenches falls hurts strains and other such innocent causes as will be hereafter showed  to effect a cure of them in either sex every reader is
