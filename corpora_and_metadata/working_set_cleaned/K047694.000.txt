for refuge to illustrious boil francis gentleman  preface it were an imposition on the town and an injustice to the memory of the inimitable ben johnson should i publish this play without acknowledging that most part of the plot some of the scenes and many of the speeches are almost literally copied from a dramatic work of his with the same title an attempt at altering a piece of his is i believe unprecedented and indeed bold for one who never before either burdened the press with his labors or dared the critics censure i was allured to the task by a number of very noble sentiments which are scattered through the original in many lines neither harsh or unmusical wherein there seems to breath the true inspired spirit of poetry and fancy plays within her proper sphere under the restraint of a well tempered critical judgment but much more by the strong contrast of virtuous and vicious characters with which i found it adorned which is the most useful laudable and consequently the fundamental part of the drama  to reduce the multiplicity of characters the train of incidents to make the parts of livia and agrippina somewhat interesting which in johnson are very near despicable to select his beauties and by proper means to bring about the catastrophe seemed at first an enterprise as difficult as toiling for wealth in a mine and almost startled me from my design but however as i had begun i determined to proceed and of my success the perusal of the piece will make you a judge  johnsons strict adherence to history in his two plays of sejanus and catiline would have been highly commendable had it not been manifestly prejudicial to him since he has been so scholastically nice as scarcely to omit a single person or incident mentioned in the lives of these great wicked men nay he has even translated literally in his sejanus several lines from cornelius tacitus by this means his tragedies became rather dramatic histories than entertainments suited to a modern theater from this i have ventured to deviate i have kept caesar at rome to preside at the conviction of sejanus as i think it adds much spirit to the closing the catastrophe i have drawn him of a disposition much milder than he was in reality the pious resolution of repealing the oppressions and healing the constitutional wounds made by sejanus which i have put into his mouth in the last speech of the play i thought necessary to preserve poetical justice to which i think history should give way for the real use of dramatic performances is to instill virtue and raise an abhorrence of vice example is a strong argument nothing conduces so much to our reformation as punishing the wicked and rewarding the virtuous it is then that the moral is truly strong indeed the guiltless must sometimes fall to heighten the distress and impress us with a just pity  if these liberties should to the critics appear errors i honestly confess them errors of my judgment and for my confession expect to be mildly treated by the critics i would be understood to mean only the judicious not such teizing insects such buzzing drones of society as those at present distinguished by that name  who fret and strut their hour upon the stage and then are heard no more shakespeare each wight who reads not and but scans and spell each wordcatcher that lives on syllables pope from such i neither wish or expect indulgence let them be ridiculous at my expense if they please my pity they may move but not my anger from the penetration of the judicious i shall be glad to meet correction their clemency i doubt not for still like the brave they choose rather to spare than destroy my asserting that i had a national advantage in view in this subject may be thought chimerical at first but when the following abstract from history of the life of sejanus is considered what i have advanced may perhaps be allowed  aelius sejanus the son of seius strabo was born in tuscany he served when young with some reputation under caius caesar nephew to augustus and afterward in the praetorian band under the command of tiberius to the various turns of whose disposition by conforming he gradually crept into his closest secrets and was the first in his esteem when tiberius mounted the imperial throne he allowed this his favorite such an extent of power as rendered him the terror of honest men and the idol of sycophants the taking off germanicus husband to the agrippina who is introduced in this play and nephew to the emperor a prince remarkable for the greatest virtues though the odium of it was artfully flung on gneius piso germanicuss lieutenant was generally and justly attributed to him this was his first close attack upon the liberty of rome and procured him the hatred of the people after this by the means of livia wife to drusus eudemus her physician and lygdus an eunuch who was sejanuss catamite he contrived and effected the death of drusus son to tiberius and heir apparent to the empire the reason assigned for his hatred was a blow which drusus one day gave him but his future proceedings showed ambition not revenge was the motive which urged to the deed for he had determined to remove every bar which lay between him and the throne this was but a prelude to his future villainies agrippina her sons and all who were friends to the family of the dead germanicus were next to be disposed of this was effected by representing them to caesar who was naturally of a jealous disposition as aspiring and ambitious and consequently dangerous caius silius was first marked out for sacrifice who being before the senate criminated by varro the consul and finding his death had been premeditately resolved on by a voluntary wound anticipated a public execution  sabinus another adherent to the family of germanicus was next taken off by the means of latiaris his relation and professed friend who having often with much seeming sincerity railed at the oppressions and tyranny of sejanus and thus by touching him even on the tenderest point the master string which made most harmony or discord in him row having wrought him up to join in his invectives he fixed two senators who were creatures to sejanus in a secret place whence they might overhear the discourse between sabinus and him who on his too freely censuring the conduct of caesar rushed from their ambush accused him of treason and after a formal process he was by death eased of the pains which he endured for the sufferings of his country  sejanus next with the concurrence of tiberius removed agrippina and her sons so that he had none now left to oppose his interest with caesar or designs upon the throne her he had banished to pandateria an island in the tyrrhene sea nero to the island of pontia near naples and drusus confined in the most abject part of the palace  being thus successful in all his schemes what he aimed at became more and more apparent to facilitate his designs on the emperor he endeavored to demean him in the opinion of the people by ridiculing his defects and imperfections on the public theater this first induced caesar to examine more nearly into his conduct and he soon found it was absolutely necessary for his own safety to hurl this colossus of the roman state suddenly down the steep of fate to effect this appeared scarcely practicable since he feared the fall of this stupendous pile would drag down with it contiguous ruin in which he himself might be involved however he at last compassed this coveted end by the assistance of macro and a show of increasing friendship and trust which rendered sejanus still more secure when his glory was on the verge of expiring he was when even such an attempt must have seemed impossible accused by a letter from tiberius then in caprea supported by proofs in full senate of the most flagitious crimes condemned with ignominy and to the unexpected joy and surprise of every honest roman precipitated from the topmost height of fortune to the lowest depth of adversity and a shameful death it is generally and justly remarked that the sunshine of prosperity animates a number of buzzing flies who disappear with its decline the truth of this observation was never more apparent than in the case of sejanus for not one of the number of sycophants and dependants who had been the instruments of his villainies and who held large fortunes and titles from his bounty offered to defend him at his fall or even wore the face of concern nay so far from it they were his most sanguine enemies and hurried him onward to his fate  sejanus seemed to have been marked out by providence as an example to futurity of that justice which will at one time or other overtake the great bad man who uses his power to oppress or to curtail the liberties of his country and were this his history to be performed either publicly or privately for ministerial amusement an excellent and persuasive instruction must ensue from it  the same soil which was blessed with a brutus a cato and a germanicus was cursed with a sejanus britain who feels herself happy in an orrery a chesterfield and had in the person of her late generally and justly lamented prince of wales all that rome boasted in her germanicus knows not what sejanus may rise in future times to wound her peace  business detaining me in the country i requested my friend mr derrick to present this play to mr garrick which he accordingly did and was promised by him an answer in four or five days mr derrick waited on him again about that time when with a punctuality which is not at all answerable to the character generally given of theatrical managers he returned the piece with some compliments as to its merits alleging that it had too much declamation in it to succeed on the stage and i am induced to believe that though this play was not introduced to mr garrick under any particular prevailing influence he took the trouble to peruse it and on that alone founded his answer  however i suppose you expect to find me severe on the manager for presuming to repulse my offspring but you are mistaken i am ever ready to receive and thankful for instruction it being an approved maxim with me that approbation is very pleasing but correction more profitable and therefore say with shakespeares brutus though more in earnest i shall be glad to learn of able men shakespeare  prologue when vice corrupts and cankers in a state it surely brings though slow the frowns of fate when plodding ministers by wicked arts can blind the eyes and rule a peoples hearts then tyranny and faction rage around and lawless acts eternally abound the nation groans beneath indignant chains where proud ambitious statesmen hold the reins such was sejanus such he flourished long for patriot opposition much too strong by direst means and artifice he rose and stepped toward empire on the necks of foes no honesty before his power could stand poor harassed virtue fled the suffering land wounded she labored for a safe retreat and weeping blood forsook her ancient seat while vice in all the pomp and power of pride did at romes venerable state preside yet though thus decked with most alluring charms who would not fly to banished virtues arms titles like bubbles that on waters play are by a breath both raised and puffed away it is virtue that alone feels no decay she gives her proselytes a lasting store beyond the worth of sordid glittering ore her joys are of a higher nobler bent they balm the mind administering content thus much it necessary seemed to say concerning the chief purport of the play and now a second charge i must fulfill our author alterer or what you will humbly requests the critics may be still not that he fears  the snarling train
