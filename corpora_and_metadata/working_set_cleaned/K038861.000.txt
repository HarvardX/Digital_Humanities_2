a letter to george cheyne m d occasioned by his essay on health and long life  a letter to george cheyne m d f r s showing the danger of laying down general rules to those who are not acquainted with the animal economy etc  for preserving and restoring health  occasioned by his essay on health and long life  with animadversions upon that performance  the circumstances of diseases are infinitely various and no general rules whatsoever can be applied to particular cases without the knowledge of the reason of the rule that is without understanding the animal economy upon which all the rules of physic are built  preface to keills essays london printed and sold by j graves in st jamess street j hocke over against st dunstans church in fleet street and f jefferies in ludgate street price one

page    line    r recede and shun  to george cheyne m d fellow of the royal society sir if any thing in this world be worthy of a wise mans care it is health and as mankind cannot sufficiently testify their gratitude to those who labor in the practice of healing diseases with diligence candor and judgment so on the other hand they cannot enough detest those who set up for the art of healing without any other qualification but their diploma to recommend them and having nothing in their view but making or mending their fortunes neglect that knowledge which is absolutely necessary to make their practice honorable and successful  they who write well and ill on the subject of health ought in likemanner to be set in opposition to one another and as their labors tend to the preservation or prejudice of health so ought they to become the objects of our favor or contempt  as all mankind are more or less frail they therefore ought to bear a great deal from one another folly and the trade of scribbling among the rest of mens follys may be so far indulged as not to be censured so long as it continues harmeless and innocent but as soon as it ceases to be so it is every reasonable mans duty to endeavor to stop its torrent and divert as much as possibly he can the mischief it threatens  if a man imagines he can oblige the world by communicating some thing useful as he ought by no means to suppress it so what he advances ought to be attended with the reasons that led him into his opinion and these should be offered to the consideration of such only whose application in that way to which they tend has made them judges of their sufficiency and then if his arguments should prove too weak to support his oppinion no other harm will ensue but his loss of labor and that share of praise which probably he might expect as the reward of it  but when a physician shall presume to lay down practical rules to all mankind without distinction for the preservation of health and if these rules should prove pernicious and destructive to it people will be apt to imagine that he puts himself upon a level with these savages on the seacoast who set out false lights to invite distressed mariners to their destruction that they may reap the benefit of the shipwreck  you best know sir what were the motives that prompted you to publish your essay of health and long life as you call it but i doubt many will have reason to wish it had never appeared it is now almost in every bodies hand and that seeming selfdeniedness in your preface that air of piety that you put on in almost every other period will persuade many to believe so good a man would never publish a book to pamper his vanity and would never pretend to the knowledge of any thing he was an absolute stranger to these considerations will i am afraid weigh with many to their destruction  i intend by this to show that every attempt of this kind must be fruitless if not pernicious by encouraging people to tamper with their constitutions which they cannot possibly regulate by any general rules and if your performance proves that your knowledge of the animal economy is not quite so extensive as perhaps it ought to be you must not take it amiss if i point out a few of those passages from whence that unhappy conclusion naturaly flows if the reasons i shall offer to this purpose are not sufficient to make it appear they cannot hurt you but on the contrary if they happen to be just and convincing no good man will blame me for undeceiving people in what regards a thing so essential to their wellbeing as health  i have no inclination to trace you through every thing that i think wrong in this performance because beside the irksome employment of finding fault that would oblige me to write a book at least as large as yours i shall endeavor therefore to be as short as the subject will allow me  it is a common saying as you observe that a man past forty is either a fool or a physician and if it means any thing it only implys that by so long experience a man that is not a fool will know what things have best agreed with him and his reason will direct him to continue the use of them till some alteration in his constitution makes them hurtful and when the happens he will find there is something else required to make a man a physician besides living forty years in the world for beside diseases old age will alter a mans constitution and bring on symptoms which he could have no experience of when less advanced in years of what use then can his former experience be to him in circumstances he never was in before  but let us suppose that by forty years experience a man may have discovered the proper method he should follow through all the different stages and accidents of life to preserve his health and prolong his days yet this method will only be applicable to himself and such constitutions as exactly resemble his own in every circumstance and such another perhaps will not be to be found among all the rest of mankind  you tell us page   the reflection is not more common than just that he who lives physicaly lives miserably the truth is too great a nicety and exactness about every minute circumstance that may impare our health is such a yoke and slavery as no man of a free and generous spirit would submit to it is as the poet expresses it to dye for fear of dying  if this had been the effect of any previous reflection or if you had believed it charity inclines me to think that you would not have been so industrious to contradict it as appears from your subsequent rules of health as you are pleased to call them but have left mankind to act for the benefit of their health as reason and experience should dictate to them and when they are indisposed to call in those aids that are proper to give them relief i mean such physicians whose skill in the animal economy and the materia medica has rendered them capable to judge of the nature of a distemper and to apply the proper means to remove it i am sure every reasonable man is a better judge of what he ought to do for the benefit of his health than any physican can be who is not intimately acquainted with all the circumstances of his constitution  when a man has acquired a competent knowledge of the animal economy and of the power and efficacy of these medicines proper to restore and preserve health to such a man i believe it is possible to lay down such general rules and directions as may enable him to practice the art of healing with success and ease  but to pretend to direct men ignorant of these things how to govern themselves to preserve or restore their health is equally reasonable as if one should give directions to a blind man to go a long journey by himself through ways that he never could possibly have any idea of and where every step out of the way would endanger if not destroy his life for how shall men be able to adjust either the kind or quantity of diet or medicine that may be necessary to constitutions they are strangers to how shall they be able to judge for themselves of that exercise and air that is proper for them when they are unacquainted with the nature of those symptoms that can only enable them to distinguish  you will perhaps say that you have acquainted them with these symptoms to which your directions are suitable but may not a person be afflicted with any symptoms you can mention and at the same time have others which would make the method that might be proper to remove such symptoms were they alone destructive to the patient now they are complicated with others which you could not possibly foresee  what then must become of that person who having these symptoms you mention follows your advice and whose want of knowledge will make him disregard those other symptoms that will make your prescription pernicious  many attempts have been made to lay down general rules for mankind without distinction to preserve their health and prolong their lives but these productions never obtained the end they aimed at because the constitutions and habits of mens bodies differ so much from one another that any general rule laid down to any number of men for this purpose must be destructive at least to the greatest part of them if they all comply with it  for if every man was exactly to pursue that method to health and long life that is proper for him to follow perhaps we should not find two in ten thousand exactly pursuing the same course though their end would be all the same so that any general rule enioynd to these ten thousand would but at best be useful to two and hurtful or destructive to all the rest  it very rarely or never happens that diseases even of the same denomination ever affected two persons in the same manner in every symptom and the method of cure ought always to vary with the symptoms how then can you tell a man after what manner he should govern himself in a disorder when you cannot possibly know in what manner he is to be affected with it or tell how a constitution should be be regulated which you are altogether a stranger to and these valetudinary crazy constutions that you address your self to actually labor under distempers or they would not be so and perhaps there are not two such in all england whose complaints and constitutions dont differ in many circumstances  so infinite is the variety of diseases and constitutions that the best physician in the world can only determine for these he is intimately acquainted with and whose symptoms he himself has examined and cannot with any safety depend upon any thing but the conviction of his own senses to regulate his practice by  what then must the complexion of your merit be who pretending to point out the way to health and long life lay down rules for mankind to follow which perhaps will never be useful to any and may be hurtful and destructive to all who regard your advice and the greater your reputation as a physician the worse will be the consequences and consequently the greater your guilt  your rules for health are all of them either such as have been known to all mankind since the world began or mistaken notions founded upon no principles that ever reason dictated  when or by whom was it ever denied or even so much as doubted by the thinkingpart of mankind and you tell us you dont write to the insensible that eating and drinking to excess were destructive to health but then it must be owned that no body before you ever presumed to determine the quantity of meat and drink that a man should take and prescribed that quantity to every body without distinction this is indeed entirely new and i hope in charity to the rest of mankind that you are the only man in being capable of laying down such a rule  that a very great regard ought to be had to the constitution of the air to restore and preserve health is a greater truth than you seem to be aware of but then it is as true that no one constitution of air will agree with every habit of body and a physician must be intimately acquainted with a mans constitution before he can prescribe a proper temperament of air for him to live in  you affirm page    that you have constantly observed good effects from leaving off suddenly great quantities of wine and fleshmeats too by those long accustomed to both i will not here dispute what you say is fact but i shall beg leave to enquire a little into the arguments you give us to support the reasonableness of this assertion  you tell us page    that nothing is more rediculous than the common plea for continuing in drinking on large quantities of spirituous liquours viz because they have been accustomed so to do and they think it dangerous to leave it off of a sudden it were as reasonable for him that is fallen into the fire or water to lie there because of the danger of removing him suddenly but this argument of yours is to no purpose unless you can prove that a perseverance in that life a man has been accustomed to will as suddenly destroy his life as lying in the fire or water will and your other argument is page    that no man was ever afraid to forbear strong liquours in an acute distemper what quantity soever he might have drank in his health  here sir you must give me leave to inform you that diseases and health are circumstances directly opposite to one another and what may be proper and fit to be done in the one may by no means be safe or convenient in the other  e g in a continued fever where obstructions prevail in most of the capillary vessels and the usual discharges from the body by insensible perspiration etc being obstructed the larger and passable vessels to which the circulating fluid is confined are for that reason overcharged and to give a person in this case even that kind and quantity of meat and drink that would be necessary in a state of health to preserve it would increase the distemper by increasing the quantity of fluid in the passable or pervious vessels  in all these we call acute cases the circulating fluid is not only confined to a smaller number of vessels but there being a check put to the usual expense and discharge from it by the several emunctories of the body which made the former supply from eating and drinking in a state of health useful temperance therefore whatever has been a mans way of living is not only safe but absolutely necessary till these obstructions which are the disease be removed and the several excretorys are again qualified to throw off the superfluities from the mass of blood care must likewise be taken in these cases to dilute the blood and relax the fibers and these medicines which can effect this will dissolve the union of the combined particles that obstructed the capillarys and stood in the way of the circulating fluid or extracorporeal secretions  but if these diluteing medicines which are convenient in this case were given to one where the quantity of secretions are to the quantity of fluid in the body in that just proportion that is necessary to health they would increase the secretions destroy that necessary proportion and beget diseases  and if a man in a good state of health who has accustomed himself to eat and drink plentifully should suddenly leave of that method and betake himself to a spare diet all at once the excretorys which throw of the extracorporeal secretions being large enough to carry off the refuse of his extravagance would upon so sudden a change throw off more than such an absteniousdiet could spare and leave too little in the vessels to support the circulation with that velocity that is necessary to health for that the blood may be propelled with that degree of velocity that is necessary to preserve health the vessels must all be filled in such a manner as the impulse of the fluid and the reaction of the vessels may be adjusted to this necessary velocity more or less will beget a disease and the bloodvessels etc being suddenly drained and deprived of their usual supply the pressure of the fluid against them will decrease with the quantity of it and the impulse of the fluid and the reaction of the vessels being equal such a diminution from a constitution that is not laboring under an acute distemper must necessarily lessen the velocity of the fluid proportionaly  hence it is evident that the sudden change which you recommend would make such a disproportion between the quantity of fluid and the dimensions of the vessels as would render the circulation very languid and this slow motion of the fluid would give its parts an opportunity of combineing and forming bodies too gross to pass through the more minute capillarys and the obstructions that would ensue from thence would consequently be the fountain of many grievous distempers the ill consequences of such sudden changes have been taken notice of by every judicious observer in physic since hippocrates and as many of them as have wrote upon this subject have faithfully cautioned mankind against them  i have already given my reasons why i think it dangerous to prescribe either diet or medicine at random and now give me leave to point at some things which appear to me in a very odd light in the directions you have given to regulate the quantity of food  you observe page    since our appetites are deceitful and weight and measure troublesome and singular we must have recourse to a rule independent of our sensations etc you propose here to give us a rule for measuring the quantity of our food independent of our sensations and if this has any meaning at all it must be directing us to eat and drink by guess without any regard to the quantity for we cannot possibly form a judgment of any thing without the assistance of our senses but afterward you advise us page  0 to measure the quantity by our eye but then there is one of the sensations employed unless you deny vision to be a sensation then you go on page  0 thus the two wings of a middling pullet or one wing and both legs three ribs of a middling neck of mutton two middling slices of a leg or shoulder of mutton somewhat less of beef may be sufficient etc  now if it were prudent or reasonable to determine the quantity of meat that a man should take without being apprised of the nature of his constitution what can any body make of this direction as if a middling slice of meat was a determined quantity which every body knew however people may determine what they themselves call a middling slice yet i am sure it is impossible for any body that has not been accustomed to see you eat to tell what you mean by it  every thinking man i believe is an enemy to debauching in strong liquours but i cannot be of your opinion when you recommend and prefer small wines to the stronger kind indeed if a man was obliged to drink a large quantity of wine every day then small wines should be preferred provided they were sound but as no man is obliged to drink more than he cares for i should prefer a convenient quantity of the more generous sort either by it self or mixed with water if it was for no other reason but because such wines being much less subject to putrefaction than the smaller kind people will have a much better chance for drinking that which is good for notwithstanding the vast quantity of wine drank in england very few are judges when it is good of its kind or otherwise unless it happen to be spoiled to a very great degree and you your self confess the good effects of generous wines and food not only moderately but plentifully taken where you say page    that those who have drank strong liquours so plentifully as to have thereby a strong circulation and full perspiration seldom or never catch cold and this is the reason why rich foods and generous wines moderately used become so excellent an antedote in infectious and epedemick distempers etc you are so far in the right in my opinion in imagining that men are less apt to receive injuries from the circumambient air when their vessels are filled by rich food and generous wines than diseased people are whose vessels are lank for want of that competent quantity of fluid necessary to health but this truth is the consequence of a cause quite different from what you imagine it you suppose the violence with which the matter of perspiration flys from the body which you call a brisk atmosphere resists the pressure of the circumambient air and prevents its having access to the body your words are these speaking of the effects of rich food and generous wines you say they page    not only banish fear and terror but as they make so full and free a stream of perspiration and maintain so active and brisk an atmosphere as suffers no noxious steams or mixtures in the air to come within it but drives and beats off the enemy to a distance but persons of viscous heavy fluids of poor and sizey juices of little or no perspiration such as generally all studious sedentary and sickly persons are but especially those that are subject to nervous disorders must necessarily suffer under these poisonous mixtures in the air if they do not cautiously and carefully sense against them or take not a present remedy and antidote when tainted for besides the air that gets through the perspiratory ducts into our blood etc  doctor james keill in his essays upon the animal economy computed the force of the heart equal to a weight of   ounces only and that the velocity of the blood at the heart to that in the minute capillarys and he did not descend so far as the excretorys of insensible perspiration was as      to   and here you suppose that the matter of insensible perspiration whose velocity is the least of any is upon some occasions propelled with a force sufficient to repel the pressure of the atmosphere upon the surface of a mans body which in a medium is computed to be equal to between    00 and  0000 pound  i confess dr keill was mistaken in this calculation for if the force which propells the animal fluids was so much inferior to the pressure of the atmosphere the circulation could not be carried on and consequently no animal could exist in the air we live in for that reason i shall not press this doctrine as an argument against you nor is it necessary here to determine how much you are mistaken in the other extreme  but the true cause why people whose vessels are well filled with good nourishment from rich food and generous wines are not apt to catch cold or be tainted with infectious distempers is because when the vessels are all thus filled the excretorys upon the surface of the body are charged in proportion and being swelled with the matter of perspiration they press against and shut up these orrifices which convey the air or any thing else from the surface of our bodies to our mass of blood and when the vessels are not filled as they ought to be from sickness or any other cause the excretorys of perspiration are proportionaly empty and consequently cannot press upon these orrifices but will leave them open to receive the air or any kind of fluid that may happen to be applied to the skin of such a person these excretorys that emitt the matter of insensible perspiration can never be the same which receive any thing into the blood from without us because if they are not obstructed they are constantly throwing out the matter of insensible perspiration and they cannot possibly give access to one fluid from without at the same time they are discharging another from within and if they are obstructed they can neither do the one nor the other  that fat is harder to digest than the more solid part of animals page    is a position you seem to be very certain of and quote sir isaac newtons authority to support your opinion and though the justice which the world has done to the character of that great man will leave but few dissenters from any opinion of his yet since the best may err and the greatest genious may be sometime mistaken i have ventured to think differently and shall give you my reasons why i do so  dont we find that fat disolves more easily than any other part of of the animal substance by all the trials we can make to that purpose out of the stomach what then should make it less soluble in the stomach than any where else and dont we find that a much less degree of heat than is in the stomach of any animal will disolve it infinitely sooner than any other part of the animal can be dissolved by all the artful contrivances we can think of so that abstracting from the action of the stomach the heat alone would dissolve or digest it sooner than any other substance can be  and if because of its smoothness as you imagine it could in some measure elude the action of the stomach yet its parts being less tenacious than that of any other substance the less force would be sufficient to divide them but when the stomach is contracted to promote digestion the contraction being equal in every part of it the matter contained in it cannot possibly evade the pressure tho it should shift its place and i am informed by men of great probity who tell me from their own experience that the turtle which they eat frequently in the west indies is the fattest of all animals and that it is the wholesomest and lightest food in the world  i cannot imagine why all these invectives against punch as rackpunch is commonly made in england though i believe this composition may not be agreeable to every constitution yet i imagine by the generality of people it may be drank as safely as an equal quantity of wine for since it contains a smaller quantity of spirits it will consequently be less apt to heat us  you say pge    every thing that has passed the fire so that it has had due time to divide and penetrate its parts as far as it possibly can retains a caustic burning quality ever after etc this observation holds true in bodies which have been calcined but the fire never has that effect upon any matter while its parts continue defended and diluted with water and water is the basis of every liquid except oil this is evident in that single instance of hartshorn which when calcined is in some degree corrosive and receives that quality from the fire but are not the parts of this same substance divided and separated by the force of the fire when it is boild in water to make jelly and did ever any body apprehend a caustic burning quality in hartshorn jelly has not the fire the same access to the plants from whence the simple insiped waters of the shops are distilled as to wine from whence you distill brandy does it not separate their parts in the same manner and as there any thing caustic either in the plants which remain in the alembick or in the water drawn from them  according to your notion it would add to the fiery quality of brandy or any other spirit to boil it over a fire but make that expment when you will and you will find it produce a very contrary effect though you stop it so close that nothing can escape but what passes through the pores of the vessel and though the subtle parts of the fire may get access through the pores of the vessel yet it can never affect any particle of matter contained in it so as to burn it as long as there remains any water to dilute and defend it  that there is oil in the composition of all inflamable spirits i own but every body knows whenever fire gets access to oil it sets it in a flame and if the parts of the fire did incorporate with this oil as you say it does would it not have the same effect and destroy it this is obvious from your own observation of the continued distillation of spirits they will at last when they come off without any water to defend them as you say be reduced into liquid flames which will of themselves evaporate into visible flames and fumes  it is not my business in this place to write a disertation upon the nature of fire and causticks it is sufficient to show you and i think it is evident from what i have said that the fire contributes nothing to arrack brandy or rum etc but as it seperates these spirits from grosser bodies from which they are drawn and in which they actually existed before distillation  the juices of lemons and oranges and we use no other in england but what are brought from abroad are every day given with good success by physicians who justly deserve that character to their patients in several cases in much greater quantities than people who are not drunkards ever take them in punch and you own that sugar and water are no enemies to our constitutions  you say page    in the west indies where from the necessity of drinking much because of the violene of the heat and from the want of proper liquors there they are forced to drink much punch though lemons and oranges be in their full perfection they are universally afflicted with nervous and mortal dry bellyaches palsies cramps and convulsions which cut them off in a few days entirely owing to this poisonous mixture etc  now i would fain ask you if all the people in the west indies are afflicted with this distemper and if it cuts them off in a few days how could ever that place be inhabited but perhaps you only mean those who drink punch however that be you are misinformed of the state of that country for they have plenty of wines from all the countries which produce it and ale and cider from england and are under no necessity of drinking much punch for want of other liquors madera wine and water is the most agreeable and wholesomest drink imaginable and this they hive in so great plenty that they make it serve the common purposes of drinking as we do small beer in england nor is it to be supposed that a people whose commerce obliges them to have dealings with every country in europe would want any convenience that europe can afford  and i am informed by a gentleman of good understanding and great integrity who lived upwards of  0 years in the west indies and but lately came from it that the disease called the dry bellyach which is so peculiar to that country attacks the women as well as the men and that the women there are particularly remarkable for their temperance and abstinence from strong liquors and that many of both sexes who never tasted punch or indulged in any strong liquor in their lives are afflcted with this distemper if this be true and i have no reason to doubt my information then this distemper must have some other source than punch  and if the bath be the only cure for this distemper as you boldly affirm it is how comes it to pass that so many are cured of it in the west indies and though the meaning of your recommending the bath and of your encomiums upon the water and other conveniences of that place upon several occasions is by no means mysterious yet you have rashly strained that point too far in this place and it will never contribute to the end for which i believe you designed it for probably you never can have any patients under these circumstances but from the west indies who at the same time they read your recommendation of the bath to save and cure them they will find your mistake in saying it is the only remedy since they all know that many more are cured of it at home than ever came to the bath to find relief and that going to a colder climate never fails to produce a cure of this distemper without taking any other remedy  and this disease is so far from always cutting them off in a few days that they who live soberly when they are so afflicted generally recover in a very little time and it will hold those who continue the excessive use of strong liquors many months nay years before they are either killed by it or cured of it these things which every body in the west indies know to be true will necessarily make them conclude that you know nothing of the nature of this distemper and if this be true your telling them that the bath is their only remedy will hardly bring them there to become your patients  besides we cannot suppose without reflecting upon the good sense of these people that they would indulge themselves in a liquor so pernicious to them as you think punch is when they have variety of other liquors that would answer all the purposes of drinking  this disease that you ascribe to punch is i am told the effect of catching cold in that country which the sober people carefully guard against but those who use to intoxicate themselves with strong liquors often neglect the proper means to prevent taking cold by sleeping sometimes in the open air or not taking the proper care to avoid this ill by means that are necessary to be used within doors for though a man is less apt to catch cold when his vessels are all turgd with the liquor that has made him drunk yet after some time when the several emunctorys of the body have discharged the superfluous fluid from the vessels they will become more lank and the pores of the skin will be more open to admit any noxious steams that may be in the air than they were before and therefore a more than common care is requisite to prevent a mans taking cold in this state and if a man catches cold there after being drunk he will be seized with this distemper whatever liquor he debauched in indeed as all the ingredients of ruinpunch are the product of that country they are consequently to he purchased very cheap and for this reason the poorer sort of people and the sailors that go thither who are the bulk of those who delight in drinking to excess often get the dry bellyach etc by catching cold after being drunk with punch but since punch is no more accessory to this distemper than any other strong liquor that a man debauches in and since sober persons who never tasted punch are subject to this distemper i think it very unreasonable to attribute this mischief wholly to punch  when you wrote your essay of the gout etc you took a fancy to say that the nerves were solid without cavities and therefore contained no fluid this notion has led you into many extravagant expressions about the condition of the nerves which this last production of yours is crowded with e g what idea can be annexed to that expression so often used by you of bracing and winding up the nerves every one knows how a drum is braced and how a fiddle string is wound up but how those operations can be applied to the nerves in any part of the animal body is what i am sure no man can imagine  in your treatise of the gout etc you have these words essay of the gout page    i have a long time suspected the reasonings of physicians and the accounts given by them of the nature of diseases that were found on nervous juices and fluids their motion nature and qualities and yet it will be a great baulk on the theory of distempers the boasted politeness and admired fineness of the present age has advanced should there really be no such fluids in animal bodys this as you observe would have been no small surprise to the learned world and i will tell you anotherthing which perhaps you do notknow it would have been no small addition to their surprise to have found that you had made the discovery  now though the arguments you bring to support your opinion that the nerves contain no fluid are of such a nature that it may seem trifling to take notice of them yet i shall be at some pains with the last thing you say in defense of this notion because i presume you brought it thus in the rear as thinking it the strongest and most conducive to your purpose the sum of this last argument is because the nerves are cylindrical tubes whereas the arteries and veins etc which evidently contain fluid are conical and nature being uniform in her operations therefore you conclude that the nerves contain no fluid  the arteries by dividing into branches must grow gradually narrower and for that reason are conical and the nerves are cylinders because they do not communicate with one another but run on in separate canals from their origines to their extremities  and the wisdom of our creator is signaly manifested in contriveing the structure of the nerves different from that of all the other vessels in the animal body for as the nerves do not communicate with one another but run on in separate canals from their origins to their extremities an impulse or addition of fluid to any quantity of nerves determined to move a muscle or muscles runs on or is propagated to their extremities without communicating their additional fluid or impulse to any of the other nerves which could not happen if their structure was like that of the arteries for if the nerves that serve in bending and extending of a limb were branches from a common trunk with which they had a communication any impulse at the trunk would be propagated equally to all the branches the benders and extenders so that instead of regular and voluntary motions we should be distorted with convulsions e g suppose a power at a determining to affect c by means of a fluid contained in the vessel a which communicates equally with b as with c any impulse upon the fluid at a will affect b equally with c without a possibility of determining its momentum more to the one than to the other  this demonstration i have borrowed from a system of animal economy that is not yet published i wish when it is it may be effectual to put an end to all that unintelligible babbling which has hitherto confounded this useful knowledge  it is no difficult matter to conceive how the fibers may be contracted by increasing the quantity of fluid in the vessels which they compose but by what power in nature essay of the gout can the fibers be drawn in and sink into their own substance which you say is the case in muscular motion you are realy so unhappy in all your expressions that regard the animal economy that if i was not certain you live by the trade of physic i should imagine you wrote purposely to turn it into redicule  this sir is a very incredulous age we live in and these infidels whom providence has favored with knowledge and understanding will never regard an opinion without good reasons to support it be it never so boldly asserted so obstinate are they in their aversion to folly that a man who speaks and writes without thinking may babble and scribble from his cradle to his grave without meeting any other recompense but redicule for his pains and by this means they vainly imagine to restrain the folly of writing and speaking at random i say vainly imagine it because you know it is attempting an impossibility  to be humbly proud is no new character and yet i believe you may justly boast that no body ever came up to it so fully as you have done a singular ambition peculiar to your self has made you upon some occasion or other reject every opinion that has been commonly received in that way you would fain persuade the world you was bred in yet when occasion serves you can truckle to any opinion that ever was invented in that way and at the same time you are denying and despising the most reasonable notions of the best physicians you condescend to express your self in all the unintelligible jargon of the mountebanks though i presume they are your averon for the same reason that they hate one another and treat us with whole pages of uncouth words and phrases with as much meaning as the wandering orator delivers them from the stage this method may get you the applause of the ignorant who are always fond of what they do not understand and they being the greatest part of mankind and generally the richest you may advance by it what the unthinking herd of man mistake for interest but sure you can be under no necessity of stooping to such meanness though quackery like thieving is not always prompted by necessity  your fondness of novelty which you have in common with all those who do not know how to judge righty of things made you assert what a great man only suggested and was far from being positive about it that the nerves were solid and contained no fluid i have already taken notice of your intention to be witty upon the resigned modern opinion as you are pleased to call it and shall not repeat it again but when it is convenient for you to make your favorite essay of the gout bathwater do every thing by ascribing qualitys to it directly opposite to one another or which is the same thing making it have effects directly contrary you thought pardon me if i mistake in saying so that it was necessary to fall in with the very opinion that you had but a few pages before condemned with the greatest contempt  and then you say that the relaxation of the muscles n palsies etc proceeds from obstructions in the nerves for how can the nerves be obstructed if they contain no fluid  the desire of knowledge is a very laudable quality as any human nature can boast of but he who endeavors to grasp at the knowledge of a thing beyond the reach of his capacity and notwithstanding this will pretend to all the knowledge of it that a genious equal to the task could possibly arrive at is a character much of a piece with him who describes foreign countries and the particular qualities of great persons as if he had been most intimately acquainted with them when he never possibly could have access to know any thing about them but what public fame gave him in common with all mankind and all this from the vanity of being thought a man of consequence and not ignorant of what any body would desire to know that there are many such characters in the world is a melancholy truth beyond contradiction and the despicable appearance they make society when detected is obvious to every man of sense  you prescribe exercise indefinitely to all mankind as if rest was never necessary and exercise never hurtful that exercise is an excellent remedy in some cases to restore and preserve health is very true but what rules have you laid down or could you lay down to teach all men what kind and quantity of exercise is proper for them all under their several circumstances to to take and it is impossible for men ignorant of the nature of their constitutions and of any bodily distemper they may happen to labor under to judge aptly for themselves in this matter  when you come to mention the use of opium you acknowledge that physicians are the only proper judges when and in what quantity it is to be exhibited now as one great effect of this medicine is to calm and dispose men to rest which is the opposite of exercise does it not follow that they must likewise be the only judges of the quantity of exercise that men should take for when it is fit for men to be quiet then most certainly it is fit for them to leave off exercise and of consequence if men who are not physicians cannot judge for themselves of the one they cannot possibly determine the proper seasons and quantity of the other  in another place you seem to give your assent to what i have been alleging in plainer terms where you say page    from these general rules taking in the particular complexions and habits etc here you seem to make it necessary to have regard to the particular circumstances of people in order to prescribe justly for them but who are to be the judges of these particular circumstances must these essential things be left to the discretion of men who cannot possibly have any knowledge of them the practice of physic sir is a sharp edgedtool and seldom or never fails of having very ill consequences when put into unskillful hands  to show you how consistant you are with your self in your essay of the gout etc where you treat of bathing you say essay of the gout pag     if people will bath indifferantly without advice without duly preparing their bodies and cleansing the alimentarypassages without any distinct knowledge of their case their strength the proper season of bathing or the time they ought to stay in at once there must necessarily happen as there have happened unlucky accidents which tend to discourage and disgrace bathing in general  and a little further in the same treatise you say essay of the gout page     it is impossible to lay down a general rule about the quantity of bathwater which it is convenient to drink daily that being to be varied according to some circumstances of the patient and the nature of the distemper  when we consider these passages together with your essay of health we find that at the bath people ignorant of physic must not pretend to act for themselves and must be directed in every step they take by the advice of a physician but every where else your general rules are sufficient to guide them without any other assistance  if you had not some private reasons to conceal it it would be some satisfaction to know for what reason you have excluded the people at the bath from the benefit of your general rules is it not as easy to give directions for bathing and drinking the bathwater under circumstances that you are not acquainted with as to direct people any where else in their diet and medicine whose constitutions you are equally a stranger to or would you have us understand by this that people had better trust to their own management than to the advice of any physician except just in that place where dr cheyne is to be consulted with  i do not know how you may have succeeded in this way but i think you are by far less artful in your addresses to the public than for let us our brethren the quacks brag what we will  tollere nodosam nescit midicina padagram essay of the gout page       those you are pleased to call your brethren for though i believe your ends are all the same yet these strenously declare that the good of mankind is their only aim while you tacitly own that sordid selfinterest is yours  and here pardon the comparison like the dog in the fable you drop the substance to snatch at the shadow and when you intend to make a monopoly of all the practice in the kingdom to your self you are industrious to lose what you have already got for notwithstanding all the fine things you have said of the bath who do you think will be at the expense and trouble of going thither and where to add to that expense they must fee a physician to regulate them according to the various circumstances of their constitutions when every where else with the assistance of your rules only they can act for themselves without being beholden to any physician  give me leave to observe by the by that you give a very extraordinary latitude in taking opium when you say page     that they who in the opinion of the world have died of too much opium could not have lived many days without it and yet where you decry the excessive use of drams you tell us page  they will as certainly kill as laudanum or arsenick now if laudanum can certainly kill how are you certain that no body was ever killed by it since it is a drug so much in use and which every man has access to at his pleasure a man that has murdered another may as reasonably urge in his defense that the person he destroyed could not possibly have lived many days though he had avoided that fate  your  th chap contains reasoning of a very extraordinary nature there you are pleased to say page     pain constricts crisps up and shortens the animal fibers it acts like a wedge in tearing and rending and dividing those small filaments it does to them what the points of salts do to all animal substances which are to be preserved for food viz hardens stiffens and contracts them the fibers of live animals being contractile tonick and springy when a hard pointed body enters them which is the case in all bodily pain the parts by their contractile nature fly from recede as much as possibly they can the wounding instrument this appears from the large gash of a wound made across the fibers of a muscle in the continual bending to the other side when any part of us is pained in the cramps and convulsions nay and sometimes fevers produced by intense acute pain pleasure on the contrary relaxes the fibers by a soft and bland or as the mathematicians speak a commensurate and harmonious touch it acts on the fibers as two unison and concordant musical instruments act on one another and by stroaking softning and smoothing comes at last entirely to relax and unbend them the parts of the fibers run after follow and pursue and at last break their union in some degree to reach such a demulcent touch  would not any one that implicitly believed in you imagine from this passage that every individual animal fiber was a rational being and had the power of discerning at a distance what was convenient or hurtful to it since you say they fly from a destructive object and pursue that from which they can receive benefit and if your argument of the great gash in a muscle from the fibers being cut transversly be of any weight they must outlive the person to whom they belong for the same thing happens in the muscles of a dead body a considerable time after life is extinguished this is a circumstance very well known to all those who have studied anatomy in that method by which the knowledge of it can only be attained  when one winds up a fiddle string till it breaks does not the two ends fly back in the same manner as the fibers of a muscle when cut transversly here contrary to your chimera the broken ends of the string retreat from one another toward the destructive powers that divided it and this will happen to every elastick fiber whether you cut it or extend it till it breaks  the muscles in all live bodies even in what we call their relaxed state are in some measure inflated and their fibers endure a proportionable degree of tension for i they were not inflated they could not be extended and if they were not fibrae nullam habent elasticitatem nisi certa camsint tens  sgravesand de elast extended they would not be elastick and if they were not elastick the cut ends would not recede from one another  and in muscular motion though the extremitys of the muscles are brought nearer yet we will find the length of the fibers increased by this action if we consider them through all the angles made by the transverse fibers which bind them together and the fibers of a muscle being extended in proportion as it is inflated it is therefore that exquisite pain is felt in violent cramps and convulsions etc  if a fibre s being made longer at the same time its extremities are brought nearer should seem a paradox to you only consider what happens to a bowstring when one draws it to shoot off an arrow in this action though the two ends of the string are brought nearer yet the length of it will be increased in proportion to the resistance of the bow and the power which draws the string  what we call but very improperly bodily pain never happens but when the fibers are extended beyond their natural length and for that reason an incision made with a blunt instrument ragged in the edge gives more pain than that which is made with one that is harp and smoother because the first draws the fibers a greater length before it can divide them than the lt and hence it is that in ampations they always with a sharp instrument carefully separate the perstm from the bone where the saw is to be applied to avoid the painful tension of its fibers by the teeth of the saw  and when such pain is produced from an internal cause it happens from the obstruction of some part of the animal fluid by which means the vessels in that part swell and the fibers which compose their sides are stretched and in danger of being broke and tore assunder in proportion to the increase of the obstructed fluid and the intenseness of the pain increases with the tumor are not the fibers extended in the tumor while an abscess is forming and in the case o an exostosis does not the tumor of the bone extend the fibers of the periostium is it not from the tension then and not from the crisping up of the fibers as you term it that these diseases cause pain these things are so well known to every one who deserves the name of a physician that i am sorry i should have occasion to mention them to you  but you are positive page     that pain most certainly crisps up constricts and contracts the animal fibers now if the fibers are sometimes shortnd and crispd up as you call it and if it be a disease then according to you the pain must precede the disorder but how pain should exist by it self without a disease to produce it is what i dare say no body can imagine what is commonly called bodily pain as i take it and i believe i speak the sense of every reasonable man is a disagreeable sensation arising from some disorder in the animal machine it is often the consequence but never can be the cause of any disorder  what i have said i think sufficiently shows how far your knowledge in the animal economy extends as to your skill in pharmacy every apothecary that reads the receipt of your cordial etc may determine and that no man can be quallified for a physician that is ignorant of both or any of these i may venture to affirm is a truth as evident as any proposition in euclid  nor have you succeeded better in you philosophical dissertation upon the passions you say page     passion may be defined the sentiments produced on the soul by external objects either spiritual ones immediately or material ones by the mediation of the organs of the body now how can the soul perceive any thing from outward objects without receiving some impression from them and how can such impressions get access to our minds but by the mediation and avenues of our senses and are not all the organs of our senses bodily organs  you tell us page     the acute passions whether pleasurable or painful have much the same effect and work after the same manner as acute diseases do they effect a brisk and lively circulation of the fluids crisp up and constrict the solids for some time thus sudden gusts of joy or grief pleasure or pain stimulate and spur the nervous fibers and coats of the animal tubes and thereby give a celerity and brisker motion to their included fluids there is something so extravagantly wild in this notion though you have often expressed your self much to the same purpose that i am truly at a loss what answer to make to so odd a proportion viz that the perceptions and sensations of the mind fly about the body in the form of a palpable fluid which contains hard and pointed bodies for such they must be to stimulate the fibers in the manner you contend for  that a great part of the nervous fluid is governed by the affections of the mind is evident from the bodily motions which depend upon the will and as the mind is differently affected it may no doubt restrain or increase the flow of this fluid to the detriment of the animal economy but you affirm that these very sensations and affections of the mind which we term pain and pleasure not as they prevail upon the mind to act upon its organs but act as solids themselves to destroy or preserve us and thus you say the sensations of the mind create bodily fain  but all sensations whether pleasant or painful exist no where but in the mind and however it be common to call that disagreeable sensation which arises from any disorder in the animal organs bodily pain to distinguish it from other painful affections of the mind which do not proceed from that cause yet in philosophical reasoning no phrase nor expression should be admitted that is not strictly agreeable to truth and though the soul readily perceives when the body is either disordered or better disposed for performing the functions necessary to life and health yet the organs themselves are incapable of any sensation and consequently there is no such thing in nature as bodily pain and therefore that phrase ought never to be used especially where close reasoning is required  but you seem to be of another opinion and tell us page     that beauty or perfection gives pleasure to both parts of the compound that is to the mind and its organs i thought there had not been a thinking man in being who did not know that the organs of the body were composed of mere matter and consequently incapable of any sensation and that knowledge and perception can only exist in the mind and is the distinguishing character of it  i have a better opinion of you than to believe you mean what i think this passage implys for since knowledge and perception are these essential quallities of the soul which denote its existence and since all things which are endued with the same properties must necessarily be of the same species and nature why should we then believe the soul immortal if these properties from whence we derive our belief of its immortallity are common to the body which evidently perishes nor does the absurdity of this notion of yours end here for when we consider it with what you call the  th prop of this dissertation we will find them amount to the most hideous hypothesis that ever was imagined equally shocking and repugnant to reason your words are these page     as in bodies there is a principle of gravity or attraction whereby in vacuo they tend to one another and would unite according to certain laws and limitations established by the author of nature so there is an analogous principle in spirits whereby they would as certainly in their proper vacuity be attracted by tend to and unite with one another and their first author center and the rock out of which they were hewn to use a scripture phrase as the planets would to one another and to the sun etc now if the soul be to the supreme power as the stone is to the rock from whence it is hewn then the soul must be of the same nature and species with god himself and not only this but if the properties of the soul are common to the body as you have said they are then not only the soul but the supreme power it self must be of the same nature with the body which every days experience shows us is finite and corruptible but as this pretended reasoning of yours could only be the produce or a perplexed imagination it deserves pity rather than reprehension and a man must be divested of all regard to the dignity of human nature to be able to read it without having compassion for the author  page    you desire the tender and the valetudinary to guard against passion you may as well propose to cure a man of a fever by bidding him be well for as the passions of the mind depend upon the habit and constitution of the body a man whose habit of body naturaly produces these emotions we call passions can as well hinder his pulse to beat as suppress them till that habit which gives them birth is changed indeed there may sometimes such means be used as will alter in some measure this untoward habit and give a man considerable relief and make him less subject to these miserable disorders yet there being great variety of causes which produce these ills upon the minds of men to prescribe a method for curing this ill without knowing the true cause it will be so far from having an equal chance of bringing about the desired effect that there will be as many odds against it for making the case more desperate as there are causes more than one capable of producing the distemper  if you or any body should think me too severe and allege in your behalf that however faulty your performance may be yet since you did your best mankind are still obliged to you for your endeavors i would ask you or any that would plead in this manner for you if you were to purchase any thing for your convenience that you could not be a competent judge of till you had tried it and if a person whose integrity you depend upon should sell you that which is damaged and good for nothing for the very best of its kind and suppose the preservation or loss of your life or health depended upon the difference i would i say ask how far this mans telling you it was the best he had to dispose of would serve to preserve his credit with you  i would not here be misunderstood and supposed to write this for the benefit of physicians who i look upon generally speaking to be the bane of mankind and i believe it would be better for the world that the practice of physic was quite abolished for though many would suffer in wanting these helps that they might receive from the hands of able physicians yet i am persuaded their number would be so small in proportion to those who are daily tortured and murdered by ignorant pretenders to that art that people in general would receive great benefit and relief by being freed from so great a curse as physicians generally are  i am sir etc london november      p s  you very obligeingly insinuate in the preface to your essay o health that this was the last time you you would trespass upon the public in his manner this i thought was very ind in you and i was in hopes it you would have attoned for all that was to follow but upon reading further i found my self mistaken and if i had any influence over you i would persuade yon once more to appear in print and acknowledge your fault for this last performance which is if possible worse performed and may be of much worse consequence than any of your former  you say page     god was forced to shorten the life of man to prevent the increase of wickedness etc if you had been able to prove this mankind might have thought charitably of your performance and believed you intended a further reformation by making their lives yet shorter and more miserable but as the matter now stands i know but one thing you can plead for your excuse which i leave you to guess at and then your book may be of some use since it contains almost in every page an ample and convinceing testimony of it
