amana a dramatic poem  libertas et natale solum by a lady  london printed by t harrison for w johnston in ludgate street mdcclxiv  preface the story of this piece is taken from the moral and ingenious writings lately published styled the adventurer numbers    and    but the drama which was too much confined in the fable has been enlarged here by the addition of four persons namely nardic abdallah fatima and hamet for though nardic and abdallah sanbad in the original are mentioned in the story they are not introduced into the scene  some other alterations have been made in the fable in order to accommodate the representation to a british audience the machinery of genies has been laid aside and the catastrophe brought to pass without the declared interposition of superior agents the time and place too have been restrained to preserve two of the unities shakespeare alone could call spirits from the vasty deep he was himself a superior intelligence could create beings not to be found in nature or fable could rock ages to sleep to hasten his events and annihilate both time and space to bring the history of a man within the representation of a day existence saw him spurn her bounded reign and panting time toiled after him in vain but modern wits are no more able to stride in shakespeares buskin than modern beaus to shoot in ulysses bow  the moral professed in the original story is to show the folly of human wishes and schemes for correcting the moral government of the world which sentiment is preserved here in a speech of amanas  o nouradin forgive this fatal rashness  had i staid a few short moments we had now been blessed but wresting from the hand of providence the means of my escape we both are wretched but i confess that the reflections which occurred to my mind most strongly on the perusal of this tale were a tender and humane resentment of the miseries of those nations which are subject to despotic power and an exulting sense of the peculiar blessings of liberty that we enjoy in these thrice happy kingdoms  the contemplation of this contrast both suggested and inspired the plan of the following writing in which i have endeavored to contribute my grateful mite of praise to those laws and to that government under which our superior advantages are established defended and preserved and however the presumption of this attempt may be condemned i hope that the faults of the performance may be pardoned as the first essay of  a woman  to the right honorable the countess of northumberland madam i beg leave to lay at your ladyships feet a work which from the spirit of liberty it attempts to breathe may hope for the honor of your patronage your ladyships own character justifies this address and the names of percy and seymour demand it history is my voucher and fame my herald liberty was their crest and glory their motto  but such an heroic subject is beyond my strength and i shall content myself with praising and admiring the more social and amiable virtues of your ladyship your humanity benevolence and affability which latter quality is the characteristic of true nobility in opposition to that haughtiness which is frequently observable in those who have sprung from obscurity  those who are placed on an eminence may descend but those on a level would rise  if this little work the offspring of a female and unlettered pen shall be so happy to amuse your ladyship for half an hour it will afford the highest satisfaction to the author who humbly presumes to hope that your ladyships candor will pardon whatever defects your judgment may find in this piece for the sake of those sentiments it is intended to convey  i have the honor to be with the profoundest respect and humblest duty madam your most humble and obedient servant eliza griffith

amana hail sacred fount blessed by our holy prophet whose precepts pure as thy translucent stream cleanse the foul man diffusing health and virtue frequent ablutions purge our outward stains and moral laws preserve our inward pureness but hark a caravan approaches near quick from all eyes let me conceal my own  veils enter caled caled damsel by heat and thirst impelled i come to seek refreshment from this hallowed spring say will thou lend that goblet  amana take it freely  reaching it to him caled heavens what an arm a shape a mien an air such are the houries promised us above and why not taste our happiness below she must unveil aside withdraw that curtain maid to cure my passion or confirm my wonder taking hold of her amana rude stranger hold    caled nay then i will do it for thee   they struggle and her veil falls off enter nouradin nouradin insolent slave forego thy brutal hold or by the soul of my departed father strikes him this moment is thy last say beauteous maid can you forgive this ruffians barbarous outrage or shall his instant death make just atonement  enter abdallah and amana runs to him amana o let me hide me in my fathers bosom   abdallah my loved amana my last grasp of life what monster viler than the wildest arab could dare insult thy unoffending youth or force thee lave thy glowing cheeks with tears  nouradin the slave who dared offend the angelic maid waits to receive his doom from her decree and justice satisfied too lovely fair i hope that vassals crime will rest on him absolving us from any purpose vile nor may the innocent atone the guilty  amana injustice dwells not in a heart like mine nor can resentment there long hold a place to you my lord my grateful thanks are due who rescued me from brutal violence that wretchs rude assault i pardon also let him depart unharmed  nouradin excellent maid thy mind and body sure are of a piece bright emanations of the deity  abdallah if you from insult have preserved amana o take a fathers prayer whose feeling heart for every wrong she suffers must drop blood my ages darling sole remaining stay which holds my frame from sinking to the grave o could i see that tender lilly propt by fortunes fostering hand or better far supported by the bridegroom rose i then with smiles would close my wearied eyes in death  nouradin o if the purest flame that ever warmed a virgin heart for such is mine to love unknowing of its pleasures or its pains till i beheld this loveliest of her sex and gazed my soul away o if a passion which in a moment equals that of years can make me worthy to possess such charms accept that prop that firm support in me whose circling arms shall screen her from each blast cherish her blooming years and nurse her age  abdallah since heaven deprived me of its richest bounty my lost amestris joy has never once pervaded this dark mansion the busy guest now fills each space nor leaves me room for utterance  generous young man thy worth thy wealth and power to me are fully known with gratitude i willingly accept the proffered honor if my amanas heart feel no reluctance to aid her fathers wish and make us blessed but should all egypts monarch from his throne descending court her to the bridal bed if her repugnant heart refused his love i would remit a fathers stern behest nor force my child to splendid misery what says amana  amana my fathers tenderness has been so great that i have scarcely felt the bonds of duty as inclination prompted every act which might appear obedience and in this the most important deed of all my life my heart feels no reluctance to obey  nouradin extatic sound thus prostrate at thy feet let my full heart pour forth its grateful rapture and by a life of love and friendly care repay the happiness i now receive  abdallah arise my son and may our holy prophet with benign aspect smile upon your union may long and prosperous days attend your lives and every hour increase your mutual flame  nouradin this day the mourning for my father ends from meccas shrine to which in pilgrimage i went i now return some angel sure has led my footsteps near this sacred fount and in reward for filial duty paid has blessed me with an husbands happy rites with here is and your consent tomorrows sun shall see us joined in hymens constant bands meantime to cairo instant well repair where choicest ornaments shall deck my fair their rays inferior by thy eyes be shown which shine in native modesty alone  exeunt nouradin amana and abdallah manet caled caled may swift destruction overtake you both and if wronged caleds means can lend it aid they shall be well supplied thou nouradin have robbed me of this maid i met her first and had a prior claim her childish coyness would soon have yielded to my freeest wishes had thou not intervened while she right woman preferred the fortune to the man nor yet is this the worst offense did he not strike thee and act the bravos part throughout a blow what though the chance of war has quite reversed my outward seemings still my pride remains as high as when in spain my native country i was saluted by the style of lord and though the turk has sold my limbs to bondage the inward man no shackles can control my abject state restrains a nobler daring therefore i will seek amends by cautious means and may revenge quick animate my purpose it is said that love has wings  but vengeance still outstrips its flight  the cyprian queen is drawn by doves  the bird of jupiters an eagle on eagles wings my vengeance now shall speed and in my talons grasped these doves shall bleed  exit scene changes to a palace enter osmin osmin what art thou pomp an airy being sure delusive shade which fools alone admire but wisemen never enjoy even substances grow vain and mock the eager grasp the mind sated not satisfied with blooming beauty lo dull disgust pursues the tired embrace varietys a cheat  instead of quickening it only palls the taste and sinks our relish to depravity the lowly cottager whose homely wife made coarse by labor rests within his arms feels more of bliss than i who can command a thousand various fair to inspire new wishes and revive my ardor but then it is submission and not love which prompts their yielding  they choose not osmin but obey the sultan while in full gust of amorous dalliance i but feel myself an happy brute yet still a wretched man  enter fatima osmin why fatima with illtimed zeal and fondness do thou obtrude upon my private leizure  fatima blame not thimpatience of unchanging passion which follows where attraction leads the way though that which once to me you urged is dead mine like the fragrant mittle lives in frost thy chilling coldness may destroy its blossoms but cannot kill the root  osmin these strong professions of neverceasing love sound like upbraidings to my tired ear  i like them not  nor thee  fatima oh do not wound me with such harsh expression but since my once loved image has forborne to mark its former traces in thy bosom yet still in pity to my sexs weakness restrain thy speech from scorn o spare the guilt to thy own breast of stabbing mine with grief yet leave me hope  the wretchs only solace  and let the jealous doubts of slighted love and not thy stern decree pronounce my doom oh suffer me to gaze sometimes in rapture upon my sovereigns face to hear that voice which whilom used to inspire my soul with joy and ease my heart with sighing on thy bosom  osmin away  away  dalliance without desire is lifeless sport  besides it might increase thy hapless flame and i in generous pity would quickly cure thy simple sexs folly retire  i am used to dictate  not to argue  fatima since you pronounce it i will go for ever a banished wretch exiled of joy or hope but dread the anguish thou have made me feel may be repaid thee in the same degree love is a vengeful power and will i hope resent his votarys cause some beauteous maid shall yet avenge my wrongs and make thee know worse pangs than i do now  if possible  osmin thy vain predictions like phantastic dreams vanish in empty air i dare deny that all the charms of thy whole sex conjoined can raise or pain or pleasure in my breast  full well i know therefore despise ye all  fatima then hear almighty love thy suppliants prayer  if thou do ever touch that stubborn heart with bitterest venom tinge the piercing dart mix yellow jealousy and fireeyed rage and may no healing balm his pangs assuage let him feel all loves anguish all its pain and may his fondest wishes meet disdain  exit enter nardic nardic may endless days of never fading bliss await my sovereign may still ripening honors bloom round his brow and each day add new trophies to adorn his fame behold from gazas walls a messenger arrived proclaims your arms victorious over the rebel slaves who now all own allegiance to thy rightful sway  osmin it is well now let those lofty disaffected towers that braved the heavens and me be razed to earth and let all those who dared oppose my reign now feel my vengeance is the city sacked  nardic yes mighty sultan   osmin then let its name no longer be remembered but see o nardic how the shortlived joy inspired by this success like the swift glare of lightning is extinguished discontent returns and renders still thy prince unhappy  nardic where then may we seek bliss if he whose nod gives life or death while numerous nations wait attendant on his will can yet be wretched whose every sense is gratified to fullness while all of art and all of nature join to soothe his wish and court his appetite our bounteous nile yields all that can indulge the smell or taste of fruits and flowers luxuriant our minstrels cunning in their harmony draw forth such dulcet sounds as might assist creation in her work and animate the dust from whence we sprang but o the last the best the highest pitch of mortal bliss see the collected master works of nature the lovely fair from various regions sought envying each other every partial smile  osmin avaunt audacious slave dare thou presume to expostulate with me when i have said that i am most unhappy think thou then thy flattering tongue can gloss my wretchedness but wherefore do i suffer thee to breathe thou abject thing except to administer delight to osmin then hear my firm resolve  if in three days thou findst not some new joy some untried vanity that may awake my soul and rouse it to a sense of pleasure thy head shall pay the forfeit  vanish straight nor waste thy precious time in vain debating  exit nardic osmin i have surrounded joys capricious maze yet cannot find the clue  some demon sure withholds it  but i will seek it in the pit of acheron or missing sink in the pursuit nor rapes nor murders shall obstruct my course pleasures like maids must first be won by force of them too when we taste we soon are cloyed and only sigh for those not yet enjoyed  end of the first act act ii scene nardic s apartment nardic solus nardic terror solicitude and wild despair pursue my steps each moment seems my last the tyrant seeks my life and he must have it  where can i turn to find new joys for one who has in vain exhausted natures treasure and plenteous as she is has made her bankrupt were he indeed a king i might supply new objects daily to relieve his languor and yield him transports beyond mortal sense to feed the poor to comfort the distressed to usher bashful genius into life become a parent to the orphans tear and cause the widows heart to sing for joy exalt a monarch to an angels rank but virtue never has warmed his earthborn soul it is a sixth sense to osmin science fair to him has spread her lettered page in vain  his mind never reached to contemplations height nor felt the rapture of a moral sense his pulse his nerves form all his notices his heart his soul are aliens to his joys i have sent proclamation forth that he who in two days produce the fairest virgin to fill the sultans arms shall in degree stand next to nardic be the third within this spacious realm no claimant yet appears  enter an attendant and caled attendant this stranger mighty lord earnest desires to come into thy presence i have now fulfilled thy wish to caled nardic it is well  retire exit attend what would thou   caled let nardics smiles from out the dust raise up the lowest slave that mingles with his fellows here may my faithful service be accepted and osmins arms be blessed with sovereign beauty  nardic say on for lo my ears are all attention   caled this day the merchant nouradin prepares to wed the fairest maid circassias plains or georgias vales have ever yet presented to the seraglios of the south or east the fabled venus fails of her description and those angelic nymphs which by our prophet are promised to the happy saints above but equal her perfection never sure for vulgar use were charms like here is ordained  our caliph only may deserve such bliss  nardic if that thy tongue unused to flattering speech has but reported truly quick expect the high reward proclaimed  nay more endowed with all the active friendship of my life haste then and bring this most transcendent fair to bless my longing sight  caled my gracious lord without thy aid our purposed wish were vain lo caled is the slave of nouradin and shall he dare to ravish from his arms the bride of his affections thou must lend the sultans power which only can accomplish his happiness and ours with that invested instant i will force her to your raptured gaze and prove that i want art to paint her charms  nardic the royal mandate quick shall be prepared and if our holy prophet aids my prayer she will answer to thy boast come in with me  exeunt scene a garden nouradin and amana seated in a bower nouradin my beauteous bride with pleasure i survey these dazzling gems diminished in their luster by thy bright eyes like stars before the sun but o that glorious planet moves but slowly stopping perhaps his course to gaze on thee were thetis such a bride as my amana his chariot would outspeed the wind and yet not equal my impatience for the night  amana all that i hear all that i see is new yet not the pride of sudden elevation swells my full heart but gratitude to thee these splendid ornaments and this gay scene attract my wonder but inspire not joy it is he the fond dispenser of them all it is nouradin alone that gives them value and makes them pleasing to amanas eyes  nouradin o were the flaming mines where diamonds grow with all of wealth and grandeur in my power how poorly should i estimate the gift compared to that which i receive from thee  amana too highly do thou rate so slight a prize for poor amanas heart is all her treasure there humblest duty joined with tenderest love and grateful sentiment shall ever dwell for thee my lord my lover husband friend  nouradin transporting charmer generous to excess but words are feeble to express my sense here then i make a solemn vow that though kneeling our law admits plurality of wives thy nouradins sincere and faithful heart shall never wander from amanas charms nor feel the power of beauty but from her the pride the pleasure of his future life his whole of bliss below who dares intrude rising enter caled and guards nouradin unmannered slave what insolence to rush into my presence thus  caled then know my errand  presenting the mandate nouradin with reverence i receive the caliphs mandate  reads caled can thou not read it why do tremble so arouse and be a man  i did not strike thee  thou first bereaved me of that precious beauty  i but repay thee justice for thy wrongs  nouradin ten thousand daggers stick within my heart  monster barbarian oh  drops the paper and caled takes it up amana alas he faints quick let me fly to aid him  runs to him caled lovely maid thy tender cares must henceforth be bestowed on one more worthy of thy charms the sultan in tedious languishment attends thy presence and we must not delay  amana oh never never  this world has no exchange for nouradin  nouradin tear out my heart pluck all my limbs asunder wreak thy full vengeance on this wretched body  but spare oh spare amana  amana naught but death shall ever wrest me from my love my father enter abdallah will thou not rescue me  caled observe this mandate  to abdallah abdallah alas my child it is not in my power   nouradin since wealth can bribe thee to an act of baseness let it for once inspire humanity take all that i possess  excepting her  thou can not leave me poor   caled were all thy wealth trebled a thousand fold nay were it more than even thought can number for it all i would not forego the joys i feel in vengeance now thou art answered  quick prepare to part  i will indulge thee with a last embrace  amana they shall dismember me to loose this hold  oh kill me sir and save me from dishonor to her father abdallah oh my unhappy child thy father wishes to see thee dead but cannot give the blow  caled come madam to delay your bliss were vain if you consent not force shall make you happy  lays hold of her nouradin oh do not hurt her tender limbs and i will quit my hold of her and life together my loved my lost amana  they force her off he falls abdallah cursed be this clime and doubly cursed its prophet for whose false faith i left the only true at once abandoned heaven and my country renounced both worlds for my amestris charms o liberty thou first best gift to man bestowed in paradise  natures creation subject to him himself without control except to heaven alone thus thus derived we claim it as our birthright yet o shame whole nations have resigned this right divine from heaven revolting yet submit to man albion alone preserves the blessed palladium where every power of doing good is free and peasants may defend their rights from kings a second eden in religion also in faith and practice purest among men yet i a renegade to each advantage though born a briton bred a christian too my creed my country for a womans love did forfeit true indeed my paradise i have enjoyed below  but vengeance sure though slow has now oertaen and my amana is marked a victim for her fathers crime yet still just heaven if sin may be attoned kneels by deep contrition weigh my penitence nor shed the parents guilt upon the child oh rather let me live while natures powers admit existence in that life be cursed with pain with penury with every ill to vex the mind or torture human sense extend those evils to my latest gasp and purge my apostasy with wounds and death  nouradin why did i part with her why not sustain starting up the sultans cruelty and caleds vengeance oh had they hewed me piecemeal what could they have done but killed me and i now must suffer a thousand thousand deaths but fear for her unmanned my nature quite  for in the strife they might have injured her there there i died  torn from my bleeding heart where is she now perhaps encircled in the caliphs arms  abdallah stay that ungenerous thought  though born a slave my daughter ever has been bred a briton nor will she condescend to live on terms which her chaste soul abhors  from earliest youth she has been taught to know that life is dowerless without virtue stripped of that rich portion one lot alone remains  to die with honor therefore believe amana still a virgin or no more   nouradin why do thou seek to aggravate my sorrows i hoped amanas heart might be at peace that wealth that grandeur might have bought her smiles and left me only wretched  oh it is false vile treason against love that heavenly maid within this hour declared she only lived for nouradin  then let me instant fly to save her from pollution this good sword lodge deep in osmins breast  or in my own  abdallah my son attend a thought has quick occurred which may perhaps redeem us from despair the captain of the guards his name is hamet was once a well tried friend of mine honest sincere and brave strict bound in gratitude for services no matter now to tell and if the modes of court have not erased all generous feelings from his aged breast he will both pity and assist our purpose should he but lend his aid i yet have hope of rescuing amana from perdition but oh he never felt a fathers anguish nor did his heart ever bleed as mine does now  nouradin o lose not time in fruitless doubts or fears but fly this moment and strong urge your suit use every argument that thought can frame to bind him to our friendship if my wealth can buy his service let him take it all and pay me with one sight of my amana  abdallah thou needst not seek to press a fathers haste to save an only child for though no raptures now fire my blood like yours more generous passions rage against oppression with parental fondness have made my heart as brave as his who dares the cannons roar in battle but my son know that the adventure is most hazardous therefore with caution let us now proceed entreating heaven to bless the pious deed  and if we fail i am prepared to bleed  end of the second act act iii scene nardic s apartment enter nardic nardic what strong impatience agitates my mind would caled were arrived i long yet dread to view this promised maid upon whose charms depends my life or death oh the mean slavery of proud dependence how contemptuous seem all power all greatness which we poorly borrow from anothers smiles or purchase basely with office servile or with treachery buy strange state of man to be or slave or tyrant is there no mean condition holy prophet are all then born for one no way to blend prerogative with liberty to poise in equal scales the prince and peoples rights and make them mutually suspend each other  enter caled leading in amana veiled caled now let thy servants truth be fully proved behold the fair amana  nardic her shape and stature vouch in part thy praise her face i hope will certify the rest takes off her veil  scendent charmer dry those falling tears and let thy lovely eyes be decked in smiles to reet thy coming greatness happiest as fairest of thy sex i hail thee queen prostrates himself before her and here devote my future life and service to the commands of our bright sultaness the fair amana  amana o detested flattery offspring of meanness and ambition fostered in courts luxuriant soil for every vice to thrive and flourish in know i disdain the sultan and his greatness if indeed thou mean thy kind professions for my service o give me back to a fond fathers arms to a despairing husbands bleeding heart or with thy poignard set my own at rest  nardic alas bright maid thy youth and inexperience have much deceived thee and thou know not yet the joys superior which attend on greatness soon in the caliphs arms thou will renounce the mean plebeian whom thou now lamentest and thank our prophet for the blessed exchange the highest transport to a female heart shall too be thine for thou will triumph over contending rivals for the prize of beauty a thousand fair ones shall obey thy will who while they pine in envy at thy bliss must still acknowledge thy superior charms i soon shall lead thee to true happiness and lodge thee safe in osmins fond embrace  exeunt nard and call amana rather to instant death convey me straight what will my fate do with me oh nouradin why did my soul receive its first its tenderest its only feelings from thy worth why was thy generous love bestowed on such a wretch lost and abandoned now to vile pollution no  it shall never be  though void of means to free myself by force my daring soul shall seek some horrid way  i know not what  to rescue me from force and prostitution  enter osmin and nardic nardic there stands the lovely fair whom i described  now let thine eyes be judge  osmin retire a while exit nardic my beauteous maid bend not thy eyes thus mournful upon the earth but let them shine on osmin  amana o let the judge of nations hear my prayer throws herself at his feet with eyes of pity not desire behold the unhappiest of her sex unworthy far or of his greatness or his love for oh her aliened heart was wholly won ever she beheld the mighty osmin given away by sacred contract to a lovely youth and this day was to have solemnized our nuptials but for the treachery of a barbarous slave then let not him for whom fond beauties sigh retain the furtive prize of villainy but quick restore her to the virtuous ties of filial duty and of wedded love  osmin arise  but be assured thou pleadst in vain  the tenderness of thy complaint has moved me but not to pity  since thou can feel love why not sustain its pleasing pains for me thou art not formed of coarse plebeian mould too delicate to sill a vassals arms i would preserve thy passion in its force but thou must learn to change the happy object the task is easy from my own experience for i have loved before  and now love thee  amana as well might thou command sweet flowers to grow on the tempestuous sea as force true love to change its object it is impossible from one strong stem rooted in both our hearts our passions bloomed at once reciprocal thy breath may blast the fruit but never thy hand reap the ripe harvest then o mighty sultan if ever thou do hope to taste the joys of mutual love o let my streaming eyes and lifted hands procure my reconveyance or if thou enviest him this poor possession quick let my death destroy his hopes with thine  osmin thou shall not die nor will i part with thee  but know the slave for whom thy fondness pleads shall bleed within thy sight if in the space of two revolving suns thou yieldest not to gratify my wish with soft compliance it is thy own fault if henceforth thou art unhappy  by gentle means i choose to win thy love my utmost power thou may command at will thy friends shall all be great nay more the slave the very slave thou sighst for will i serve his life or death depends on thee  thou art as well as mine his destiny  farewell  offers to go amana o do not leave me thy relenting heart speaks in thy eyes and gives a dawn of hope thou will not murder nouradin thou will not  i know thou will not say his life is safe and bid me be at peace from wild distraction  osmin i have already told thee my resolve nor am i used to trifle in my speech my words are firm decrees and since pronounced that wretchs fate now rests on thee  not me  amana then hear my resolution fixed as thine  though dearer to my heart is nouradin than sight is to the blind health to the sick to prisoners liberty  o far far dearer than life and all its joys to his amana  yet will i put with him survey the mutes fixing the bow string round his neck where i should fold my grateful arms to death devote him rather than wound his image in my heart or stain that mirror with a second object  osmin beware and stop thy heedless tongue lest i revoke the clemency my grace has proffered and doom thy minion to an instant death  amana oh i am silent will not dare to speak even to entreat thy pity  o nouradin thou can not know what i endure for thee aside osmin it is well  restrain thy impetuous grief and let the tedious interval i have indulged thee be well employed to brighten every charm which now obscured and deadened by thy sorrow show like aurora when her infant beams hold contest with the gloomy shades of night and like the glorious ruler of the day let genial warmth dispel the sullen mist then in the full meridian of thy charms with perfect beauty bless my longing arms  exeunt severally enter nardic caled and hamet nardic joy to thee caled may still prosperous days attend thy life with full and long enjoyment our sultan has accepted thy fair gift and owns her equal to his fondest wish therefore with power in next degree to mine i here invest thee aga of the guards hamet in thy new office will instruct thee  he has resigned it to make way for caled  caled most mighty lord caled is bound to thee thy future slave for even those flattering honors with which thou loadst him hold inferior rank as second to the higher debt he owes thee who slaked his thirsty soul with sweet revenge but much i long to know how did amana receive the overture of osmins flame true woman i suppose for such the sex one lover out of sight with greedy ear she listened to the seconds soothing tale forgot her vows and sunk into his arms  nardic caled you are much deceived  her stubborn will yet bends not  she is indeed a woman  perverse and obstinate  pleads plighted love to nouradin entreats to be restored to his embrace or begs that she may die  caled how would her sighs delight my listening ear but then i fear lest through her sullen coyness the sultan take disgust and cast her from him perhaps restore her to her husbands arms  the thought has daggers in it  nardic o fear not that  he is too much enamoured of her charms to quit the fond pursuit the power of beauty had never such effect upon his heart since first i marked the movement of his passions besides his restive pride will scorn to yield and force is ready should persuasion fail he has allowed a respite of two days to abate her grief and tune her soul to joy while as he knows his own unbridled will which like a whirlwind bears down all before it he has withdrawn himself from the serrail to waste the tedious space in solitude at the plain of the mummies near kairo sakara upon the bank of nile where i must now attend him by command thou caled to thy charge repair and know that any who attempt to pass thy watch within the palace wards must die farewell  caled adieu and fear not caleds strictest duty   exeunt severally manet hamet hamet oh i am well repaid for thirty years of brave and faithful services displaced for a vile pandar true indeed i never have ravished virgins from their bridegrooms arms to gratify his satyrs lust  i warred with men not maids and often in heat of battle at peril of my own have saved his life but that is past  his kingdom is at peace he does not want me now and like his armor i am left to rust too cumbrous to be worn  enter abdallah hamet welcome my ancient and approved friend thou come in proper time to lend me aid and comfort with thy philosophic counsel thou art the man on earth i wished to see  thy friendly tongue has often advised beware the dangerous shoals and rocks which frequent lurk beneath the tide of royal favor  now behold me stuck aground shipwrecked indeed  abdallah thy adverse fate sincerely i lament thy wellproved merit claims this tribute grief but oh my friend a nearer higher sorrow now fills up all my thoughts  a fathers anguish for an only child my lost amana  hamet say what of her my dear unhappy friend has the destroying angel torn her from thee and veiled her beauties in the silent tomb  abdallah had fate demanded her i were resigned  but oh she still survives a sacrifice to brutal force unless thy generous aid shall join to rescue her from vile pollution  hamet by this good sword which never yet has failed me in hottest battle even by hamets life or what is dearer still his unstained honor i swear i will redeem the virtuous maid or failing perish in the attempt  abdallah enough  but see the monster caled nigh approaches  let us retire and plan the generous purpose  hamet the die is cast  my life upon the hazard   exeunt enter caled as they are going out caled amanas father in discourse with hamet i like not that  perhaps they plot my ruin i stand on slippery ground my elevation was too precipitate and like the pine whose hastened growth outstrips its slender girth each blast alarms me and i shrink my head old hamets well earned post and long worn honors he has resigned with silence and submission unlike a soldier conscious of his worth therefore i doubt not deep within his heart he will retain the sense of injury which like an inward wound will rankle there till it break out and show the putrefaction though freed from bondage yet a slave to fear that worst of tyrants i am wretched still his steps i must attend with cautious eye quickened by malice  for whom we have wronged it is natural to fear and thence to hate  exit scene nouradins apartment he lying on a couch nouradin this feverish grief and torturing expectation drink up my blood my bosom is on flame my nerves shrunk up and i shall first expire before abdallah comes to tell me  what what can he tell me save that my amana is dead  or worse  a victim to dishonor his frigid age feels not a lovers pains nor can the fondness of a thousand fathers in nature or degree compare with mine  enter abdallah abdallah arise my son and let thy soul taste hope   nouradin thou do not mock me sure oh quickly speak say does she live and free from brutal stain have thy blessed eyes beheld the unsullied maid oh say may she again be mine my wife  abdallah i have not seen her but i know she lives and dwells in innocence and may i hope again be thine  the friend i told thee of has proved his worth and with his utmost power has promised to assist the bold adventure therefore prepare to quit this cursed land where tyranny is law and innocence can find no safety but in hasty flight if we succeed in rescuing amana my native country shall afford us refuge but if successless in the brave attempt our solace be that we shall die in virtue  nouradin oh i am all impatience for the trial to live with her were happiness indeed but if my fate that blessing shall deny death is its next best gift now speak the means  abdallah know then the tyrant whether through compassion or still in hope to soothe her to compliance has granted her two days to wean her sorrow to conquer nature and submit to fate during which interval he has retired to sakara whence like an epicure fasting from beauty to increase appetite he like an hungry glatton may return and feast his quickened sense with fuller gust  nouradin o may the grasp of death first seize his heart and cast him forth a prey to ravening vultures  abdallah to disappoint his vicious purpose know my ancient friend the kind the generous hamet late captain of his guard now subaltern to impious caled from a twofold reason impelled by friendships ties and just disdain on being thus disgraced to pay the hire of hellish deeds of rape and treachery will introduce thee in the sultans robes his yearly perquisite at dusk of even to the seraglio to amanas ward from whence by means which hamet shall direct thou may descend into the garden where i shall be stationed to receive my children and through a private portal straight convey a treasure richer than the crown of egypt from thence to happy england let us repair that land of liberty and wealth and valor  nouradin whether indeed thou ravst of that blessed clime in mere eutopian dream i cannot say but this i dare pronounce that with amana a desert would supply that heaven on earth my paradise below is love and virtue  abdallah within this hour hamet will doubtless bring the safe disguise by him thou must be led but oh when thou beholdest thy amana beware my son of dalliance suffer not a lovers fondness disappoint his wishes lose not the important moment but remember each instants precious to thy life and here is  nouradin oh that the hour were come fear not abdallah if nouradins fond arms once more enfold her again behold that face that form divine no power on earth shall ever force her from me and leave me life to plain as i do now  abdallah alas my son i doubt not of thy prowess it is thy fondness which i fear that weakness which only brave men know and while it sinks their spirit as a vain presumptuous man exalts it to the softness of a seraph  nouradin were but my life my happiness at stake well might thou doubt the weakness of my virtue against amanas charms  but where her safety becomes the question i can turn a stoic scarcely indulge my ravished eyes to gaze or raptured hand to feast upon her touch till i restore her to her fathers arms  abdallah o may the blessings of a mutual love light on you both let me but see you safe beyond the tyrants lust or violence and all the business of my life is over  exeunt scene the seraglio enter amana and fatima amana unhappy fair i pity thy sad fate though quite unlike my own i never thought the chaste the tender love that women feel could ever be won by outward form of man beautys our own peculiar character theirs sense and learning bravery and honor desire and admiration are their role esteem submission gratitude are ours  fatima sure in some northern climate thou were born where cupid as the poets represent him is but a child indeed  a playful god  his darts unvenomed and unnerved his arm not so he took possession of my heart but shot himself with his whole train of ills into my glowing breast thou happy fair were formed to inspire the passion in its rage thy heart insensible to all its pangs  amana alas thou art deceived amanas heart feels all the fond solicitudes of love but then it was thy chaste thy generous passion unhappy nouradin that lighted up the flame in my cold bosom which with life alone shall be extinguished  fatima hapless maid here i return thy pity twenty fold  alas thou art more wretched than myself  i have but one concern  with mutual warmth to inspire the sultans breast  while doubly vexed thou have a love debarred and one to shun the caliphs fate and mine exact the same pursuing fled from meeting hate for love  amana cursed be his passion cursed his vicious love and doubly cursed the hour he saw amana oh that deformity would spread its veil over these few but illstarred charms to avoid his brutal passion i would even forego the chaste the tender love of nouradin or trust to constancy to insure his faith or that the sudden hand of death would seize my captive limbs and rescue my free soul from the more dreaded tyrant some way yet i will escape  despair point out the means  fatima if thou indeed hate osmin more than death and art yet unprovided of the means to shun his loathed embrace i may perhaps assist thy frenzy but unhappy fair one weigh well the desperate deed for once begun it were too late to save thee from thy folly thou might indeed rob fatima of life but naught of mortal aid could rescue thine  amana o do not judge so poorly of amana to think that she could ever be induced to wrong her kind deliverer  here i vow no rack shall wrest the secret from my lips which with their latest breath shall bless thy service  fatima my mother was well skilled in natures lore and this small vial dying she bequeathed me saying that should this world of teeming ills ever load my life with woes too strong for sufferance i need but quaff this draught and ready death within an hour would swallow up my pains  accept it then for wretched as i am even lost to hope i dare not wish to die  amana with gratitude sincere i thank thee for it  welcome thou anodyne of human cares i will place thee near my heart for oh it is thou and thou alone i fear can give it rest now hated osmin i defy thy vice in spite of thee i shall escape dishonor wafted on air my unstained soul shall fly and seek its native mansion in the sky a bower of bliss for nouradin prepare and deck it with the choicest garlands there await his coming for a little space then live for ever in his chaste embrace  end of the third act act iv scene a gothic building representing the palace of sakara enter osmin and nardic osmin how poor is greatness and how weak is power when a fond girl shall dare resist my will and yield that love which i in vain solicit to a plebeian to an abject slave low as the grovelling worm on which i tread compared to osmins wealth his rank his birth my word may render that mean wretch unhappy but cannot make me blessed  even in my arms the adverse fair will sigh for nouradin and curse the tyrant for the unwilling joy  nardic and what avail her curses while her charms shall gratify my sovereigns fond desire and feast his every sense  osmin away  away  i am surfeited of sense want higher gust which love reciprocal alone can yield oh must i never taste the fond embrace of mutual love the ardour never behold of unfeigned passion modesty alone that brightest ornament of female beauty restraining its excess must i never see the half denying half consenting glance steal from amanas eye i may possess but not enjoy her charms  dull feast to gorge a clovefoot satyrs appetite o that i could transform my outward semblance and take the shape and garb of nouradin then might i feel the true extatic joy of being pressed with transport to the heart of this too lovely but capricious fair the very thought inspires an half enjoyment  nardic then why not practice the deceit my liege i have seen this nouradin when late he came to sue a license out for meccas shrine whither his filial piety and duty inclined him to perform a pilgrimage in zeal and honor of his fathers shade he seemed a comely youth in face and person resembling much my prince the least disguise in the dun shades of night might gratify my sovereigns present wish thy fond embrace would fill her arms as well as nouradin twill make her happy during the delusion and save a world of virgin coyness then if she be woman she will forgive the cheat and bless the artifice that saved her shame  osmin haste then  supply me with a merchants garb this night i will play amphytrion absolved by gods who smile at the fond frauds of love i will enter the seraglio steal into the sighing fair ones ward disguise my voice and whisper in her ear it is nouradin thy love thy husband quick let us enjoy those transports which the sacred priest this morn has sanctified by hymens virtuous bands thus thus well disappoint the tyrants hope o the transcending joy i then shall feel when full possessing all she can bestow i let her know it is osmin she has blessed and like another jove confound her sense with my full blaze of glory  nardic i am charmed at this fair scene which opens to thy view such happy thefts exceed those dull enjoyments which willing beauty yields this key conveys my royal master through the palace gates unseen by all his guards within an hour i will provide a dress to suit the intent exact the same that bridegrooms wear for such we must suppose was nouradins this morn when habited in form to espouse the fair and may success attend my sovereigns will equal to his and nardics mutual wish  exit osmin cold and inanimate thou talk of wishes who neither know the pride of kings disdained nor the indignance of a thwarted passion  o could i like another phaeton but guide the suns bright chariot for a day i would plunge the world in deep and sudden darkness nor ask for light but from amanas eyes like him too once to obtain my souls ambition i would hazard mine and this whole globes existence for i in truth could never yet believe our lying imans or their flattering prophet all that i know of bliss i will enjoy and leave the rest to chance or destiny  exit scene nouradins house enter nouradin in the sultans robes with hamet and abdallah hamet my friends i have risqued my life to aid your cause and much i fear but more i hope the event these robes of royalty sit easy on thee and as thou bear a likeness to the sultan the guards will never suspect the masquerade  but should the least suspicion chance to arise in any of the watch deep plunge this dagger in his heart and speed thy course in silence  nouradin if there be such a deity as love he will protect and guide me to amana for sure a fonder votary never bowed before his altar in the cyprian isle night too will be my friend accustomed still to smile on lovers she will not refuse her aid to nouradin my beating heart bounds with prophetic rapture i shall yet retrieve the angelic maid from soul offense and make her future life one scene of bliss  abdallah i would not wish to damp thy virtuous hope but much i dread there is an heavy cloud hangs over our heads to shower down evils on us my cursed apostasy has brought this ruin on my illfated house and my amana with you my son though innocent may suffer for my impiety  so heaven decrees  nouradin what means abdallah  abdallah in the distracted moment when my child was deemed a sacrifice to brutal lust and torn from thy despairing arms and mine i told thee of my country and religion and oh i told thee   nouradin i do remember something like a dream while on the ground in agony i lay you talked methought in wild phantastic vision of lands of freedom of a purer faith and judgments visited for sins derived  abdallah to thee my son i might appear to rave born as thou art beneath a tyrants yoke and early taught to bend thy passive neck to arbitrary sway the mountain goddess has never deigned to mark her footsteps here nor yet has heaven its saving grace extended to lands of despotism and gross imposture but what i tremble for is lest the charms of my amestris opening in their prime in my amana may perhaps induce the curse of disobedience to our law  hamet let not thy timorous faith forebode such ills nor sink the spirit of our bold emprize for thee or me the muddy dregs of life are scarcely worth the draught a nauseous potion therefore without repining at the past with calmness let us wait the pregnant future and whether death or freedom be our lot let us receive the alternative like men  abdallah my friends i fear not for myself my life has filled its years and like a full fed guest i would gladly quit the banquet and depend on penitence sincere for future bliss but oh i dread lest those much dearer to me than all the joys of earth combined may starve like dowerless children of a spendthrift father for my extravagance and luxury  nouradin forbear these sad reflections  if high heaven whose justice with the tenderest mercy tempered presides over all its works if it regard the ways of man its justice will pronounce amana mine and in its goodness will restore her to my fond and faithful arms  hamet prophetic be thy hope  this silver key the last remaining badge of hamets greatness none but the mighty nardic has another and he most luckily attends the sultan will open every gate within the palace beneath the garden wall well wait for thee  if thou escapest we shall be free if not this dagger shall release my bonds  farewell  exit nouradin the servent blessings of a grateful heart raised from the depth of sorrow into joy dwell ever round thee and protect thy age looking after him but why that heavy gloom upon thy brow illboding to our hopes as lowering clouds in days of harvest to the rural swain to abdallah abdallah from threescore years of tedious disappointment i have been taught that hope is the true curse of tantalus and when the flattering draught seems just to touch our lips some sullen sprite dashes the stream aside and makes us feel our griefs increased by bordering on joy therefore i bid thy inexperience fear  nouradin thy philosophic lore i will strive to learn when my tumultuous passions are at peace then only can it rule the human heart the rudders useless in a storm must yield to raging billows and resistless winds whilst the scared pilot stands in mute despair but to our holy prophet here i kneel to bless my little bark with prosperous gales  let but amana be the precious freight no other treasure shall i wish on board or care what course we steer  possessed of her all climes all nations are the same to me wherever she smiles a paradise will bloom and every withered herb breathe rich perfume fruits will spontaneous grow beneath her eyes and flowers to deck her bed will gladly rise  exeunt scene the garden of the seraglio enter amana and fatima amana my spirits are attuned to peace and harmony and now with tenderest pity i bemoan thy illplaced love  surely i think there is a curse attends that passion in our sex and she alone is blessed whose equal pulse beats undisturbed in senseless apathy  fatima o say not so  it is the balm of life and even its pains delightful  what must then its pleasures be but those alas i fear i never again shall know  amana do not despair  when the first tumults of the caliphs rage for my escape are past then may thou hope by arts of soothing tenderness once more to steal into his heart and win his love by soft indulgence to his present passion thou may revive the former in his breast and thus regain the empire thou have lost she who would please proud man must not disdain the lowest methods to attain her purpose humilitys the garb in which their sex the most delight to see us dressed  by this their vain superiority is shown and our dependent state upon their wills  fatima thy calm expressions raise my utmost wonder thou can not surely mean to die ever long yet talk with such reflection and composure  amana my soul is fixed and therefore am i calm did hope or fear perplex this constant breast the strong emotions could not be concealed what can i hope from lust and tyranny or what have i to fear who in that hour when i was forced from my fond husbands arms lost the last glimpse of happiness below for thee alone my generous nouradin and my unhappy father do i feel o fatima this thought has roused sensations which i could wish had slept  i am alas i feel it now a weak a very woman  fatima unhappy fair thou speak too modestly  no greek or roman ever yet recorded has shown less fear or more contempt of death if in the hour of trial thy firm soul support thee thus thou art a prodigy  amana it will not then forsake me i am armed with innocence and none but guilty souls should fear or hesitate at deaths approach my father will rejoice at my escape and even thy grief my faithful nouradin will soften into tenderness and peace by knowing i am happy  my loved shade thou will invoke thy guardian seraph then whilst i with joy still hovering over thy head shall guide thy footsteps in the paths of bliss  fatima amazing fortitude sure angels prompt and will reward thy virtue but behold the setting sun has warned us to retire  soft rest and pleasing visions bless thy slumbers  amana adieu my friend may every happiness thou prayest for me await thee in return may osmin since it is thy wish restore that aliened heart which thou have bought so dear exit fatima my senses are oppressed  within this bower i will indulge their bent  spirits benign who rule over dusk and dawn watch and protect me from all the dangers of the sullen night  and o if virgin thoughts as pure as snow may hope for favor from ye send a dream of nouradin my lost my hapless lord let him be present to my sleeping eyes whom waking i shall never more behold or in these faithful arms again enfold in gentlest whispers let him breathe his love then sighing leave me like the widowed dove  end of the fourth act act v scene before the palace enter the sultan disguised osmin i have safely passed through all the several gates and windings of these spacious courts and trod in paths i never traced before  this door leads into the serrail and brings me near the summit of my joy  why do i not anticipate my bliss feel all over rapture no  i despise myself for such mean arts to put on this disguise and counterfeit a vassals semblance thus to gain  a woman curse on the vulgar passion that enslaves us which ever is at war with reasons laws and so fortuitous we scarcely find two hearts united in one mutual flame while adverse loves still jostle one another oh it is the plague of man  and woman too but what are they the very sport of nature formed solely for our use like the fair flower that blooms but to be cropped then cast away now let me haste to rifle its perfume then loath the withering stalk opens the door out of which caled rushes and draws his sword ha what art thou  caled beyond my wish beyond my utmost hope this lucky incident has intervened  i thank thee gracious alha

are not so far advanced but i can spy the hero nouradin who for a girls caprice so bravely struck his late dependant his superior now the conference twixt hamet and abdallah i guessed might be for some such hopeful purpose and therefore quite beyond my line of duty i have attended to this pass and now shall make thy bridal robes thy funeral weeds resistance all is vain therefore submit  osmin

fruits of thy rebellion  oh  dies osmin too sure his weapon has been busy here  my heart impatient of the least control full of indignant rage opposed its point and now i bleed to death oh the disgrace the shame that will attend my memory when i am found disguised and by a slave oerpowered in mean attempt to win a vassal this  this wounds deeper than the fatal steel curse on the wayward sex

my presence straight and upon pain of death let none else enter exit attendant to gain this mighty realm i would not endure but for another day the strong emotions of hope and fear which agitate my mind but it is an higher prize than wealth or power that stirs up my ambition  it is amana whose love rewards my hazard and my pains i had forgot that hamet bid me enter the close pavilion at this gallerys end where osmin still employs his vacant hours in amorous dalliance with the alternate fair and whither none uncalled dare come it is here  going to the side of the stage i cannot calm my spirits  my full heart beats at my breast as if to force a passage to my beloved my betrothed amana  an universal tremor shakes my frame sure it is the approaching joy of seeing her that makes this

sultan has this moment summoned you to attend his pleasure in the close pavilion else i had not disturbed your happy slumber  amana the sultan said you what is he returned did he not promise me a poor two days and is this pittance now curtailed to half but what is a day a week a year to me whose fates already fixed and soul resolved then why should i resent this breach of faith or start at

means this chilling damp that clings around me why do i tremble thus my tottering limbs why should they now refuse their wonted aid a little longer and i shall not want it but pale and cold stretched on my parent earth no longer be a burden to myself can love of life have power over the unhappy or shall a wretch who languishes in prison refuse to be set free the instinctive voice perhaps of nature

terrors now this cordial draught shall lead me to his arms to peace and nouradin  drinks it is done and now fear hope and every passion of the soul are all extinct but love  that still remains and in
