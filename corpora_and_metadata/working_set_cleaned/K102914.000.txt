the upholsterer or what news a farce in two acts as it is performed at the theater royal in drury lane   o bone nam te  deos qutiam propius contingis oportet number quid de dacis adisti  hor by the author of the apprentice  london printed for p vaillant facing southamptonstreet in the strand mdcclviii price one shilling  to mr garrick sir the upholsterer would be a bankrupt even in thanks could he think of going abroad into the world without making his compliments to mr garrick for the civilities he has shown him whatever figure the poor broken politician might make before the commissioners of bankruptcy at guild hall you have taken care of his appearance before the selfchosen commissioners of criticism at the theater royal in drury lane  i am not willing to flatter myself that you were drawn forth on this occasion by any extraordinary touches in the capital figure or in the accompagnements du tableau i rather suppose that you approved the justness of the design than that you were an admirer of the coloring  the design sir was conceived and executed long since because the author judged that something in this way might have a seasonable tendency to allay the intemperance of too violent a political spirit or at least to laugh it into good humor with the same view it was lately retouched and given to mr mossop to be presented to the public at his benefit and however men of a serious cast may depreciate amusements of this nature i shall never blush for having dedicated a few hours to them as i am of opinion that suchlike avocations will more profitably unbend the mind from graver studies than the solitary pleasures of the recluse or any of the more open dissipations of life  i am aware that you will very probably recollect a passage in a celebrated writer montesquicu  which may seem to render the scope of this little piece somewhat questionable dans une nation libre says he il est tres souvent indiferent que les particuliers raisonnets bien ou mal il sufit quils raisonnent de la sort la liberte qui garantit des effets de ces memes raisonnements but you know that the question here is not concerning the indisputable right of the people to canvass their national concerns but the vicious excess of a propensity to politics when it gives a wrong bias to the mind and is attended with circumstances which create the ridiculous absurd in this light it was considered by mr addison who tells us in the tatler vide number     and   0 that he designed his paper for the benefit of those citizens who live more in a coffeehouse than in their shops and whose thoughts are so taken up with the affairs of the allies that they forget their customers for the very same species of people the upholsterer was brought on the stage being perhaps as proper an object of ridicule as modern i de as and manners will afford  with regard to the execution i shall not detain you any longer on that head than to remark that to preserve the gravity which is a specific quality in mr addisons fine vein of humor has been my endeavor throughout the whole though i am not insensible that grave humor is sometimes dangerous on the stage in the principal character i considered myself rather describing a passion than a man and this you remember is mentioned by an excellent critic mr hurd to belong to the province of farce for this reason the upholsterers scenes are strongly tinctured with his predominant foible and as this foible is generally fed and inflamed by a swarm of political writers i judged it coincident with my plan to expose the duplicity of their conduct by introducing the character of pamphlet  this character i have had the pleasure of seeing set off with all the exquisite strokes of so fine a comic genius as mr garricks without being indebted for success to the aid of personal satire having entirely levelled it against those who are the ready mercenaries of all parties and with all such i have the happiness not to be acquainted  i could here enlarge in the just praise of mr woodward mr yates and mrs clive etc but i have already deviated too far from the purpose i set out with which was not to inscribe a farce to you for neither of us thinks so highly of these matters nor to become your panegyrist for your extended reputation does not stand in need of it my intention was to embrace a public opportunity of subscribing myself  sir your most obedient very humble servant the author lincolns inn  th april      prologue spoken by mr mossop when first in falling greeces evil hour ambition aimed at universal power when the fierce man

starved projector sleeps and every shop some mighty statesman keeps he britains foes like bobadil can kill supply the exchequer and neglect his till in every alehouse legislators meet and patriots settle kingdoms in the fleet to show this phrenzy in its genuine light a modern newsmonger appears to night tricked out from addisons accomplished page behold the upholsterer ascends the stage no

fortune though by the way she has an uncle who is determined to settle very handsomely on her and on the strength of that does she give herself innumerable airs    rove fortune not to be minded  i will tell you what bellmour though you have a good one already there is no kind of inconvenience in a little more  i am sure if i had not minded fortune i might have been in jamaica still not worth a sugarcane but the widow molosses took a fancy to me  heaven or a worse destiny has taken a fancy to her and so after ten years exile and being turned adrist by my father here am i again a warm planter and a widower most woefully tired of matrimony  but my dear bellmour we were both so overjoyed to meet one another yesterday evening just as i arrived in town that i did not hear a syllable from you of your love fit how when and where did this happen   bell oh  by the most fortunate accident that ever was  i will tell thee rovewell i was going one night from the tavern about six weeks ago  i had been there with a parcel of blades whose only joy is centered so their bottle and faith till this accident i was no better myself  but ever since i am grown quite a new man   rove ay a new man indeed  who in the name of wonder would take thee sunk as thou art into a musing moping melancholy lover for the gay charles bellmour whom i knew in the west indies   bell poh that is not mentioned  you know my father took me against my will from the university and consigned me over to the academic discipline of a man of war so chat to prevent a dejection of spirits i was obliged to run into the opposite extreme  as you yourself were wont to do   rove why yes i had my moments of reflection and was glad to dissipate them  you know i always told you there was something extraordinary in my story and so there is still i suppose it must be cleared up in a few days now  i am in no hurry about it though i must see the town a little this evening and have my frolic first but to the point bellmour you was going from the tavern you say    bell yes sir about two in the morning and i perceived an unusual blaze in the air  i was in a rambling humor and so resolved to know what it was   brisk i and my maer went together sir    bell oh rovewell my better stars ordained it to light me on to happiness  by sure attraction led i came to the very street where a house was on fire waterengines playing flames ascending all hurry confusion and distress when on a sudden the voice of despair silver sweet came thrilling down to my very heart  poor dear little soul what can she do cried the neighbors again she screamd the fire gathering force and gaining upon her every instant  here maam said i leap into my arms i will be sure to receive you  and would you think it  down she came  my dear rovewell such a girl  i caught her in my arms you rogue safe without harm  the dear naked venus just risen from her bed my boy  her slender waist rovewell the downy smoothness of her whole person and her limbs harmonious swelled by natures softest hand    rove raptures and paradise  what seraglio in covent garden did you carry her to   bell there again now do prithee correct your way of thinking take a quantum sufficit of virtuous love and purify your ideas  her lovely bashfulness her delicate fears  her beauty heightened and endeared by distress dispersed my wildest thoughts and melted me into tenderness and respect    rove but bellmour surely she has not the impudence to be modest after you have had possession of her person    bell my views are honorable i assure you sir but her father is so absurdly positive  the mans distracted about the balance of power and will give his daughter to none but a politician  when there was an execution in his house he thought of nothing but the camp at pyrna and now he is a bankrupt his head runs upon ways and means and schemes for paying off the national debt the affairs of europe engross all his attention while the distresses of his lovely daughter pass unnoticed   rove ridiculous enough  but why do you mind him why dont you go to bed to the wench at once  take her into keeping man    bell how can you talk so affrontingly of her  have not i told you though her father is ruined still she has great expectancies from a rich relation    rove then what do you stand watering at the mouth for if she is to have money enough to pay for her china her gaming debts her dogs and her monkeys marry her then if you needs must be ensnared be in a fools paradise for a honeymoon then come to yourself wonder at what you have done and mix with honest fellows again  carry her off i say and never stand whining for the fathers consent    bell carry her off  i like the scheme  will you assist me   rove no no there i beg to be excused dont you remember what the satyrist says  never marry while there is a halter to be had for money or a bridge to afford a convenient leap   bell prithee leave fooling    rove i am in serious earnest i assure you i will drink with you game with you go into any scheme of frolic with you but war matrimony  nay if you will come to the tavern this evening i will drink your mistresss health in a bumper but as to your conjugal scheme i will have nothing to do with that business positively    bell well well i will take you at your word and me you at ten exactly at the same place we were at last night then
