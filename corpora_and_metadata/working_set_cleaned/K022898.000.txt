observations on the western parts of england relative chiefly to picturesque beauty  to which are added a few remarks on the picturesque beauties of the isle of wight  by william gilpin m a prebendary of salisbury and vicar of boldre in new forest near lymington  london printed for t cadell jun and w davies strand        to the right honorable henry addington speaker of the house of commons dear sir though your inquiries and pursuits have always been of a much higher nature than the subject of these papers yet i take the liberty of presenting them to you as i am persuaded you do not disapprove in others what the rigid economy of your own time will not suffer you to pursue with much attention yourself  my book would gladly however still offer itself to your notice from some little personal affinity it describes a country through which you have often traveled and in which your property chiefly lies  but if this plea have less weight it has one more from whieh it has a better hope of procuring a favorable reception the profits of it are intended to lay the foundation of a little fund which you my dear sir and a few other kind friends have obligingly engaged to countenance at some future period  as to the book itself it has lain by me these twenty years in which time it ought to have gained  and i hope it has gained  some little advantage one advantage is that i have had opportunities of adorning several of the scenes it describes with contrasts taken from other countries which have occasionally fallen in my way it was always a particular amusement to myself and i hope it may be also to others to see how variously nature works up the same modes of scenery in different parts of the world  at the same time so long a date has occasioned some little anachronisms i met with a few improvements in different places of later date than the body of the work itself these indeed i might have inserted in notes but i thought the occasion did not require much chronological exactness and therefore blended them with the text  after all my dear sir to tell you the plain truth in my address to you i consider my book only as a vehicle the fact is i had the vanity to wish it known that i could call one of the most amiable and respectable men i am acquainted with my friend and i hope you will excuse my not communicating to you this piece of vanity as i had determined to indulge what i feared you might wish to repress  i beg dear sir you will believe me to be with the truest esteem respect and affection  your most obedient and obliged humble servant will gilpin

where henry viii and elizabeth held their royal revelries cannot now be traced except here and there in the form of a canal or a terrace impressions made upon the ground itself are commonly more lasting than any of the works of art which are constructed on its surface they are generally more enormous and the materials of no value thus we have numberless tumuli  intrenchments  mounds  and ditches of roman and saxon construction which will probably see as many ages as they have already seen while the architectural remains of those nations are either gone or falling fast into ruin the ruin however of nonsuch had an earlier date than happens to most great houses the prudent foresight of the duchess of cleveland to whom charles ii presented it was the cause of its speedy dissolution she feared a resumption and pulling it in pieces sold the materials it is somewhat remarkable that her father lord francis villiers one of the handsomest men of his time was killed in the preceding reign in a skirmish with a party of cromwells forces on this very spot  but though the building of nonsuch was splendid and the gardens sumptuous beyond any of the royal houses of that time the situation has little merit at this day a situation is generally the first point attended to as indeed it ought in building a grand house but formerly the very worst situations seem to have been chosen as if on purpose to show the triumphs of art over nature indeed our ancestors had little taste for the beauties of nature but conceived beauty to reside chiefly in the expensive conceits and extravagances of art in which this palace particularly abounded the body of the edifice formerly stood in a field across the road opposite to a little farm now known by the name of the cherrygarden if it had been carried a quarter of a mile higher where a detached building appendant upon it called the banquetingroom formerly stood its situation would have been much better it might have commanded a view over a country which is in some parts pleasing  of the numerous appendages of this sumptuous pile nothing remains but a house now modernized which is said to have been formerly the habitation of queen elizabeths maids of honor in the garden was a large chalkpit containing about an acre of ground which has been planted and formed into a pleasing little sequestered scene by mr whately late secretary to the treasury who wrote observations on modern gardening his brother now possesses that estate which was formerly the demesne of the palace  from nonsuch we pass through ewel to epsom ewel is chiefly remarkable for a copious spring of limpid water which arising in several parts of the village forms itself into a considerable stream the baths collected from it are chill and pure in a great degree epsom has been described by the pen of toland who exercised the powers of a wanton imagination with more innocence on this subject than on many others all that can now be said of it with truth and it is now much improved since the days of toland is that it is a large pleasant village built in the form of a crescent in an open country and that it contains a few elegant houses of these the most remarkable is a house belonging to the late lord baltimore though it is now neglected and the park thrown into farms  the chief recommendation of epsom is its situation on the skirts of that open country called bansteaddowns celebrated for hunting racing cricketmatches and mutton these downs consist of beautiful sweeps of intersecting grounds disfigured indeed here and there by a chalky soil but adorned with rich and very picturesque distances  on these downs stands a huntingseat of lord derbys called the oaks which that nobleman brought into repute for it was formerly an inn by a very expensive summerevening entertainment which he gave upon his marriage general burgoyne celebrated both the place and the occasion in a small dramatic piece called the maid of the oaks  though this little villa is whimsical and singular it has its beauty it commands about twenty acres in an oblong form in the center stands the house which is a kind of tower but yet unfinished one half of the ground is laid out in close walks winding among oaks from whence the place has its name the other is a hanging lawn interspersed with fir flowering shrubs and beeches the oaks are ordinary and the firs scarcely yet halfgrown but some of the beeches are of the grandest form the whole is surrounded by a sunk fence and like an enchanted island in a desert appears a beautiful spot from every part of the downs in its neighborhood and has itself a grand view over them as far as the towers of london  from epsom we proceeded to leatherhead skirting lord suffolks park at ashted which is a pleasant scene including a great variety of ground and some fine oaks and elms within a walled circumference of about two miles the house is not grand but compact and comfortable the house is now rebuilt sir robert howard in charles the seconds time was the architect of the old house which i thought having often seen it a very good one   sect ii at leatherhead instead of continuing along the great road to guilford we turned short on the left to take a view of mr locks house at norburypark which stands about halfway between that town and dorking on the banks of the mole nothing in these parts is so well worth a travellers attention  the beauties of the mole itself deserve but little commendation it is a lazy stream and sinking into the ground in some places leaves its channel dry in droughty seasons its banks however are beautiful in various parts but in no part more so than where mr locks woods and lawns rise loftily above them  on entering the gate from the road and passing the mole we wind round the hill on the right toward the house which stands on the summit removed from the sight as we approach it though from various parts of the country it is a conspicuous object  among other wood which adorns this ascent is a profusion of box this plant grows here in full luxuriance in its native uncultivated state marking the road on the right with great beauty a regular clipped boxwood hedge is an object of deformity but growing wildly as it does here and winding irregularly at different distances along the road it is very ornamental the box itself also is a pleasing object in winter it harmonizes with the ground and in summer with the woods which surround it box has a mellower a more varied and a more accommodating tint than any evergreen one other circumstance of advantage attends it almost every species of shrub in a few years outgrows its beauty if the knife be not freely and frequently used it becomes bare at the bottom its branches dispart and it rambles into a form too diffuse for its station but boxwood long preserves its shape and in the wild state in which we found it here is far from regular though its branches which are never large are close and compact i should however mention holly as having all the picturesque qualities of box except the variety of its tints but in the room of these it throws out its beautiful clusters of coral berries which have a pleasing effect among its dark green polished leaves like box it grows slowly and alters leisurely  after winding about a mile up the hill we arrive at the house which is encircled with groves of lofty fullgrown beech the backfront if i may be allowed an awkward expression for want of a better overhangs the steep part of the hill and commands as you survey it from the windows of the house a very grand vale not like the winding rocky vales of a mountainous country but such as we sometimes find though rarely on so ample a scale among the downy hills of a chalky soil though here the chalk rarely offends this vale is a flat area of cultivated ground about five or six miles in length and one in breadth sometimes indeed though but rarely it takes the form of a lake or bay of the sea which it exactly resembles when it happens to be overspread by a thick white fog such a fog as from its gravity and the want of air to disturb it sinks to a level like water and like water also describes the prominences of the vale around the bases of the hills  generally indeed these heavy fogs are mischievous when they float over seamarshes and other moist lands a gentleman once fitted up a house near the coast of suffolk which was often subject to them it stood on a small eminence in the midst of a rich woody vale the whole surrounded by hills here the fogs would sometimes appear in an autumnal evening winding along the vale like a river and sometimes like a lake not with that indistinct and vapourish surface which fogs commonly assume but flat clear and transparent forming distinctly all those little indentations which a waterline would have described these beautiful exhibitions though frequently presented never failed to please in the mean time the family were all seized with agues fevers and bilious disorders and in three years found out that these beautiful fogs were the cause of their complaints when the master of the scene therefore had just gotten his house and grounds completed he was constrained to leave them  norbury park however is not subject to this beautiful mischief it is but rarely that its vale is thus filled with a sleeping fog and when it is the house stands so proudly above it that it despises its bad effects  the sidescreen of this vale on the right as you still survey it from the windows consists of a downy hill marked with various large irregular channels and planted with ancient oak and beech through these woods a walk is conducted along its sloping side from whence you have descending views into the vale below some of which seen through the spreading arms of an oak or a beech as through the frame of a picture have a pleasing effect  the other sidescreen of the vale consists of that boast of surrey the celebrated boxhill so called from the profusion of box which flourishes spontaneously upon it this hill from its downy back and precipitous sides exhibits great variety of pleasing views into the lower parts of surrey and the higher parts of the neighboring counties but we have here only to do with it as itself an object in a retiring scene in which it fills its station with great beauty discovering its shivering precipices and downy hillocks every where interspersed with the mellow verdure of box which is here and there tinged as box commonly is with red and orange  this hill and the neighboring hills on which this beautiful plant flourishes in such profusion should be considered as making a part of the natural history of britain asser in his life of alfred the great tells us that berkshire had its name from a wood ubi buxus abundantissime nascitur no trace of any such wood now remains nor is there perhaps a single bush of indigenous box to be found in the whole country all has been rooted up by the plough if it were not therefore for the growth of box on the surrey hills whose precipitous sides refuse cultivation it might perhaps be doubted whether box were a native of england as to the common tradition of the country that it was planted by an earl of arundel it is certainly fabulous for there are court rolls still existing which mention the boxwood on the hill before any such artificial plantation could have taken place insignificant as this shrub appears it has been to its owner sir henry mildmay a source of considerable profit it is used chiefly in turning but the ships from the levant brought such quantities of it in ballast that the wood on the hill could not find a purchaser and not having been cut in    years was growing in many parts cankered but the war having diminished the influx of it from the mediterranean several purchasers began to offer and in the year      sir henry put it up to auction and sold it for the immense sum of twelve thousand pounds box attains its full growth in about fifty years in which time if the soil be good it will rise fifteen feet and form a stem of the thickness of a mans thigh the depredations made on box hill in consequence of this sale will not much injure its picturesque beauty as it will be twelve years in cutting which will give each portion a reasonable time to renew its beauty   the endscreen which shuts in the beautiful vale just described consists of the range of hills beyond dorking and the rising grounds of deepden where in a clear day a new house built by the duke of norfolk makes a conspicuous object a little to the left of dorking hills the high grounds gradually falling admit a distant catch of the south downs which overhang the sea  such is the situation of this elegant villa though like all other situations it has its favorable and unfavourable lights it is seen to most advantage in an evening as the vale points almost directly south from the house the west is on the right in the evening therefore the woods of that screen are all in shadow which is flung in one vast mass over the bosom of the vale while the setting sun having just touched the tops of the trees as its rays pass over throws a beautiful light on the guttered sides of boxhill  this view over the vale beautiful as it is is subject however to inconvenience every house should if possible overlook its own domains as far at least as to remote distance all the intermediate space in which objects are seen more distinctly may suffer great injury from the caprice of different proprietors and in fact this view has in two or three instances suffered injury from the interference of neighbors this is indeed one reason among others why noble palaces with extensive property on every side are most adapted to these commanding situations  norburyhouse pretends only to comfort and convenience except in the drawing room which is an object of great curiosity it is an oblong of  0 feet by    the walls are covered with a hard and durable stucco and are painted by barret the whole room represents a bower or arbor admitting a fictitious sky through a large oval at the top and covered at the angles with trelliswork interwoven with honeysuckles vines clustering grapes and flowering creepers of various kinds the sides of the room are divided by slight painted pilasters appearing to support the trellis roof and open to four views that toward the south is real consisting of the vale enclosed by boxhill and the hills of norbury and dorking which has been just described the other three are artificial two of them which are the two endviews cover the whole sides of the room from the ceiling to the base  the scene presented on the west wall is taken from the lakes of cumberland it is an exact portrait of none of them but a landscape formed from a collection of some of the happiest circumstances which belong to all no real view could present so beautiful and complete a picture a large portion of the lake under a splendid calm is spread before the eye surrounded by mountains perfectly well shaped and stationed nature is not very nice in the moulds in which she commonly casts these enormous bodies and as they have various forms of beauty so have they of deformity but here we have some of the most pleasing shapes culled out and beautifully grouped woods are scattered about every part which give these scenes a greater richness than nature has given to any of the lakes in cumberland the smaller ornaments also of buildings figures and boats are judiciously introduced and have a good effect all this scenery is contained in various removes of distance for no part of the lake comes close to the eye the near ground is composed of bold rocks and other rough surfaces with which the banks of lakes commonly abound among these a wild torrent variously broken pours its waters under the surbase of the room which intercepts it this torrent the painter has managed so well that its spirit and brilliancy produce no lights which interfere with the calm resplendency of the lake but rather contrast it  in describing this noble landscape i have thus far considered it chiefly as a whole but all its parts are equally excellent on the foreground particularly are two birchtrees which are painted with great beauty the roots the bark and the foliage are all admirable  the other grand landscape occupies the eastern wall of the room it is i think inferior to that on the west yet it is a noble work the scene is sylvan and the objects of course less grand the foreground where we admire particularly some beautiful trees is tumbled about in various forms but in the distance it sinks into a rich flat country through which a sluggish stream winding its course discharges itself into the sea the same observations might be made on this picture which were made on the other with regard to composition and the judicious management of the several parts  the north side of the room opposite to the windows offers two more landscapes divided by the breast of the chimney which is adorned with a pierglass let into the wall and covered thick with a framework of honeysuckles vines wildroses and various creepers in flower all painted with great beauty these two pictures on the north are a continuation of the scene exhibited on the western wall which they unite with the landscape on the east clustering vines and wild flowers form a framework to all these beautiful pictures both at the base and along the trelliswork of the sides so as to give them the resemblance of being seen through the openings of the arbor  with this unity in the subjects of these landscapes the light also and other particulars coincide the season represented is autumn every where round the room the year is in its wane each tree and bush is touched with its autumnal hue the time of the day is about an hour before the sun sets which after a rainy afternoon is breaking out from the watery clouds that are scattered before a gentle breeze in too high a region of the air to affect the surface of the lake the rainy clouds which are broken in the west hang heavy in the north and give a dark lurid tint to the lake below in the northeast angle a ray of sunshine breaking through the gloom gilds a castled cliff but the clouds condensing again fall in a heavy though a partial shower on the landscape in the east  as the sun is represented setting on the western side of the room it is supposed to illumine the several objects in all the pictures and when the natural hour corresponds with the hour represented there is a coincidence of artificial and natural light all the landscape both within and without the room appears illumined by the same sun the union too between the natural and artificial landscape is still farther assisted by a few straggling trees which are planted before the windows with a view to connect the picture with the country  we dwell the longer on this curious and interesting room as it is the only one of the kind perhaps in england there is a room painted by the celebrated gasper poussin at the villa of monte dragone near rome on a plan something like this but gasper has paid no attention to the union of the several lights nor to the characteristic agreement of the several views  added to the house is another grand room full of much curiosity it was built by mr lock as a painting room for the amusement of his eldest son whose genius taste and knowledge in painting contend with our best artists this room is adorned with a rich collection of statues models casts and basreliefs all excellent in their kind and an adjoining closet is filled with heads hands feet trunks and other parts of the human body so that the whole together is a complete study for a painter  among the casts is a very fine one of the venus of medici it is not common to see so good a substitute of this figure i have sometimes heard her attitude called in question instead of that modest demeanor which is commonly ascribed to her i have known her reproached for prudery and theatrical affectation we can in truth say but little for her moral character her attitude however i think may be defended the sculptor i suppose meant her to be viewed with her face toward you in that position she makes the most elegant figure  shrunk from herself with fancy blushing  she received the shot of the profane eye that surprised her as our modern heroes in duelling receive a bullet by instantly drawing her body into a profile in both cases nature teaches the easiest and most commodious posture  but this collection though it consist chiefly of casts contains some genuine antiques particularly a discobolus which is esteemed i believe the first statue in england it turns on a pivot and exhibits what few statues are able to exhibit on every side the justest proportions and the most pleasing attitudes but what chiefly engages the attention in this statue is its expression it is a great beauty in any figure to appear to have some object in view which always gives animation to it i mean not that strong degree of action which the ancient masters sometimes gave their figures as in the laocoon the fighting gladiator and the torso as far as we may judge of that fragment from the swelling of the muscles strong expression no doubt is highly beautiful when it is well executed but i would here only observe the effect of some easy action or expression in opposition to none at all as in the venus the belvidere apollo the listening slave or the farnesian hercules resting from one of his labors all these gentle modes of action or expression are certainly much more beautiful than the uninteresting vacancy of a consul standing erect in his robes interesting he still may be all i contend for is that such a statue is not so interesting as if it had some object in view the discobolus before us possesses this beauty in a distinguished manner he has just delivered his quoit and with an eager eye and right arm still extended is watching its success the expanded hand indicates that the mind is yet in suspense the right hand in this statue is modern but there is a repetition of this figure in the musaeum clementinum at rome which shows i am informed the hand to have been well copied  his left hand holds another quoit as i suppose each discobolus had two it is probable however the statuary might have disposed the left hand to more advantage if he could have described a quoit flying through the air but he thought it necessary in some way to show in what mode of action his figure was engaged nature could not have told the story with more expression this statue is now in the hands of mr duncombe of yorkshire who purchased it of mr lock   as the statuary has generally a single figure only to manage there is much artifice necessary to show who he is or if he be employed what he is about and sometimes this is done very awkwardly we might produce many instances but few perhaps more remarkable than m angelos celebrated statue of moses unless the original greatly exceed any of the copies we have of it it certainly deserves less praise than it has found the face is incumbered with beard and the body with drapery but what i mean to remark at present is the conceit with which the statuary has characterized moses some symbol was necessary to distinguish him from a roman consul sitting in his curule chair m angelo has given him horns by which he has turned him into a satyr from whatever silly conceit the idea of giving horns to the great jewish lawgiver originally sprang it is certainly absurd in the last degree to see that idea realized in marble how much better might moses have been characterized simply by his rod and the two tables of the covenant which latter well managed might have made a broad contrast with the drapery while in part they might have been covered with it  among so many copies from the antique it is difficult to forbear remarking that the hair in some of them is very awkwardly expressed i have the laocoon particularly in view the hair and beard of this statue have an uncommonly bad effect for as the face is turned from the eye the locks of hair which are in round curls are confounded with the features themselves presenting a number of small cavities whose dark shadows diminish the effect of those in the nostrils mouth and eyes which should give character and expression to the face it is a difficult thing no doubt to give the ease of hair to a block of marble yet it may be done in two ways we have examples of both the hair may be represented very short just covering the head approaching nearly to baldness as we often see it expressed or it may be represented in an easy flow this is more difficult yet we sometimes see it well executed and when it is so it is certainly more beautiful than to express the hair in small ringlets as it is in the laocoon and in many other antiques  before we leave this room i cannot forbear mentioning a head which has a place there with hair of another kind it plainly indeed appeared allied neither to the greek nor roman models among which it stood for the mouth was frightfully bad yet the upper part of the face was executed with simplicity and had something in it like taste and beauty on inquiry we found it was a great curiosity being the workmanship of a native of otaheite and seemed a convincing proof that a love for the imitative arts is innate but what particularly struck us in this head was its being adorned with real hair which had a still worse effect than the beard of laocoon the mixture indeed of reality and imitation is very disgusting and i doubt not would have appeared so on a little more knowledge and experience to the ingenious sculptor of the head himself but we need not wonder at such absurdity in an artist of otaheite when we see among ourselves so many shocking statues painted after the life and vile waxen images with wigs and drapery things to shudder at rather than to admire the plain marble makes no pretense to any thing but imitation it means not to put a trick upon us by substituting itself for real life but when we look at a waxen figure arrayed in real drapery yet with rigid limbs and glazed and motionless eyes that is with every appearance of life about it but motion in which the very essence of life consists we are shocked the fact is that when the art of imitation applied to human life is so perfect as to produce a real though momentary illusion it presents by its near approach to life an image of death for the instant we perceive that a figure of this kind wants motion we pursue it to the next stage where motion ceases which is death a representation of a dead body may be beautiful and pleasing but a figure which presents you with the appearance of death when you expected life not only disgusts you by the suddenness of the transition but also from the minds having been even for a moment imposed on by so paltry a trick  from such effects therefore it seems to follow that an art calculated to please by an imitation of life should when applied to the human figure though necessarily imperfect be made intentionally more so lest by too near an approach to life it should shock us with the idea of death  besides the shock which these representations give to the senses they grossly oppose every idea of taste when we see a stuffed skin in a museum we expect only an object of curiosity and are satisfied but when a thing of this kind is shown as an object of beauty it sets all taste which in natural objects seeks for nature at defiance and we consider a mummy which aims at nothing but what it is by many degrees the more respectable figure  as we leave this elegant mansion and descend the hill the views are more picturesque than those over the valley from the backfront they consist of oblique sweeps of descending foregrounds every where wellwooded and set off with remote distances this is the simplest mode of landscape but where the foreground and distances are good though there is a strong opposition between them they are not unpleasing  a little to the right as we descend from the house the beechwoods consisting of lofty fullgrown trees sweep down to the vale though in less luxuriance as they gradually descend when the descent becomes precipitous the channelled sides of the hill are in many parts bare of vegetation and discover the soil which is not chalk though of a chalky tendency and rather gray than white patches of earth are mixed with these patches of barren soil in which boxwood grows profusely and here and there where the soil allows a luxuriant beech down this hill an alpine road winds into the vale and adds much to its beauty and character it is still rendered more interesting by opening in various parts toward boxhill which presents its flanks in these partial views with a very mountainlike appearance the whole scene makes a good alpine picture  our remarks on this place should have been more cursory if the plan of the whole the situation and the embellishments of it had not been all uncommon great houses in general resemble each other so nearly that it is difficult to find among them any characteristic features here the whole is new  sect iii from norburypark we returned to leatherhead and passed the mole again in our way to guildford the country on the left consists chiefly of open downs which are rather narrow in this part as they are drawing to a point they are interspersed also with plots of cultivation as these downs are generally high we had from many parts of them a variety of beautiful distances on the right not so expansive as those from bansteaddowns but more picturesque as they are more within the command of the eye the great beauty of such scenes consists in the richness of their parts in the removal of one distance beyond another discoverable chiefly by lengthened gleams of light and in the melting of the whole into the horizon if a distance be deprived of any of these characteristics it is imperfect but the last is most essentially necessary a hard edge of distance checking the view which is often the case when the distance is not remote is exceedingly disgusting when the distance indeed is bounded by mountains it falls under other rules of picturesque beauty  of the elevated situation of these downs much advantage has been taken many elegant houses are built upon the edge of them for the sake of the various prospects they command the whole country indeed from leatherhead almost to guildford is thus richly adorned two of the most beautiful of these villas are those belonging to the late admiral boscawen and lord onslow the latter is esteemed one of the best houses in surrey the grounds about it seem well disposed but we only rode past them  a little to the left near three parts of the way to guildford we were directed to look out about half a mile from the road for a beautiful scene called the sheepleas consisting of lawns divided from each other by woody copses we easily found it and were much gratified with the appearance it presented of a simple arcadian retreat  few parts of this adorned tract of country between leatherhead and guildford through a space of about eleven miles can be called picturesque yet from the variety it affords it is very amusing one of the great nuisances of the landscape here as well as in other parts of the neighborhood of london is the formal manner which prevails of lopping trees especially elms they are entirely deprived of the beautiful ramification of all their lateral branches and you see them every where formed into mere poles with a bush at the top we considered them only as objects of deformity but the skilful woodman i have heard considers such mutilation as very detrimental to the timber one reason given for lopping the elm is that it may be the better converted into a hollow trunk to convey water under ground elm is the wood chiefly used for this purpose as it continues long sound if it be kept from the air but perhaps not one in fifty of these mutilated trees is converted to this use  guildford is a town both of antiquity and curiosity but is in no part picturesque it consists of one long street running down precipitately to the river wey from whence the road on the other side rises still more abruptly it has lately been much eased  in the highest part of the town stands the castle which consists of a heavy tower though in one or two points it is not unpicturesque the wey is navigable as far as guildford and beyond it for timber which is brought down the river from the contiguous parts of the country  floats of timber are among the pleasing appendages of a river when the trunks are happily disposed this disposition however i fear must be the result of chance rather than of art it is hardly possible to pack a float picturesquely by design these cumbrous machines are navigated each by a single man with a pole and as they glide gently down the stream the tremulous reflections they form on the still surface of the water and their contrast with trees bushes and pasturage as they float along are pleasing  but cumbrous as these rafts are they are as nothing compared with those which are often floated down the rhine in the neighborhood of andernach great quantities of timber brought down by various streams from the forests of germany are there constructed into a float of vast dimensions some of these floats are a thousand feet long and ninety broad and are each furnished with five hundred men for the accommodation of such a company a street of cabins is built upon the surface of the float when all is ready and the several men are at their posts many of whom are in rafts and boats both behind and before the float to conduct it properly the pilot stands up and taking off his hat with a loud voice cries out let us pray on which the whole body of the workmen on board fall down on their knees and beg a blessing on the expedition the anchors and cables are then drawn on board and the whole machine is put in motion as it sails majestically down the rhine it draws all the inhabitants from the towns and villages on the banks of the river to see it pass till it arrive at dort in holland the place of its destination where being broken up the sale of its several parts continues many months and raises often the sum of thirty thousand pounds see a longer account of these floats in a very ingenious and entertaining work entitled a journey through holland etc by anne ratcliffe   to these timber floats we may add one of a very singular kind on the nile constructed of earthen vessels large jars to preserve water in dry seasons are in great request in many parts of egypt these of various sizes are manufactured chiefly in the clayey grounds of the upper parts of the country when the potter has gotten a sufficient number ready for market he begins to form his float in some convenient place near the river he ranges his largest jars empty but wellcorked in rows of a proper length and breadth these he braces tight with flexible twigs and with the same art ranges above them several tiers of smaller jars till he has made up the quantity and kind of goods his market demands over all he constructs a seat for himself by this time the waters of the nile whose increase he calculates begin to ripple round his earthen raft which is presently after afloat having victualled it with a bag of parched rice and put on his blue linen shirt and cap he takes his seat and paddles his vessel into the middle of the channel the wondering stranger eyes from the shore this odd species of navigation and though assisted by his pocketperspective cannot conceive its construction in the mean time it glides down the stream neither storms nor rocks it fears with which the nile is little acquainted and if it even touch the ground its motion is so gentle and the ooze so soft that its construction is not in the least disturbed nothing can be more ingenious than to make a cargo of heavy materials its own vehicle at the same time such a float could hardly be an object of beauty  the elegant author of the elegy in a churchyard seems to have had a float of this kind in his view in the last lines of the following beautiful description of the nile  what wonder in the sultry climes that spread where nile redundant over his summerbed from his broad bosom life and verdure flings and broods over egypt with his watery wings if with adventurous oar and ready sail the dusky people drive before the gale or on frail floats to neighboring cities ride that rise and glitter over the ambient tide from guildford to farnham the form of the country is singular the road is carried through the space of eight miles over a ridge of high ground with a steep descent on each side this grand natural terrace which the country people call the hogs back presents on each hand extensive distances on the right the distance is very remote consisting of that flat country through which the wey the mole and the thames though none of them objects in the scene flow with almost imperceptible motion on the left the distance is more broken with rising grounds interspersed through various parts of it  though the distance on neither hand forms a picture except in a few places for want of foregrounds and proper appendages proportioned to the scene yet on both sides we study a variety of those pleasing circumstances which we look for in remote landscape as we draw near the close of this terrace the two distances unite in one forming a kind of grand amphitheatre in front  such violent contrasts as these in which lofty grounds break down precipitately into extensive plains are rather uncommon in nature as these different modes of country are generally more imperceptibly united we have several scenes however of this kind in different parts of england particularly in the view over the vale of mowbray see northern tour vol ii p      and in that over the vale of severn see the wye p    in both which the union is abrupt as england however is a country only on a small scale compared with the vast tracts on the continent its scenes are more in miniature its rivers its lakes its mountains and plains though generally more picturesque as more suited to human vision yet do not strike the imagination with so much grandeur many instances might be brought from the continent of sublimer effects in all modes of landscape a very abrupt transition from the most magnificent sylvan scenery to entire sterility i met with lately in an account of the productions of boutan and thibet communicated in the philosophical transactions vol lxxix  where boutan says the author of those remarks joins the territory of thibet the boundary is marked by such a line as is perhaps hardly to be seen in any other part of the earth from the eminence where we stood the mountains of boutan which ranged above us appeared every where beautifully arrayed in wood mantling down to our very feet this view was toward the south when we turned toward the north the eye is received by a vast dreary waste descending far and wide composed of extensive ranges of hills and plains but from the woody spot where we stood through the whole unbounded distance there is not the least appearance of vegetation  farnham consists chiefly of one long thoroughfare street and is principally remarkable for its being the summerresidence of the bishop of winchester  farnhamcastle stands high and was formerly a fortress of considerable reputation it was built by a bishop of winchester in the time of king stephen when castles were much in fashion and made some figure in the troubled reign of that prince it afterward figured in the times of lewis the dauphin in the insurrections of the barons and in the civil wars of the last century during these last troubles it was blown up by sir william waller though not with that picturesque judgment with which many castles in those times were demolished very little is left that can make a pleasing picture after the restoration it deposited its military character and was changed again into an episcopal palace by bishop morley but it has ever since been neglected the present bishop is the first who has paid any attention for many generations to farnhamcastle he has greatly improved the house and has fitted it up in such a manner as will probably make it an object to every future bishop the keep or inner castle is left standing in its ruins and is still a curious piece of antiquity it is surrounded by a deep ditch which together with the area of the castle containing about two acres makes an excellent kitchengarden  behind the house extends a park about four miles in circumference which the bishop found as much neglected and out of order as the house itself it was cut with unlicensed paths the trees were mangled to browze the deer and a cricket ground had so long been suffered that the people conceived they had now a right to it this last was a great nuisance such a scene of riot and disorder with stands for selling liquor just under the castle windows could not easily be endured the bishop took the gentlest methods he could to remove the nuisance and at length though not without some difficulty got it effected  having thus removed nuisances from his park he began to embellish it he improved the surface he laid out handsome roads and walks he planted young trees and protected the old trees from farther ill usage  across the park runs an avenue a mile long of ancient elms the bishop could not persuade himself to remove this monument of antiquity and i think with great judgment has left it in its old form for though an avenue is neither a pleasing nor a picturesque arrangement of trees yet the grandeur of this gives it consequence and its connection with the antiquity of the castle gives it harmony here the poet after mourning the loss of other avenues may exult ye fallen avenues once more i mourn your fate unmerited once more rejoice that yet a remnant of your race survives   about a quarter of a mile from the house arises in the park an eminence on which stands a keepers lodge the situation is conspicuous but the object unpleasing a few acres therefore around it are enclosed a greenhouse is built to skreen the lodge and walks are cut and adorned with different kinds of curious shrubs in high perfection  from this eminence are several openings into the country particularly one toward moorpark where that enlightened genius sir william temple retiring in disgust from state affairs when charles iis politics received a tincture from france cultivated every part of literature with an elegance of taste uncommon at that day his heart lies buried according to his will in a silver urn under a dial in his garden a singularity of this kind in preferring a garden to a churchyard rather favors the opinion which bishop burnet gives us of temples religious sentiments  in most of the views from the park at farnhamcastle crooksburyhill is a distinguished feature which tradition says sir william temple always considered as one of the greatest ornaments of his place this shows his love for nature though in laying out his grounds the awkward idea of the times misled both his theory and practice  from the terrace before the castle the view is singular we overlooked the town of farnham and a tract of country which may properly be called the vale of hops for we saw nothing but ranges of that plant which was now in full leaf and made a curious though very unpleasing appearance the hop and the vine in a natural state are among the most picturesque plants their shoots their tendrils their leaves their fruit are all beautiful but in their cultured state they are perfect samples of regularity stiffness and uniformity which are of all ideas the most alien to every thing we wish in landscape  nothing shows so much the prejudice of names as the value fixed on farnham hops those produced in this parish sell at weyhill and all the great fairs at a considerably greater price than those which grow even in the next parish though divided only by a hedge to keep up this idea of excellence the farnham farmers agree every year on a secret mark which they affix to all their own bags the value of the hops spread under our eye from the terrace on which we stood was supposed to be at least ten thousand pounds  sect iv from farnham to alton the road passes through pleasant lanes holt forest occupying the left forms an agreeable woody horizon sometimes it breaks the line and advances a little nearer the eye but it generally keeps the same distance and runs along the higher grounds through the space of several miles but though it is higher than the neighboring country it is itself a tract of level land we rode through it and were much pleased with its woods and lawns  in the midst of it stands a house which formerly belonged to mr bilson leg a very extensive lawn is cleared before it interspersed with combinations of trees and though it is a perfect flat yet the line of its woody boundary being varied and removed to different distances by retiring woods the whole has a good effect which is not a little assisted by some handsome trees on the foreground  a flat if it be very extensive may convey a grand idea but when we have a small piece of flat ground to improve all we can do unless we vary its surface is to adorn it with wood surrounded with artful scenery as it is here it may form a landscape in which the eye may find great entertainment the water which adorns this lodge we thought but indifferently managed though we were told it was contrived by the late lord chatham  from alton to alresford and from thence to winchester we find little that excites attention the road is in general close till within a few miles of winchester where the downs begin to open they are heavy uninteresting swells of ground but as we proceeded farther we admired some of the intersections of their vast heaving forms and had at least the pleasure of surveying a large tract of country in its original state on which neither romans saxons danes nor britons seem to have made any impression more impression has been made on these downs within these last half dozen years than had been made before in as many centuries large portions of them are now enclosed and thrown into tillage   in a valley among these downs watered by a considerable stream lies winchester as we descend into it the great church and the kings house as it is called are capital features and give it an air of grandeur  the south side of the great church is a piece of heavy unadorned gothic but this was owing to accident formerly the buildings of a monastery covered this side of it and the architect william of wickham who could not foresee the dissolution of monasteries thought it of no consequence to adorn a part of his church which could never be seen but when the monastery was removed the defect became glaring  why the tower in the hands of so elegant an architect was left so ill proportioned is a question of surprise it certainly contributes to give the whole building an air of heaviness i doubt whether a spire was ever intended as it was not i believe among the gothic ornaments of that day  the inside however of this cathedral is very grand except about the transept where there seems to have been some awkward contrivance the nave which is three hundred feet in length is perhaps the most magnificent in england but it is injured by some monuments particularly that of the founder which trespass upon it they are placed between the pillars and bulge out into the middle aisle of the nave indeed i know not whether monuments at all in such churches as pride themselves on their architecture can in any shape be considered as ornamental the nave of westminsterabbey for instance is injured as a piece of architecture by the several monuments introduced into it which like spots of light in a picture injure the whole they break in upon its simplicity and grandeur thus too i doubt whether the introduction of monuments will be any advantage to st pauls i should fear they might injure the grandeur of the dome which the judicious architect had already adorned as much as he thought consistent with the sublimity of his idea in all cathedrals there are cloisters and other recesses which are the proper situations for monuments and even here every thing should not be admitted that comes under the name of a monument and pays the fee plain tablets may be allowed but when figures and ornaments are introduced they should be such as neither disgrace the sculptor nor the person whom he meant to honor it would be of great advantage also to class monuments as we hang pictures in a room with some view to symmetry and order and if different professions were ranged by themselves it would still make it more agreeable to examine them  the choir of winchester cathedral is greatly adorned but without any taste the love of ornament is one of the greatest sources of deformity and it is the more to be lamented as it is very expensive and very universal it prevails from the churchwarden who paints the pillars of his parish church blue and the capitals yellow to the artist who gilds and carves the choir of a cathedral a taste of this kind prevails here  in the first place the situation of the organ seems injudicious a view along the whole range of the church no doubt is grand but not i think of consequence to remove the organ into the awkward situation in which it now stands in the middle of one of the sides where it has no correspondent part besides an organ if judiciously adorned is a proper finishing to one end of the choir as the communion table and its appendages are to the other  the woodwork in the choir is elegant gothic but it is greatly injured by a blue band spangled with golden stars with which the ground behind it is adorned what the meaning of this strange conceit is i could not conjecture  but the decoration of the altarpiece is the most offensive the choir is separated from the chapels beyond it by a lofty screen the tabernacle work of this screen still remaining shows it to have been of the purest gothic it is divided into twelve compartments which are supposed to have held statues of the twelve apostles but these having been destroyed in the time of the civil wars each gothic niche is injudiciously filled with a roman urn  but the projection over the communion table is still more offensive it is a sort of penthouse hanging over the table and adorned with festoons of flowers they are said to have been carved by gibbons and probably were but all the elegant touches of his chisel are destroyed at hampton court at chatsworth and wherever we have the works of this master great care has been taken to preserve them in their original purity i believe not even a varnish has been suffered but here they are daubed all over with brown paint totally at variance with every thing around them and as if that were not enough they are also adorned with profuse gilding  inshrined amidst all this absurdity hangs wests picture of the resurrection of lazarus which is by no means in my opinion among the best works of this master the composition did not please me the whole is divided formally into three parts with too little connection among them jesus and his disciples stand on one side the spectators on the other lazarus and his sisters occupy the middle neither is the effect of light nor the harmony of the coloring more pleasing the coloring particularly which both the story and the situation of the picture required to be peculiarly modest is inharmoniously glaring the parts did not appear to more advantage than the whole there is but little of those passions and varied expression which the story is meant to excite in drawing mr west is acknowledged to be a perfect master but there is one thing in the picture which is particularly displeasing every painter should so far provide for the distant effect of his picture that no improper or disagreeable idea may be excited in the general view of it as you approach this picture without knowing what the subject is a figure at the foot of lazarus gives the whole too much the appearance of une femme accouchee  the skreen which separates the choir from the nave and the aisles is beautiful in itself but we are astonished that such an artist as inigo jones should not see the absurdity of adorning a gothic church with a grecian skreen the statues of james i and charles i however they come there would have been in themselves more pleasing if their unclassical insignia of crowns and sceptres had been removed  the kings house was built by sir christopher wren for charles ii it stands on the site of the old castle of winchester loftily overlooking the city and is i think a beautiful piece of architecture magnificent it certainly is extending in front above three hundred feet and if it had been completed in the grand style in which it was conceived with its lofty cupola and other appendages its gardens and parks laid out in ample space behind a noble bridge in front over the ditch and the street opened as was intended to the west end of the cathedral with which its front is parallel it would have been perhaps one of the grandest palaces in europe the death of charles put an end to the scheme it had afterward another chance of being completed having been settled on prince george of denmark if he had survived queen anne its last tenants were six thousand french prisoners from whose dilapidations it will not speedily recover it has since been much more respectably occupied by a body of emigrant french priests but is now i believe converted into a barrack   winchester was not only a regal seat in saxon times but one of the first towns in britain its history is full of curiosity and the antiquities with which it abounds confirm its history but among its antiquities i recollect no object of beauty except an old cross in the high street which is an exquisite piece of gothic architecture and shows that the artists of those days could adapt their ideas of proportion as well to works of miniature as of grandeur this little structure rises from a basement of half a dozen steps with curious open work in a pyramidal form it is ornamented in the richest manner but its ornaments are becoming because they are introduced with proportion uniformity and symmetry if the edges had been gilt and adorned with chinese bells it would have been ornamented in a taste something like that employed in the choir of the cathedral  sect v from winchester to salisbury the road still continues along downs the parts of which often fold beautifully over each other this sort of country though in itself unpicturesque affords a good study for a landscapepainter it gives him a few large masterly strokes and forms an outline which the imagination fills up about a mile short of stockbridge we had a good distance on the left  as we gain the higher grounds about two or three miles before we reach salisbury the lofty spire of the cathedral makes its first appearance and fixes the spot to which the road though devious will certainly carry us at last it is amusing to see a destined point before us as we come up to it by degrees it is amusing also to transfer our own motion to that of the object we approach it seems as the road winds to play with us showing itself here and there sometimes totally disappearing and then rising where we did not expect to find it but the most pleasing circumstance in approaching a grand object consists in its depositing by degrees its various tints of obscurity tinged at first with the hazy hue of distance the spire before us was but little distinguished from the objects of the vale but as it was much nearer than those objects it soon began to assume a deeper tint to break away from them and leave them behind as we get still nearer especially if a ray of sunshine happen to gild it the sharp touches on the pinnacles show the richness of its workmanship and it begins gradually to assume its real form  salisbury is a pleasant town with the sweet accommodation of a stream of limpid water running through every street but the only thing in it worth the attention of a picturesque eye is the great church and its appendages  salisbury cathedral is esteemed the only pure specimen we have of the early style of gothic architecture it marks the period when saxon heaviness began first to give way it wants those light and airy members which we find in the cathedrals of york canterbury lincoln and others of a later period but it possesses one beauty which few of them possess that of symmetry in all its parts the spire is esteemed the loftiest structure of the kind in england it is very light yet its great height especially when seen either from the east or west appears rather disproportioned and indeed on the whole i think no spire can be so pleasing an object as an elegant gothic tower the tower is capable of receiving all the beauties of gothic ornament those of many of our cathedrals indeed of many of our parish churches as of derby for instance are adorned with great elegance but the spire tapering to a point does not present a sufficient surface for ornament the bands round that of salisbury are rather a deformity nor do i see what gothic ornaments so tapering a surface is capable of receiving for which reason though a plain wellproportioned spire may happily adorn a neat parish church and make a picturesque object rising among woods or in the horizon i think it is not so well adapted to the rich style of a gothic cathedral and indeed succeeding architects as the gothic taste advanced in purity laid aside the spire and in general adopted the tower pinnacles which are purely gothic are very beautiful and for this reason the tower part or foundation of the spire at salisbury which is adorned with them is the only part of it that is interesting if instead of the spire something of a gothic dome or rich open work had been carried up a moderate height i think it would have been more beautiful as it is the chief idea seems to have been to carry stones higher into the air than they were ever carried before  the inside of salisbury cathedral is more beautiful than the outside the assemblage of its various parts so harmonious among themselves and its simple ornaments though of the rudest gothic are very pleasing  there is one beautiful circumstance in it which i remember not to have seen with so good an effect in any other cathedral except that of wells to the east end of the choir st marys chapel is attached and appears separated from it only by three large pointed open arches behind the communion table the internal part of the chapel with its east window and pillars seen through these arches gives the conjunct idea of space and perspective which is very pleasing  but this cathedral also though in itself a noble piece of architecture has been much injured by what is called beautifying the nave of the church and side aisles were painted as if they had been arched with brick nothing could be more absurd or disgusting the choir also was colored with three tints which had a bad effect if the whole had been washed with one uniform stonecolour the natural lights and shades would have been seen to more advantage the prebendal stalls also and the organ were all decorated in the same awkward manner the ceiling too was patched over with circles containing ugly figures of legendary saints and indeed the whole was a profusion of bad taste  to remove all this deformity and beautify the cathedral mr wyatt was engaged by the bishop and chapter and fully answered the expectation that was raised the figures on the roof are obliterated the whole is washed over with one uniform stonecolour and the ornaments of the bishops seat and the prebendal stalls are beautiful though rather perhaps in a style of later gothic than the rest of the church  across the middle of the choir from wall to wall just under the roof ran a massy beam eighty feet long and four feet square it was a very disgusting encumbrance but as it had rested there beyond the memory of man and was thought to bind the two walls together to prevent their spreading it had never been touched mr wyatt however examined it and being persuaded it had no connection with the walls ventured to remove it and has done it without any bad consequence it was supported in two or three places by scaffolding and the middle part being sawn and taken away the ends were easily removed  the next question was what should be done with the three large arches which open the view into st marys chapel should they be filled with tracerywork like the east windows of some cathedrals or should they be left open as they had always been the latter mode which was certainly the better was adopted tracerywork would have been out of place in this cathedral which was built before that mode of ornament was introduced besides a great beauty would have been lost which arises from a perspective view into the chapel  this question being settled another arose a very beautiful altarskreen was constructed out of the ornaments of a little chapel which had formerly been attached to the church and which mr wyatt found it necessary to remove the question was where should this skreen be placed some thought it might be placed best at the end of st marys chapel so that it might be seen to advantage through the arches which were to be left open entirely to the bottom in this case the communion table was to be moveable and to be brought forward into the choir only when it was wanted others were of opinion that the communion table should stand fixed where it had ever stood and the skreen which was a very low one should be placed just behind it so as merely to hide the bases of the pillars and the pavement of st marys chapel permitting at the same time a perspective view into it above the skreen the former of these opinions prevailed though some thought it might have been more proper and more in taste to have taken the latter it might have been more proper because it would have made a separation between the church and the chapel which is as desirable at one end as the separation made by the skreen and the organ between the choir and nave is at the other besides the communion table is a natural adjunct to the choir and could not be removed without making an improper break it might also be thought indecent by many people and give offense this separation might likewise have been more in taste because the eye not having so good a criterion of distance as would be afforded by seeing the bases of the pillars and pavement of the chapel would have conceived the distance to the eastwindow of the chapel greater than it really is so that the idea being thus in part curtailed would in fact have been enlarged it is an undoubted rule in painting that an exact delineation of a grand object injures its sublimity whatever is discretely left to the imagination is always improved these remarks however are founded only in theory and it is possible the skreen may have a better effect where it stands at present  the east window of st marys chapel is adorned with a picture of the resurrection in painted glass sir joshua reynolds gave the design in which though he had represented our savior rising he had left the tomb still closed and sealed the bishop remonstrated that he had given the fact contrary to the truth of scripture where it is said the seal was broken and the stone removed sir joshua however still persisted contending that by not breaking the seal he had made the miracle so much the greater and it was not without some difficulty that the bishop got him persuaded to correct his design the truth i suppose was sir joshua had not fully at first attended to the circumstances of the story and did not care to be at the trouble of altering his picture how far this window in the hands of so eminent a master may be beautiful i know not it was not finished when i was last at salisbury but if it be not better than the other eastwindow given by lord radnor which is esteemed good in its kind it will in my judgment be a disagreeable ornament indeed if colors cannot be better blended on glass and harmonized than i ever saw them i own i should never wish to see an historical subject painted in this way the gloom of a painted window in an old cathedral is pleasing but i should desire only ornamental scrawls the best painted windows i remember to have seen were i believe in the chapel at magdalen college in oxford they are single figures and only in clair obscure they are the best because they are the least glaring  the choir of salisbury cathedral thus improved under the able hands of mr wyatt is now one of the most beautiful pieces of gothic architecture in england the deformities of the nave and grand aisles i fear will not soon be removed as there is a deficiency in the fund but they greatly call for improvement  adjoining to the church is a square cloister opening into a chapter house in abbeys we suppose the cloister was a place for the monks to enjoy exercise under cover but from the connection of this cloister with the chapter house we are led to imagine it was intended also as a place for tenants and suitors to wait under shelter till each was called into the chapter house to settle his respective business the chapter house and cloisters are in the same way connected at gloucester and may probably be so in other cathedrals  the cloister and the chapter house at salisbury belong to an age of much better taste in architecture than that of the cathedral itself they are both of very pure and elegant gothic the former is a light airy square of about forty feet on each side the latter is an octagon of fifty feet in diameter with a pointed roof supported by a light column rather perhaps too light in the center nothing in architecture i think can be more pleasing than these buildings nor does any thing militate so much against a servile attachment to the five orders the greek and roman architecture no doubt possess great beauty but why should we suppose them to possess all beauty if men were left to their own genius and invention as the founders of the gothic probably were we might it is true have many absurd compositions which we have even now but we should certainly have greater variety and amidst that variety no doubt several new and elegant models but the five orders have drawn the art so much to themselves that it would be heresy in architecture to oppose their canons  rules we allow must confine every art but what rules are necessary to confine architecture except those of utility symmetry proportion and simplicity utility respects the purposes for which an edifice is raised symmetry the general purity and sameness of the style proportion the relation of parts simplicity the modesty and propriety of ornaments i know not in which of these requisites the gothic does not equal the roman if in any it may be thought to fail it is in the ornamental part  in what taste the private buildings of those times were constructed when gothic architecture was in its splendour we know not it is probable they were not designed by the eminent professors of the art but by low mechanics according to every mans humor without rule or knowledge many of them no doubt were inconvenient enough as well as wretchedly adorned but in the public buildings of those times there is generally such propriety of ornament that is each ornamental member arises so naturally from the building itself and is so much of a piece with it which seems to be all we wish in ornament that in the best specimens of gothic architecture the eye is no where offended or called aside by the contention of parts but examines all whole and parts together in one general view in the interior perhaps the gothic architect is commonly more chaste than in the exterior in which he allows himself more to wanton and indeed seems to have had a worse choice of proper ornaments but in our best compositions the outside as well as the inside is highly beautiful for myself i freely own i am as much struck with the cathedral of york or with this cloister and chapter house covered as they are with ornaments as with the noble simplicity of the cathedral of st pauls each style is beautiful  but in comparing the gothic and grecian ornaments in architecture the comparison holds merely with regard to such ornaments as are fanciful and ideal in portraying or combining such ornaments as have nature for their original either in human or in animal life the gothic sculptor is in general miserably deficient he had little knowledge of nature in forming and less of art in combining and yet he is often offending with some gross representation of this kind  in the chapter house at salisbury for instance which gave occasion to these remarks amidst all that beautiful profusion of fancied ornaments so elegant in themselves and so well adapted to the building to which they are applied there is likewise a great profusion of historical sculpture the several sides of the room are divided into stalls for the members of the church i believe there are not fewer than fifty and the little angular divisions between the stalls are adorned with basrelief as gothic workmanship it is not bad though it is very inferior to roman or modern sculpture there is no idea either of grace or taste or even of proportion in the figures themselves nor in the mode of combining them they all represent scripture stories some of which are very illmanaged in the story of noah two beasts are looking out of a window in the ark sufficient to load it and noah himself praying at the poop is sufficient to sink it after the civil wars the parliament commissioners sat in this chapter house and have left behind them marks of their rough ideas of religion at this sculpture they seem to have taken particular offense and have hacked it miserably they began as they entered on the left and for a while erased every thing before them but they seem to have grown tired as they proceeded in their work the middle part therefore is but little injured and the figures on the right are perfect if however the inside of this elegant building were washed over with one uniform stonecolour the sculpture obtrudes itself so little on the eye that bad as it is it might easily pass unobserved both the cloister and chapter house are in so decaying a state that it would require a great sum to restore them though there is now in the library an estimate given in about an hundred years ago from which it appears that the whole might then have been completely repaired for   0 l it appears also from another paper in the library of ancient date that the cathedral cost   000 marks in building about twenty eight thousand pounds which is a much larger sum than we should have supposed it could have cost at that early day  near the cathedral stands the bishops palace which till very lately was one of the most gloomy mansions that can well be imagined it was a large incumbered house with about a dozen acres of flat ground by way of garden lying behind it this garden was bisected with a broad canal and confined within an embattled wall such an assemblage of awkward circumstances are not often united  the present bishop of salisbury bishop barrington has at great expense entirely newmodelled this gloomy palace he has altered the rooms enlarged the windows made a new entrance and given a new appearance to the whole place one great and very expensive improvement was to arch over a wide drain which was carried along the whole backfront of the palace it was passed at different places by two or three bridges and was such a nuisance that we are surprised it had been suffered so long  as to the flat grounds which were bisected with the canal laid out in vistas and circumscribed by an embattled wall it was impossible to do more than to remove a few of the formalities of the place and carry a neat gravel walk round it which near the house plays among a few irregular plantations  but one improvement he has introduced which adds a grandeur to the garden beyond what any episcopal seat in england can boast he has brought the cathedral into it in one of its most pleasing points of perspective between the palace and the cathedral ran formerly a wall which included a piece of ground belonging to the bishops of salisbury and used as a kitchengarden  this wall and the kitchengarden bishop barrington has removed and has not only obtained a noble object but he has exchanged the disagreeable appearance of a long straight wall for a very grand boundary to his garden the cloister and chapter house are the parts immediately introduced whose several abutments and projections are pleasing circumstances from these rises the body of the cathedral and the spire having here a larger base appears more in proportion  about a mile from salisbury old sarum formerly stood its situation and establishment were both very singular  imagine the ridge of a hill falling into a plain from the end of which a part having been artificially separated forms a round knoll of about two thousand feet in diameter cooped within this narrow compass stood on a still higher knoll in the center a formidable castle and just below it a cathedral here also stood the bishops palace together with the houses of his chapter and the whole was surrounded with immense ditches and ramparts which strike us with astonishment even at this day  so close a union between a castle and a cathedral insulated as they were and seated so loftily must have made a very singular appearance though probably they never had much picturesque beauty  many retainers no doubt there were on so large a foundation but it does not appear that any houses except those of the chapter were admitted within the precincts of the fortress other appendages seem to have been placed as a suburb under its walls  here the bishops of salisbury lived like temporal princes till king stephen suspecting the bishop of that day was attached to the empress maud dispossessed him of his castle of sarum together with two other castles which he held one at sherborn from whence the sea had been removed by william i and the other at the devizes  the castle of sarum was given to a norman earl who held a garrison in it for the king  this became matter of continual contest the clergy and the garrison were at constant variance once the bishop and his clergy returning from a procession found the gates shut against them  wearied at length by repeated insults they complained to the pope and at length got a dispensation to remove the sea of salisbury to its present situation this was soon found to be so very convenient in comparison of the old one that it drew the inhabitants of old sarum by degrees after it the castle was left by itself and in a few years it also was deserted and old sarum became only a heap of ruins but these ruins deserted as they are preserve a substantial proof of their ancient dignity in being represented by two members in parliament  sect vi from salisbury our first excursion was to longford castle the seat of the earl of radnor it was built about the time of james the first on a danish model probably by some architect who came into england with the queen its form is triangular with a round tower at each corner which gives it a singular appearance it stands in a vale which approaches nearly to a flat as the avon which passes through the garden does to stagnation longford castle therefore borrows little from its situation all its beauty is the result of art which cannot rise beyond what may be called pleasing but the principal objects here are the pictures the whole collection is good the following we thought some of the best  a return from the chase by teniers the composition of this master is rarely so good as it is here his coloring is always pleasing  a boy by rubens  peter de jodes family by vandyck the heads in this picture are perfect copies from nature  a view of tivoli  a landscape by hobima the composition the light and the execution in this picture are all good  tobias by spagniolet  two pictures by poussin in these as in many of this masters works there is a great deficiency in point of general effect but the classical spirit in which they are painted with the pure taste of design and correctness in the parts will always give value to the works of poussin these i think are executed with a firmer pencil and more spirited touch than most of his works  a landscape by ruysdaal  two small paintings by callot it is surprising with what smart touches this master enlivens his figures his pictures have all the spirit and precision of his etchings  but the two most admired pictures in this collection are two landscapes by claude which exhibit the rise and decline of the roman empire in a pleasing allegory the former is represented by a sunrise and the landing of eneas in italy the latter by a sunset and several roman buildings in ruin nothing can exceed the coloring of both these pictures the hazy light of a rising sun and the glowing radiance of a setting one are exactly copied from nature and therefore nicely distinguished an eye accurate in the effects of nature will easily discern with which species of light the summit of the wave or the edge of the battlement is tipped and yet claude has in none of his pictures that i have seen discriminated the shadows of the morning which are certainly much darker than those of the evening he does not indeed appear to have marked the difference between them nor do we observe that painters in general are more accurate now and then with nature before him claude possibly may give a morningshadow its character but when an effect is very rare it appears to be the result of imitation rather than of principle  with regard to aerial landscape claude excelled all masters we are at a loss whether to admire more the simplicity or the effect of his distances  but when we have bestowed this commendation on him we have summed up his merit it all lay in coloring we rarely find an instance of good composition in any of his pictures and still more rarely an exhibition of any grand scene or appearance of nature as he lived in italy he had frequent opportunities of seeing much sublime scenery but as it seldom struck him we cannot help inferring that his genius was not sublime if a dutch master who has seen nothing but a flat country introduces neither rocks nor cascades nor the sloping sides of hills into his pictures it is no wonder but if a painter who has studied among the alps and appennines rejects them it is evident that he has no taste for this species of scenery claude and salvator received or might have received their ideas from the same archetypes they were both italian painters but claude studied in the campagna of rome salvator among the mountains of calabria while the one therefore admired the tamer beauties of nature the other caught fire and rose to the sublime i do not mean to insinuate that claude painted like a dutchman but only that his genius was less sublime than salvators it is true the objects he painted are of the grand species he saw no other but as he seldom made the best use of them by bringing them forward and producing grand effects it is plain he saw them with indifference and we conclude it was much the same to him whether he painted by the side of a stagnant canal at harlem or under the fall of a cascade at tivoli in short he seems to have had a knack of coloring certain objects skies and distances in particular and this is accounted for by his residing chiefly in the campagna  as to his figures and foregrounds if they do not disgust the eye it is all we expect his buildings too are often unpleasing and incumbered and seem calculated rather to show his skill in architecture than in the production of picturesque beauty  it is saying however much in favor of claude that he had been bred a pastrycook and that if he did not do all that might have been done he did much more than could have been expected  sect vii our next expedition from salisbury was to stonehenge and wilton  stonehenge at a distance appeared only a diminutive object standing on so vast an area as salisbury plain it was lost in the immensity around it as we approached it gained more respect and we could now trace a large ditch round the whole confined within a gentle mound but when we arrived on the spot it appeared astonishing beyond conception a train of wondering ideas immediately crowded into the mind who brought these huge masses of rock together whence were they brought for what purpose by what machines were they drawn or by what mechanic powers erected  many have attempted to solve such questions as these but none have gone farther than conjecture even the very purpose for which these stones were brought together is not sufficiently ascertained mr walpole remarks that whoever has examined this monument has ascribed it to that class of antiquity of which he himself was most fond this was at least the case of the celebrated inigo jones on his return from italy having nothing but italian architecture in his head he found out that stonehenge was a roman ruin  many idle things no doubt have been written on this subject it is a happy field for conjecture on the whole perhaps the laborious inquiries of dr stukeley have been attended with the most success for though neither he nor any man could answer all the inquiries which curiosity is apt to make on this subject yet he seems to have contributed more toward a just idea of this wonderful monument than any other antiquarian he has gone upon principle he has traced it by its measures and other data into druid times and as far as appears conviction follows his researches in his long discussion he may in some parts be whimsical and in many certainly tedious but allowances should be made for a man full of his subject who of course will see many things which he supposes to be of consequence and which he cannot in few words make apparent to others  of these stones there are an hundred and forty and by calculation it appears that each of the largest of them would require the strength of an hundred and fifty oxen to move it  the outer circle has been formed by a combination of two uprights and an impost yet each combination of these three stones is detached and without any connection with the rest except that of coinciding in the form of a circle many of these uprights still remain but only five with the imposts annexed  the inner circle never had any imposts but consisted only of upright stones ten of these are still standing out of forty of which the original number is supposed to have consisted  besides these circles there are some internal parts formed of stones placed eliptically some of which also have had imposts these dr stukeley conceives to have been the recesses of the priests in this part of the circle also is placed a stone which he supposes to have been an altar  rough as all this work appears now to be after having been exposed to the storms of two thousand winters it has been originally constructed wlth wonderful art all the stones seem to have been chiseled on the inside especially with great care and the imposts have all been let into the uprights by mortices and tenons very curiously wrought  but it is not the elegance of the work but the grandeur of the idea that strikes us the walk between the two circles which is a circumference of three hundred feet is awfully magnificent at least it would have been so if the monument had been entire to be immured as it were by such hideous walls of rock and to see the landscape and the sky through such strange apertures must have thrown the imagination into a wonderful ferment the druid though savage in his nature had the sublimest ideas of the object of his worship whatever it was he always worshipped under the canopy of the sky and could not bear the idea of a roof between him and heaven i have known the idea sometimes taken up by pious christians who have confessed they found their minds most expanded when they worshipped in the open air  stonehenge is supposed to be the grandest structure of the kind that exists we meet with many other druidical remains of this form though of inferior size but i have somewhere heard of one in france inferior indeed to stonehenge in magnificence but superior to it in elegant construction the imposts uniting with each other form one continued circle of stone on the top of the uprights which makes a more pleasing appearance than stonehenge where each impost resting on two uprights stands detached from its neighbor  wonderful however as stonehenge is and plainly discovering that the mind which conceived it was familiar with great ideas it is totally void though in a ruinous state of every idea of picturesque beauty and i should suppose was still more so in its perfect one we walked round it examined it on every side and endeavored to take a perspective view of it but in vain the stones are so uncouthly placed that we found it was impossible to form them from any stand into a pleasing shape  besides these stones there are others of immense size in different parts of the island though none i believe so large near boroughbridge two or three of the largest are found which are known by the name of the devils arrows  volney in his travels through syria mentions three stones of white granite among the ruins of balbeck each of which was twelve feet thick and which together extended above fiftyeight yards and in an adjacent quarry he found a stone lying half chiseled which was sixtynine feet long and in breadth and thickness about thirteen it was probably too large to be carried from the spot vol ii p       about two miles from dol in bretagne in the middle of an orchard mr wraxall tells us there is a single stone fixed in the earth of a conic form which is about fortyfive feet high and nearly as many broad it had long puzzled the antiquarians of the country and gave rise to various conjectures some of them however endeavored to get at its foundation there they found it was really a natural production being fixed to a stratum of solid rock several feet below the surface tour through france p      the plain on which stonehenge stands is in the same style of greatness as the temple that adorns it it extends many miles in all directions in some not less than fifty an eye unversed in these objects is filled with astonishment in viewing waste after waste rising out of each new horizon  such appears the spacious plain of sarum spread like oceans boundless round where solitary stonehenge gray with moss ruin of ages nods  the ground is spread indeed as the poet observes like the ocean but it is like the ocean after a storm it is continually heaving in large swells through all this vast district scarce a cottage or even a bush appears if you approach within two or three miles of the edge of the plain you see like the mariner within soundings land at a distance houses trees and villages but all around is waste  regions like this which have come down to us rude and untouched from the beginning of time fill the mind with grand conceptions far beyond the efforts of art and cultivation impressed by such views of nature our ancestors worshipped the god of nature in these boundless scenes which gave them the highest conceptions of eternity such were the grand ideas of the patriarch as he ranged the wide regions of the east and set up his monumental pile not adorned with vases or statues but a mound of earth a rude pillar which he called gods house or some vast heap of stones of a fabric firm as the ground on which it stood like this before us which has seen in succession the ruins of innumerable works of art and will probably remain undiminished till the end of time  all the plain at least that part of it near stonehenge is one vast cemetary every where as we passed we saw tumuli or barrows as they are called rising on each hand these little mounds of earth are more curiously and elegantly shaped than any of the kind i remember elsewhere to have seen they commonly rise in the form of bells and each of them has a neat trench fashioned round its base though in their forms and in the ornamental circles at their bases some appear to be of more distinguished workmanship they are of various sizes sometimes of thirty sometimes of forty or fifty yards in diameter from many places we counted above an hundred of them at once sometimes as if huddled together without any design in other places rising in a kind of order by the rays of a setting sun the distant barrows are most conspicuously seen every little summit being tipped with a splendid light while the plain is in shadow is at that time easily distinguished most of them are placed on the more elevated parts of the plain and generally in sight of the great temple that they are mansions of the dead is undoubted many of them having been opened and found to cover the bones both of men and beasts the latter of which were probably sacrificed at the funeral we suppose also that some of them contained the promiscuous ashes of a multitude as virgil describes them   confusae ingentem caedis acervum nec numero nec honor cremant tunc undique vasti certatim crebris collucent ignibus agri tertia lux gelidam coelo dimoverat umbram moerentes altum cinerem et confusa ruebant ossa focis tepidoque onerabant aggere terrae indeed this mode of burial as the most honorable seems to have been dictated by the voice of nature we meet with it in homer we meet with it in herodotus the vestiges of it are found on the vast plains of tartary and even among the savages of guinea  that we do not ascribe more antiquity to these temples and cemetaries than rightly belongs to them the antiquarian has shown by many learned arguments i shall subjoin another of classic origin from which it will appear probable that the furniture of these vast plains was exactly the same in caesars days as it is now  that chief in the first book of his commentaries describing the place which was agreed on to be the scene of conference between him and ariovistus tells us it was an extensive plain in which was a large artificial mount planities erat magna et in ea tumulus terreus satis grandis i translate terreus by the word artificial because it certainly implies something factitious no correct writer speaking of a natural hill would use such an epithet it would be a mere redundancy and just as improper as if he had said planities erat magna terrea but in describing an artificial mount it is certainly proper because such a mount might have been constructed of other materials besides earth  that caesars tumulus was intended also as a memorial for the dead is probable from the common use of the word tumulus especially when accompanied with the epithet terreus for we know no other use for which these tumuli terrei or artificial mounts were constructed but that of being memorials of the dead and for this use we know they certainly were constructed we find aeneas likewise haranguing his troops from a tomb of this kind  socios in caetum littore ab omni advocat aeneas tumulique ex aggere fatur  having thus settled caesars tumulus terreus to have been a barrow and knowing also from him that the druids frequented gaul we are led to believe that his planities magna and salisbury plain were places of the same kind both of them most probably druid scenes caesar indeed mentions but one tumulus on his plain but as he was describing only a particular spot not the general scene we may easily suppose there might be many other barrows and perhaps a stonehenge also in the neighborhood of it  it is probable also as caesar tells us the druid discipline was carried originally into gaul from britain which was the great source of druidlearning disciplina haec in britannia reperta atque inde in galliam translata esse existimatur et nunc qui diligentius eam rem cognoscere volunt plerumque illo discendi causa proficiscuntur lib iv  that salisbury plain might have been a scene of great antiquity many years before the time of caesar  though salisbury plain in druid times was probably a very busy scene we now find it wholly uninhabited here and there we meet a flock of sheep scattered over the side of some rising ground and a shepherd with his dog attending them or perhaps we may descry some solitary wagon winding round a distant hill but the only resident inhabitant of this vast waste is the bustard this bird which is the largest fowl we have in england is fond of all extensive plains and is found on several but these are supposed to be his principal haunt here he breeds and here he spends his summerday feeding with his mate on juicy berries and the large dewworms of the heath as winter approaches he forms into society fifty or sixty have been sometimes seen together  as the bustard leads his life in these unfrequented wilds and studiously avoids the haunts of men the appearance of any thing in motion though at a considerable distance alarms him i know not that he is protected like the partridge and pheasant by any law but his own vigilance is a better security to him than an act of parliament as he is so noble a prize his flesh so delicate and the quantity of it so large he is of course frequently the object of the fowlers stratagems but his caution is generally a protection against them all the scene he frequents affords neither tree to shelter nor hedge to skreen an enemy and he is so tall that when he raises his neck to take a perspective view his eye circumscribes a very wide horizon all open attempts therefore against him are fruitless the fowlers most promising stratagem is to conceal himself in a wagon the west country wagons periodically traveling these regions are objects to which the bustard is most accustomed and though he retires at their approach he retires with less evident signs of alarm than from any thing else it is possible therefore if the fowler lie close in such a concealment and with a long barrelled gun can direct a good aim he may make a lucky shot sometimes also he slips from the tail of a wagon a couple of swift greyhounds they soon come up with the bustard though he runs well and if they can contrive to reach him just as he is on the point of taking wing an operation which he performs with less expedition than is requisite in such critical circumstances they may perhaps seize him  some encroachments have been made by the plough within these few years upon salisbury plain but these inroads though considerable in themselves bear little proportion to the vastness of these downy grounds the plough is a heavy invader and its perseverance only can produce a visible effect in so vast a scene  another reason also may operate powerfully in preserving these wide domains in a state of nature the soil is in most places very shallow not above five or six inches above a rock of chalk and as the tillage of two or three years exhausts it without more expense than the land will answer it has been thought but ill husbandry to destroy a good sheepwalk for a bad piece of arable land  but though salisbury plain is a remarkable scene in england it is nothing in comparison of many scenes of this kind on the face of the globe in which the eye is carried if i may so phrase it out of sight where an extent of land flat like the ocean melts gradually into the horizon such are many parts of poland and tartary the plains of yedesan on the borders of bessarabia are among the most extraordinary baron de tott describes them on his journey to the cham of tartary as so immense that he tells us somewhat i think hyperbolically the piercing eyes of the tartars who rode before him could distinguish the heads of the horsemen in the horizon when the convexity of the earth hid the rest of their bodies his description is more natural afterward when he says he saw the sun rise and set on these plains as navigators do at sea their singularity consists both in their vastness and in certain regular valleys which bisect them these valleys are distant from each other about ten or twelve leagues and run in parallel lines across the plain they are totally void of the usual ornaments of our valleys variety of ground a foaming rivulet and woody banks they are mere trenches cut out by nature about twenty yards deep and sometimes a quarter of a mile broad so that as you traverse the plain the eye passes over them like sunk fences and all appears one boundless waste through the middle of each of these valleys is a muddy rivulet and as there is no elevation of ground it is almost stagnant the course of these rivulets such as it is leads from north to south and at the end of the plain they form small lakes which communicate with the black sea in these valleys the tartars of yedesan fix their tents while their numerous herds of horses oxen dromedaries and sheep graze the plains these herds are continually wandering from home in summer especially the larger kinds and the chief employment of the tartar is to gallop about in quest of them he takes a quantity of roasted millet in a bag mounts his horse and rides till sunset then if he find not what he sought he clogs his horse and leaves it to graze and as he is always at home he sups wraps himself in his cloak and sleeps till morning when he begins his search again having given this general account of the plains of yedesan baron tott speaks of his first days journey over them the conclusion of it was the nearest valley at about ten leagues distance the sun was now setting and after a long journey i still saw nothing before me says he but a vast melancholy plain when i suddenly felt my carriage descend and looking out i saw a range of tents extending to the right and left we crossed a rivulet over a bad bridge and found three tents on the other side out of the line one of which was intended for me it was a kind of large hencoop constructed in a circular form with a sort of dome opening at the top and was covered with a felt of camels hair the paling was connected by slips of raw hides and finished with great strength and delicacy see memoirs of baron de tott vol i p      but of all the plains of which we meet with any account those of the deserts of arabia are the most forbidding perhaps no part of the globe of equal circumference is so totally destitute of natures bounty and of every kind of vegetable furniture  the whole a wild expanse of lifeless sand and sky the tartarean plains just described are bisected with streams and valleys such as they are covered with herbage but the barrenness of the arabian plain in no part intermits the tents horses and camels of the caravan to which the traveller is attached are the only objects he sees if he should fix one end of an immense cord at these tents the other might be carried round along the rim of a boundless horizon without sweeping over any inequality all this vast circle is covered with gray sand like the ashes of a furnace over all hangs the canopy of heaven undiversified by a single cloud to break the rays of a scorching sun while a breeze if it can be called such glowing with heat often fills the air with clouds of overwhelming dust or totally destroys its vital spring  breathed hot from all the boundless furnace of the sky and the wide glittering waste of burning sand a suffocating wind the pilgrim smites with instant death patient of thirst and toil son of the desert even the camel feels shot through his withered heart the fiery blast in the mean time a universal silence reigns over the whole vast scene none of the cheerful sounds of nature are heard neither of beast nor of bird nor even of humming insect all is still as night with such a country as this moses threatens the people of israel on their disobedience the heaven that is over thy head shall be brass and the earth that is under thee shall be iron the lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust from heaven shall it come down upon thee till thou be destroyed deuteronomy xxviii         there is however an appearance in these deserts taken notice of by sir john chardin which is rather picturesque a splendour or vapor is sometimes formed by the repercussion of the rays of the sun from the sand which seems at a distance a vast lake but as the thirsty traveller approaches in hopes of finding water it retires before him or totally disappears sir j chardins mss as quoted by harmer  q curtius takes notice of the same effect in one of the marches of alexander  thus we see how differently nature works up the same modes of scenery and there is great amusement in bringing these several scenes together and in following her steps through all her similar but varied operations  sect viii having satisfied our curiosity on salisbury plain and performed the due rites at stonehenge by pacing its dimensions and counting the stones we proceeded to wilton the point of salisbury spire just emerging from the horizon guided us across the open country and as we got into the more cultivated part we turned out of the salisbury road and fell down into wilton which lies in a vale on the edge of the plain we cannot expect a very beautiful scene in the neighborhood of such a waste natures transitions are generally gradual the true picturesque vale is rarely found in any country but a mountainous one great plenty of wood and water however give an agreeable air to the vale of wilton  wilton was once the capital of all this country to which it gave its name but salisbury drawing old sarum within its vortex drew wilton also at present this village is chiefly remarkable for the splendid palace of the earls of pembroke  wiltonhouse was formerly an abbey and felt the full weight of the inquisition set on foot in the reign of henry the eighth the ladies of wiltonabbey were accused of too great an intimacy with the monks of a neighboring house stories of this kind were listened to at the time of the dissolution with great attention though often perhaps void of any foundation both houses however fell together and the demesnes of wilton were given to the pembroke family in whose hands they still continue the earl of that day began immediately to turn the abbey into a mansion but the plan was not completed in its present state till late in the reign of charles i the gardenfront by inigo jones is admired by all judges of architecture the portico boasts the hand of hans holbein there are some things however yet wanting to give the house an air of magnificence the entrance is particularly awkward and incumbered since this was written it has been altered   as the morning threatened rain we thought it better to take a view of the garden before we entered the house it occupies the center of a wide valley adorned with a river this river was fashioned by the conductors of taste in the last age into an immense canal it is now changed again into an irregular piece of water but though its banks are decorated with rich gardenscenes it still retains enough of formality to suggest the old idea it forms however the grandest view in the garden salisbury church comes in very happily as an object at the bottom of it and is of sufficient magnitude to show that it was not constructed for the purpose  gardenscenes are never picturesque they want the bold roughness of nature a principal beauty in our gardens as mr walpole justly observes is the smoothness of the turf but in a picture this becomes a dead and uniform spot incapable of light and shade and must be broken insipidly by children dogs and other unmeaning figures  that is i suppose mr walpole means by such figures as commonly frequent gardenscenes which are of all others the most unpicturesque and yet i have been informed that mr b wilson made a good landscape even of this scene he took it however from that end which is nearest to salisbury where he got a rougher foreground than he could find in the garden in a distance he might more easily disguise a gardenscene  opposite to the house the river willy enters the canal it is a river only of small dimensions but over it is thrown a magnificent palladian bridge  i have sometimes thought the palladian bridge may be considered as a species of bombast in architecture it is like expressing a plain sentiment in a pompous phrase merely to pass a trifling stream a plank with a simple rail is sufficient and in a pastoral scene it is all you require in such a scene as this indeed a simple plank would be out of place you are composing in heroics but a certain species of simplicity is required even here and as in all literary compositions turgid expressions offend why should they not offend in every mode of composition here we allow a handsome bridge is necessary but why more than a bridge what have pillars  walls  pediments  and roofs to do with a bridge a bridge in itself is one of the most beautiful of artificial objects but dressed in this bombast style it offends it offends at least the simplicity of a picturesque eye if you want a cool airy building to receive the refreshment of a summer breeze as it passes over the lake erect one in some proper place and if it be well disposed nobody can take offense but let it stand for what it is do not leave people in doubt whether it is a house or a bridge by uniting modes of architecture which are in themselves distinct and giving one the ornaments that belong to another from these criticisms we except such bridges as are situated like the rialto at venice which connecting the parts of a large city may be allowed to assume a correspondent air of grandeur and may with propriety even be covered with a roof but here no such accommodation is necessary and what is unnecessary is always affected  from the palladian bridge and banks of the river the ground rises beautifully consisting of a hanging lawn encompassed with wood which is broken into pleasing parts but here though in sight of the palladian bridge we have another ornament full as much out of place as the other was out of form  on the summit of the hill is erected a triumphal arch with marcus aurelius mounted on horseback on the top of it  now if we only recollect the intention of a triumphal arch we shall see how grotesquely such a fabric is erected here  when a roman general triumphed it was the custom to raise these arches through which the procession passed to the city and they were sometimes constructed and adorned in a very magnificent manner and left as memorials of the great event on which they were at first erected all this was noble and admirably adapted to the intended purpose but we have here a triumphal arch set upon the top of a hill totally unconnected with any thing near it a triumphal arch would be perhaps too pompous a structure to form a part of the approach to the house yet in that capacity it might have been suffered it might have had some analogy at least to its situation but as it now stands however good it may be in itself it is certainly an absurd ostentatious ornament  the rain coming on obliged us to leave the rest of the garden unseen and drove us into the house it prevented also our seeing the stables which are very grand and what we still regretted more a row of cedars of libanon which are esteemed the finest in england we saw them afterward from the windows of the house but probably to some disadvantage as they did not answer the expectations we had formed of them  the grand collection of statues in wiltonhouse entitle it very deservedly to the attention of every traveller when we enter the great hall we are struck with the profusion of them  at the first view of such a collection it becomes matter of wonder how italy can be so inexhaustible a fund of ancient statues besides their peopling all the palaces of that country there is not a cabinet in europe which is not more or less inhabited by them all come from italy italy has been supplying the curious with antiques for many centuries and they who have money may buy antiques in italy still  the wonder will in some degree subside when we consider the rage for sculpture which possessed the ancient romans statues were the chief ornaments of old rome and had for ages been collected there by all ranks of people  the conquest of greece brought them first into repute as they became more admired praetors and proconsuls made them every where the objects of rapine not only greece but the aegean isles asia and egypt were pillaged statues bassreliefs busts pillars every thing that could be severed from the buildings to which they belonged were swept away to rome temples baths porticoes and other public places were first adorned the conquered provinces could not supply the demand artists were called from greece parian marble was imported and statues were erected to the gods and heroes of rome as had been erected before to those of greece  italusque paterque sabinus vitisator curvam servans sub imagine falcem saturnusque senex janique bifrontis imago vestibulo adstabant aliique ab origin reges martia qui ob patriam pugnando vulnera passi the rage for these beautiful ornaments next seized private persons every one who had a consular or a praetorian ancestor wished to see him erected in brass or marble till at length it became as common in rome to have a likeness taken by a statuary as it is in london to have one taken by a portrait painter artists no doubt there were of all kinds and prices adapted to every rank the mechanic therefore as well as the senator might see his house adorned with himself his wife and his family all sculptured to the life in stone many of these ignoble statues might in length of time deposit their plebeian forms and visit foreign countries as scipios caesars and octavias it is not every connoisseur who can detect them by their garb  from what has been observed we may easily judge what an inexhaustible fund of antiques rome and its colonies for the rage spread over all the neighboring parts of italy might produce quantities no doubt of these works are still laid up in those magazines of ruin and rubbish which goths and other barbarous invaders have heaped upon them  the statues busts and bassreliefs which we now survey were chiefly collected by the cardinals mazarin and richlieu and the earl of arundel in charles the firsts time additions have been made since some i have been told were presented by one of the dukes of tuscany to whom an earl of pembroke had shown particular civilities during his stay in england the collection no doubt is very magnificent one of the first perhaps in europe if we except royal and classic ground and many of its contents are excellent pieces of art in general however they may be classed as martial classes his epigrams into good bad and indifferent it is impossible that in so numerous a collection the whole can be valuable in many of those however which are indifferent some of the parts may be good and afford useful studies  among the busts which struck us most on the transient view we were able to give them were those of miltiades  hannibal  pindar  adrian  cleopatra the sister of alexander   lepidus  sophocles  pompey  nerva  labienus parthicus  semiramis  marcellus the younger  metellus imberbis  diana  lucan  caracalla  alcibiades  cecrops  vitellius  and galba pyrrhus of epire is particularly fine the air of this bust is very noble and is impressed with the whole character of the hero a collossean bust too of alexander the great is striking but the head seems rather too long probably it might be covered though i do not recollect the circumstance with a grecian helmet if so the headpiece and visor connected without a joint when thrown back would make the head too long by the addition of the length of the face  among the altorelievos we admired two cupids  curtius  saturn  some boys eating grapes  ulysses in the cave of calypso  saturn crowning the arts  cupid sucking venus  the story of claelia  silenus on his ass   galataea  cupids and boys  a boy on a seahorse  a victory the composition of which is very good  a priestess sacrificing in which the animals are particularly fine  a nuptial vase both the form and sculpture of which are elegant  among the statues we thought the best were  a small meleager  an amazonian queen less than the life the attitude and expression of which are both excellent  a dying hercules part of this group is good particularly the expression of pean but the principal figure though in miniature is monstrous and the character is unpleasing  a colossean hercules  saturn holding a child  the father of julius caesar the attitude of this figure is very noble  mark anthony the attitude of this too is admirable  venus holding a vase this figure if looked at on the side opposite the vase is pleasing but on the other side it is awkward  a naiad the upper part of which is beautiful  apollo in the stonehall the body is better than the hands  cleopatra and caesarion are esteemed we did not see much merit in them there is at least no feminine beauty in cleopatra the pillar too in the outward court may here be mentioned the whole of which has an elegant appearance and the statue is beautiful  it is not easy to avoid remarking that these antiques might possibly have been arranged in a more judicious manner the apartments of a noble house should not suffer their ornaments to obtrude foremost upon the eye each apartment should preserve its own dignity to which the ornamental part should be subordinate in every work of art and indeed of nature also it is a breach of the most express picturesque canon if the parts engage the eye more than the whole the hall therefore the staircase the saloon and other apartments might be adorned with a few busts and statues but to receive the whole collection perhaps a long gallery should have been professedly built in this they might have been arranged in profusion  in constructing such a gallery little ornament would be required here the statues would be the objects not the room to them therefore the whole should be subordinate they would constitute the whole  two things in such a gallery should chiefly be considered the color of the walls and the distribution of the light if the walls were stained with a darkish olivetint they would perhaps show the statues to the best advantage and yet a lighter tinge might probably give them more softness the experiment might easily be tried  with regard to the light it should be high but not vertical if the antiques were ranged on one side of the room the light might be introduced from high windows on the other such a light would not certainly be the most picturesque as each figure at least when studied would require a side light appropriated to itself but this in a degree might be obtained by the means of curtains  much of the beauty of such a room would depend on the mode of arranging the antiques the bassreliefs might be put in plain square frames and affixed to the wall the busts might stand on brackets between them or in recesses and the statues might occupy the front or perhaps on examining the whole collection together some more happy arrangement might be formed  as nobody in england but the earl of pembroke could fit up such a gallery it should not perhaps be made entirely a private concern it would be generous and noble to lay it open to artists when well recommended and to let them study in it under proper restrictions it would bring italy as much as could be into england  but statues are not the only furniture at wilton it contains many very valuable pictures  those we admired most were  a cattlepiece by rosa of tivoli few masters are better acquainted with composition coloring and the distribution of light this picture though not a capital one is an instance of his skill in all these respects  a wholelength of the first lady of the second earl philip and a halflength of the countess of castlehaven both these are by vandyck and both are excellent  mrs kelligrew and mrs morton by vandyck the latter we admired very much  mr james herbert by lely  a carpet and boarshead by maltese the composition is a strange one but the picture is well painted  an old woman with fish by snyders the fish are masterly but the composition is disagreeable  an old woman reading by rembrant  christ taken from the cross by albert durer they who admire the works of the old masters will find a very good one here  a large fruitpiece with figures by m angelo delle battaglio it is a tradition in the family that m angelo kept this picture in his possession as a favorite piece and that sir robert gere bought it of his widow for three hundred pistoles  democritus by spagnolet the style of painting in this picture is admirable but the character of democritus is bad  four children by rubens for composition and coloring we seldom see a more pleasing picture either by this master or any other  the virgin with christ by cantarini the manner is indistinct but the boy is a beautiful figure  the division of christs garments by carracci this picture is well painted but the light is illmanaged  the princess sophia habited like a shepherdess by huntorst  a good virgin by carlo dolce  an admirable portrait of titian by himself  the woman taken in adultery by janeiro the story is not well told but the figures are beautifully grouped  a good schalken  an old man selling plumbs to children by francis hals this is a happy subject to show pleasure and disappointment in young faces and the painter has been as happy in his expression of them  in one of the rooms i remember meeting with a picture of pietro testa which is uncommon there is great spirit in it  but the capital picture at wilton is the large familypiece by vandyck of the excellence of this picture we are told many stories that it is vandycks masterpiece that it is celebrated through europe and that it might have been covered with gold as a price to obtain it this latter is a compliment which i have often heard paid in great houses to favorite pictures and as the king of france is supposed to be the richest man in europe he is generally introduced on these occasions as the bidder for myself i own i am not entirely of the king of frances opinion i have examined this picture with great attention and reluctantly own i cannot bring myself to admire it either in the whole or in its parts vandycks portrait of king charles i over a chimney at hampton court i believe it is now removed  which consists only of a single figure i freely own i should prefer to this though it consists of thirteen  vandyck seldom appears to advantage when he has several figures to manage his master rubens early saw this and desired him to relinquish history and apply to portrait he did but here he is again engaged in history that is he has a number of figures at full length to manage in one large piece which extends twenty feet by twelve the composition of such a work required more skill than he possessed  in the first place there is no attempt at design some little familyscene should have been introduced which might have drawn the figures into one action thus titian represents the cornaro family joining in an act of devotion this picture belongs to the duke of northumberland  without something of this kind the figures had better have been painted in separate pictures  composition too is wanting as well as design the figures are illgrouped and produce no whole  the coloring too is glaring yellow red and blue are the sources when properly blended of every harmonious tint but here they stare in raw colors every gaudy figure stands foremost to catch the eye except the principal figures which are attired in black the young people are all so richly dressed that it seems as if their father and mother had ordered them to put on their best clothes and come down to be painted and that the painter had drawn them so attired just as he saw them without any distinction or choice of drapery to destroy the harmony still more a large escutcheon of the pembroke arms hangs in one corner of the picture filled with such a profusion of red and yellow that it catches the eye at once and may properly be called one of the principal figures  if from a general view of the picture we proceed to particulars i fear our criticisms must be equally severe never painter it must be owned had that happy art which vandyck possessed of turning earths and minerals into flesh and blood never painter had that happy art of composing a single figure with the chaste simplicity of nature and without affectation or artifice of any kind and some of the figures in this picture are no doubt composed in this style particularly the earls of pembroke and carnarvon but the figures in general when considered apart are far from capital some of the attitudes are forced you look in vain for vandycks wonted simplicity but what disgusts us most is a want of harmony in all pictures whether the faces are old or young the same colored light if i may so express myself should be spread over all  the mellow or the bluish tinge arising from the state of the atmosphere whatever it is through which the light is thrown upon them but here this rule is so far from being observed that even allowing the variation of different complexions the faces of all though of one country belong to different climates a yellowfaced boy particularly among the front figures has a complexion which nothing but a jaundice or an indian sun could have given him for the rest some of the carnations are very beautiful particularly the hands of the countess of pembroke  all this censure however must not be laid to the charge of vandyck his pencil could never have been guilty of such violence against nature i have been assured by the late lord orford  that about a dozen years ago this picture was retouched by a painter i think of the name of brompton i saw it before that time and some years after and as far as my memory serves it was altered much for the worse this may account for most of the faults that may be found with the carnations  it would have been a happy thought to represent the dead children by little cherubs hovering in the air if the picture had had an emblematical cast in serious portrait the thought seems rather out of place  at wiltonhouse the accomplished sir philip sidney whose beloved sister was married to the earl of pembroke wrote his arcadia a work of such fancy that although not accommodated to the refinement of this age it was greatly admired in the last and went rapidly through eight editions  sect ix from wilton we returned to salisbury and from thence proceeded to fonthill the seat of mr beckford the road conveyed us through lanes along the edge of the plain about denton the ground lay beautifully the hills descending gently on each side  fonthill is a noble house situated in a park which contains great variety of ground it takes its name from a woody hill and fountain hard by it from which rises a stream that assists in forming an artificial river decorated by a very sumptuous bridge if the bridge had been more simple the scene about it would have been more pleasing the ground though artificially formed slopes well to the river on each side and beyond the bridge opens into a sweet retiring valley  mr beckford seems also to have been assiduous in making a collection of pictures and in point of numbers he has succeeded a socrates by salvator is most esteemed but though a capital picture it seems illcoloured being a mere yellowish clair obscure nor has socrates any character i must add however that i have oftener than once judged falsely on the first sight of salvators pictures which have pleased me more on a second view this however is certainly a fault we expect from a good picture as from a good man a favorable impression at sight  but if there be few good pictures at fonthill there is abundance of splendour not without a little dash of vanity and ostentation what is wanting in taste is made up in finery never house was so bedecked with all the pride of upholstery the very plateglass in one room cost fifteen hundred pounds since this was written i have been informed that fonthill has been much improved particularly that a cathedral has been built of the full dimensions of a genuine one as mr wyatt was the architect it must be a noble edifice and if it be properly stationed it must be a grand decoration   from fonthill we proceeded through hendon to stourhead the seat of mr hoare along downs overlooking an extensive distance on the left we soon came in sight of the house and plantations adorned with towers stretching in a line along the horizon the plantations which seemed to stand on a flat appeared in this distant view very regular and gave us but an unfavourable idea of the place the mystery however of this apparently unpleasing situation was unravelled when we came upon the spot  mr hoare purchased stourhead about forty years ago of lord stourton who takes his title from a village of that name in the neighborhood the improved grounds consist of three parallel valleys all of them closed at one end by an immense terrace running several miles in length with little deviation either to the right or left this was the horizontal stretch of unpleasing ground which we saw at a distance the valleys run from it nearly at right angles and were entirely skreened from the eye as we approached  but though mr hoare has taken all the three valleys consisting of several miles in circumference within his improvements he has adorned that only which lies nearest his house the other two are planted and cut into rides but the wood is yet young  the house is built on an elegant design by colin campbell the architect of wansteadhouse in essex it consists of a basement one grand floor and an attic we enter a handsome hall and pass into the saloon which is a noble room sixty feet in length on each side of these rooms range the apartments  several good pictures adorn them those we admired most were  some market peasants by gainsborough both the figures and the effect of this picture are pleasing  the conference between jacob and esau by rosa of tivoli this is a capital picture and abounds with amusement though it is neither painted in the masters best manner nor are the figures wellgrouped  a small landscape by lucatelli  a holy family by caracci  a landscape by rembrandt the background and sky are dark and the figures sitting on the foreground and seen by firelight have a good effect  a baptists head in a charger by carlo dolci  a good copy of reubens boys at wilton  elisha restoring the widows son by rembrandt this is esteemed the most capital picture of the collection but it wants a whole and the prophet a character  from the house we went to view the improvements around it that valley near which the house stands and which i have mentioned as the most adorned contains a very noble scene it is called the valley of sixwells from six heads of the river stour which arise here and which the stourton family take for their arms the produce of these springs is collected into a grand piece of water in which and the improvements on its banks consist the beauties of the scene  in the common round we are carried first to the lower parts along the margin of the lake which we cross in a narrow part by a superb wooden bridge and still continuing along the water are amused with a grotto which has more propriety in it than these places commonly have here arises one of the heads of the stour which a wellcut river god deus ipse loci pours from his urn  there is another grotto also near this in which the springs are collected into a marble bath it is adorned with the statue of a sleeping nymph under whom you read these lines nymph of the grot these sacred streams i keep and to the murmur of these waters sleep ah spare my slumbers gently tread the cave and drink in silence or in silence lave     leaving these grottos we ascend the higher grounds and so proceed from one ornamental building to another every where entertained with different views of the lake and its banks  one of these buildings is very beautiful it is called the pantheon as it is built on something like the model of the pantheon at rome though it is only the ornament of a garden it is a splendid edifice the rotunda which is the grand part of it is lighted from the top and is thirtysix feet in diameter to this is added a portico and an apartment on each side the inside of the rotunda is adorned with statues and basrelievos and in the center stands an excellent hercules by rysbrach  this statue was the work of emulation rysbrach had long enjoyed the public favor without a rival schemaker first arose as a competitor and afterward rubiliac both artists of great merit the latter of uncommon abilities rysbrach piqued at seeing the applause of the public divided executed this statue as a proof of his skill he composed it from the selected limbs of six or seven of the heroes of broughtons amphitheatre a scene of diversion at that time in high repute the brawny arms were taken from that chief himself the chest from the coachman a champion well known in his day by that appellation and the legs from ellis the painter who took more delight in broughtons amphitheatre than in his own paintingroom  having finished our circuit round the garden we were on the whole much pleased there is a greatness in the design though sometimes a littleness in the execution the buildings in general are good but they are too numerous and too sumptuous the giltcross is a very disgusting object indeed simplicity is every where too much wanting many of the openings also are forced and the banks of the lake in some places formal the paths are mere zigzags the going off of the water and all the management about the head of the lake which is always a business difficult to manage is awkward and perplexed and as to the grounds near the house they are still in the old style of avenues and vistas we saw many things at the same time which pleased us particularly the line of the lake in general along its shores the woody skreens that environed it and the effect of some of the buildings in the landscape when seen single especially that of the pantheon on the whole we spent an agreeable summer evening at stourhead and found more amusement than we generally find in places so highly adorned  the next morning we visited the more distant parts of mr hoares improvements the other two valleys and the terrace the valleys will be more beautiful as the woods improve at present they are but unfurnished and yet in their naked state we saw more clearly the peculiarity of the ground three valleys thus closed by an immense terrace is a singular production of nature some parts of the terrace command a most extensive distance at the point of it where it falls into the lower ground a triangular tower is erected for the sake of the view over the door is the figure of king alfred with this inscription in memory of alfred the great who on this summit erected his standard against danish invaders he instituted juries established a militia created and exerted a naval force a philosopher and a christian the father of his people the founder of the english monarchy and of liberty   from the tower of alfred we returned to stourhead after a ride of at least eight miles through the different parts of mr hoares plantations  sect x from stourhead to froom we passed through an enclosed country which is barren of amusement on our right we left maidenbradley an old house belonging to the duke of somerset and went a few miles out of our road to see longleat the mansion of lord weymouth  longleat is a noble old fabric the workmanship of john padua about the year      this architect was much esteemed by the protector somerset whose house in the strand he built sir john thyn who employed him here was one of the protectors principal officers the style however of longleat has more a cast of the gothic than that of somerset house which makes a nearer approach to grecian architecture somerset house in the strand is now pulled down and an expensive edifice for various offices erected in its room  neither possesses enough of its respective style to be beautiful in its kind the gothic style perhaps at best is but ill adapted to private buildings we chiefly admire it when its clustered pillars adorn the walls of some cathedral when its pointed ribs spread along the roof of an aisle or when the tracery of a window occupies the whole end of a choir gothic ornaments in this style of magnificence lose their littleness they are not considered as parts but are lost in one vast whole and contribute only to impress a general idea of richness  we sometimes indeed see the smaller appendages of cathedrals decorated very beautifully in the gothic style as the chapter house at salisbury and that most elegant building at ely called the parishchurcb but in these buildings the proportions chiefly fill the eye for which such ornaments are contrived as have a good effect ornaments of this kind i have never seen used in any private house of gothic construction nor indeed are they proper as they are only found in sacred buildings it might perhaps have been esteemed a mode of profaneness to adopt them in private structures this idea indeed the gothic architects themselves seem to have had by never using them but in churches  on the whole the grecian architecture seems much better adapted to a private dwelling house than the gothic it has a better assortment if i may so speak of proper ornaments and proportions for all its purposes the gothic ornaments might dress up a hall or a saloon but they could do little more we should find it difficult to decorate the flat roof of an apartment with them or a passage or a staircase  nor are the conveniences which the grecian architecture bestows on private buildings less considerable than the beauty of its decorations the gothic palace is an incumbered pile we are amused with looking into these mansions of antiquity as objects of curiosity but should never think of comparing them in point of convenience with the great houses of modern taste in which the hall and the saloon fill the eye on our entrance are noble reservoirs for air and grand antichambers to the several rooms of state that divide on each hand from them  longleat has nothing of the grecian grandeur to recommend it it is a large square building with a court in the middle which is intended to enlighten the inner chambers the whole is certainly a grand pile but it has little beauty and i should suppose less convenience it is at present however exceedingly in dishabille and the furniture seems to be the relics of the last century the family of the thynnes cover the walls in great profusion we rarely see so numerous a collection of portraits without one that is able to fix the eye  be the inside of the house and its contents however what they may when we view it seated as it is in the center of a noble park which slopes down to it in all directions itself a grand object evidently the capital of these wide domains it has certainly a very princely appearance  somewhere among the woods of this mansion was first naturalized the weymouthpine this species of pine is among the most formal of its brotherhood and yet the planter must consider it in point of variety as an acquisition the patriarchpine mr walpole tells us still exists but we did not see it    sect xi from longleat we pursued our road through froom to wells the first part of our journey presented nothing very interesting as we approached mendiphills the road divides one branch leading over those high grounds the other under them we chose the latter which afforded us on the right those hills for a background and on the left an extensive distance in which glastonburytor as it is called is the most conspicuous feature  our approach to wells from the natural and incidental beauties of the scene was uncommonly picturesque it was a hazy evening and the sun declining low was hid behind a deep purple cloud which covered half the hemisphere but did not reach the western horizon its lower skirts were gilt with dazzling splendour which spread downwards not in diverging rays but in one uniform ruddy glow and uniting at the bottom with the mistiness of the air formed a rich yet modest tint with which durcotehill projecting boldly on the left the towers of wells beyond it and all the objects of the distance were tinged while the foreground seen against so bright a piece of scenery was overspread with the darkest shades of evening the whole together invited the pencil without soliciting the imagination but it was a transitory scene as we stood gazing at it the sun sunk below the cloud and being stripped of all its splendour by the haziness of the atmosphere fell like a ball of fire into the horizon and the whole radiant vision faded away  wells is a pleasant town and agreeably situated the cathedral is a beautiful pile notwithstanding it is of saxon architecture the front is exceedingly rich and yet the parts are large in the towers the upper stories are plain and make a good contrast with the richness of the lower but this circumstance appears to most advantage when the towers are seen in profile in front there is too much ornament in the inside the saxon heaviness prevails more the choirpart is in better taste and the retiring pillars of the chapel beyond the communion table produce an unusual and very pleasing effect like that at salisbury the chapter house is an elegant octagon supported by a single pillar one of the parish churches also at wells is adorned with a very handsome gothic tower and is itself a beautiful pile  near wells is a famous cavern called okeyhole it lies under mendiphills which in this place form a beautiful recess adorned with rock and wood a recess of this kind appears of little value to those who are acquainted with mountainous countries but in the south of england it is a novel scene as to the cavern itself it runs about three hundred yards under ground dividing into three large apartments but no cavern that i know except that at castleton in derbyshire see an account of it in mr gs northern tour vol ii p   0  is worth visiting in a picturesque light caverns in general are mere holes and have no connection with the ground about them that at castleton has a grand entrance and the rocky scenery with which it is hung forms a most magnificent approach but in the cavern here there is no grandeur of this kind so that it contributes little to the beauty of the recess in which it lies  from okeyhole we returned to wells and from thence proceeded to glastonbury the ruins of which had highly raised our expectation  sect xii the ground on which the abbey of glastonbury stands is higher than the neighboring district which is a perfect flat insomuch that tradition says it was formerly covered with the sea if that was the case the ground which the abbey occupies if not an island was at least a peninsula to this day it bears the name of the isle of avelon and the meadows around it seem plainly to have been washed and relinquished by the sea  the abbey of glastonbury therefore does not enjoy that choice situation which the generality of religious houses possess original foundations like this were generally fixed by accidental causes an escape from a shipwreck a battle a murder the scene of some princes death with a variety of other circumstances have commonly determined their site so that if they enjoy a good situation it seems to be accidental those religious houses whose situation we particularly admire i should conjecture have been chiefly colonies or offsets from the great religious houses in these there might be a choice of situation  the event which settled the situation of this abbey is firmly attested on the proof of romish legends when joseph of aremathea came to preach the gospel in britain as it is asserted he did he landed on the isle of avelon and fixing his staff in the ground a dry thornsaplin which had been his companion through all the countries he had passed fell asleep when he awoke he found to his great surprise that his staff had taken root and was covered with white blossoms from this miracle however he drew a very natural conclusion that as the use of his staff was thus taken from him it was ordained that he should fix his abode in this place here therefore he built a chapel which by the piety of succeeding times increased into this magnificent foundation  of this immense fabric nothing now remains but a part of the great church st josephs chapel an old gateway part of the abbots lodge and the kitchen  of the great church the south side is nearly entire some part of the east end remains a little of the cross isle and a remnant of the tower all of the purest and most elegant gothic the north side was lately taken down and the materials were applied to build a meeting house from this defalcation however the ruin as a picturesque object seems to have suffered little in correspondent parts if one only be taken away or considerably fractured it may possibly be an advantage but we greatly regret the loss of the west end which was taken down to build a town hall still more we regret the loss of the tower as the eye wants some elevated part to give an apex to the whole besides in that part of the tower which remains there is rather a formality two similar points which have been the shoulders of a gothic arch arise in equal dimensions and do not easily fall into a picturesque form  st josephs chapel which stands near the west end of the great church is almost entire the roof indeed is gone but the walls have suffered little dilapidation this chapel was probably more ancient than the church as it has evidently a mixture in it of saxon architecture but the style is very pure in its kind and the whole is rich and beautiful it is no little addition to its beauty that ivy is spread about over the walls in such just proportion as to adorn without defacing them  on the southwest of st josephs chapel stands the gate of strangers which seems to have been a heavy building void of elegance and beauty not far from the gate of strangers and connected with it in design are shown the foundations of the linguists lodge but no part of it unless it be a postern is now left this was a very necessary part of an endowment which was visited by strangers from all parts of the world  the abbots lodge has been a large building it ranges parallel with the south side of the church and was nearly entire within the memory of man it was a suit of seven apartments on a floor but very little of it is now left in the year      it was taken down to answer some purpose of economy though it seems never to have been a structure of any beauty  hard by the abbots lodge stands the kitchen which is to this day very entire and is both a curious remnant of antiquity and a noble monument of monkish hospitality it is a square building calculated to last for ages its walls are four feet thick and yet strengthened with massy buttresses they have indeed an immense roof to support which is still in excellent repair it is constructed of stone and seems to be a work of very curious masonry running up in the form of an octagonal pyramid and finished at the top in a double cupola the under part of this cupola received the smoke in channels along the inside of the roof and the upper part contained a bell which first called the society to dinner and afterward the neighboring poor to alms the inside of the kitchen is an octagon four chimnies taking off the corners of the square it has two doors and measures twentytwo feet from one to the other and a hundred and seventy from the bottom to the top in this kitchen it is recorded that twelve oxen were dressed generally every week besides a proportional quantity of other victuals  these are all the visible remains of this great house foundations are traced far and wide where it is conjectured the cloisters ran the monks cells the schools the dormitories halls and other offices the whole together has been an amazing combination of various buildings it had the appearance indeed of a considerable town containing perhaps the largest society under one government and the most extensive foundation that ever appeared in england in any form its fraternity is said to have consisted of five hundred established monks besides nearly as many retainers on the abbey above four hundred children were not only educated in it but entirely maintained strangers from all parts of europe were liberally received classed according to their sex and nation and might consider the hospitable roof under which they lodged as their own five hundred travelers with their horses though they generally i should suppose traveled on foot have been lodged at once within its walls while the poor from every side of the country waited the ringing of the almsbell when they flocked in crowds young and old to the gate of the monastery where they received every morning a plentiful provision for themselves and their families all this appears great and noble  on the other hand when we consider five hundred persons bred up in indolence and lost to the commonwealth when we consider that these houses were the great nurseries of superstition bigotry and ignorance the stews of sloth stupidity and perhaps intemperance when we consider that the education received in them had not the least tincture of useful learning good manners or true religion but tended rather to vilify and disgrace the human mind when we consider that the pilgrims and strangers who resorted thither were idle vagabonds who got nothing abroad that was equivalent to the occupations they left at home and when we consider lastly that indiscriminate almsgiving is not real charity but an avocation from labor and industry checking every idea of exertion and filling the mind with abject notions we are led to acquiesce in the fate of these great foundations and view their ruins not only with a picturesque eye but with moral and religious satisfaction  this great house possessed the amplest revenues of any religious house in england its ancient domains are supposed now to yield not less than an annual income of two hundred thousand pounds i have heard them calculated at much more  within a mile of the abbey stands the torr which is by much the highest land in the island of avelon and had been our landmark through an approach of many leagues the summit of this hill is decorated with a ruin which has its effect though in itself it possesses no beauty it is a structure of ambiguous intention one tradition supposes it to have been a seamark for which it is well adapted another makes it an oratory to the abbot it certainly belonged  here the holy man when satan led him aside might sometimes ascend and looking round him might see all the country his own houses and villages filled with his vassals meadows covered with innumerable flocks and herds to support the strength of his table rivers and woods abounding with fish and game to furnish its delicacies fields waving with corn to fill his granaries and his cellars and among other sources of luxury no fewer than seven ample parks well stocked with venison here was a glorious view indeed his heart might dilate as the vision expanded and if he were not well upon his guard he might easily have mistaken an earthly reverie for holy joy and religious gratitude  near the bottom of this hill are found great quantities of that species of putrefaction which resembles a coiled serpent or as it is often called an ammons horn  the ruins of glastonburyabbey occupy a piece of ground about a mile in circumference which has no peculiar beauty but might be improved into a very grand scene if it were judiciously planted and laid out with just so much art as to discover the ruins to the best advantage but such schemes of improvement are calculated only for posterity a young plantation would ill accord with such antique accompaniments the oak would require at least a centurys growth before its mossgrown limbs could be congenial with the ruins it adorned  i should ill deserve the favors i met with from the learned antiquarian who has the care of these ruins though he occupies only the humble craft of a shoemaker if i did not attempt to do some justice to his zeal and piety no picturesque eye could more admire these venerable remains for their beauty than he did for their sanctity every stone was the object of his devotion but above all the appendages of glastonbury he reverenced most the famous thorn which sprang from st josephs staff and blossoms at christmas on this occasion he gave us the following relation  it was at that time he said when the king resolved to alter the common course of the year that he first felt distress for the honor of the house of glastonbury if the time of christmas were changed who could tell how the credit of this miraculous plant might be affected in short with the fortitude of a jewish seer he ventured to expostulate with the king upon the subject and informed his majesty in a letter of the disgrace that might possibly ensue if he persisted in his design of altering the natural course of the year but though his conscience urged him upon this bold action he could not but own the flesh trembled he had not the least doubt he said but the king would immediately send down an order to have him hanged he pointed to the spot where the last abbot of glastonbury was executed for not surrendering his abbey and he gave us to understand there were men now alive who could suffer death in a good cause with equal fortitude his zeal however was not put to this severe trial the king was more merciful than he expected for though his majesty did not follow his advice it never appeared that he took the least offense at the freedom of his letter  the death of the last abbot of glastonbury is indeed a mournful tale as it is represented by the writers of those times and was calculated to make a lasting impression on the country  this abbot is said to have been a pious and good man careful of his charge kind to the poor and exemplary in his conduct he is particularly mentioned as a man of great temperance which in a cloister was not perhaps at that day the reigning virtue what was still as uncommon he was a lover of learning and not only took great care of the education of those young men who were brought up in his house but was at the expense of maintaining several of them at the universities he was now very old and very infirm and having passed all his life in his monastery knew little more of the world than he had seen within its walls  it was the misfortune of this good abbot to live in the tyrannical days of henry viii and at that period when the suppression of monasteries was his favorite object henry had applied to many of the abbots and by threats and promises had engaged several of them to surrender their trusts but the abbot of glastonbury attached to his house and connected with his fraternity refused to surrender he was conscious of his own innocence and thought guilt only had to fear from the inquisition that was abroad but henry whose haughty and imperious spirit unused to control soared above the trifling distinctions between innocence and guilt was highly incensed and determined to make an example of the abbot of glastonbury to terrify others an order first came down for him to appear forthwith before the council the difficulties of taking so long a journey appeared great to an old man who had seldom traveled beyond the limits of his monastery but as there was no redress he got into an easy horselitter and set out in his mode of traveling we see the state and dignity which certainly required some correction of the great ecclesiastics of that age his retinue it is said consisted of not fewer than an hundred and fifty horsemen  the kings sending for him however was a mere pretext the real purpose was to prevent his secreting his effects as it was never intended that he should return proper persons therefore were commissioned to search his apartments in his absence and secure the wealth of the monastery his steward in the meantime who was a gentleman of the degree of a knight was corrupted to make what discoveries he could it was an easy matter in those days to procure evidence where it was already determined to convict in one of the abbots cabinets some strictures upon the divorce were either found or pretended to be found nothing else could be obtained against him  during this interval the abbot who knew nothing of these proceedings waited on the council he was treated respectfully and informed that the king would not force any man to do what he wished him to do freely however as his majesty intended to receive his final determination on the spot he was at liberty to return  being thus dismissed the abbot thought all was now over and that he might be permitted to end his days peaceably in his beloved monastery  he was now nearly at the end of his journey having arrived at wells which is within five miles of glastonbury when he was informed that a county court of what kind is not specified was convened there on that day to which he as abbot of glastonbury was summoned he went into the court room accordingly and as his station required was going to take his place at the upper end of it among the principal gentry of the country when the crier called him to the bar where he was accused of high treason  the old man who had not the least conception of the affair was utterly astonished and turning to his steward who stood near him asked if he knew what could be the meaning of all this that traitor whispering in his ear wished him not to be cast down for he knew the meaning of it was only to terrify him into a compliance though the court therefore on the evidence of the paper taken out of his cabinet found him guilty of high treason he had still no idea of what was intended from the court he was conveyed to his litter and conducted to glastonbury still in suspense how all this would end  when he arrived under the walls of his abbey the litter was ordered to stop and an officer riding up to him bad him prepare for instant death a priest at the same time presented himself to take his confession  the poor old abbot utterly confounded at the suddenness of the thing was quite unmanned he begged with tears and for gods sake they would allow him some little time for recollection but his tears were vain might he not then just enter his monastery take leave of his friends and recommend himself to their prayers all was to no purpose he was dragged out of his litter and laid upon a hurdle to which a horse being yoked he was drawn along the ground to the torr and there to make the triumph complete was hung up in his monks habit and in sight of his monastery it was a triumph however that was attended with the tears and lamentations of the whole country which had long considered this pious man as a friend benefactor and father  how far this shocking story in all its circumstances of strange precipitancy and wanton cruelty may be depended on considering the hands through which it is conveyed may be matter of doubt thus much however is certain that if the picture here given of the royal savage of those days be not an exact portrait it bears evidently a striking resemblance  sect xiii having given a last look at the picturesque ruins of glastonbury we left them with regret that pure style of gothic in which this grand house was composed it is probable gave the keytone in architecture to all the churches in this neighborhood for it is certain a better taste prevails among them as far as we observed than in any other part of england through which we had traveled  from glastonbury we took the road to bridgewater and passed through a very fine country  about three miles beyond pipers inn we mounted a grand natural terrace called the heights of pontic  on the right we had the whole range of mendip hills which though inconsiderable in themselves made some figure in this view with pleasant savannahs stretching among them beyond the hills appeared the sea and the island of steepholms the nearer grounds between this distance and the eye were filled with ample woods which ranged not in patches here and there dispersed but in one extended surface of tufted foliage for we saw little more from the heights on which we stood than the varied tops of the woods beneath us the whole country i believe is a scene of cultivation and the woods little more in fact than hedgerows but one row succeeding another the intermediate spaces are concealed together with all the regularity of that mode of planting and the whole appears in the distance as one vast bed of foliage  on the left we had the same kind of country only the hills on this side of pontic are much superior to those of mendip on the other among the savannahs on this side shoot the extensive plains of sedgmore which stretch far and wide before the eye here the unfortunate monmouth tried his cause with his uncle james and all the country was afterward the scene of those acts of brutality which kirk and jefferies committed and which are still remembered with horror and detestation  this vast distance which we surveyed from the heights of pontic not only filled the eye with its grandeur as a whole but was every where interspersed with amusing objects which adorned its several divisions in one part lord chathams obelisk pointed out the domains of pynsent in another part we were told the rich scenes before us were the woods of sir charles tint the tall spire which arose on the right belonged to the great church at bridgewater and the several little spots of water glittering under the sunbeams were reaches of the river parret inlaying as with moltonglass the vale that spread beyond the sight  at the distance at which we stood we could not well unite all these bright spots of the river into a winding course but the imagination easily traced the union  the distances indeed from the heights of pontic are both grand and picturesque picturesque when thus reduced into parts though in their immensity greatly too extensive for painting the whole scene was a translation of a passage in virgil bringing before our eyes  mare velivolum terrasque jacentes littoraque et latos populos  we have the same view elsewhere  from the mountains ridge over tufted tops of intervening woods regions on regions blended in the clouds   i cannot forbear contrasting this grand view with a few bold strokes of distance which moses gives us when he tells us he went up from the plains of moab to the top of pisgah from whence the lord showed him all the land of gilead unto dan and all naphtali and the land of ephraim and manasseh and all the land of judah unto the utmost sea and on the south the plain of the valley of jericho unto zoar  on mr hoares terrace we had seen the spot where alfred the great mustered his scattered troops to oppose the danes the country near bridgewater affords a scene where on another occasion he appeared in a different character  where the the one and the parret join their waters they form between them a piece of ground containing about two acres which is called the isle of athelney in saxon times it was not only surrounded by water but with woods and marshes to a great extent and was in every part of very difficult access here the gallant alfred retired in his distresses when he fled before the danes after the battle of wilton at first he considered it only as a place of refuge and sustained himself by shooting the wild deer with his arrows but by degrees getting together a few of his friends he fortified the island and particularly the only avenue that led to it from hence he often made successful inroads upon the danish quarters and retreating among the marshes eluded pursuit from hence too in the habit of a minstrel he made that celebrated excursion to their camp in which under the pretense of amusing them with his songs and buffooneries he took an exact survey of their situation he then laid his measures so judiciously and fell upon them with so much welldirected fury that he entirely broke their power during the remainder of his reign in aftertimes when success had crowned his enterprises he founded a monastery in the island in memory of the protection it had once afforded him but its site which had nothing to recommend it except this personal circumstance was in all respects so inconvenient that it never flourished though it existed till the times of the dissolution  sect xiv there is very little in bridgewater which was our next stage worth a travellers attention its great boast is the celebrated blake one of cromwells admirals who was born in this town and represented it in several parliaments  the name of blake can hardly occur to an englishman without suggesting respect if ever any man was a lover of his country without being actuated by party or any other sinister motive it was blake whether in a divided commonwealth one side or the other should be cordially chosen by every citizen is a nice question some of the ancient moralists have held the affirmative but a man may see such errors on both sides as may render a choice difficult this seems to have been blakes case the glory of his country therefore was the only part he espoused he fought indeed under cromwell but it was merely he would say to aggrandize old england he often disliked the protectors politics with the death of charles he was particularly displeased and was heard to mutter that to have saved the kings life he would freely have ventured his own but still he fought on took an immense treasure from the portuguese beat the dutch in two or three desperate engagements burnt the dey of tuniss fleet awed the piratical states and above all destroyed the spanish platefleet in the harbor of santa cruz which was thought a piece of the most gallant seamanship that ever was performed some things in the mean time happened at home which he did not like particularly cromwells treatment of the parliament but he still fought on and would say to his captains it is not for us to mind state matters but to keep foreigners from fooling us what is singular in this commander is that all his knowledge in maritime affairs was acquired after he was fifty years of age he had the theory of his profession as it were by intuition and crowded as many gallant actions into nine or ten years as might have immortalized as many commanders one personal singularity is recorded which gives us a sort of portrait of him when his choler was raised and he was bent on some desperate undertaking it was his custom to twirl his whiskers with his forefinger whenever that sign appeared those about him well knew something dreadful was in agitation  such a peculiarity however could not easily be made intelligible in a picture and therefore it is more proper for history than representation and yet i can conceive a portrait of blake in this attitude if well managed to have a good effect his fleet might lie in the offing ready to sail at a distance might stand a castle which he meant to attack firing at his fleet and involved in smoke blake with a few of his officers around him might stand on the foreground occupying the principal part of the picture and ready to embark in a boat which was waiting for them on the strand blake himself might be represented in the attitude above described throwing a dreadful look at the castle but this dreadful look must be in the hands of a master or it will infallibly become grotesque and caricature after all though this disposition might make a good picture i know not that it would be intelligible enough to make a good portrait  all this coast between bridgewater and bristol is low and subject in many parts to overflowing tides in the memorable storm of november   0  it was a melancholy scene the sea broke over it with great outrage and did surprising damage in many places as you travel through it you see marks set up by the country people to show how far the sea poured in at that time but indeed every part of the bristol channel is subject to very high tides at all times in bridgewaterriver it often rises in an uncommon manner and comes forward in such rapid swells that it has been known sometimes to overset ships it affects the river at bristol also and all the rivers on the coast and if i am not mistaken on the opposite coast likewise  sect xv as we left bridgewater we drew nearer the sea in our way we passed sir charles tints plantations which we had before seen as parts of a distance they appeared now stretching to a great extent along the side of a hill and beautifully interspersed with lawns they were adorned with too many buildings which would however have had a better effect if they had not been painted white a seat or small building painted white may be an advantage in a view but when these white spots are multiplied the distinction of their color detaches them from the other objects of the scene with which they ought to combine they distract the eye and become separate spots instead of parts of a whole  in the neighborhood of sir charles tints lies enmorecastle the seat of lord egmont it is a new building in the form of an old castle a dry ditch surrounds it which you pass by a drawbridge this carries you into a square court the four sides of which are occupied by the apartments it is called whimsical and no doubt there is something whimsical in the idea of a mans enclosing himself in the reign of george the second in a fortress that would have suited the times of king stephen but if we can divest ourselves of this idea enmorecastle seems to be a comfortable dwelling in which there is contrivance and convenience the situation of the stables seems the most whimsical you enter them through a subterraneous passage on the right of the great gate there was no occasion to carry the idea so far as to lock up the horses within the castle if the stables had been placed at some convenient distance nobody who should even examine the castle under its antique idea would observe the impropriety while the inconvenience as they are placed at present is evident to every one who sees them  but if the house be well contrived within it is certainly no picturesque object without the towers which occupy the corners and middle of the curtains are all of equal height which gives the whole an unpleasing appearance if the tower at the entrance had been more elevated with a watchhouse at the top in the manner of some old castles the regularity might still have been observed and the perspective in every point except exactly in the front would have given the whole a more pleasing form  but even with this addition enmorecastle would be in a picturesque light only a very indifferent copy of its original the old baronial castle in its ancient state even before it had received from time the beauties of ruin was certainly a more pleasing object than we have in this imitation of it the form of enmore is sacrificed to convenience to make the apartments regular within the walls are regular without whereas our ancestors had no idea of uniformity if one tower was square and low the other perhaps would be round and lofty the curtain too was irregular following the declivity or projection of the hill on which it stood it was adorned also with watchtowers here and there at unequal distances nor were the windows more regular either in form or situation than the internal parts of the castle which they enlightened some jutting corner of a detached hill was also probably fortified with a projecting tower a large buttress or two perhaps propped the wall in some part where the attack of an enemy had made it weak while the keep rising above the castle formed generally a grand apex to the whole amidst all this mass of irregularity the lines would be broken the light often beautifully received and various points of view presented some of which would be exceedingly picturesque whereas enmorecastle seen in every point of view presents a face of unvaried sameness even taken in perspective it affords no variety we see three similar towers with two similar curtains between them on one side and three similar towers with two similar curtains between them on the other on the whole therefore as it obtains no particular convenience from its castleform and evidently no particular beauty it might perhaps have been as well if the noble founder had built like other people on a modern plan  sect xvi from enmorecastle we ascended quantochills our views from the heights of pontic were chiefly inland but from the high grounds here as we now approached the sea we were entertained with beautiful coastviews which make a very agreeable species of landscape  the first scene of this kind was composed of bridgewaterbay and the land around it we saw indeed the two islands of flatholms and steepholms and the welsh coast beyond them but they were wrapped in the ambiguity of a hazy atmosphere which was of no advantage to the view haziness has often a good effect in a picturesque scene the variety of objects shapes and hues which compose an extensive landscape though inharmonious in themselves may be harmoniously united by one general tinge spread over them but here the land bore so small a proportion to the water that as we could not have a picture and expected only amusement we wished for more distinctness we had it soon for before we left our station a light breeze arising from the west swept away the vapors the distant coast became distinct and many a little white sail appeared in different parts of the channel which had been lost before in obscurity  the going off of mists and fogs is among the most beautiful circumstances belonging to them while the obscurity is only partially clearing away it often occasions a pleasing contrast between the formed and unformed parts of a landscape and like cleaning a dirty picture pleases the eye with seeing one part after another emerge into brightness it has its effect also when it goes off more suddenly  the exhibition we just had of the fogs leaving the welsh coast was a pleasing one but where there is a coincidence of grand objects under such circumstances the exhibition is often sublime one of the grandest i remember to have met with was presented at the late siege of gibraltar see drinkwaters journal   it was near daybreak on the   th of april      when a message was brought from the signalhouse at the summit of the rock that the long expected fleet under admiral darby was in sight innumerable masts were just discerned from that lofty situation but could not be seen from the lower parts of the castle being obscured by a thick fog which had set in from the west and totally overspread the opening of the straits in this uncertainty the garrison remained some time while the fleet invested in obscurity moved slowly toward the castle in the mean time the sun becoming powerful the fog rose like the curtain of a vast theater and discovered at once the whole fleet full and distinct before the eye the convoy consisting of near a hundred vessels were in a compact body led on by twentyeight sail of the line and a number of tenders and other smaller vessels a gentle wind just filled their sails and brought them forward with a slow and solemn motion had all this grand exhibition been presented gradually the sublimity of it would have been injured by the acquaintance the eye would have made with it during its approach but the appearance of it in all its greatness at once before the eye had examined the detail had a wonderful effect  to this account of a grand effect from the clearing away of a fog i shall subjoin another which though of the horrid kind is grand and sublime in the highest degree it is taken from captain mearess voyage from china to the northern latitudes of america that navigator having gained the inhospitable coast he was in pursuit of was sailing among unknown bays and gulphs when he was suddenly immersed in so thick a fog that the seamen could not even discern an object from one end of the ship to the other night too came on which rendered every thing still more dismal while the unhappy crew were ruminating on the variety of distresses that surrounded them about midnight they were alarmed with the sound of waves bursting and dashing among rocks within a little distance of the head of the ship instantly turning the helm they tacked about but they had sailed only a short way in this new direction when they were terrified with the same dreadful notes a second time they altered their course again but the same tremendous sound again recurred at length day came on but the fog continuing as intense as before they could see nothing all they knew was that they were surrounded by rocks on every side but how to escape they had no idea once during a momentary interruption of the fog they got a glimpse of the summit of an immense cliff covered with snow towering over the mast but the fog instantly shut it in a more dreadful situation cannot easily be conceived they had steered in every direction but always found they were landlocked and though they were continually close to the shore on sounding they could find no bottom their anchors therefore were of no use four days they continued in this dreadful suspense tacking from side to side on the  th the fog cleared away and they had a view at once of the terrors that surrounded them they had by some strange accident found their way into a bay environed on all sides with precipices of immense height covered with snow and falling down to the water in lofty rocks which were every where perpendicular except in some parts where the constant beating of the surge had hollowed them into caverns the sound they heard was from the waters swelling and rushing into these caverns which absorbing them drove them out again with great fury against the rocks at their mouths dashing them into foam with a tremendous sound captain meares now perceived the passage through which he had been driven into this scene of horrors and made his escape  on reading such accounts as these in a picturesque light one can hardly avoid making a few remarks on the grand effects which may often be produced by what may be called the scenery of vapor nothing offers so extensive a field to the fancy in invented scenes nothing subjects even the compositions of nature so much to the control and improvement of art it admits the painter to a participation with the poet in the use of the machinery of uncertain forms to which both are indebted for their sublimest images a sublime image is perhaps an incorrect phrase the regions of sublimity are not peopled by forms but hints they are not enlightened by sunshine but by gleams and flashes the transient view of the summit of a cliff towering over the mast filled the despairing seaman with more terror than if he had seen the whole rocky bay it set his imagination at work the ideas of grace and beauty are as much raised by leaving the image half immersed in obscurity as the ideas of terror definition which throws a light on philosophic truth destroys at once the airy shapes of fiction virgil has given more beauty in three words  lumenque juventae purpureum  than he could have done in the most labored description as gray likewise has in the two following lines though some cold critic would probably ask for an explanation over her warm cheek and rising bosom move the bloom of young desire and purple light of love it is by snatches only that you catch a glimpse of such beauties would you analyze them the vision dissolves in the process and disappears like life pursued to its last retreat by the anatomist you ruin the image by determining its form and identifying its tints  as we proceeded farther along the heights of quantoc we had views of the promontory of minehead which forms a more beautiful coast than bridgewaterbay the land is higher and more varied here we had still a distinct view of the bristol channel and the coast of wales the sea as is not uncommon happened to be beautifully variegated it had a reddish hue with a tinge of rainbow green which being mixed together formed different gradations of kindred colors and sometimes going off in purple gave the surface of the ocean a great resplendency  minehead seems by its situation to confirm what we were told that its harbor was the best and safest in this part of the coast when the great storm of   0  ravaged all these shores with peculiar fury minehead was the only harbor which could defend it is shipping it is chiefly useful in the irish trade as it lies in the midway between ireland and bristol  in so ordinary a town as watchet we were surprised to find so handsome a pier but in many of the ports along this coast though inconsiderable in appearance we see a great air of business this little mediterranean is crowded with skiffs passing and repassing and has a brisk trade within itself in corn metals limestone and other commodities the coast about watchet is very rocky and the crevices of the rocks are curiously veined with alabaster which makes a part of the traffic of the place but the stone from which the greatest advantage is derived is a kind of pebble found on the shore when the tide leaves it these pebbles burn into lime of so peculiar a texture that when placed under water it assumes its original hardness even when pulverized and laid upon land it is turned into a kind of hard grit by the first shower of rain in the foundation of bridges therefore and all stonework which lies under water the lime of watchet is exceedingly valued a species of this kind of lime mr bryant informs us was in use among the romans the foundationstones particularly of the great mole at puteoli were united by this cement see bryants dissert on the wind euroclydon p      from watchet we pursued our route along the coast the promontory of minehead still continued the principal feature of the view as we approached it a woody hill which in the distance adhered to the promontory began more and more to detach itself from it and as we came still nearer we discovered a light airy building on its summit which by degrees appeared to be an unfinished edifice with its scaffolding about it in this condition it has probably a more picturesque effect than it will have when it has completely taken the form which seems to be intended at a distance it had the appearance of the sibyls temple at tivoli the tower is round and the scaffolding annexed the idea of a range of ruined pillars supporting the roof  as we turned a little from the sea dunstercastle the seat of mr lutterell opened before us at about the distance of half a mile and made a striking appearance it is indeed on the whole one of the grandest artificial objects we had met with on our journey its towers which are picturesque arise near the summit of a woody hill which seems connected with another hill much higher though it is in fact detached from it this apparent union makes the composition more agreeable and is of great advantage to the view it takes away that idea of art which an insulated hill would be apt to raise the consequence of this grand object is greatly increased by a dead flat between it and the eye broken ground in itself is more beautiful but a flat often carries the eye more directly to a capital object with which also it often very agreably contrasts i speak however undecidedly because sometimes it is otherwise but in the present case we thought the approach by a flat had a good effect  from the terrace of the castle we had a great variety of amusing landscapes though nothing very interesting we obtained a good idea however of the form of the country and found that dunstercastle which stands high is surrounded though at a considerable distance by grounds that are much higher in this amusing circle round the walls of the castle we had three distinct species of landscape a parkscene a tract of mountainous country and a seacoast  in the time of the civil wars dunstercastle had a respectable name and was considered as one of the strongest of the kings garrisons in the west when his affairs were in the wane after the battle of naisby it was fixed on as the best place of refuge for the prince of wales but the plague immediately breaking out in the town of dunster some other place of security was sought for  at dunster we were told there is a very elegant gothic church built in the time of henry vii when it is commonly supposed gothic architecture was in its purest state though i think it was rather as all arts end in refinement at that period on the decline whether this church however were of elegant architecture or not the late intelligence we received did not suffer us to examine we had already left the place and when there had conceived the castle to be the only thing worth visiting  from dunster in our route to dulverton we had a pleasant ride for half a dozen miles through a winding valley and along the sides of hills on the left which came sloping down with their woody skirts to the road but we soon exchanged these valleys for a naked open country and the woody hills for dreary slopes cut into portions by naked hedges unadorned by a single tree  as we left dulverton in our way to tiverton we entered another pleasing valley wooded thick with oaks which climbed a steep on the right and formed a hanging grove on the left ran the ex a rapid rockychannelled stream shaded likewise with trees beyond the ex the ground rose in a beautiful parkscene in the midst of which stands the house of sir thomas acland  from hence to tiverton the country affords nothing that is striking we had hills but they were tame and uniform following each other in such quick succession that we rarely found either a foreground or a distance as we mounted one we had another immediately in view at tiverton are the remains of a castle which was formerly the mansion of the earls of devonshire  sect xvii from hence we traveled through the same kind of hilly country toward barnstaple in our way we turned aside to see lord fortescues at castlehill where we did not think we were sufficiently repaid for going so far out of our way lord fortescue has improved a large tract of ground but with no great taste or contrivance the reader will recollect this was written several years ago and that many alterations may since have been made  into one error he has particularly fallen that of overbuilding his improvements from one stand we counted eight or nine buildings this is the common error of improvers it is a much easier matter to erect a temple or a palladian bridge than to improve a piece of ground with simplicity and beauty and give it the air of nature one of his buildings an old castle upon a hill from which his place i suppose takes its name stands beautifully little more i should think in the way of building would have been necessary this lofty castle might be object sufficient from almost every part of his improvements  as we approached barnstaple the view from some of the high grounds is very grand composed on one side of barnstaplebay and on the other of an extensive vale the vale of taunton carrying the eye far and wide into its rich and ample bosom it is one of those views which is too great a subject for painting art confined by the rules of picturesque composition must keep within the compass of inch foot and yard but such slender confines cannot rouse the imagination like these extensive scenes of nature the painter jealous of his art will sometimes deny this if the picture he tells us be well painted the size is nothing his canvas however diminutive has the effect of nature and deceives the eye you are affected says he by a landscape seen through the pane of a window why may you not be equally affected by a landscape well painted within the same dimensions  it is true the eye is frequently imposed upon it is often purposely misled by tricks of deception but it is not under the idea of deception that the real artist paints he does not mean to impose upon us by making us believe that a picture of a foot long is an extended landscape all he wishes is to give such characteristic touches to his picture as may be able to rouse the imagination of the beholder the picture is not so much the ultimate end as it is the medium through which the ravishing scenes of nature are excited in the imagination  we do indeed examine a picture likewise by the rules of picturesque composition but this mode of examination we are not now considering the rules of composition serve only to make the picture answer more effectually its ultimate end we are now considering only the effect which the picture produces on the mind of the spectator by carrying him forcibly and yet willingly with his eyes open into those scenes which it describes  it is just the same in every species of painting the portraitpainter must raise the idea of wit or humor or integrity or good sense or piety or dignity in the character of the person whose portrait he represents or he does nothing in history too unless the picture rouse the imagination to something more than you see on the canvas it leaves half its work undone you coolly criticize it indeed by picturesque rules but that is not all it ought to raise in you those ideas and sentiments which paint cannot express that is it should produce something in you which the painter could not produce on his canvas  on the whole then the true enjoyment of the picture depends chiefly on the imagination of the spectator and as the utmost the landscapepainter can do is to excite the ideas of those delightful scenes which he represents it follows that those scenes themselves must have a much greater effect on the imagination than any representation of them which he can give that is the idea must be much more strongly excited by the original than by a representative the fact is art is a mere trifler compared with nature the efforts of both it is true may be called the works of god but the difference lies here in the efforts of art god works with those little instruments called men he works in miniature but when he works in the grand style of nature the elements are his instruments see the subject of these last pages treated in another view in vol ii of for scen p       sect xviii the approach to barnstable from the lower grounds is as beautiful as from the higher the river the bridge the hills beyond it and the estuary in the distance make all together a good landscape the town itself also situated about nine or ten miles from the sea stands in a pleasant vale shut in by hills forming a semilunar cove around it when the tides are high it is almost insulated the flat grounds which lie immediately about it make an agreeable contrast with the hills once these grounds were little better than marshes but by proper draining they are now become beautiful meadows in a word barnstable is the pleasantest town we met with in the west of england  from hence to torrington the country is uninteresting but between torrington and oakhampton it assumed a better appearance in some parts of it we had grand distances in other parts hanging woods particularly a very noble one belonging to mr harris which traveled with us a considerable way on the left and afforded us a view sometimes over it and sometimes through it but at all times pleasing  from oakhampton we visited the falls of lidford which compose the most celebrated piece of scenery in this country  lidford was formerly a town of the first consequence in england in william the conquerors time it was taxed pretty nearly on an equality with london as tin was at that time the staple commodity of the country lidford might draw its consequence from being one of the principal marts of that metal here afterward a stannerycourt was kept the castle in which it was held is still in being it is a large square tower rather out of repair than in ruin near it stands the parish church and at a distance we had a view of another church loftily seated called brentor but the falls of lidford are a mile and half from the castle  in our way we were to pass a bridge which we were informed was thrown over the rocky sides of two frightful precipices of the river lid each eighty feet high the idea was terrific and we expected a very grand scene but we were disappointed from the omission of a single circumstance in the intelligence which was that the separation between these two tremendous precipices is little more than the crevice of a rock and in fact we had passed it before we knew we had been upon it it is only seen by looking over the battlements of the bridge if the day be clear you just discover the river foaming among rocks many fathoms below if not you must be content with listening to its roar the music however is grand for if the river be full the notes swell nobly from the bottom varied as they are by ascending so narrow and broken a funnel  we were told a story of a london rider who traveled this road in a stormy night and being desirous to escape the rain as quickly as he could pushed his horse with what exertion his whip and spurs could excite the next morning he heard that lidford bridge had been carried away in the night when he recollected that his horse had made a singular bound in the middle of its course in fact he had seen better in the dark than his master and had saved both his own life and his riders by springing over the chasm  in the back settlements of virginia at the bottom of the allegeny mountains near a place called stanton there is a specimen of this mode of scenery in a very grand style a valley winds several leagues in length and yet is scarce any where more than a hundred feet wide though in many places it is two hundred and fifty deep it is adorned in various parts with rock and secured by lofty mountains covered with wood this valley through much of its course is little more than the channel of a considerable river but in one part the rocks approximate so nearly as to form a complete natural arch not only over the river but over the valley itself when nature mimics if i may so speak the works of man for bridges are not a natural production you see the comparative magnificence of her operations not only in their vastness but in the careless simplicity with which they are wrought when the hand of man throws an arch over a river or a chasm he piles up a number of little stones or bricks fixing them with cement carefully and painfully one upon another in a certain regular shape all is nicety exactness and precision if one stone be fixed awry the whole structure is endangered but when nature throws an arch her first operation perhaps is to bury deep in the soil one end of some vast diagonal or horizontal stratum of rock flinging the other end athwart over the chasm or if that be not sufficient she unites it perhaps to the fragment of a rock formed in the same manner on the other side of a valley sometimes she works in a still grander style and forms her arch of one single mass of perforated stone which in her way she hews into a vast irregular surface in both operations it is evident a variety of forms must result sometimes the arch is pointed sometimes it is flat and horizontal and often varied into some nameless form when the grand mass of the edifice is thus reared nature proceeds to ornament she leaves the cornice and the balustrade to human artists her ornaments are of a different kind she first spreads the whole over with soil in the american arch here specified the thickness of the soil including the substratum of rock is at least forty feet this is a depth of soil sufficient for trees of considerable size many of which adorn the arch among these nature has planted various shrubs and hanging bushes which are often highly colored and streaming down wave in the wind in great profusion then perhaps with one of her broadest pencils she dashes the sides of the rock with a thousand beautiful stains from mosses and other incrusted vegetation of various kinds which finish and complete the operation  thus nature works as if to mock at art and in defiance of her rival powers by these fortuitous and random strokes performing such inimitable feats as she with all her rules can never reach such an arch is the american one we are now surveying which on the authority of an eyewitness i have heard described as a most magnificent structure of the kind sometimes i understand when the water is low the traveller may walk under it survey its massy abutments and looking up admire its tremendous roof raised at the vast height of at least two hundred feet above his head and frosted over with various knobs and rocky protuberances which have stood for ages though they continually threaten ruin when he has satisfied his curiosity below he may find a path which leads him to the top there he meets a commodious road which is the only passage the inhabitants have over the valley he finds also in different parts a rude rocky parapet and if his curiosity carry him farther he may cling to some wellrooted plant and have a perpendicular view to the river below as terrific as the view he had just had over his head he will probably see also on one side the river as it approaches and on the other as it retires many beauties i doubt not might likewise be pointed out from this station but what i have heard chiefly noticed are the rocky hills which environ the valley and shoot into it here and there in vast promontories covered with stately pines and oaks which perhaps flourished as they now do in the days of columbus let us now return to humbler scenes  the channel of the lid though contracted at the bridge soon widens both below it and above and would afford many beautiful scenes to those who had leisure to explore them this river rises about three or four miles above lidford on the edge of dartmore and flowing through a barren plain finds a small rocky barrier through which it has in a course of ages worn a whimsical passage as it issues from the check it meets with here it falls about thirty feet into a small dell which was not represented to us as a scene of much beauty but a little farther the banks rise on each side vegetation riots the stream descends by a winding and rapid course and the skreens though small are often beautifully adorned with wood and rock by this time the river approaches the bridge where it is lost in the narrowness of the channel and as i have just observed becomes almost subterranean  from the bridge we proceeded directly to what are emphatically called the falls of lidford which are about three miles below we alighted at a farmhouse and were conducted on foot to the brow of a steep woody hill from which we had a grand view of lidfordcastle which appeared now at a distance more proudly seated than it seemed to be when we rode past it of the river we saw nothing but could easily make out its channel under the abutments of grand promontories which marked its course  having viewed this noble landscape we descended the hill by a difficult winding path and at the bottom found the lid the appearance which the river and its appendages made here from the lower grounds were equally pleasing though not so grand as from the higher indeed no part of this magnificent scenery would be a disgrace to the wildest and most picturesque country  the fall of the river which brought us hither and which is the least considerable part of the scenery for we had heard nothing of these noble views is a mere gardenscene the steep woody hilt whose shaggy sides we had descended forms at the bottom in one of its envelopes a sort of little woody theater rather indeed too lofty when compared with its breadth if nature had been as exact as art would have been in observing proportion down the central part of it which is lined with smooth rock the river falls this rocky cheek is narrow at the top but it widens as it descends taking probably the form of the stream when it is full at the time we saw it it was rather a spout than a cascade for though it slides down a hundred and eighty feet it does not meet one obstruction in its whole course except a little check in the middle when the springs are low and the water has not quantity enough to push itself forward in one current i have been told it sometimes falls in various little streams against the irregularities of the rock and is dashed into a kind of vapoury rain which has a good effect  this cascade it seems is not formed by the waters of the lid as we had supposed from its name but by a little stream which runs into that river rising in the higher grounds at the distance of about two miles from the cascade  sect xix from lidford we found a cheerful country to tavistock in our way we passed brentor which we had seen at a distance when we first saw the castle of lidford it is seated on the top of a mountain and was enveloped when we rode past it in all the majesty of darkness in fact it was so much immersed in clouds that we could not even distinguish its form and if we had not seen it before at a distance we should have been at a loss to have known what it was though we should certainly have thought it rather a castle than a church how very lofty its situation is may be supposed from its being a good seamark in opening plymouth harbor though it stands at the distance of twenty miles from the sea  at tavistock from the appearance which the river tavey makes at the bridge it is probable there may be some beautiful scenes along its banks but we had not time to explore them  as to the abbey though it was once of mitred dignity and though a considerable portion of it still remains we did not observe a single passage that was worth our notice what is left is worked up into barns mills and dwellinghouses it may give the antiquarian pleasure to reverse all this metamorphosis to trace back the stable to the abbotts lodge the mill to the refectory and the malthouse to the chapel but the picturesque eye is so far from looking at these deeds of economy under the idea of pleasure that it passes by them with disdain as heterogeneous absurdities  from tavistock our next stage was to launceston through what seemed an unpleasant country but the whole road was involved in so thick a fog that we saw but little of it where we could have wished the fog to clear up it fortunately did at a place called axworthy here we descended a steep winding woody hill through the trees of which we had beautiful views of tufted groves and other objects on the opposite side at the bottom we found the tamar a fine stream adorned with a picturesque bridge  the road soon brought us to launceston the capital of cornwall which is a handsome town the castle was formerly esteemed one of the strongest fortresses of the west as we may suppose at least from the name it bore which was that of castleterrible during the civil wars of charles i it continued among the last supports of the royal cause in those parts though it has suffered great dilapidations since that time its remains are still respectable and what is more to the purpose at present they are picturesque the great gate and road up to it and the towers that adorn it make a good picture the stately citadel makes a still better it is raised on a lofty eminence and consists of a round tower encompassed by the ruins of a circular wall in which through a wide breach you discover the internal structure to more advantage the construction of this whole fortress is thought to have been very curious and they who wish to have a full account of it may be gratified in borlases history of cornwall    a little to the north of launceston lies werrington an estate belonging to the duke of northumberland the park contains many beautiful scenes consisting of hanging lawns and woods with a considerable stream the air running through it in some parts where the ground is high the views are extensive many antiquarians suppose this to have been the seat of orgar earl of devonshire whose beautiful daughter elfrida is the subject of one of the most affecting stories in the english history and one of the purest dramatic compositions in the english language  somewhere in this neighborhood lived thomasine percival at what time i find not but the story of this extraordinary woman is still current in the country she was originally a poor girl and being beautiful had the fortune to marry a rich clothier who dying early left her a welljointured widow a second advantageous match and a second widowhood increased her jointure being yet in the bloom of youth and beauty her third husband was sir john percival a wealthy merchant of london of which he was lord mayor he also left her a widow with a large accession of fortune possessed of this accumulated property she retired to her native country where she spent her time and fortune altogether in works of generosity and charity she repaired roads built bridges pensioned poor people and portioned poor girls setting an example which should never be forgotten among the extraordinary things of this country  from launceston we traveled as far into cornwall as bodmin through a coarse naked country and in all respects as uninteresting as can well be conceived of wood in every shape it was utterly destitute  having heard that the country beyond bodmin was exactly like what we had already passed we resolved to travel no farther in cornwall and instead of visiting the landsend as we had intended we took the road to lescard proposing to visit plymouth in our return  an antiquarian it is probable might find more amusement in cornwall than in almost any country in england even along the road we saw stones and other objects which seemed to bear marks both of curiosity and antiquity some of the stones appear plainly to be monumental the famous hurlers we did not see  the naturalist also the botanist and the fossilist especially the last might equally find cornwall a country full of interesting objects here his search would be rewarded by a great variety of metals fossils stones pebbles and earths  here too the historian might trace the various scenes of druid rites and of roman and danish power here also he might investigate some of the capital actions of the civil wars of the last century and follow the footsteps of fairfax sir beville grenville lord hopton and other great commanders in the west the battle of stratton in which the last of those generals commanded was an action masterly enough to have added laurels to caesar or the king of prussia indeed we could have wished to have gone a few miles farther to the north of this country to have investigated the scene of this action lord clarendon has described it so accurately that it can hardly be mistaken it was a hill steep on all sides bordering if i understand him rightly on a sandy common on the top were encamped a body of   00 of the parliament forces with thirteen pieces of cannon under the earl of stamford at five oclock in the morning on the   th of may      the royalists attacked them with very inferior force in four divisions who mounted four different parts of the hill at once after a wellfought day they all met about three in the afternoon at the top and congratulated each other on having cleared the hill of the enemy and taken their camp baggage ammunition and cannon the scene of so notable an exploit may be still perhaps pointed out by the inhabitants of the country from lord clarendons description however it may certainly be found  it is probable also that in a picturesque light many of the castles of this county might have deserved attention many of the coasts might have amused us with elegant sweeping lines and many of the bays might have been nobly hung with rockey scenery we should have wished also to have heard the winds howl among the bleak promontories of the landsend to have seen through a clear evening the light fall indistinctly on the distant isles of scilly and to have viewed the waves beating round the rocks of that singular situation mount st michael the loss of this last scene we regretted more than any thing else but to travel over deserts of dreariness in quest of two or three objects seemed to be buying them at too high a price especially as it is possible they might have disappointed us in the end many a time has the credulous traveller gone in quest of scenes on the information of others and has found such is the difference of opinions that what gave his informant pleasure has given him disgust  sect xx in returning from bodmin we passed over that part of bradocdowns where lord hoptons prowess was again shown in giving a considerable check to the parliaments forces in those parts this wild heath and much of the neighboring country is in the same style of dreary landscape with that we had found between launceston and bodmin so very undisciplined the country still is that the wild stags of nature in many parts claim it as their own we did not see any of them but we were told they sometimes show themselves on the high moors about bodmin and lescard  and yet these are the lands wild as they are that are the richest of the country they bear little corn it is true but it is very immaterial what the surface produces the harvest lies beneath in this neighborhood some of the richest of the cornish mines are found and lescard where we now were is one of the coinagetowns as they are called of these towns there are five which are scattered about the different parts of cornwall where mines are most frequent after the tin is pounded and washed from the impurities of the mine it is melted separated from its dross and run into large square blocks containing each about three hundred pounds weight in this form it is conveyed to the coinagetown where it is assayed and stamped this stamp makes it a saleable commodity  we had not however the curiosity to enter any of these mines our business was only on the surface great part of this country it is true is in a state of nature which in general is a state of picturesque beauty but here it was otherwise our views not only wanted the most necessary appendages of landscape wood and water but even form we might perhaps have seen this part of cornwall in an unfavourable light as the sweeping lines of a country depend much for their beauty on the light under which they are seen but to us they appeared heavy unbroken and unaccommodating in the wild parts of scotland where this dreariness of landscape often occurred we had still a distance to make amends for the foregrounds it was rarely that we had not a flowing line of blue mountains which gave a grandeur and dignity even to an impoverished scene but in these wild parts of cornwall we sometimes saw a face of country which is rather uncommon in the wildest scenes of nature without a single beauty to recommend it  this dreariness however had begun to improve before we arrived at lescard plantations though meagre only arose in various parts and the country assumed somewhat of a more pleasing air particularly on the right toward lestwithiel the high grounds formed intersections something like a castle appeared on one of them and the woody decorations of landscape in some degree took place  as we left lescard the country still improved extensive sides of hills covered with wood arose among the foregrounds and ranging in noble sweeps retired into distance these bursts of sylvan scenery appeared with particular beauty at a place called brownswoods here too we were entertained with an incidental beauty the whole sky in front was hung with dark clouds to the very skirts of the horizon behind us shone the brightest ray of an evening sun not yet indeed setting but very splendid and all this splendour was received by the tops of trees which rose directly in front and being opposed to the gloomy tint behind them made a most brilliant appearance this is among the most beautiful effects of an eveningsun these effects are indeed as various as the forms of landscape which receive them but nothing is more richly enlightened than the tufted foliage of a wood  we now approached the sea at least the river tamer which is near its estuary and as this coast is perhaps one of the most broken and irregular of the whole island we had several views of little creaks and bays which being surrounded with wood are often beautiful but they are beautiful at fullsea only at the ebb of the tide each lake becomes an oozy channel  the picturesque beauty of a scene of this kind once cost a poor traveller dear he had long been in quest of a situation for a house and found one at length offered to sale exactly suited to his taste it was a lake scene in which a little peninsula sloping gently into the water presented from its eminence a pleasing view of the whole charmed with what he had seen he ruminated in his way home on the various improvements it might admit and fearing a disappointment entered without farther scrutiny into an agreement with the owner for a considerable sum but what was his astonishment when on taking possession his lake was gone and in its room a bed of filthy ooze how did he accuse his rashness and blame his precipitate folly in vain he wished to retract his bargain in vain he pleaded that he had been deceived that he had bought a lake and that in fact the object of his purchase was gone you might have examined it better cried the unfeeling gentlemen of the law what have we to do with your ideas of picturesque beauty we sold you an estate and if you imposed upon yourself you have nobody else to blame  from the road as we passed we had a view of trematoncastle where a stannery court is still kept which had formerly very extensive privileges trematonlaw is almost to this day an object of reverence among the common people of cornwall  soon after saltashbay opened on the left and on the right hamoaz harbor with many a gallant ship of war at anchor upon its ample bosom beyond the hamoaz rose the hanging lawns and woods of mount edgcomb forming a noble background to the scene  at saltash we had good views of the river tamer both above and below the town a sweeping bay is formed on each side in many places at least a mile in breadth in both directions the banks are high and the water retires beautifully behind jutting promontories  having crossed the tamer at saltash we had four miles farther to plymouth through the whole way we had various views of the the sound mount edgcomb plymouth harbor hamoaz plymouth town and plymouth dock from all these views together we were able to collect a clear geographical idea of this celebrated harbor  two rivers the tamer and the plym the first of which is considerable meeting the sea at the distance of about three miles asunder form at their separate mouths two indented bays these two bays open into a third which is the receptacle of both and larger than either the bay formed by the tamer is called the hamoaz that formed by the plym is called plymouth harbor and the large bay into which they both open is called the sound at the bottom of the sound where the two bays communicate with it lies st nicolas a large island fortified with a castle and strong works which are intended to defend the entrance into both these inlets the entrance into hamoaz is very intricate for the island can be passed only at that end next plymouth which makes the passage narrow and winding the entrance at the other end is wide and direct but is defended by a dangerous shelf of hidden rocks the situation of which appears plainly at low water from the ripling of the tide above them the cornish side of hamoaz is formed by mount edgcomb  sect xxi plymouthdock or docktown as it is often called lies at the entrance of hamoaz and is about two miles distant from the town of plymouth it is chiefly worth visiting as it is the station of the docks storehouses gunwharfs and other appendages of this noble arsenal which is a wonderful sight to those who have seen nothing of the kind the citadel too and the victuallingoffice which is close to it the bakehouse also and the slaughterhouse whatever unpleasant ideas may accompany the latter are all grand objects of their kind  among the things which attracted our attention at plymouthdock were the marble quarries we saw several of the blocks polished and thought them more beautiful than any foreign marble the ground is dark brown the veining red and blue the colors are soft in themselves and intermix agreeably whereas in the sienna and other foreign marbles there is often amidst all the richness of their colors a glare and harshness in their mixtures disagreeable to the picturesque eye which always wishes to unite harmony with coloring in the verde antique the tints are sufficiently soft but they are so much the same and broken into such minute parts that they have no effect when exhibited in quantity after all however different kinds of marble are suited to different purposes but i think there are two rules which should direct the choice of all marbles in columns and other large surfaces the parts should be large that is the veins of the marble should be conspicuous i think also that no marble in any situation can be beautiful unless there be a degree of softness and harmony in it if it be veined for instance the veins should in some parts strike out boldly and in other parts sink and retire as it were into the ground of the marble leaving only slight traces of their colors here and there behind them in both these respects i have thought the columns in the hall at kiddelston in derbyshire models of beauty it will however be understood that when form or inscription is required veined marble of any kind is improper in some works as in most kinds of ornaments the marble itself is the principal object in others as in statuary and inscription the marble is only the vehicle  with the plymouth marble in its rough state most of the buildings of the dock are constructed the refuse burns into excellent lime between launceston and kellington i have heard there is a species of marble found almost purely white but as i never heard of its being applied to any use i suppose it is only of a spurious kind  there is also another species of beautiful stone much in use at plymouth which is of cornish extraction and is found chiefly on the moors from whence it is called the moorstone the best kind of it is a perfect granite and will bear a polish though the spars sometimes fly off in the operation and leave an unequal surface the more friable kind of this stone spangles the road with an excellent binding gravel  among the sights of a dockyard the careening of a ship is not the least picturesque we happened to see an operation of this kind in great perfection the ship itself lying on one side is a good object its great lines which in an upright state are too regular take now more pleasing forms and while the rolling volumes of smoke harmonize the whole the fire glimmering sparkling or blazing is sometimes enveloped in these black voluminous eddies and sometimes brightening up breaks through them in transient spiry blazes  but as light is best supported by shade a conflagration by night from whatever cause produced has the grandest effect by day the effect depends chiefly on the smoke aided perhaps by some accidental objects as it was here by the pitchy side of a vessel but at night the darkness of the hemisphere makes the grandest opposition the light is concentrated to one spot only variously broken as it may happen to fall on different objects at the same time it receives the full beauty of gradation the ruddy glow which spreads far and wide into the regions of night graduates as it recedes from its center and becoming fainter and fainter is at last totally lost in the shades of darkness a conflagration therefore by night presents us with the justest ideas of the great principles of light and shade it gives a body of light variously broken and at length dying gradually away  a common bonfire surrounded by a few figures scattered about it in groups forms often a beautiful scene that passage in which shakespeare describes the campfires of the french and english gives us a different picture in that description the fires are distant and the paly flames just umber the faces that watch round them touched with the pencil they should be marked only as ruddy specks all distinction of feature is lost but round a bonfire on the spot you see action and passion distinctly represented the hat waved the agitated body and the lips of the bawling mouth all marked with the strongest effects of light while some of the figures which stand between the eye and the fire are as picturesquely distinguished by being totally in shade  grand indeed though dreadful is the conflagration of houses especially if those houses have any dignity of form the bursts of fire from windows and doors the illumination of the internal parts of a structure and the varied force of the fire on the different materials it meets with which may be more or less combustible are all circumstances highly picturesque it may be added also that wind makes a great difference in the appearance of a conflagration and yet i know not whether its most splendid effects are not seen best in a calm  but the operations of war produce still grander effects of this kind the burning of ships is productive of greater ideas and more picturesque circumstances than the burning of houses the very reflections from the water add great beauty but these representations are among the difficult attempts of the pencil vanderveld who did every thing well and burnt many a ship in a truly picturesque manner failed most in his grandest work the burning of the armada some parts of his pictures on this subject at hampton court are masterly but in general they are but an indifferent collection of vandervelds works probably the subject was imposed on him and when that is the case the painter seldom arrives at the excellence which his own subjects produce it cannot well indeed be otherwise for the choice of a subject is in other words that just arrangement of it which he conceives ia his own mind both in regard to composition and light so that when a subject is imposed the arrangement is to seek and it is probable he may not easily find one that suits his subject besides he sets to it without that enthusiasm which should animate his pencil when the empress of russia therefore employed sir joshua reynolds she did well in leaving him to choose his own subject one thing indeed which injures vanderveld in burning the armada picturesquely is the number of fires he is obliged to introduce which can never have so good an effect as one  but among all the grand exhibitions of this kind the siege of gibraltar furnishes two of the noblest they had every circumstance to recommend them they were grand in their own nature they were connected with great and prosperous events which is a recommendation of any subject and they were actions performed in the night the first relates to the burning of the enemys batteries by a sally from the garrison the second to the destruction of the battering ships i shall give them both in the words of a published journal of that siege in which the effects are well described see drinkwaters account of the siege of gibraltar p  0    nov         the batteries were soon in a state for the firefaggots to operate and the flames spread with astonishing rapidity into every part the column of fire and smoke which rolled from the works beautifully illumined the troops and neighboring objects forming all together a coup dail not possible to be described  sept         about an hour after midnight one of the batteringships was completely in flames and by two oclock she appeared one continued blaze from stem to stern between three and four oclock six other ships were on fire the light thrown out on all sides by the flames illumined the rock and all the neighboring objects forming with the constant flashes of our cannon a mingled scene of sublimity and terror see drinkwaters account of the siege p      the former of these scenes would have made a good picture the latter if represented should be taken when one ship only was completely in flames with small appearances of fire in some of the others  at the end of the  th book of homer we have the effects of an illumination very picturesquely detailed hector aving driven the greeks to their intrenchments was prevented by the night from completing his victory resolving therefore to push it the next morning instead of retreating to troy he encamped under its walls in the field of battle where unnumbered flames before proud ilion blaze and lighten glimmering xanthus with their rays the long reflections of the distant fires gleam on the walls and tremble on the spires a thousand piles the dusky horrors gild and shoot a shadowy luster over the field full fifty guards each flaming pile attend whose umberd arms by sits thick flashes send homer however has nothing to do with most of these picturesque images they are only to be found in popes translation though it may be fashionable to depreciate this work as a translation it must at least be owned that pope who was a painter has enriched his original with many of the ideas of his art  but still in all these operations however grand the fire ravages only the works of man to see a conflagration in perfection we must see the elements engaged nothing is eminently grand but the exertion of an element the effect of the air is grand when excited by a storm piles of earth or mountains are superbly grand the ocean in a storm is still grander and the effect of fire when let loose in its full fury carries the idea of grandeur to a still greater height  one of the most astonishing effects of this kind which is any where to be met with may be found in the  0th volume of the philosophical transactions in a letter from sir william hamilton it contains the account of an eruption of mount vesuvius in the autumn of the year      the whole relation is full of grand ideas but the parts of it to which i particularly allude were the concluding efforts of the eruption from which i shall select a few circumstances  the relater who was an eyewitness tells us that on saturday the  th of august as he was watching the agitations of the mountain from the mole of naples which gave him a distinct view of it a violent storm came on just as the volcano was throwing out some of its fiercest fires the clouds of black smoke sometimes covered great part of the fire at other times disparting presented it in fuller view this awful conjunction of light and shadow was farther assisted by various tints which were produced by lights reverberated from the clouds and by pale flashes of lightning which were continually issuing from them  but the appearance of the volcano the next day was still more sublime about nine oclock in the morning a loud report issued from the mountain which shook the houses of portici to such a degree as to alarm the inhabitants for their safety and drive them into the streets immediately volumes of liquid fire or rather as the relater describes it fountains of redhot lava shot upwards to such an amazing height that they seemed three times as high as the mountain itself which is computed to rise three thousand feet from the level of the sea together with these volumes of liquid fire vast clouds of the blackest smoke succeeded each other in bursts intercepting this splendid brightness here and there by masses of the darkest hue  the wind was southwest and though gentle was sufficient to put the smoke into motion removing it by degrees so as to form behind the fire a vast curtain stretching over great part of the hemisphere to add to the solemnity this black curtain was continually disparted by pale momentary electric fires in the mean time the other parts of the sky were clear and the stars shone bright the contrast was glorious beyond imagination the splendour which was sufficiently balanced by the shadowy curtain behind it illumined the sea which was perfectly calm far and wide and added much to the sublimity of the scene  some of the fiery lava being thrown on mount somna in the neighborhood of vesuvius its woods were frequently in a blaze this introduced a secondary light very different in its tint either from the fiery red of the volcano or the silvery blue of the electric fire  this grand and awful vision in which as sublime an effect of light and shade was presented as nature perhaps ever exhibited before lasted about half an hour  i make no apology for introducing all these grand effects of fire as i never think myself out of sight of my subject when i can lay hold of any picturesque idea  sect xxii our curiosity having been gratified among the dockyards at plymouth led us next to visit mount edgcomb  the promontory of mount edgcomb running a considerable way into the sea forms as was just observed one of the cheeks of the entrance of hamoazharbour which is here half a mile across the whole promontory is four or five miles long and three broad in shape it is a perfect dorsum high in the middle and sloping gradually on both sides toward the sea in some places it is rocky and abrupt  lord edgcombs house stands half way up the ascent on the plymouth side in the midst of a park containing an intermixture of wood and lawn it makes a handsome appearance with a tower at each corner but pretends only to be a comfortable dwelling  the great object of mount edgcomb is the grandeur of the views as we advanced toward the summit of the promontory we saw in various exhibitions on one side all the intricacies and creeks which form the harbor of plymouth with an extensive country spreading beyond it into very remote distance and scattered with a variety of objects among which we distinguished the wellknown features of brentor  the other side of the promontory overlooks the sound which is the great rendezvous of the fleets sitted out at plymouth though seamen speak very indifferently of its anchorage one of the boundaries of this extensive bay is a reach of land running out into pointed rocks the other is a lofty smooth promontory called the ramshead the top of this promontory is adorned with a tower from which notice is given at plymouth by a variety of signals of the number of ships and their quality that appear in the offing  between the ramshead and mount edgcomb is formed a smaller inlet called causandbay at the head of which lies kingston before this little town rode a large fleet of what appeared to be fishing boats but we were informed that most of them were smuggling vessels  the simplicity of the few objects which form the sound on one side made a pleasing contrast with the intricacies of the plymouthcoast on the other  at the distance of about three leagues from the ramshead stands the edystone lighthouse we could just discern it as it caught a gleam of light like a distant sail  having viewed from the higher grounds of mount edgcomb this immense landscape which is on both sides a mere map of the country and has little picturesque beauty especially on the plymouth side we descended the promontory and were carried on a lower stage round its utmost limits  the grounds here are profusely planted on that side which overlooks causandbay the plantations are only young but on the other which consists of at least half the promontory they are wellgrown and form the most pleasing scenes about mount edgcomb that immense map as it lay before the eye in one view from the higher grounds and appeared variously broken and scattered was now divided into portions and set off by good foregrounds some of these views are pleasing but in general they are not picturesque a large piece of water full of moving objects makes a part of them all and this will always present at least an amusing scene  the trees both evergreens and deciduous are wonderfully fine considering their seaaspect but chiefly the pinerace seems to thrive and among these the pinaster which one should imagine from its hardy appearance to be indigenous to the soil the woodman would dislike that great abundance of hoary moss which bedecks both it and most of the other plants of this marine scenery but to the picturesque eye the vegetation seems perfect and the moss a beauty it is moss of a peculiar form at least of an unusual growth its hue is generally cerulean with a strong touch here and there of naplesyellow mixed with other pleasing tints which being scattered profusely about the whole plantation give it an uncommon richness in these woods the arbutus grows in great perfection and many other shrubs which are generally found only in sheltered situations  besides a luxuriance of wood a variety of rocky scenery embellished our walk especially about the vertical point of the promontory it is a wellcolored brown rock which appears in all forms nor is it bald and naked but every where garnished with twirling boles and hanging shrubs  upon the whole though there are many formalities about mount edgcomb terraces particularly and vistas near the house a few puerilities also the reader will recollect when this was written  and too little advantage taken every where of the circumstances which nature has pointed out yet it is certainly a noble situation and very well worth the attention of a traveller  sect xxiii among the curiosities of this coast the edystone lighthouse is not one of the least about three leagues beyond plymouthsound in a line nearly between startpoint and the lizard lie a number of low rocks exceedingly dangerous at all times but especially when the tides are high which render them invisible on these rocks it had long been thought necessary to place some monitory signal but the difficulty of constructing a lighthouse was great one of the rocks indeed which compose this reef is considerably larger than the rest yet its dimensions are still narrow it is often covered with water and frequently even in the calmest weather surrounded by a swelling sea which makes it difficult to land upon it and much more so to carry on any work of time and labor the uncommon tumult of the sea in this place is occasioned by a peculiarity in the rocks as they all slope and point to the northeast they spread their inclined sides of course to the swelling tides and storms of the atlantic and as they continue in this shelving direction many fathoms below the surface of the sea they occasion that violent working of the water which the seamen call a ground swell so that after a storm when the surface of the sea around is perfectly smooth the swells and agitation about these rocks are dangerous from these continual eddies the edystone derives its name  the first lighthouse of any consequence erected on this rock was undertaken by a person of the name of winstanley in the reign of king william mr winstanley does not appear to have been a man of solidity and judgment sufficient to erect an edifice of this kind he had never been noted for any capital work but much celebrated for a variety of trifling and ridiculous contrivances if you set your foot on a certain board in one of his rooms a ghost would start up or if you sat down in an elbowchair its arms would clasp around you his lighthouse which was built of wood partook of his whimsical genius it was finished with galleries and other ornaments which encumbered it without being of any use it was however on the whole much admired as a very ingenious edifice and winstanley certainly deserved the credit of being the first projector of a very difficult work he had fixed it to the rock by twelve massy bars of iron which were let down deep into the body of the stone it was generally indeed thought well founded and the architect himself was so convinced of its stability that he would often say he wished for nothing more than to be shut up in it during a violent storm he at length had his wish for he happened to be in it at the time of that memorable storm on the   th of november   0  which has been already mentioned see pages     and      as the violence however of the tempest came on the terrified architect began to doubt the firmness of his work it trembled in the blast and shook in every joint in vain he made what signals of distress he could invent to bring a boat from the shore the terrors of the storm were such that the boldest vessel durst not face it how long he continued in this melancholy distress is unknown but in the morning no appearance of the lighthouse was left it and all its contents during that terrible night were swept into the sea this catastrophe furnished mr gay with the following simile in his trivia which was written a few years after the event so when famed edystons farshooting ray that led the sailor through the stormy way was from its rocky roots by billows torn and the high turret in the whirlwind born fleets bulged their sides against the craggy land and pitchy ruins blackened all the strand   a lighthouse was again constructed on this rock before the conclusion of queen annes reign it was undertaken by one rudyard who built it also of wood but having seen his predecessors errors avoided them he followed winstanleys idea in the mode of fixing his structure to the rock but he chose a plain circular form without any gallery or useless projecting parts for the storm to fasten on to give stability also to his work he judiciously introduced as ballast at the bottom   0 tons of stone in short every precaution was taken to secure it against the fury of the two elements of wind and water which had destroyed the last but it fell by a third late one night in the year      it was observed from the shore to be on fire its upper works having been constructed of light timber probably could not bear the heat it happened fortunately that admiral west rode with a fleet at that time in the sound and being so near the spot he immediately manned two or three swift boats other boats put off from the shore but though it was not stormy it was impossible to land in the mean time the fire having descended to the lower parts of the building had driven the poor inhabitants upon the skirts of the rock where they were sitting disconsolate when assistance arrived they had the mortification however to find that the boats through fear of being dashed in pieces were obliged to keep aloof at length it was contrived to throw coils of rope upon the rock which the men tied round them and were dragged on board through the sea the case of one of these poor fellows who was above  0 years of age was singular as he had been endeavoring to extinguish the fire in the cupola where it first raged and was looking up the melted lead from the roof came trickling down upon his face and shoulders at plymouth he was put into a surgeons hands and though much hurt he appeared to be in no danger he constantly however affirmed that some of the melted lead had fallen down his throat this was not believed as it was thought he could not have survived such a circumstance in twelve days he died and mr smeaton says he saw the lead after it had been taken out of his stomach and that it weighed seven ounces see mr smeatons account of the edystone   the next lighthouse which is the present one was built by mr smeaton and is constructed on a plan which it is hoped will secure it against every danger it is built entirely of stone in a circular form its foundations are let into a socket in the rock on which it stands and of which it almost makes a part for the stones are all united with the rock and with each other by massy dovetails the cement used in this curious masonry is the lime of watchet see page      from whence mr smeaton contrived to bring it barrelled up in cydercasks for the proprietors will not suffer it to be exported in its crude state the door of this ingenious piece of architecture is only the size of a ships gunport and the windows are mere loopholes denying light to exclude wind when the tide swells above the foundation of the building the light house makes the odd appearance of a structure emerging from the waves but sometimes a wave rises above the very top of it and circling round the whole looks like a column of water till it breaks into foam and subsides  the care of this important beacon is committed to four men two of whom take the charge of it by turns and are relieved every six weeks but as it often happens especially in stormy weather that boats cannot touch at the edystone for many months a proper quantity of salt provision is always laid up as in a ship victualled for a long voyage in high winds such a briny atmosphere surrounds this gloomy solitude from the dashing of the waves that a man exposed to it could not draw his breath at these dreadful intervals the two forlorn inhabitants keep close quarters and are obliged to live in darkness and stench listening to the howling storm excluded in every emergency from the least hope of assistance and without any earthly comfort but what is administered from their confidence in the strength of the building in which they are immured once on relieving this forlorn guard one of the men was found dead his companion choosing rather to shut himself up with a putrefying carcass than by throwing it into the sea to incur the suspicion of murder in fine weather these wretched beings just scramble a little about the edge of the rock when the tide ebbs and amuse themselves with fishing which is the only employment they have except that of trimming their nightly fires  such total inaction and entire seclusion from all the joys and aids of society can only be endured by great religious philosophy which we cannot imagine they feel or by great stupidity which in pity we must suppose they possess  yet though this wretched community is so small we were assured it is generally a scene of misanthropy instead of suffering the recollection of those distresses and dangers in which each is deserted by all but one to endear that one to him we were informed the humors of each were so soured that they preyed both on themselves and on each other if one sat above the other was commonly found below their meals too were solitary each like a brute growling over his food alone  we are sorry to acknowledge a picture like this to be a likeness of human nature in some gentle minds we see the kind affections rejoice in being beckoned even from scenes of innocence mirth and gaiety to mingle the sympathetic tear with affliction and distress but experience shows us that the heart of man is equally susceptible of the malevolent affections and religion joins in confirming the melancholy truth the picturesque eye in the meantime surveys natural and moral evil under characters entirely different darken the storm let loose the winds let the waves overwhelm all that is fair and good the storm will be sublime and the catastrophe pathetic while the moral tempest is dreary without grandeur and the catastrophe afflicting without one picturesque idea  the emolument of this arduous post is twenty pounds a year and provisions while on duty the house to live in may be fairly thrown into the bargain the whole together is perhaps one of the least eligible pieces of preferment in britain and yet from a story which mr smeaton relates it appears there are stations still more ineligible a fellow who got a good livelihood by making leathernpipes for engines grew tired of sitting constantly at work and solicited a lighthouse mans place which as competitors are not numerous he obtained as the edystoneboat was carrying him to take possession of his new habitation one of the boatmen asked him what could tempt him to give up a profitable business to be shut up for months together in a pillar why said the man because i did not like confinement  sect xxiv at plymouth we heard much of the scenery upon the tamer of which we had had a little specimen at axworthy see page      we resolved therefore to navigate that river as far as the weir which is about twentytwo miles above plymouth and as far as we could have the advantage of the tide procuring therefore a good boat and four stout hands from the ocean man of war then lying in the hamoaz we set sail with a flowing tide  the river tamer rises from the mountains of hartland near barnstaplebay in the north of devonshire and taking its course almost due south divides that county from cornwall no river can be a more complete boundary as it approaches plymouth it becomes a noble estuary the hamoaz is esteemed after portsmouth the best station for ships of war upon the british coast this grand bay which was the first scene we investigated on the tamer is about a mile in breadth and seven miles in length though the larger ships we observed seldom to anchor above a league from the sea its banks on each side though rather low are by no means flat they are generally cultivated and the shore is finished by a narrow edging of rock  the next view we had of any consequence was the opening toward st germans on the left this is a creek about three leagues in length the woods of anthony occupy one side of the opening and a house which appeared at a distance in the center is ince a seat of the killigrews  soon after we came in sight of saltash which stands high but affords no very picturesque appearance when we crossed the ferry the day before the views of the creek from the hill presented a beautiful scene both above and below the town see page  0   but when the eye is stationed upon the water the retiring reaches of the river are lost and the landscape is much impaired  our next scene was the opening of the tavey into the tamer sir harry trelawneys house was one of the principal objects of this view the distance was composed chiefly of the dartmore hills the banks of the tamer were still low and cultivated and bore no proportion to the extent of the water which did not begin to contract itself nor the banks to swell till we had proceeded nine or ten miles up the river  the first scene which in any degree engaged our attention was composed of the woods of pentilly on the cornish side the house too is a good object and a building at the bottom of the bank has a picturesque appearance though its dignity was degraded when we learned it was only a limekiln lime is the chief commodity of trade on this river employing many large boats in transporting it and the limekilns which we see in many places on its banks are of such noble dimensions that they may at a little distance be mistaken for castles without any imputation on the understanding they are among the greatest ornaments of the river the background of the scenery of pentilly is a lofty bank adorned with a tower to which belongs a history  mr tilly once the owner of pentillyhouse was a celebrated atheist of the last age he was a man of wit and had by rote all the ribaldry and commonplace jests against religion and scripture which are well suited to display pertness and folly and to unsettle a giddy mind but are offensive to men of sense whatever their opinions may be and are neither intended nor adapted to investigate truth the brilliancy of mr tillys wit however carried him a degree farther than we often meet with in the annals of profaneness in general the witty atheist is satisfied with entertaining his contemporaries but mr tilly wished to have his sprightliness known to posterity with this view in ridicule of the resurrection he obliged his executors to place his dead body in his usual garb and in his elbowchair upon the top of a hill and to arrange on a table before him bottles glasses pipes and tobacco in this situation he ordered himself to be immured in a tower of such dimensions as he prescribed where he proposed he said patiently to wait the event all this was done and the tower still enclosing its tenant remains as a monument of his impiety and profaneness the country people shudder as they go near it  religio pavidos terrebat agrestes dira loci  sylvam saxumque tremebant   as we sailed farther up the river we came in view of the rocks and woods of coteil which are still on the cornish side and afford some beautiful scenery here we had grand sweeping hills covered with wood at the bottom of one of them stands a noble limekilncastle which is relieved by a lofty background  near the bottom of another stands a small gothic ruin situated with much picturesque beauty in a woody recess it was formerly a votive chapel built by a chief of the coteil family though some say by one of the edgcombs its founder had engaged on the unsuccessful side during one of the periods of the dubious wars of york and lancaster his party being beaten he fled for his life and as he was a man of consequence was closely pursued the tamer opposed his flight he made a short vow to the virgin mary threw himself into the river and swam safe to the promontory before which we now lay on our oars his upper garment which he had thrown off floated down the stream and giving occasion to believe he had perished checked the ardour of pursuit in the mean time coteil lurked in his own woods till a happier moment and in the day of security raised this chapel to the holy virgin his protectress who had the full honor of his escape  we have the story sometimes told otherwise and given to the times of charles i but a story of so late a date one should imagine might have been better ascertained than this seems to be and if the chapel have any connection with the story it is much more credible that a votivechapel should have been erected in the   th century when we know they were common than in the   th when such structures were never heard of  at coteilhouse we landed which is entirely surrounded with wood and shut out from the river if it were a little opened it might both see and be seen to advantage to the river particularly it would present a good object as it stands on a bold knoll and is built in the form of a castle but it is a deserted mansion and occupied only as a farmhouse here we refreshed ourselves with tea and larded our bread after the fashion of the country with clouted cream  round this old mansion grew some noble trees and among them the spanish chestnut full grown and spread out in huge massy limbs we thought these chestnuts scarce inferior in grandeur to the proudest oaks the chestnut on which salvator rosa has hung edipus is exactly one of them  we had now sailed a considerable way up the tamer and during the whole voyage had been almost solely obliged to the cornish shores for amusement but the devonshire coast as if only collecting its strength burst out upon us at calstock in a grander display of lofty banks adorned with wood and rock than any we had yet seen and continued without interruption through the space of a league  but it is impossible to describe scenes which though strongly marked have no peculiar features in nature these lofty banks are infinitely varied the face of each rock is different it projects differently it is naked or it is adorned or if adorned its ornaments are of different kinds in short natures variations are as infinite on the face of a rock as in the face of a man each requires a distinct portrait to characterize it justly while language can no more give you a full idea of one than it can of the other  with the views of calstock we finished our voyage up the tamer and though the banks of the river were diversified both with rocks and woods with open and contracted country yet considering the space through which we had sailed and the high commendations we had heard of this river it was on the whole less a scene of amusement than we had expected to find it we had a few grand views but in general the navigators of the tamer find only some of the common characteristics of a river  longos superant flexus variisque teguntur arboribus viridesque secant placido aequore sylvas all is beautiful sylvan and highly pleasing but if you ask what we saw we can only say in general that we saw rocks trees groves and woods in short the whole is amusing but not picturesque it is not sufficiently divided into portions adapted to the pencil  the scenery itself on the banks of the tamer is certainly good but had it even been better the form of the river could not have shown it to much picturesque advantage the reaches are commonly too long and admit little winding we rarely trace the course of the river by the perspective of one skreen behind another which in river views is often a beautiful circumstance and yet if one of the banks be lofty broken into large parts and falling away in good perspective the length of the reach may possibly be an advantage in some parts of the tamer we had this grand lengthened view but in other parts we wished to have had its continued reaches more contracted  these remarks however it must be observed affect a river only in navigating it when we are thus on a level with its surface we have rarely more than a foreground at most we have only a first distance but when we take a higher stand and view a remote river lofty banks become then an encumbrance and instead of discovering they hide its winding course when the distance becomes still more remote the valley through which the river winds should be open and the country flat to produce the most pleasing effect  in the immense rivers that traverse continents these ideas are all lost as you sail up such a vast surface of water as the mississippi for instance the first striking observation is that perspective views are entirely out of the question if you wish to examine either of its shores you must desert the main channel and knowing that you are in a river make to one side or the other  as you approach within half a league of one of the sides you will perhaps see stretches of sandbanks or islands covered with wood extending along the shore beyond the reach of the eye which have been formed by depredations made on the coast by the river for when the winds rage this vast surface of water is agitated like a sea and has the same power over its shores as the trees of these regions are in as grand a style as the rivers themselves you sometimes see vast excavations where the water has undermined the banks in which immense roots are laid bare and being washed clean from the soil appear twisted into various forms like the gates of a cathedral  though the banks of the mississippi we are told are generally flat you frequently see beautiful scenery upon them among the vast woods which adorn them are many groves of cypresses to which a creeping plant called the liane is often attached what kind of flower it bears i have not heard but if it be not too profuse it must be very ornamental hanging from tree to tree and connecting a whole cypressgrove together with rich festoons  these woods are interspersed also with lawns where you see the wild deer of the country feeding in herds as they espy the vessel gliding past they all raise their heads at once and standing a moment with pricked ears in amazement they turn suddenly round and darting across the plain hide themselves in the woods  from scenes of this kind as you coast the river you come perhaps to low marshy grounds where swamps overgrown with reeds and rushes but of enormous growth extend through endless tracts which a days sailing cannot leave behind in these marshes the alligator is often seen basking near the edge of the river into which he instantly plunges on the least alarm or perhaps you descry his hideous form creeping along the sedges sometimes hid and sometimes discovered as he moves through a closer or more open path  contrasts like these between the tamer and the mississippi are amusing and set each scene off to more advantage the tamer may be called a noble river but what is it in point of grandeur when compared with the mississippi which at the distance of two thousand miles from the sea is a wider stream than the tamer where it falls into it on the other hand though the mississippi no doubt has its beauty yet as a river it loses as much in this respect when compared with the tamer as it gained in point of grandeur in the mississippi you seek in vain for the rocky banks and winding shores which adorn the tamer and are the glory of riverscenery  to these contrasts i shall just add one more as lord macartney and his suit in their way to canton sailed down one of the rivers of china they passed under a rock of gray marble which arose from the water to the amazing perpendicular height of six hundred feet it was shagged with wood and continued varying its form but still preserving its immensity through the space of at least two miles in some parts its summit beetled frightfully over the river and gave an involuntary shudder to the passenger as he passed under its tremendous shade  sect xxv as we were leaving plymouth the town was greatly agitated with an account received that morning of the battle of lexington which happened on the   th of april we had been chiefly in company with general bell of the marines and as a large detachment from that corpse was with the troops in america the generals house was crowded with people inquiring after their relations and friends while they who looked farther conceived that as blood was now drawn all hope of accommodation was over  we left plymouth under the impression of these melancholy ideas till a succession of new objects dislodged them by the ashburton road we took our route to exeter  about three miles from plymouth stands salterham the seat of mr parker it is mount edgcomb in miniature being situated on a small peninsula and surrounded not indeed by the sea but by a considerable creek  mr parker commands a view of st nicholass island mount edgcomb and the ramshead but though the objects are great they did not appear to us either picturesque in themselves or agreeably combined the ground particularly beyond the creek is ill shaped  the soil of salterham seems as unkindly to vegetation as mount edgcomb is friendly to it and the creek it stands on is entirely forsaken by the tide at ebb and becomes a mere channel of ooze perhaps in our remarks here we were too much under the impression of the gloomy ideas we had brought from plymouth  from salterham we pursued our route to ivybridge where as far as we could judge from the appearance of the river we should have met with some beautiful scenery if we had had time to examine it  from hence we proceeded to ashburton which lies among hills and chudleigh where are stonequarries which at a distance have the appearance of a grand range of natural rock here the bishops of exeter formerly resided the ruins of the episcopal palace may still be traced  we were but little amused however with any thing we saw in this country the whole of it from plymouth is but an uninteresting scene its very appearance on a map shows in some degree its unpicturesque form it is intersected with several rivers which run in valleys between opposite hills these hills we were continually ascending or descending when we had mounted one hill we were presented with the side of another so that all distance was shut out and all variety of country intercepted a pleasant glade here and there at the dip of a hill we sometimes had but this did not compensate for that tiresome sameness of ascent and descent which runs through the country  at chudleigh we left the great exeterroad to see mamhead and powderhamcastle in our way we mounted a sort of grand natural terrace about seven miles in length and three in breadth though this indeed is a broader surface than we commonly distinguish by that appellation the name of this eminence is haldownhill  from hence we had a grand extensive and in many parts a picturesque distance consisting first of the whole course of the ex from exeter to the sea the city of exeter the town of topsham sir francis drakes and powderhamcastle beyond these objects all of which seemed in the distance to adorn the banks of the river the eye ranged over immense plains and woods hills and vales of these the vale of honiton and other celebrated vales made a part but they were mere specks too inconsiderable for the eye to fix on distance had pressed all the hilly boundaries of these vales flat to the surface at least it had so diminished them that the proudest appeared only as a ripple on the ocean the extreme parts of this vast landscape were bounded by the long range of sedburyhills which were tinged when we saw them with a light either hue scarce one shade removed from the color of the sky the whole immense scene therefore without the least interruption from the hills of the country faded gradually into air  a view of this kind gives us a just idea of the surface of the globe we inhabit we talk of its inequalities in a lofty style its mountains ascend the skies its valleys sink down into depths profound whereas in fact its inequalities are nothing when compared with its magnitude if a comprehensive eye placed at a distance from the surface of the earth were capable of viewing a whole hemisphere together all its inequalities great as we make them mount caucasus the andes teneriffe and all the loftiest mountains of the globe would be compressed like the view before us and the whole would appear perfectly smooth to us a bowling green is a level plain but a minute insect finds it full of inequalities  in surveying the windings of the ex in its course to the sea we are reminded of a sketch by a great master of the course of aufente it is slightly touched indeed but with great spirit and the distances are particularly well marked we have it at the end of the seventh aeneid where the picturesque poet led by his subject to mention some of the countries of italy gives us this pleasing view  queis jupiter anxurus arvis praesidet et viridi gaudens feronia luco qua saturae jacet atra palus gelidusque per imas quaerit iter valles atque in mare conditur ufens in this landscape we have first the foreground composed of the temple of jupiter anxur proudly seated and overlooking the neighboring country  queis jupiter anxurus arvis praesidet  the immediate distance consists of the temple of feronia marked by a grove which adorns it and a lake lying at its foot  viridi gaudens feronia luco qua saturae jacet atra palus  the lake to which the poet gives the epithet atra had that deep black clear hue which claude and poussin well knew produced often the best effect in the second distance all color is gone and the fading landscape of course takes its aerial tinge it is enough now if a few principal objects are dimly seen a winding river is the most distinguishable it is discovered only by its meanders along the plain  gelidusque per imas quaerit iter valles  it has not its course shaped out between high banks but seeks out its passage here and there as the small depressions of a flat country allow beyond all appears the sea but the distance here is so remote that it is not marked with any degree of strength no epithet is applied you can scarce distinguish it from the sky criticisms of this kind may seem refinement but there is little doubt i think but the poet in composing these lines had some real landscape strongly formed in his imagination chance could not have marked all these distances so very exactly  having descended haldownhill we saw mamhead the seat of lord lisburne and powderhamcastle though we had no time to examine either  the former from a woody hill which seems to be adorned with much beautiful scenery commands a noble view over the mouth of the ex the latter stands on a knoll overlooking a flat park bounded by the same river but with a less amusing view of it the ex in both these views is a grand tide channel and in the former especially is very beautiful but we saw nothing in the distance either from mamhead or powderhamcastle which haldownhill had not already shown us though not in all respects perhaps to so much advantage  sect xxvi the city of exeter which we soon reached is by far the most considerable town in the west of england it is seated rather eminently on the eastern side of the ex from this river it derives its name which is a corruption of excester or the castle on the ex a name which gives it a title to roman origin the antiquarian however is not obliged merely to etymology for his proof of its antiquity he points out vestiges of roman masonry in the south gate he finds variety of coins and he measures the length and breadth of the walls which form a parallelogram by roman feet  exeter is said to be very regularly built having two large airy streets running through the length and breadth of it and uniting in the center it appeared to us however very incumbered we were directed from the bridge to the great church through close and disagreeable alleys the best part of the town we did not see as our time allowed us to examine only the most remarkable buildings    on the north side the highest ground is occupied by the ruins of rugementcastle formerly the residence of saxon kings from the terrace of this castle and from the walls of the town we had the same extensive view over the country which we had before from haldownhill but as we now saw them from a different station and from a lower point they were less grand but more picturesque hills which were there compressed to the surface began here to arise and take their form in the landscape breaking the continued lines of distance and creating new lights and new shades with their varied elevations toward the mouth of the river we were told a light mist often prevails when the rest of the landscape toward the west is perfectly clear we did not see any appearance of this kind but i should suppose it might frequently produce a good effect not only from the beauty of the mist itself but from its clearing away see page      and leaving some objects distinctly seen and others but obscurely traced  the good bishop rundle who was educated in this town speaks with picturesque warmth of the views from its public walks and the great beauty of the landscape around it the climate he affirms to be so fine that in no part of england trees shoot with more luxuriance or fruits ripen to a richer flavor the fig and the grape he says scarce desire better skies see letters of the late t rundle lld   few places in england are more renowned in the annals of war than exeter it was three times besieged by the danes once by william the conqueror again by king stephen a sixth time in the rebellion of perkin warbec in the time of henry vii again in a rebellion which broke out in the reign of edward vi and two or three times more in the civil wars of charles i on many of these occasions it was regularly garrisoned and the citizens had nothing to do with its defense but when it rested on them they generally behaved with remarkable spirit many instances of their gallantry are preserved in history henry vii was so much pleased with their behavior in his time that he paid them a visit on purpose to thank them and when he left the town he took his sword from his side and presenting it to the mayor desired it might always be carried before him which it has been ever since  the history of the great church at exeter is remarkable it was four hundred years in building under the direction of several bishops each adding something to complete the design one of them even lengthened the nave of the church by two additional arches yet notwithstanding this lapse of time in which the fashion of architecture underwent so much change and notwithstanding the different architects employed whose genius and taste must have been very different it is singular that each succeeding bishop has so attentively pursued the plan of his predecessor that the whole together strikes the eye as a uniform building on examining the parts nicely we may here and there distinguish the opposition of saxon and gothic but in general they accord very happily the west front is uncommonly rich and adorned with figures the nave of the church is fitted up for divine service which may be useful but injures the effect  the curious should not forget before he leave the church to see the chalice and sapphire ring which were dug out of a bishops grave when a new pavement was laid about twenty years ago to what bishop the ring belonged is only guessed but it might be tolerably ascertained by a knowledge of the progress of art which some antiquarians possess such a knowledge gives the form and workmanship of these curious remains of antiquity to their proper period if the traveller have a mind also to please his conductor who leads him through the aisles of the church he may tell him he has heard that the great bell called peter weighs above a thousand pounds more than great tom at lincoln and that the pipes of the organ are wider than those of any organ in europe both these accounts he will probably hear confirmed with great solemnity though the latter of them is a mistake and as to the former both it and its rival at lincoln are mere handbells compared with the great bell at moscow which weighs    000 pounds and measures at its mouth above twentyone yards  sect xxvii from exeter to honiton we passed through a rich country yet somewhat flatter than we had met with on the western side of exeter we found however here and there an eminence which gave us a view of the distances around at fairmilehill particularly a very extensive view opened before us but nothing can make it pleasing as it is bounded by a hard edge a distance should either melt into the sky or terminate in a soft and varied mountain line see page      this high ground which appeared at a distance as a hard edge is on the spot a grand terrace running eight or nine miles from honiton to sidmouth presenting sometimes the sea and sometimes a variety of hills vales and distances with which the country abounds we had not time however to explore the several beauties of the landscape it overlooks night came on before we reached honiton and drew a veil over all the objects of the horizon  at honiton we intended to sleep but it was ordered otherwise this town having been twice burnt down within these last thirty years the inhabitants take a very effectual method to prevent the catastrophe a third time by appointing all travelers to the office of watchmen about twelve oclock a fellow begins his operations with a monstrous handbell and a hoarse voice informing us that all is safe this serenade is repeated every quarter of an hour with great propriety for in that portion of time it may reasonably be supposed the traveller who is ignorant of the institution and not accustomed to such nocturnaldin in a countrytown cannot well get his senses composed especially as his ear will naturally lie in expectation of each periodical peal in the mean time the sly inhabitant who is used to these noises of the night enjoys a quiet repose the institution may be good we only wished it had been intimated to us before that we might have had an option in the case  we had now traveled between seventy and eighty miles from plymouth and found the whole of the country except the little deviation we made from chudleigh to examine the scenery about the ex unvaried and uninteresting like an immense piece of high furrowed land at least as far as exeter it is continually rising and falling and though it has its beauties yet they are chiefly seen near the coast where its valleys break down and open to the sea and where its estuaries often form very pleasing scenes  the road from plymouth to honiton by the seacoast was the road we ought to have taken but as it had not been pointed out to us as particularly picturesque we took the upper road merely for want of better information i shall however give the reader a sketch of the coast from some hints which i have had on good picturesque authority i have also myself seen a great variety of accurate drawings of this coast which have given me a strong idea of its character  sect xxviii from plymouth according to this route you make the first stage to totness and so far the country wears nearly the same face which it did between plymouth and ashburton you cross the same rivers ascend the same hills and fall into the same valleys  this is a country however in which the farmer glories though the painter treats it with neglect here the acre fills the bushel with abundant increase and here the ox does credit to his pasture but though the country abounds in corn and pasturage cider is its staple the cider of the south hams which is the name of a great part of this country is every where famous  at totness you meet the dart down which river you may sail about six or seven miles to dartmouth this little navigation i have heard much extolled as a peculiar scene of beauty but i have heard others on whose judgment i can more rely speak of it with less emotion and yet i can easily imagine that two people of equally picturesque taste may conceive differently of the same scene they may have different conceptions of beauty though the conceptions of each may be very just or they may examine the same scene under different circumstances a favorable or an unfavourable light makes a greater alteration in any scene than a person unaccustomed to examine nature would easily imagine  at dartmouth you have a great variety of interesting views the bay which the river forms at its mouth is one of the most beautiful scenes on the coast both the entrance of the dart into it and its exit to the sea appear from many stations closed up by the folding of the banks so that the bay has frequently the form of a lake only furnished with shipping instead of boats its banks are its great beauty which consist of lofty wooded hills shelving down in all directions you would not expect such scenery on a seacoast but the woods by being well sheltered grow luxuriantly  and yet an eye versed in the various scenes of nature would easily distinguish these bays from the pastoral simplicity of an inlandlake the sea always impresses a peculiar character on its bays the water has a different aspect its tints are more varied and its surface differently disturbed its banks too have a more weatherbeaten and ragged appearance losing generally their verdure within the air of the sea the searock also wants that rich incrustation of mosses and lychens which adorns the rock of the lake and the wood though it grow luxuriantly as it does here shows plainly by its mode of growth that it is the inhabitant of a seagirt clime to this may be added that the appendages of the bay and lake are different a quay perhaps for landing goods an anchor a floating buoy or a group of figures in seamens jackets are the ornaments of one scene but unknown to the other  the bay in the mean time may be as picturesque as the lake all i mean to point out is that the character of each is different and therefore in painting they should not be confounded its particular value each receives from the fancy of the spectator as was just observed people may have different conceptions of beauty and yet the conceptions of both may be equally just the pastoral simplicity of the lake may please one person and the bustle of the bay another i shall only add that representations of the two scenes are exceedingly well suited as companions to each other  at the opening of dartmouthbay to the sea appears the town of dartmouth ascending a hill its castle at the distance of a mile stands close to the waters edge on the other side across the bay rises kingswere a sort of suburb belonging to the town the winding of the bay and the varied beauty of its banks are seen to great advantage in a walk which carries you from the town of dartmouth to the castle  all this coast affords excellent fish the sole breeds here in great abundance and the john dory delights in it as its most favorite haunt the torbayboat often brings this delicious fish to the tables of the luxurious but the epicure who wishes to eat it in perfection does not think a journey to these coasts too much at totness great quantities of salmonpeal are taken in an uncommon mode of fishing the fish are intercepted as the water ebbs by dogs which swimming after the shoal are taught to drive them up the river into close nets provided to receive them  dartmouth harbor is a very busy scene when a shoal of pilchards enters it as they often do at particular seasons driven in by porpoises which lie off at sea in expectation of them the shoal discovers itself by the tremulous motion of the water and the leaping of the fish here and there on the surface on this appearance every boat that can swim puts off from the shore with nets the whole would make a busy and entertaining water scene if it were well painted  from dartmouth you return with the tide tide to totness from thence in the way to brixham you may visit the grand ruins of berrypomeroycastle this fortress belonged formerly to a family of the name of pomeroy which being seated there by the conqueror kept possession of it during all the various revolutions of england till the reign of edward vi it was once a formidable place and its ruins are still magnificent the grand gateway remains entire together with a round tower a great part of the wall is standing and many of the chambers may be traced  from hence you proceed to brixham where the naturalist finds himself puzzled with a well which ebbs and flows though the waters are not in the least brackish but pure and limpid which seems to indicate they have no communication with tides  near brixham you begin to skirt that celebrated inlet of the sea called torbay it is a grand scene and affords many magnificent views if you have leisure to circle the bay in quest of them  its general form is semilunar enclosing a circumference of about twelve miles its winding shores on both sides are skreened with grand ramparts of rock between which in the central part the ground from the country forming a gentle vale falls easily to the waters edge wood grows all round the bay even on its rocky sides where it can get footing and shelter but in the central part with great luxuriance  in this delicious spot stood formerly torabbey the ruins of which still remain its situation was grand and beautiful wooded hills descending on every side skreened and adorned it both behind and on its flanks in front the bay opening before it spread its circling rocky cheeks like a vast colonade lessening in all the pleasing forms of perspective and receiving all the variety of light and shade which the sun veering round from morning till evening throws upon them here a society of monks dwelt in peaceful security the enemys fleet more than once in former times ravaged the coast and burnt dartmouth and other towns the abbey feared no mischief all it had to do was to open its hospitable gates and give an asylum to the terrified fugitives of the country  this noble bay has afforded its protection many a time to the fleets of england which in their full array ride safely within its ample basin but it appeared in its greatest glory on the fifth of november      when king william entered it with fifty sail of the line and four hundred transports the ships indeed were dutch but a british admiral led the van and a british flag flew at the masthead  from torbay your next stage is newtonbushel where crossing the teign you ride along the banks of that river to teignmouth in your way you are entertained with a variety of river views but nature laying aside here in a great degree her rocks and bold shores works with softer materials the banks of the teign i understand are rather cultivated than wild though at its mouth it receives the sea with rocks which are both magnificent and beautiful they are covered like the generality of the rocks on this coast with a profusion of wood  from teignmouth you skirt the shore to the mouth of the ex over which you ferry at the bar here the country grows somewhat bolder but rather in the form of swelling hills these hills likewise are profusely covered with wood which sweeps almost down to the waters edge but as you take a view of them with your back to the sea they appear in still greater magnificence uniting with the woods of the country those of powderhamcastle receive them first and beyond these you see rising and stretching into distance the woods of mamhead in rich though indistinct luxuriance  the ex is by far the noblest river in this part of the coast it empties a profuse channel into the sea and forms a basin at its mouth which would be an excellent harbor for a royal navy if it were not obstructed by a bar when the tide flows however ships of considerable burden advance as far as topsham and could formerly have proceeded with equal ease to the walls of exeter but a little above topsham the channel of the river is again obstructed  the tradition of the country ascribes this obstruction to a quarrel between the mayor of exeter and an earl of devonshire the earl claimed the first salmon that was taken in the season as an acknowledgment of his jurisdiction over the river the mayor claimed it as a perquisite of his office the earls claim appears to have been worse founded because instead of appealing to the laws for redress he had recourse to private revenge both sides of the river were his property and both sides closely wooded with ancient oak these trees he cut down in abundance and threw them into the channel of the river the tide afterward carrying up with it great quantities of sand and gravel formed this obstruction by degrees into such a barrier as could never afterward be removed if this tradition be well grounded we have seldom an instance of revenge in so grand a style most people who seek gratifications of this kind are satisfied with revenging themselves on the person who had offended them but the earl of devonshire not only revenged himself on the mayor of exeter but on the whole city and for all future times  about seventy years ago the inhabitants of exeter cut a new channel for the river and built very expensive locks upon it by means of which they can now bring vessels of some burden to the town  from the mouth of the ex the coast affords nothing very interesting till you come to the mouth of the sid this river opens into the sea between high promontories that on the west is particularly lofty and much broken though not rocky and is represented as affording many picturesque views but here is no basin opening into the land as in the other rivers of this coast the sid is a mere rural stream and preserves its character pure to the very shores of the ocean  the valley through which it takes its course is a scene of peculiar construction it forms a gentle descent toward the sea between two steep hills which leave little more room at the bottom than what the road and the river occupy so that in fact it has hardly the dimensions of a valley but might rather be called a cleft in the higher grounds running down to the sea the hills however which compose its sides are not like the narrow valleys of a mountainous and rocky country abrupt and broken but consist chiefly of rich pasturage and are covered with flocks and herds they are adorned too with wood and though in their course they now and then wind a little they generally lead the valley in a straight line from north to south  through this narrow valley you rise slowly near the space of nine miles so long an ascent though in all parts gradual raises you at length to a great height at the conclusion of the valley you find yourself on a lofty down from whence you have some of the grandest views which this country rich in distances affords you look chiefly toward the west and take in an amazing compass indeed all the district on both sides of the ex as far as the sea these high grounds formed that hard edge and made that peculiar appearance which we observed in the road between exeter and honiton see page      from these lofty downs you descend gently into honiton where these two different routes from plymouth unite  sect xxix as we left honiton the obscurity of a hazy morning overspread its vale the picturesque beauty of which we had heard much commended if therefore it possesses any which from the analogy of the country may be questioned we are not qualified to give any account of it a misty morning in general gives new beauty to a country but we must catch its beautiful appearance as we do all the other accidental appearances of nature at a proper crisis we left honiton at too early an hour in the morning to see the full effect of the mist it rather blotted out than adorned the face of the country the most picturesque moment of a misty morning is just as the sun rises and begins its contention with the vapors which obstruct its rays that appearance we had soon after and in such profusion that it gave a beautiful effect to a landscape which seemed not calculated to produce much effect without it  we have a striking picture of a morningsun though unaccompanied by mist in the short account given us of lots escape from sodom we are told the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered into zoar descriptive poetry and painting must both have objects of sense before them neither of them deals in abstracted ideas but the same objects will not always suit both images which may shine under the poets description are not perhaps at the same time picturesque though i believe every picturesque object is capable of shining as a poetical one the passage before us is both poetical and picturesque a relation of the plain fact would have been neither if the passage had been coldly translated lot arrived at zoar about sunrise the sense had been preserved but the picture would have been lost as it is translated the whole is imagery the first part of the expression the sun was risen upon the earth brings immediately before the eye through the connection of the sun and the earth the rays of a morning sun striking the tops of the hills and promontories while the other part of the expression lot entered into zoar brings before us through the same happy mode of raising and connecting images a road the gates of the town and the patriarch approaching it not by the way that we should wish to introduce the story of lots retreat with any distinction into the picture the principal part would be the landscape and lot could only be a distant figure to adorn it and in that light unnecessary history introduced as the ornament of landscape appears absurd in basson and some other matters such introductions are frequent we consider therefore the passage before us merely as landscape and lay little stress on the figures reubens has thrown a fine glow of coloring into a picture on this subject in the possession of the duke of marlbrough but reubens has introduced as he ought the figures on the foreground making the landscape entirely an underpart i forget whether he has given his picture the full effect it might receive by throwing the back scenery into that grand shade suggested by the words of scripture the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace the atmosphere also might have a good effect tinged with the ruddy glare of fire blended with the smoke  as the mist cleared away and we saw more of the country around its picturesque charms did not increase upon us if the hills and dales however of which the whole country is composed possess little of this kind of beauty they possess what is better the riches of soil and cultivation in a high degree if any valleys can be said to laugh and sing these certainly may nothing can exceed either their tillage or their pasturage  among the beautiful objects we occasionally met with in this country the cattle which every where grazed its rich pastures were worthy of remark most of those we saw seemed to be of a peculiar breed elegantly and neatly formed rather small generally red growing gradually darker toward the head and shoulders their horns which are short are tipped with black their coats are fine and their heads small  at axminster the carpetworks are worth visiting some of them display a very rich combination of colors but in general they are so gay that furniture must be glaring to be in harmony with them of course they are too gay to be beautiful  no carpeting perhaps equals the persian in beauty the turkey carpet is modest enough in its coloring but its texture is coarse and its pattern consists commonly of such a jumble of incoherent parts that the eye seldom traces any meaning in its plan the british carpet again has too much meaning it often represents fruits and flowers and baskets and other things which are generally ill represented or awkwardly larger than the life or at least improperly placed under our feet the persian carpet avoids these two extremes it seldom exhibits any real forms and yet instead of the disorderly pattern that deforms the turkey carpet it usually presents some neat and elegant plan within the compartments of which its colors though rich are modest the texture also of the carpet is as neat and elegant as the ornamental scrawl which adorns it  sect xxx from axminster we left the great road to visit fordabbey  in a sequestered part of the country where devonshire and dorsetshire unite lies a circular valley about a mile and half in diameter  its sides slope gently into its area in various directions but are no where steep woody skreens circling its precincts conceal its bounds and in many parts connecting with the trees which descend into the bosom of the valley form themselves into various tufted groves through the middle of this sweet retreat winds a stream not foaming among broken rocks nor sounding down cataracts but mild like the scene it accompanies and in cadence not exceeding a gentle murmur from this retreat all foreign scenery is excluded it wants no adventitious ornaments sufficiently blessed with its own sweet groves and solitude   such landscape needs not the foreign aid of ornament but is when unadorned adorned the most this happy retirement was once sacred to religion verging toward one side of the valley stand the ruins of fordabbey it has never been of large dimensions but was a model of the most perfect gothic if we may credit its remains particularly those of a cloister which are equal to any thing we have in that style of architecture this beautiful fragment consists of eight windows with light buttresses between them and joins a ruined chapel on one side and on the other a hall or refectory which still preserves its form sufficiently to give an idea of its just proportions to this is connected by ruined walls a massy tower what the ancient use of this fabric was whether it belonged to the ecclesiastical or civil part of the monastery is not now apparent but at present it gives a picturesque form to the ruin which appears to more advantage by the preeminence of some superior part see page       at right angles with the chapel runs another cloister a longer building but of coarser workmanship and almost covered with ivy the river which enters the valley at the distance of about half a mile from the ruin takes a sweep toward it and passing under this cloister opens into what was once the great court and makes its exit through an arch in the wall on the opposite side this venerable pile  clad in the mossy vest of fleeting time and decorated all over with variety of lychens streaming weatherstains and twisting shrubs is shaded by ancient oaks which hanging over it adorn its broken walls without encumbering them in short the valley the river the path and the ruins are all highly pleasing the parts are beautiful and the whole is harmonious  they who have lately seen fordabbey will stare at this description of it and well may they stare for this description antedates its present state by at least a century if they had seen it in the year      they might probably have seen it as it is here described now alas it wears another face it has been in the hands of improvement its simplicity is gone and miserable ravage has been made through every part the ruin is patched up into an awkward dwelling old parts and new are blended together to the mutual disgrace of both the elegant cloister is still left but it is completely repaired whitewashed and converted into a greenhouse the hall too is modernized and every other part sashwindows glare over pointed arches and gothic walls are adorned with indian paper  the grounds have undergone the same reformation the natural groves and lawns are destroyed vistas and regular slopes supply their room the winding path which contemplation naturally marked out is gone succeeded by straight walks and terraces adorned with urns and statues while the river and its fringed banks have given way to canals and stewponds in a word a scene abounding with so many natural beauties was never perhaps more wretchedly deformed  when a man exercises his crude ideas on a few vulgar acres it is of little consequence the injury is easily repaired and if not the loss is trifling but when he lets loose his depraved taste his absurd invention and his graceless hands on such a subject as this where art and nature united cannot restore the havoc he makes we consider such a deed under the same black character in matters of picturesque beauty as we do sacrilege and blasphemy in matters of religion the effects of superstition we abhor some little atonement however this implacable power might have made in taste for its mischiefs in religion if it had deterred our ancestors from connecting their mansions with ruins once dedicated to sacred uses we might then have enjoyed in perfection many noble scenes which are now either entirely effaced or miserably mangled  before we leave these scenes i must relate a story of the monks of ford which does great credit to their piety it happened in what century tradition says not that a gentleman of the name of courtney a benefactor to the abbey was overtaken at sea by a violent storm and the seamen having toiled many hours in vain and being entirely spent abandoned themselves to despair my good lads said courtney calling them together and pulling out his watch if watches were then in use my good lads you see it is now four oclock at five we shall certainly be relieved at that hour the monks of ford rise to their devotions and in their prayers to st francis will be sure to rembember me among their benefactors and you will have the benefit of being saved in my company persevere only one hour and you may depend on what i say this speech reanimated the whole crew some flew to the pump others to the leak all was life and spirit by this vigorous effort at five oclock the ship was so near the shore that she easily reached it and st francis got all the credit of the escape  sect xxxi from fordabbey we were obliged to return to axminster and from thence we set out for bridport traversing vast cultivated hills from which on the left we had views into the country and on the right over the sea the isle of portland ranged in the distance many leagues along the shore forming a long white beach which made an uncommon appearance  from bridport to dorchester we passed through a more inland country though in other respects similar to the country we had just left the features of it are broad and determined sweeping hills with harsh edges intersect each other here and there a bottom is cultivated enclosed and adorned with a farmhouse and a few trees but in general the whole country is an extended down it is every where fed with little rough sheep which have formed it with constant grazing into the finest pasturage indeed a chalky soil itself which is the substratum of these downs is naturally inclined to produce a neat smooth surface the several flocks which pasture these wide domains have their respective walks and are generally found within the distance of a mile from each other we saw them once or twice issuing from their pens to take their mornings repast after a hungry night it was a pleasing sight to see such numbers of innocent animals made happy and in the following lines it is beautifully described  the fold poured out its sleecy tenants over the glebe at first progressive as a stream they sought the middle field but scattered by degrees in various groups they whitened all the land   but the progressive motion here described is one of those incidents which is a better subject for poetry than painting for in the first place a feeding flock is seldom well grouped they commonly separate or as the poet well expresses it they are scattered by degrees and whiten all the land nor are their attitudes varied as they all usually move the same way progressive like a stream indeed the shape of a feeding sheep is not the most pleasing as its back and neck make a round heavy line which in contrast only has its effect to see a flock of sheep in their most picturesque form we should see them reposing after their meal is over and if they are in sunshine they are still the more beautiful in reposing they are generally better grouped and their forms are more varied some are commonly standing and others lying on the ground with their little ruminating heads in various forms and if the light be strong it spreads over the whole one general mass and is contrasted at the same time by a shadow equally strong which the flock throws upon the ground it may be observed also that the fleece itself is well disposed to receive a beautiful effect of light it does not indeed like the smooth covering of hair allow the eye to trace the muscular form of the animal but it has a beauty of a different kind the flakiness of the wool catches the light and breaking it into many parts yet without destroying the mass gives it a peculiar richness  we saw another circumstance also in which sheep appear to advantage the weather was sultry the day calm and the roads dusty along these roads we saw once or twice a flock of sheep driven which raised a considerable cloud as we were a little higher on the downs and not annoyed by the dust the circumstance was amusing the beauty of the incident lay in the contrast between such sheep as were seen perfectly and such as were involved in obscurity at the same time the dust became a kind of harmonizing medium which united the flock into one whole it had the same effect on a group of animals which a heavy mist when partial has on landscape but though circumstances of this kind are pleasing in nature we do not wish to see them imitated on canvas they have been tried by loutherberg who with a laudable endeavor has attempted many different effects but i think in this he has failed he has represented the dusty atmosphere of rapid wheels but it is an incident that cannot be imitated for as motion enters necessarily into the idea and as you cannot describe motion it is impossible to give more than half the idea it is otherwise with vapor which from the light mist to the sleeping fog is of a more permanent nature and therefore more adapted to the pencil  the only circumstance which can make a cloud of dust an object of imitation is distance as this gives it somewhat of a stationary appearance one of the grandest ideas of this kind which i remember to have met with may be found in zenophons anabasis  as cyrus was approaching artaxerxes over one of those vast plains which are often found in the east a horseman who had been making observations returned at full speed crying out to the troops as he rode through them that the enemy was at hand cyrus not suspecting the king to be so near was riding carelessly in his chariot and the troops unarmed were marching negligently over the plain the prince leaping from his chariot presently armed himself mounted his horse called his generals around him and drew up his troops this was scarce done when the historian tells us a white cloud was seen in the distant horizon spreading far and wide from the dust raised by so vast a host as the cloud approached the bottom of it appeared dark and solid as it still advanced it was observed from various parts to gleam and glitter in the sun and soon after the ranks of horse and foot and armed chariots were distinctly seen as the translation is not exactly faithful the critical reader may be better pleased perhaps with the greater simplicity of the original  etc p  0  vol i edit glasg   the extended plains of dorsetshire however desolate they now appear have once been busy scenes the antiquarian finds rich employment among them for his curiosity to follow him in quest of every heaving hilloc and to hear a discussion of conjectures about the traces of a danish or a roman mattoc where the eye of common observation perceives no traces at all might be tedious but he shows us several fragments of antiquity on these plains which are truly curious and convinces us that few places in england have been more considerable in roman times than dorchester poundbury and maidencastle as they are called are both extraordinary remains of roman stations the latter especially which encompasses a large space of ground numberless tumuli also are thrown up all over the downs these were antiquities in the times even of the romans themselves  but the most valuable fragment on these plains is a roman amphitheatre about half a mile from dorchester it is constructed only of earth but it is of so firm a texture that it retains its complete form to this day its mounds are of immense thickness and seem to be at least twenty feet high the area contains about an acre of land and is now a corn field there are two openings in the mound opposed to each other which have formerly been gates the circumference without appears circular to the eye though in fact i believe it is rather oval the inside is apparently so the difference of the figure seems to have been occasioned by the swelling of the mound within where the seats have been disposed this piece of antiquity is known by the name of maumbery how much it resembles in form and size the old amphitheatres now subsisting in italy may be seen from the following description of one near nice i made a second excursion to these ancient ruins and measured the area of the amphitheatre with thread it is an oval figure the longest diameter extending about a hundred and thirteen yards and the shortest about eighty in the center of it was a square stone with an iron ring to which i suppose the wild beasts were tied to prevent their springing upon the spectators some of the seats remain with two opposite entrances consisting each of one large gate and two smaller lateral doors arched there is also a considerable portion of the external wall but no columns or other ornaments of architecture see smolletts letters   on comparing the amphitheatre of dorchester with this at nice we find the form of both exactly similar and no great difference in the size the area of maumbery is two hundred and eighteen feet by a hundred and sixtythree dr stukely calculates that it might have contained about thirteen thousand people at mrs cannings execution who was burnt in the middle of this amphitheatre for the murder of her husband it is supposed to have contained in the area and on the mounds at least ten thousand spectators it is surprising that camden takes not the least notice of this singular piece of antiquity  dorchester as we may judge from these noble remains was a place of great consideration in roman times the works of maidencastle supposed to be capable of receiving fifteen thousand men show plainly the consequence of this station in a military light and i know not that the erection of an amphitheatre was thought necessary in any other part of britain at least we have not that i recollect the remains of any other that is well ascertained except that at sylchester  the situation of dorchester is pleasant it stands on a high bank of the from and is surrounded with dry sheepdowns on which however the plough has lately made large encroachments the town is clean and well built and round it is a variety of pleasant walks which to a certain degree i think should always engage the attention of the magistrate  in the neighborhood of dorchester are many gentlemens seats well worth visiting the woody dips among these downy hills afford naturally very fine situations the only one however which we regretted our not being able to see was miltonabbey the seat of lord milton which lies about three miles from dorchester the day which we had laid out for seeing it was rainy and we had not time to wait for a better the capital feature of the landscape we were told is a valley winding among hills of various forms and covered with woods which sometimes advance boldly on projecting knolls and sometimes retire in bays and recesses we heard also the ruins of the abbeychurch commended as remains of the purest gothic all these materials are in a high degree picturesque and if they are happily united miltonabbey must be a very interesting scene to make a good picture composition however is as necessary as pleasing objects  sect xxxii blandford our next stage lies about sixteen miles from dorchester and though not a place of such renowned antiquity is perhaps a still more agreeable town it lies within a curve of the river stour and is pleasantly seated among meadows and woods if a person wished to retire from business where he might have the conveniences and pleasures of the town and country united his choice might waver between barnstaple dorchester and blandford if he wished to be near the sea he will find a pleasant seacoast at barnstaple if airy downs and open country pleased him he might fix at dorchester but if he loved meadows and woodlands he must make choice of blandford  this town has been twice burnt almost within the memory of man the last fire which was in the year      destroyed it so completely that only twentysix houses remained standing here we cannot help bemoaning the singular fate of these western towns this is the fourth of them we met with dorchester crediton and honiton were the other three which have been totally in a manner destroyed by fire to these might be added wareham and very lately minehead  near blandford stands eastbury the seat of lord melcombe but it did not much attract our curiosity as it is more celebrated for the splendour of the house than the scenery around it  brianston mr portmans seat which is near the town i suppose is a much more pleasing place we were not at his house but saw enough of his woody hill and the variety both of its steep and easy slopes together with the vale and winding river over which it hangs to regret the closing in of the evening upon us before we had finished our walk  from blandford the country still continues wild and uncultivated yet full of antiquities among which the most celebrated is the foundation of a sort called badburyring it makes a considerable figure as we rode past and seems from its elevation its dimensions and complicated works for it has been fortified with a triple ditch to have been a place of uncommon strength  some parts of these downs are very picturesque they are finely spread and form elegant sweeps with many pleasant views into a woody country which stretches away to the right they possess indeed all the variety taken notice of by the poet when he speaks of the  pure dorsetian downs in boundless prospect spread here shagged with woods there rich with harvests and there white with flocks in the last epithet he is rather unhappy for the sheep which graze these plains are so far from being white that they are universally washed all over with redocre which greatly injures both the pastoral and picturesque idea  winborn was our next stage from blandford appearing as we approach it to stand in a wild vale surrounded with wood this town takes its name from one of the most celebrated abbeys of saxon times its form dates its antiquity the great church which is the only part remaining is of the heaviest and earliest species of saxon architecture if it have no beauty however it has at least the peculiarity of two contiguous and similar towers on one of which stood once a spire equal in height it is said to that of salisbury  in this church rests a large collection of royal and noble bones but the tomb most visited is that of king ethelred brother to alfred the great an excellent prince just shown to his subjects in his early youth he engaged in all the toils and perplexities of government the times were adverse his country was overrun by the danes he encountered them in battle and was mortally wounded his remains were deposited in the chancel of this church where the inscription upon his gravestone one should suppose has been occasionally repaired or it could never have endured the changes of so many hundred years his effigies too in sculptured brass though of miserable workmanship is however better than we can suppose the times of alfred could produce in a life so short there was little to record but the last great scene of it s ethelredi regis west saxonum martyris qui anno domini dccclxxii xxiii aprilis per manus danorum paganorum occubuit the whole monument has a monkish air and was probably the production of later times than those of alfred mr gough in his splendid publication on sepulchral antiquities supposes from the form of the letters that this inscription is not older than the times of the reformation which is perhaps bringing it as much too low as other people are inclined to carry it too high  from winborn we passed through a heathy barren flat unpleasant country to pool which lies about nine miles farther this country unpleasant as it is is rendered more so as we approach the town the whole coast is oozy and when the tide ebbs it has the appearance of a vast swamp with which the heathy flat before us unites in one level surface nothing under the idea of landscape can be more disagreeable when the tide flows the view is somewhat mended the water covering the swamp gives some variety to the surface of a dead uninteresting flat  beyond the water appear the high lands of the isle of purbeck as it is called though it is in fact only a vast promontory running eight or nine miles in the form of a peninsula along the coast it is washed by the river from on one side and by the sea on the other here are dug great quantities of that hard species of stone which takes the name of the country and is of such excellent use in paving here too are found marbles more beautiful than the marbles of italy but less valued because more common they are something like the marbles we admired at plymouth see page  0   but i think more variegated the veins running on a brown ground are white red and blue  seated high on one of the eminences of purbeck far to the west we saw corffcastle but the distance was too great to distinguish its features clearly the ruins of it are said to be the most considerable of the kind in england it was reduced to this state by the parliament at the conclusion of the civil wars vast piles of ruin were thrown down into the ditch but the immense massiness of them and the tenacity of the mortar will long preserve them from any farther separation the principal facts commemorated in this celebrated castle are the murder of edward the martyr by elfrida the imprisonment of edward the second till he was carried to his last horrid confinement at berklycastle and the long siege it underwent in the civil wars of charles i defended by lady banks wife of lord chief justice banks to whom it belonged with a garrison only of forty men against an army with artillery  in the kings library in the british museum no    d iii  are a set of maps of the several counties of england which belonged to the old lord burleigh and are rendered curious by several of his notes and memoranda written upon their margins to the island of purbeck he seems to have paid great attention his notes upon it probably have a reference to the spanish invasion we are not to expect any picturesque remarks from lord burleigh but his observations give us an idea of the coast at studlandbay he observes that forty boats may land but not without danger at swanage boats may land and retreat at any time of the tide in this bay and studlandbay six or seven hundred ships of a thousand ton burden may ride safe in any wind along this coast for three miles there is a good landing shipmanspool is a creek where the enemy cannot land more than two or three boats batteragebay is full of rocks and shelves such also are worbarrowbay arestmiss and lullworthcove but in worbarrowbay and shipmanspool five hundred sail of large ships may ride in almost every wind  pool lies on a bay of the sea which is very intricate the body of it is a large and commodious harbor but it runs into many little creeks and winding channels which give it the air of a waterlabyrinth when the tide flows the town appears encircled with water and looks like venice but the shores are so low especially about brownisland which appears only like a bank that there is little picturesque scenery about the place in some parts when the tide is full and you can get a few trees into the view you have a tolerable dutch landscape in general however all is bare and that painter only who can skilfully fill his foreground with figures and marine appendages can make a picture of it but few painters have the art of touching small figures in landscape though many have the misfortune to spoil their pictures by attempting it the general proportions even of small figures and their graceful actions for there is a species of picturesque grace of which even clowns should participate are very hard to hit we judge of the difficulty from the few who have excelled scot who understood the form of a ship and in his seaviews could give his skies and water not indeed the brilliancy of vanderveld yet a clearness which every one could not attain was very deficient in the necessary addition of figures he could not place their heads on their shoulders nor hang on their arms nor set them on their legs nor give them an easy action and yet a few touches will do all this  it is surprising how few  when those touches are well understood vanderveld could do it zeeman could do it and yet perhaps neither of these masters understood the anatomy of the human body neither of them perhaps could have drawn either a leg or an arm with accuracy but in drawing a small figure for a landscape accuracy is not required it is enough to understand its general proportion the symmetry of its parts and the effect of action to understand the effect of action is so exceedingly necessary that nothing hurts the eye more than to see a figure awkwardly using its arms and legs almost any eye can see the impropriety in the management of small figures i mentioned callot two of whose pictures we had seen at longfordcastle among the most able masters see page     they who have not an opportunity of seeing his pictures which are scarce may observe the same skill in his prints and yet i should not care to mention this master as a perfect model because with all his excellence there is often a degree of affectation in his attitudes if his figures had been large the eye would have taken quick disgust but in a miniature the exaggeration of posture is less striking  our route from pool to christchurch led us over a heath wilder almost than any we had yet found but it scarcely lasted four miles it ended in agreeable lanes through a country not unpleasant at least the force of contrast with the country we had just seen gave it a pleasant appearance here whenever we had an opening on the right we had views of the sea the isle of wight and the needles  from christchurch we proceeded to lymington skirting the borders of new forest but as i have given an account of this country in another work see forest scenery  i shall pass it over here  sect xxxiii at lymington we embarked for the isle of wight and stood for cowes as we approached it the shore soon began to form into two points of land the nearer of which is defended by a small castle the farther seemed high ground and woody  as we drew nearer the bay began to open and as we turned the castlepoint an ample road well secured lay before us full of large shipping the town of cowes occupied the two sides of the hill on the right and left the harbor is a creek running a considerable way into the country it is formed by the river medina which comes down from the higher grounds where the island swells into its greatest breadth and is navigable as far as newport about six miles from the sea  at cows we landed intending to spend two or three days in the island which we hoped would allow us sufficient time to examine its picturesque beauties  the form of the isle of wight is that of an irregular lozenge from the eastern point to the western it ranges about twentythree miles from the northern to the southern about thirteen through the middle of it in the longer direction runs a track of high land in some parts rather mountainous but of the smooth downy kind fit for the pasturage of sheep from these high grounds we have every where a view of the island and its boundaries of the sea toward the south and toward the north of the coast of hampshire from which the island is separated by a channel about five or six miles in breadth  the shores of the island on the northern side fall almost every where to the water in easy declivities except just at the western or needle point where they are broken and precipitous but all the back of the island as the southern coast is commonly called which is washed by the tides of the ocean is worn bare to the naked rock and is in most places bounded against the sea by steep cliffs what depredation the waves in a course of years have made upon it is evident from the fragments of rock which have tumbled from the undermined cliffs and lie scattered along the shore many of them are far out at sea and at low water only show their heads above the waves no part of the british coast is more dangerous to vessels ungoverned and driving in the storm  from cowes our road led us first to newport along the course of the medina which afforded many happy situations to those who are fortunate enough to have any of its more pleasing reaches within the view of their houses a tide river has always its disadvantages but it has its advantages also it is generally once or twice a day adorned with the white sails of little skiffs passing to and fro and at all times with boats or anchoringbarks which have lost the tide and wait for its return these are picturesque circumstances which an inland river cannot have  newport is the capital town in the island it grew into repute from its situation on the medina after carisbroke the natural capital was deserted it is a large handsome town and its market is often a curiosity as the island is so fertile that it is supposed to produce seven or eight times more grain than its inhabitants consume the overplus is commonly brought to newport to be shipped off and an hundred laden wagons may sometimes be seen ranged in double lines along the marketplace the free school also which is a handsome room about fifty feet long is worth looking into as it received greater honor than perhaps any schoolroom ever did before when the commissioners from the parliament treated with king charles i in the isle of wight this room was chosen for the conference  from newport we proposed to take a view of the northern coast which extends from cowespoint to st helens and is thought to contain the most beautiful part of the island this might be done in two ways either by riding along the coast and seeing each particular place that was pointed out as most beautiful or by keeping along the higher grounds and taking a general view of the whole together as we could not do both we chose the latter and soon found we had made the more judicious choice for the ground quickly narrows in that part of the island and we obtained a good idea of its general scenery mr groses house at the priory and two or three other places we could have wished to have examined more particularly but as we should have been confined within hedges we could have seen little besides the places we immediately visited of the general appearance of the landscape on this side of the island some account shall be given at the conclusion of our circuit round it  part of the high grounds over which we passed is called ashydown on the loftiest summit of this ridge is placed a seamark when ships are driven by the storm so near the southern coast of the island as to lose sight of this mark of security little hope of safety remains it is hardly possible for them to avoid the rocks  as the high grounds began to decline we verged toward the southern part of the island with an intention to take a view of its rocky boundaries but we had not here the advantageous point of view which we had on the other side the rocky shores which we wished to examine can be seen no where properly but from the sea we could only therefore get a view of them from some particular stands which commanded a lengthened reach of the coast and such stands occurred but seldom  from the high grounds we descended first to sandownbay which lies on the south coast and is the only part on this side where it is supposed an enemy could effect a landing it is defended by a fort which takes its name from the bay but the rocks soon commence and continue the guardians of the coast in an almost uninterrupted chain from this place to the very western point of the island  among the curious parts of this rocky scenery we were carried to shanklinchine a vast chasm winding between two high promontories more than a mile into the country the chasm opens to the sea upon a bed of pebbles where generally a boat or two lie moored and the fishermans hut stands half way up the precipice both sides of the chasm are adorned with rock and both with wood and it is in general a picturesque scene but it has not the beauty of the dells of a mountainous country where the wood is commonly finer and the rocks more adorned and more majestic and where a stream pouring over ledges of rock or falling down a cascade adds the melody of sound to the beauty of the scene  near shanklinchine mr stanley built a cottage among the rocks where he enjoyed the seabreezes in the heat of summer it is called undercliff as it is built on a ledge of rock between the uppercliffs and the sea the view in front is not unpleasing it is a sort of wild rocky valley about half a quarter of a mile across hanging over the sea which appears abruptly beyond it without the intervention of any middle ground it exhibits generally a moving picture presenting the track which ships coasting the island commonly take  as it is a birdseye view many of these vessels especially of the smaller size appear with their masts and sails considerably below the horizon i mention this circumstance because in a picture such representations are rather unpleasing in representing a view of this kind therefore the painter if under a necessity to paint it should always wish to remove the vessels he introduces so far into distance as to raise their masts above the horizon see this subject treated more at large in the forest scenery vol ii p      the larger the vessel is the nearer of course she may approach the eye in the variety and motion of natural views we are not so much hurt with these circumstances which have a bad effect in painting and yet a birdseye view on water is always less pleasing than on land as the variety of ground is more amusing in itself than water and as it carries off the perspective better the grandeur which an extensive view of the ocean presents is a different idea we are speaking here only of its beauty if we restrict the masts of ships however from appearing below the horizon we object not to boats and birds in that situation the boat either fishing or in motion the wheeling gull or the lengthened file of seafowl appear often to great advantage against the bosom of the sea and being marked with a few strong touches contribute to throw the ocean into perspective  but though the situation of undercliff or steephill is pleasing we could not say much for what is called the cottage it is covered indeed with thatch but that makes it no more a cottage than ruffles would make a clown a gentleman or a meally hat would turn a laced beau into a miller we every where see the appendages of junket and good living who would expect to find a fountain bubbling up under the windows of a cottage into an elegant carved shell to cool wine the thing is beautiful but out of place the imagination does not like to be jolted in its sensations from one idea to another but to go on quietly in the same track either of grandeur or simplicity easy contrasts it approves but violent interruptions it dislikes  pleasing ideas no doubt may be executed under the form of a cottage but to make them pleasing they should be harmonious we sometimes see the cottage idea carried so far as to paste ballads on the walls with good effect but we need not restrict what may be called the artificial cottage to so very close an imitation of the natural one in the inside certainly it may admit much greater neatness and convenience though even here every ornament that approaches splendour should be rejected without too though the roof be thatched we may allow it to cover two stories and if it project somewhat over the walls the effect may be better we should not object to sashed windows but they must not be large and if you wish for a vestibule a common brick porch with a plain neat roof is all we allow we often see the front of a cottage covered with what is called rough cast which has a good effect and this may be tinted with a yellowish tinge mixed with lime which is more pleasing than the cold raw tint of lime and ashes but if in the front there is any stonework under the denomination of frize archetrave or ornament of any kind it is too much  the ground about a cottage should be neat but artless there is no occasion to plant cabbages in the front the garden may be removed out of sight but the lawn that comes up to the door should be grazed rather than mown the sunkfence the net and the painted rail are ideas alien to the cottage the broad gravel walk too we totally reject and in its room wish only for a simple unaffected one  these things being considered it may perhaps be a more difficult thing to rear a cottage with all its proper uniformities than is commonly imagined inasmuch as it may be easier to introduce the elegances of art than to catch the pure simplicity of nature  from steephill we visited a scene of a very different kind sir richard worsleys seat at appuldercomb here every thing was uniformly grand the house is magnificent and it is magnificently furnished enriched ceilings a few good pictures costly hangings shewy carpets gobelin chairs and large pierglasses all correspond and yet not in any expensive profusion since this has been written i am told the house is adorned with some curious pieces of greek antiquities   the grounds too which were more the objects of our curiosity are laid out in a style of greatness equal to the mansion a woody scene rising behind is a beautiful background to the house as well as an excellent shelter from the north in front is spread a magnificent lawn or rather a park for it is furnished with deer well varied and not illplanted stretching far and wide its boundary in one part is confined at the distance of about two miles by a hill running out like a promontory whose continuous horizontal ridge might hurt the eye if it were not crowned with a castle this object seems well executed and is certainly well placed views of the sea and various parts of the island are judiciously opened from all the higher grounds about the house    sect xxxiv from this scene of magnificence in splendour we visited another of magnificence in ruin this was carisbrokecastle an object perhaps the best worth seeing of any in the island instead of passing on therefore to the needlecliffs which remained yet unseen we returned to newport which lies within a short walk of the castle  carisbrokecastle stands on elevated ground nearly in the center of the island it is a fortress of great antiquity its towers and battlements have been the care of several princes through a long series of years and we easily mark the style of different ages not only from the dates and arms which are placed in various parts of the castle but also in the mode of building its latest works have the air of modern fortification they are constructed of earth faced with stone and are carried round the castle as an outwork forming a circumference of about a mile and a half what is properly called the castle stands on somewhat less than two acres of land it is difficult on the spot to comprehend the various parts of this complicated fortress to describe it would be impossible some of the more remarkable parts are commonly shown we were carried to see montjoys tower the walls of which are eighteen feet thick we were conducted also to the top of the keep from whence we discovered the sea in the three directions of north south and east on the west a hill intercepted it we were shown also a well as curious for its depth as the keep is for its height and were desired to listen to the echoes and lengthened sound which even a pin makes when thrown into it there lived lately an appendage to this well which deserved notice also it was an ass which had drawn water patiently from it through the space of forty years  carisbrokecastle was once the residence of the princes of the country and afterward of appointed governors when the island became annexed to the crown as the inhabitants had not that ready access to justice which other parts of the kingdom had they sometimes smarted under the despotic power of their governors remonstrances were often made to the crown but it seems to have been a maxim of state especially during the reign of the tudors to strengthen rather than abridge the power of governors in the remoter provinces and though it was not always a maxim of justice it was probably a maxim of good policy on the borders of scotland we have many instances of this delegated tyranny  but though the governors of the island were sometimes apt to overruled law themselves they were careful not to let the inhabitants feel vexations of any law but their own for this reason they would never suffer an attorney to settle in the island in the oglander family are preserved some memoirs of the country written by sir john oglander one of their ancestors in which we are told that in the reign of elizabeth when sir george carry was governor of the island an attorney came sneaking into it with a view to settle sir george hearing of him had him apprehended and ordering bells to be fastened about his legs and a lighted firebrand tied to his back he turned him loose to the populace who hunted him out of the island see sir r worsleys account of the isle of wight   adjoining to carisbroke castle is a royal domain called parkhurst or carisbrokeforest it contains about three thousand acres and must have been when its woods were luxuriant very beautiful it is now a naked scene but we saw its elegant lines with more advantage than if it had been adorned with all its sylvan drapery the deer its ancient inhabitants are now nearly extinct and it is grazed by sheep and little groups of wild horses which are not less ornamental  the great historical circumstance of carisbrokecastle is its having been long the prison of distressed majesty many a mournful tale on this subject the noble historian of those times has told us he is circumstantial in his relation of the unhappy charless imprisonment here but in an account of the isle of wight collected by an ancestor of the worsleyfamily and printed though in few hands some circumstances with regard to that event are mentioned which had not come to the ears of lord clarendon  that historian tells us through what means this unfortunate prince threw himself into the power of colonel hammond who was then governor of the isle of wight hammond however seems to have been a man of humanity and while his hands were untied was disposed to show the king every civility in his power charles took his exercise on horseback where he pleased though his motions were probably observed and as the parliament had granted him five thousand pounds a year he lived a few months in something like royal state  but this liberty was soon abridged his chaplains and servants were first taken from him then his going abroad in the island gave offense and soon after his intercourse with any body but those set about him so solitary were his hours during a great part of his confinement that as he was one day standing near the gate of the castle with sir philip warwick he pointed to an old decrepid man walking across one of the courts and said that man is sent every morning to light my fire and is the best companion i have had for many months  all this severe usage charles bore with patience and equanimity and endeavored as much as possible to keep his mind employed he had ever been impressed with serious thoughts of religion which his misfortunes had now strengthened and confirmed devotion meditation and reading the scriptures were his great consolation the few books he had brought with him into the castle were chiefly on religious subjects or of a serious cast among them was hookers ecclesiastical polity this book it is probable he had studied with great attention as it related much to the national questions of that time in which no man was better versed in his slender catalogue we find also two books of amusement tassos jerusalem and spencers fairy queen if charles had acted with as much judgment as he read and had shown as much discernment in life as he had taste in the arts he might have figured among the greatest princes every lover of picturesque beauty however must respect this amiable prince notwithstanding his political weaknesses we never had a prince in england whose genius and taste were more elevated and exact he saw the arts in a very enlarged point of view the amusements of his court were a model of elegance to all europe and his cabinets were the receptacles only of what was exquisite in sculpture and painting none but men of the first merit in their profession found encouragement from him and these abundantly jones was his architect and vandyck his painter charles was a scholar a man of taste a gentleman and a christian he was every thing but a king the art of reigning was the only art of which he was ignorant  but though a love for the arts we see has no connection with political wisdom yet we cannot so easily give up its tendency to meliorate the heart this effect we may presume at least it had on charles  to this supposition in favor of the arts it is objected that we often see among professional men very abandoned libertines but i should here wish to suggest a distinction between an innate love for what is beautiful and that sort of mechanical turn which can happily delineate color and express an object of beauty the one is seated in the heart and the other in the eye and in the fingers the mechanical man merely following his profession is governed by no idea but that of enriching himself it is not the love of beauty with which he is smitten but the love of money he paints a picture with as little enthusiasm as a blacksmith shoes a horse all this is sordid whereas the true admirer of art feels his mind thoroughly impressed with the love of beauty he is transported with it in nature and he admires it in art the substitute of nature the love of beauty may exist without a hand to execute the images it excites it may exist the more strongly perhaps for being only felt for the conceptions of genius never rise in value from their being embodied the embodied form is always below the original idea  the beauteous forms of nature and art thus impressed on the mind give it a disposition to happiness from the habit of being pleased from the habit of seeking always for pleasing objects and making even displeasing objects agreeable by throwing on them such colors of imagination as improve their defects and if a love for beauty is not immediately connected with moral ideas we may at least suppose that it softens the mind and puts it in a frame to receive them an intimate acquaintance with the works of art and genius in their most beautiful and amiable forms says an agreeable writer harmonizes and sweetens the temper opens and extends the imagination and disposes to the most pleasing views of mankind and providence by considering nature in this favorable point of view the heart is dilated and filled with the most benevolent sentiments and then indeed the secret sympathy and connection between the feelings of natural and moral beauty the connection between a good taste and a good heart appears with the greatest luster gregorys compar view p       we left the unhappy charles who occasioned these remarks in one of the gloomy mansions of carisbrokecastle amusing his solitary hours with hookers ecclesiastical polity and spencers fairy queen his exercise was now much abridged he was skilled in horsemanship and fond of riding but as this was refused he spent two or three hours every morning in walking on the ramparts of the castle here he enjoyed at least a fine air and an extensive prospect though every object he saw the flocks straying carelessly on one side and the ships sailing freely on the other put him in mind of that liberty of which he was so cruelly deprived  in the mean time he was totally careless of his person he let his beard and his hair grow and was inattentive to his dress they who had seen him says lord clarendon a year before thought his countenance extremely altered his hair was gray and his appearance very different from what it had been  there is a picture of him at sionhouse in which the distresses of his mind are strongly characterised on his countenance a person is represented delivering him a letter which may be supposed to contain bad news charless features were always composed and serious but here they are heightened with a melancholy air and yet they are marked also with mildness and fortitude it is a very affecting picture as it brings strongly before us the feelings of this amiable prince on the most disastrous events of his life it is painted so much in the manner of vandyck that it might easily be mistaken for one of his best pictures but it was certainly painted by sir peter lely who copied after vandyck when he first came into england vandyck died in the year      which was before the troubles of charles began  during the time of his imprisonment in carisbrokecastle three attempts were made chiefly by the gentlemen of the island to rescue him lord clarendon gives us the detail of two of them but a third which he had heard of he supposes to have been a mere fiction as it is mentioned however in the worsley papers with every mark of authenticity and as one of the principal conductors of it was a gentleman of that family there seems to be little doubt of its being a fact the following is an abstract of it  by a correspondence privately settled with some gentlemen in the island it was agreed that the king should let himself down by a cord from a window in his apartment a swift horse with a guide were to wait for him at the bottom of the ramparts and a vessel in the offing was to be ready to convey him where he pleased the chief difficulty in the scheme was in the first step the associating gentlemen were doubtful how the king should get through the iron bars of his window but charles assured them he had tried the passage and did not doubt but it was sufficiently large all things therefore were now prepared the hour was come and the secret sign thrown up to the kings window charles being ready began the attempt but he soon found he had made a false calculation having protruded his head and shoulders he could get no farther and what was worse having made great exertions thus far he could not draw himself back his friends at the bottom heard him groan in his distress but were unable to relieve him at length however by repeated efforts he got himself disengaged but made at that time no farther attempt afterward he contrived to saw the bars of his window asunder and another scheme was laid but the particulars of this lord clarendon details  the treaty at newport soon followed after which charles was seized by the army and carried a prisoner to hurstcastle in his way thither he met mr worsley one of the gentlemen who had risked his life for him at carisbroke charles wrung his hand with affection and pulling his watch out of his pocket gave it to him saying that is all my gratitude has to give  this watch is still preserved in the family it is of silver large and clumsy in its form the case is neatly ornamented with filagree but the movements are of very ordinary workmanship and wound up with catgut i mention these particulars merely for the sake of observing that the arts do not certainly troop in companies together so much as they are often represented at the time when this clumsy piece of mechanism was made which we may suppose was the work of the best artist of his day architecture and painting were at a height which they have never exceeded the case seems to be this when art has a model before it as painting has nature and architecture the grecian orders it soon arrives at perfection but such arts as depend on invention science and mechanic skill work their way but slowly in a country in the year      on digging a grave in the church of newport a leaden coffin was found with this inscription elisabeth  d daughter of the late king charles deceased sep  th mdcl   from carisbrokecastle we proposed to visit the western parts of the island and took our course as before along the higher grounds through the middle of the country our road led us near swanston the seat of sir fitzwilliam barrington which seems to be a pleasant scene and afterward near westoverlodge the habitation of mr holmes where we observed nothing very interesting  a little stream which we cross here falling down to the northern coast forms at newtown a few miles below one of the best natural harbors in the island the streets and vestiges of a considerable town are here traced but scarce a house is standing whether it was planned and never built or whether it was destroyed and never restored seems to be matter of uncertainty it is the general opinion that it was burnt in some danish invasion but its being represented in parliament seems rather to indicate its having had a period of later existence  from hence we proceeded to yarmouth where henry viii built a castle to defend the entrance through the needles between the isle of wight and the coast of hampshire on which coast stands hurst another castle opposite to that at yarmouth  here the island draws nearly to a point the extreme part of it is almost separated from the main body by a creek which runs up from yarmouth almost to the opposite shore the narrow isthmus is called freshwatergate here we found ourselves among rocks and precipices of wonderful height and had from this stand a view of an extended range of chalky cliffs running along the southern coast of the island here too we found a perforated cave which in some positions makes a picturesque foreground while the sea appearing through it has a good effect  sect xxxv we had now taken a view of the island from one end to the other and on the whole found ourselves rather disappointed in the chief object of our pursuit which was the picturesque beauty of its scenery  picturesque beauty is a phrase but little understood we precisely mean by it that kind of beauty which would look well in a picture neither grounds laid out by art nor improved by agriculture are of this kind the isle of wight is in fact a large garden or rather a field which in every part has been disfigured by the spade the coulter and the harrow it abounds much more in tillage than in pasturage and of all species of cultivation cornlands are the most unpicturesque the regularity of cornfieldsd disgusts and the color of corn especially near harvest is out of tune with every thing else  yet these manufactured scenes are commonly thought to be picturesque you rarely meet a description of the beauties of the country in which some of its artificial appendages do not make a part of the landscape and in poetry all these circumstances appear with advantage sometimes walking not unseen by hedgerow elms on hillocks green while the plowman near at hand whistles over the furrowed land and the milkmaid singing blithe and the mower whets his scithe but however pleasing all this may be in poetry on canvass hedgerow elms furrowed lands meadows adorned with milkmaids and hayfields adorned with mowers have a bad effect  in considering the isle of wight in a picturesque light we divide it into three kinds of landscape the high grounds the lower cultivated parts and the rocky scenes  the high grounds which as we just observed run from the eastern to the western point through the middle of the island are the only parts of the country which are in a state of nature and yet even these are not wholly so for large farms have in many parts made encroachments upon them and cut them into squares by regular hedges and enclosed sheepwalks sometimes however from these heights we are able to obtain a sweep of country unincumbered with the intrusions of art about carisbrokeforest particularly for many miles together we see nothing like cultivation  but still the best of these views afford little more than what may be called extensive foregrounds of distant country we meet with nothing in a grand style notwithstanding our elevation in some parts we find little dips from the higher grounds into woody bottoms and in other parts distances of a few miles in extent over the country below but nothing that is remote enough to assume grandeur  a distance must stretch away many leagues from the eye it must consist of various intermediate parts it must be enriched by numerous objects which lose by degrees all form and distinctness and finally perhaps terminate in faint purple mountains or perhaps mix with the blue mists of either before it can pretend to the character of grandeur such were the scenes presented to us from the heights of pontic and the hills of quantoc see pages     and      but here we had nothing of this kind a scanty island could not afford them sometimes indeed when the foregrounds were happily disposed with the sea beyond them we got a grand and simple seaview grander perhaps than the distances i have just been alluding to as consisting of fewer parts but for that reason less beautiful and amusing  the northern coast between cowes and st helens is generally considered as the most beautiful part of the island and it presents no doubt many lawns and woods and a variety of ground which must be ever pleasing but still we have only little pleasant pastoral scenes and these but seldom in any perfection for as the whole country is under the discipline of cultivation the picturesque eye is every where more or less offended  to this may be added that there is a great deficiency of wood though here and there a few plantations about improved scenes make a contrast with the lawns they adorn the country in general is naked and yet even so late as in charles iis time there were woods in the island so complete and extensive that it is said a squirrel might have traveled in several parts many leagues together on the tops of the trees these woods however are now almost universally cut down  but it is said the island does not depend so much on its home scenery its views over the channel and the hampshire coast are its pride these views however are far from being the most beautiful of their kind and much less beautiful than we had expected to find them they want the great ingredients of a pleasing coast view a variety of line and an extent of distance either of these ingredients would be a foundation for beauty but here both are wanting  in the first place a variety of line is wanting the line of the opposite coast runs generally in a straight unbroken course for many leagues at least it appears to deviate so little from a straight line that the deviation is lost whereas the true beautiful coast line breaks away in various irregular curves forming either grand rocky projections or ample bays sweeping from the eye in winding perspective these ideas we had unhappily at this time strong in recollection having just left the shores of the bristol channel in which they abound the comparison gave additional tameness to the lines of the hampshire coast  but an extent of country might have made some amends for the want of variety in the lines we had however no more of this circumstance than of the other the whole length of the coast presents only a narrow edging of land whenever you hear the beauties of it mentioned you always hear places named but never a country described you are never told for instance that the country forms some ample vale with wooded hills winding on each side or that the scene at first is woody beyond which the country retires into remote distance nothing of this kind you hear for nothing of this kind exists instead of this beautiful scenery you are informed you may see portsmouth and gosport and lymington and a number of other places which lie near the shore and so you may with a good glass for it is the custom of the island always to contemplate landscape through a telescope  there are indeed times when views on this coast are grander than can be exhibited in any part of the world when the navy of england is forming a rendezvous at spithead or waiting for a wind at st helens every curious person who loves a grand sight would wish for a stand on the islandcoast and indeed the eastern end of it is generally entertained with some exhibition of this kind even in time of peace for though a fleet of thirty or forty sail of the line is not continually riding near the coast yet generally either some ships of war or two or three frigates are passing or repairing from portsmouthharbour going out on a cruise or returning from one  these are sights with which the western coasts of the island are not often entertained the telescope there is seldom levelled at fleets or ships of the line sometimes a solitary frigate with a fair wind or an indiaman may lead through the needles and attract the attention of the western islanders but on that side of the coast they must generally be content with views adorned with skiffs passageboats and fleets of whitingfishers if however they will be content to substitute the picturesque in the room of the grand they have in these minuter appendages the advantage of their eastern neighbors  having thus considered the higher and lower grounds of the isle of wight we consider lastly its rocky scenery this is seldom an ornament to the scenes of the island as it is seldom seen from any part of it sometimes you may get a perspective view of a range of rockycoast but in general the rocks of the island make a show only at sea see page  0   and there they are grand rather than picturesque their height gives them grandeur some of them rearing themselves six hundred feet above the level of the water their extent also is magnificent as they range in some places perhaps a dozen miles along the coast but their form and color unite in injuring their beauty  with regard to their form instead of presenting those noble masses and broad surfaces of projecting rocks which we see along many of the coasts of england they are broken and crumbled into minute parts the chalky substance of which they are constructed has not consistence to spread into an ample surface it shivers too much if i were to describe these rocks therefore in two words i should call them magnificently little this however is a disadvantage only on the foreground at sea all these frittered parts dissolve away and are melted by distance into broad surfaces  but here again the color offends these cliffs are not chalk yet are so like chalk that the fossilist hardly knows what else to call them the painter is in the same dilemma he finds them not white but so nearly white that he hardly knows what other color to give them nature has in many parts spread over them a few stains and tints as she seems always studious to remove an offensive glare but on so large a surface this has but a partial effect and the whole coast for many leagues together appears nearly white now of all hues the painter dislikes white the most as it is the most refractory and unaccommodating to his other tints of course therefore the cliffs of the isle of wight offend him  from this uniformity of color the rocks of allumbay should be excepted the strata of which are tinted and marbled with red brown blue and other colors in a beautiful manner this bay is nearly opposite to hurstcastle and is the most western inlet which is formed on the northern side of the island  there is one circumstance belonging to the western rocks of the isle of wight which though but a trifling one is of a picturesque nature and ought therefore to be mentioned at periodical seasons they are frequented with prodigious flights of seafowl of various kinds their numbers can only be described by the hyperbolical expression of darkening the air they sit commonly when they are not in motion on the ledges of the cliffs in the crannies of which they breed you see them ranged in black files through a considerable space the report of a gun brings them all out of their recesses and the air which a moment before was still and quiet is now beaten with myriads of busy wings and filled with screams and cries as various as the several tribes from which they issue we have often rested on our oars under the rocks says mr pennant with much descriptive elegance attentive to the sounds above our heads which mixed with the solemn roar of the waves swelling into the vast caverns beneath and retiring from them produced a fine effect the sharp note of the seagull the loud scream of the awk together with the hoarse deep periodical croak of the cormorant which serves as a base to the rest often furnished us with a concert and joined with the wild scenery that surrounded us afforded us a high degree of pleasure but it is not i think from novelty to which mr pennant ascribes it that the pleasure arises these notes though discordant in themselves are in perfect harmony with the wild scenes where they are heard and this makes them chiefly interesting in the views therefore of this rocky coast these flights of birds should never be forgotten as they may well be numbered among its picturesque appendages  neither fish nor fowl can haunt a coast but the inhabitants find some means of turning them to advantage these airy inmates of such cliffs and precipices as hang beetling many fathoms above the sea one should imagine might pass their lives in full security but man with the hand of art contrives to reach them he fixes an iron crow firm in the ground and tying a rope tight to it he lets himself down with a basket in his hand among the middle regions of the cliffs where the fowls inhabit so bold and sudden an invasion frights them immediately from their recesses with a watchful eye he examines the parts of the rock from which they chiefly escape and scrambling about by the help of his rope he fills his basket with their eggs for which he can always find a ready market  these birds also furnish amusement to all the neighboring country in summer a number of shooting parties are formed both by land and sea and when the weather is fine you can seldom sail past without falling in with some of them  that man has a right to destroy such animals as are noxious to him is undoubted that he has a right also over the lives of such animals as are useful to him for food and other necessaries is equally unquestioned but whether he has a right to destroy life for his amusement is another question if he is determined to act the tyrant that is to consider power as conferring right the point is decided power he certainly has but if he wish to act on authorized and equitable principles let him just point out the passage in his charter of rights over the brute creation which gives him the liberty of destroying life for his amusement on noah and in him on all mankind the charter was conferred by which we hold the flesh of animals in fee and claim over all we feed on power of life and death but read the instrument and mark it well the oppression of a tyrannous control can find no warrant there i would not enter on my list of friends though graced with polished manners and fine sense yet wanting sensibility the man who needlessly sets foot upon a worm the sum is this if mans convenience health or safety interfere his rights and claims are paramount and must extinguish theirs else they are all  the meanest things that are  as free to live and to enjoy that life as god was free to form them at the first who in his sovereign wisdom made them all    i shall conclude these remarks on the numerous flights of seafowl with a passage from vaillents travels in africa which is the most curious of the kind i have met with on his landing on dassen island at the mouth of saldanhabay near the cape of good hope he tells us there rose suddenly from the whole surface of the island an immense canopy or rather a sky composed of birds of every species and of all colors cormorants seagulls seaswallows pelicans etc i believe all the winged tribe of africa were here assembled all their voices united together formed such horrid music that i was every moment obliged to cover my head to give a little relief to my ears the alarm which we spread was the more general among these legions of birds as we principally disturbed the females who were then sitting they had nests eggs and young to defend they were like furious harpies let loose against us they often flew so near us that they flapped their wings in our faces and though we fired repeatedly we could not frighten them it seemed almost impossible to disperse the cloud we could not move a step without crushing either eggs or young ones the earth was entirely strewed with them  there is besides these flights of birds another picturesque circumstance frequently seen on the coasts of the isle of wight which may be mentioned though it is a dreadful one that of shipwrecks as the distresses of mankind furnish the choicest subjects for dramatic scenes so do they often for painting and among these no marine subject is equal to a shipwreck in the hands of a master i put it into the hands of a master because i have more frequently seen this subject mismanaged than any other a winter seldom passes in which the inhabitants of these dangerous coasts are not called together to see some dreadful event of this kind long experience has taught them to judge when the mischief is inevitable they see that every wave which beats over the perishing vessel drives her nearer some reefs of rocks well known to them though the seaman knows it not signals can be of no use yet they make what signals they can to point out the danger in a short moment the dreadful crash arrives the laboring vessel now beating among the rocks gives way in every part and the hospitable islanders very unlike their neighbors on the cornish coast have nothing left but to do every thing in their power to save the miserable people and recover what they can from the wreck  having now finished our view of the isle of wight we returned from the rocks of freshwater to yarmouth where we took boat for lymington  sect xxxvi it has long been a question among naturalists whether the isle of wight was ever joined to the coast of hampshire its western point has greatly the appearance of having been torn and convulsed those vast insulated rocks called the needles seem plainly to have been washed away from the shores of the island one of them which was known by the name of lots wife a tall spiral rock was undermined and swallowed up by the sea not many years ago and there is every probability that the rest will follow  what renders this separation of the island from the main still more probable is that the sea makes yearly depredations along that part of the hampshire coast called hordlecliff which is just opposite to the needles it has been observed too that there are chalkrocks at the bottom of the water exactly like the needles all along the channel toward christchurch  the best recorded authority which we have of this early union between the isle of wight and the main is given us by diodorus siculus this writer speaking of the tin trade in britain informs us that the people of cornwall brought this metal to a certain island called ictis for the sake of its being more easily transported from thence to the continent into which island they carried it in carts when the tide ebbed for ictis he says was only an island at full sea lib iv p  0  ed hen   by ictis it is supposed diodorus meant the isle of wight the ancient name of which was vectis a name nearly similar this opinion however has been opposed by some and particularly by mr borlase in his antiquities of cornwall who rather supposes the ictis of diodorus to be some island though he does not well settle where upon the coast of cornwall but mr whitaker in his history of manchester has brought forward the old opinion again with new authority  if then this supposition is at length well grounded we may gather from it these points of information that the isle of wight was once a vast promontory running out into the sea like the isle of purbeck at this time that it was then united solidly to the coast of hampshire at its western point and in all other parts surrounded by the sea but that about two thousand years ago which is somewhat before the time of diodorus the sea had gained so far upon it that it became insular and peninsular according to the flux and reflux of the tide till at length the sea gaining still farther possession formed it as it is at present into an absolute island  as we entered lymingtonriver we found a fresh proof of the probability of the ancient union between vectis and the main the tide was gone and had left vast stretches of ooze along the deserted shores here we saw lying on the right a huge stump of a tree which our boatman informed us had been dragged out of the water he assured us also that roots of oaks and other trees were often found on these banks of mud which seems still to strengthen the opinion that all this part of the coast now covered with the tide had once been forestland  sect xxxvii from lymington we proceeded to southampton but all this part of the country through newforest as far as to the bay of southampton has been examined in another work forest scenery   at redbridge we crossed the river which flows into southamptonbay over a long wooden bridge and causeway sometimes covered by the tide ships of considerable burden come up as far as this bridge where they take in timber from newforest and other commodities  a little beyond redbridge at a place called milbroke a beautiful view opens of southampton before us lay southamptonbay spreading into a noble surface of water the town runs out like a peninsula on the left and with its old walls and towers makes a picturesque appearance on the right forming the other side of the bay appear the skirts of newforest and the opening in front is filled with a distant view of the isle of wight  southampton is an elegant well built town it stands on the confluence of two large waters and when the tide is full is seated on a peninsula it is a town of great antiquity and still preserves its respectable appendages of ancient walls and gates the country around is beautiful  at southampton we took boat to see the ruins of netleyabbey which lie about three miles below on the bay as we approached nothing could be seen from the water the bank is high and woody and skreens every thing beyond it having landed and walked up the meadows about a quarter of a mile we entered a circular valley which seems to be a mile in circumference and is skreened with wood on every side i believe much of this wood is now cut down  except that which opens to a part of the river and which has probably once been wooded also in a dip near the center of this valley stands netleyabbey as you approach it you see buildings only of the most ordinary species gableends and square walls without any ornament except a few heavy buttresses  you enter a large square which was formerly known by the name of the fountaincourt the side on which you enter seems to have been once chambered and divided into various offices such also was the left side of the court where the bakery and ovens may still be traced but in general whatever the rooms have been which occupied these two sides the traces of them are very obscure on the third side opposite to the entrance the court is bounded by the south wall of the great church and along the fourth side range different apartments which are the most perfect of any that remain in this whole mass of ruin  the first you enter seems to have been a dininghall it is twentyfive paces long and nine broad and has been vaulted and chambered above adjoining to it on the right are the pantry and kitchen you still see in the former the aperture or butteryhatch through which victuals were conveyed into the hall the kitchen of netleyabbey is inferior to that of glastonbury but is a spacious and lofty vaulted room and what is peculiar from one side of it leads a subterraneous passage to the river which some imagine to have been a common sewer but it is too ample i should suppose to have been intended for that purpose  at the other end of the dininghall you pass through a small vaulted room into the chapter house which is ten paces square this room is beautifully proportioned and adorned on each side by three arches which uniting at the top in ribs support a vaulted roof to this adjoin two smaller rooms from whence there is an entrance to the great church by the cross aisle  the great church has been a very elegant piece of gothic architecture and is almost the only part of the whole ruin which is picturesque all traces of the aisles and pillars are lost but the walls are entire except half the crossaisle which is gone the east and west windows remain the former has not yet lost all its ornaments and both are very beautiful without as well as within maundrel tells us that the east windows in all the christian churches he met with in his travels as far as tire which were not fewer than a hundred were left uninjured maundrels travels p     a similar remark i think may be made on most of the ruined churches in england the fact is singular but whether it is owing to chance or superstition may be doubted in that part of the crossaisle at netleyabbey which remains a small part of the stone roof is still left and is a very curious specimen of gothic antiquity  more of this roof might still have remained if the warnings of heaven as that renowned antiquarian brown willis informs us had taken effect from him we have an anecdote which he assures us is founded on fact of a carpenter who once trafficked with the owner of netley for this elegant roof which he meant to pull down and convert into gain as he retired to rest his slumbers were disturbed with dreadful dreams these having no effect the next night visions appeared venerable old men in monkish habits with frowning faces and threatening hands still he pursued his wicked purpose but the next night he had scarce fallen asleep when a monstrous copingstone fell plumb upon his head he started with horror and was hardly at length persuaded it was a dream all this having only a momentary effect in the morning he went to work on the execution of his design no farther warning was given him he had scarce mounted a ladder when a copingstone fell in earnest from the roof and put him to instant death others however it seems have been found notwithstanding this example who have pursued the design for a mere fragment of the roof only now remains  the present possessor pursues an opposite extreme the whole body of the church is now so choked with ruin and overgrown with thickets and ivybushes that the greatest part of the building is invisible a degree of all these no doubt would be ornamental but like other ornaments when they are too profusely scattered they offend these ruins are as much obstructed on the outside as they are within we walked round them and could find only two places the two end windows where we could possibly take a view every other approach is excluded except on the side we entered which least deserves to be exposed this part is so very ordinary that it raises a prejudice at first against the whole and the ruin would be shown to much more advantage if this side were blocked up with wood and the approach made either by the east or west window of the great church beyond the ruins are the remains of large stewponds which were formerly appendages of the abbey  sect xxxviii as we set sail from netleyabbey we had a beautiful view of southampton running from us in a point directly opposite to that view which we had from redbridge the indentations made by the river itchin and other creeks are great advantages to the view  from southampton we took our rout to winchester through a very beautiful country the first object is an artificial avenue composed of detached groups of fir the idea of an avenue as a connecting thread between a town and a country is a good one we observe however that the beauty of this avenue is much greater as we approach southampton than as we leave it as we leave it the avenue ends abruptly in a naked country but as we turned round and viewed it in retrospect it united with the woody scene around it which had a good effect a retrospect also afforded beautiful views over southampton river and its appendages the town newforest and the isle of wight all this pleasing country appeared under various forms and was often set off with good foregrounds  having passed the avenue and a few miles of miscellaneous country no way interesting we entered about the sixth stone a forestscene abounding with all the charms of that species of landscape in this we continued three or four miles  from these woody scenes the country becomes more heathy but is still diversified with wood and affords many pleasing distances on the right till at length it suddenly degenerates into chalky grounds which are of the same kind as those described in our approach to winchester see page      we left winchester by the basingstoke road which passes through a country with little picturesque beauty on either hand it becomes by degrees flat and unpleasant and soon degenerates into commonfield land which with its striped divisions is of all kinds of country generally the most unpleasant  near basingstoke stand the ruins of basinghouse which we cannot pass without feeling a respect for the gallant figure it made beyond that of any fortress of its size in the civil wars of charles i it was at that time the seat of the marquis of winchester who fortified and held it for the king during the greatest part of those troublesome times though it underwent an almost continued blockade once it was so far reduced by famine as to be on the point of surrendering and its relief by colonel gage was considered as one of the most soldierly actions of the war lord clarendon has detailed this gallant enterprise at length the outlines of it are these the king was then at oxford he had been applied to for assistance by the garrison at basinghouse but it was blockaded by so large a force that all the military men about him thought any attempt to relieve it desperate gage however offered his service and getting together a few volunteers well mounted undertook the business on monday night he left oxford which is forty miles from basinghouse came up with the besiegers before daylight on wednesday morning forced their lines by an unexpected attack and entered the place with a string of horses laden with provision the enemy soon found how contemptible a number had alarmed them and returning to their posts began to close up the avenues gage with that readiness of invention which is able to command the crisis of a great action sent orders into the country to provide quantities of provision for a large reinforcement which he hourly expected this intelligence gave a momentary pause to the motions of the enemy a moment was all that gage wanted he issued instantly from the garrison with his small troop of horse and through bye roads got safe to oxford without interruption thus relieved basinghouse continued to baffle all the attempts of the parliament till the fatal battle of naseby after that event misfortunes came in with a full tide upon the king every day brought him some new account of the loss of his garrisons and among other places he had the mortification to hear of the loss of basinghouse cromwell himself appeared before it and summoning it in haughty language was answered with scorn the incensed chief fell upon it with a body of his veteran troops carried it by assault and put the garrison to the sword  among the few fugitives that escaped was the celebrated engraver hollar who had been shut up in the castle this event in a picturesque work is a circumstance worth mentioning  from basingstoke we continued our route to bagshot lord albermarles house and improvements appeared to great advantage contrasted by the heath which surrounded them they seemed like an island in the main as we approached stains the duke of cumberlands plantations in windsorpark made a noble appearance  from stains we crossed the thames at kingston where we entered surrey  appendix since this volume went to press sir joshua reynoldss lectures fell into the authors hands which he had never seen before as they point out two or three mistakes which he had made he thinks it proper to mention them in an appendix in page    speaking of monuments in churches he expresses his doubts whether the introduction of them will be any advantage to st pauls which the judicious architect he supposes had already adorned as much as he thought consistent with the sublimity of his idea in speaking on the same subject sir joshua on the contrary informs us that sir christopher wren left niches in st pauls on purpose for monuments busts single figures basreliefs and groups of figures vol ii p     the author can only say that he does not remember any niches or recesses in st pauls which gave him ideas of this kind but as what sir joshua says is given as information and his remark depends only on supposition and recollection it must of course give way  in page     he speak highly of vandycks superiority as a portrait painter but slightly of his abilities in history a large piece in which vandyck has many figures to manage he supposes to be a work which required more skill in composition than vandyck possessed his opinion is formed chiefly on the great familypicture at wilton which gave occasion to these remarks and on two large pictures which he had formerly seen and examined at houghtonhall in none of which the composition pleased him but sir joshua reynolds in his travels through flanders tells us that he saw at mecklin a picture of the crucifixion by vandyck which he thought one of the first pictures in the world and scruples not to say he thinks vandyck had a genius for historypainting the author cannot withstand such authority but must withdraw his own opinion  or at least keep it modestly to himself  but though he had the mortification to find he differed from sir joshua reynolds in these and a few more particulars he had the pleasure to find they agreed in a number of others two or three of them belong to the volume before us in page     the author observes that he had oftener than once judged falsely on the first sight of salvators pictures which pleased him more on a second view this however he considers as a fault for we expect from a good picture as from a good man a favorable impression at sight sir joshuas opinion of a good picture is the same he says it should please at first sight and appear to incite the spectators attention vol i p  0   in the   st page the beautiful effect of easy action in a statue in opposition to none at all is considered and the venus the apollo the listening slave and the farnesian hercules resting from one of his labors are instanced all these gentle modes of action or expression are considered in the passage alluded to as much more beautiful than the uninteresting vacancy of a consul standing erect in his robes  he had the pleasure to see remarks exactly similar to these in one of sir joshuas lectures vol i p     those works of the ancients says he which are in the highest esteem have something beside mere simplicity to recommend them the apollo the venus the laocoon the gladiator have a certain composition of action with contrasts sufficient to give grace and energy in a high degree but it must be confessed of the
