being a little unfashionable seem to carry with it an air of vanity to some with a degree of pride to others but as the author is not himself conscious of either he will be as little affected by such constructions as he is by the ingenious writings of those who are said to have lashed the town with great humor and severity vide c  ll and l  ds reports of the playhouse in the two poems of the

impeachment of that sort however deserving you may think him of the lash in other respects for though he is sensible their having acted an illiberal part is by no means a sufficient plea for him yet

much of his time on subjects wholly unworthy his and the publicks attention an assertion strongly confirmed by a quaere the author had put to him the other day by a gentleman conversing with him upon the intended plan of his retort who immediately and with great justice it must be admitted interrogated him in the following words from horace ten moveat cimex pantilius   aut cruciet quod vellicet

the verge of suffering death on no other account whatever than from a supposition and report prevailing of his being a friend and intimate of the traitors like him has the present author been most illiberally brought under the same lash with a gentleman whom the noble triumvirate have thought proper to censure vilify and defame and like menander too has he suffered this on no other apparent account than from a seeming intimacy and friendship subsisting between him and this gentleman hinc sibi prima mali labes hinc spargere voces in vulgum ambiguas virg but the author would recommend it
