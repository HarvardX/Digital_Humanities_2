with the greatest esteem for her judgment is inscribed by her respectful humble servant  edward jerningham  advertisement the subject of this poem is founded on a circumstance that happened during the late war  a young lady not meeting with the concurrence of her relations in favor of an officer for whom she expressed her regard was prevailed upon by his solicitations to consent to a clandestine marriage which took place on the day he sat out to join his regiment abroad where he was unfortunately killed in an engagement  amabella harmodius breathed the rural air nor found his ruddy health with length of years decrease by duty prompted amabella crowned his silver forehead with the wreath of peace by partial nature framed in beautys mould adorned with every grace unspoild by art to friendships circle still did she unfold the lovelier beauties of a feeling heart endeared to all she met each welcome day by fortunes hand with various blessings fraught when lo her gayetys accustomed ray was quenched untimely with the gloom of thought what fixed the bosomthorn affliction knows where peace sat brooding as the gentle dove what blasted on her cheek the summer rose or slow disease or unsuccessful love remained unknown  twas by the many guessed that love to her soft vows had proved unkind beyond the power of her weak frame oppressed insanity oerthrew her lovely mind at length recovring yet to grief devote to solitude she gave the unsocial day like a pale votry from the world remote uncheerd unvisited of pleasures ray often did harmodius at her state dismayed solicit from his child her secret pain her vague reply still from his question strayed and each repeated effort proved in vain to speed the moments of the loitring hour and by their plaintive strains perchance allured within a spacious myrtlewoven bower two turtle doves the pensive fair secured ye little captives would she often say though here secluded from the fields of air through yonder vernal grove forbid to stray and join the kindred train that wanton there against you the gunner never lifts his arm nor over this mansion does the falcon sail you live unconscious of the storms alarm the rain impetuous and the beating hail nor here by kind compassion unimpressd the schoolboy ever rears his impious hand to fill with agony the feathered breast and raze the little domes that love had pland their harmless joys disease too soon effaced one fatal morn her turturellas mate she found with flagging wing subdued oppressed and just sinking at the blow of fate while down her cheek compassions shower distilled she gently raised it to her anxious breast but deaths cold blast lifes crimson current chilled and thus the fair her breathless bird addressed illfated turtle round whose peaceful bower the jocund loves so lately wont to play how sunk alas in youths exulting hour to fell disease to death the untimely prey how silent is the voice which void of art along the tender day was heard to coo how still how frozen is the constant heart which to its dear companion beat so true that dear companion that now widowed dove to screen from every harm be mine the care and while she mourns her never reviving love her grief to me the mourner will endear like thee a widow too condemned to mourn no more to me does life unfold its charms death death forbids him ever to return she said  and sunk into the attendants arms her swift relapsing to her former state with boding fears approached the serving train this scenes dread period tremblingly they wait nor were their boding fears indulged in vain awakning from her trance around she threw distressful fair her much disorder d deyes and wildring said  repeat that kind adieu ah no from love to war to death he flies did ye not hear the clash of hostile spears ah mark ye not that breast plate stained with gore what groan was that which pearcd these fearful ears he falls he falls  my warrior is no more nor was oh heaven his amabella near to sooth his pain and echo sigh to sigh drop on the gaping wound a balmy tear kiss his cold lip and close his fading eye of her distress the alarmed harmodius taught with trembling steps approached the unconscious fair give me he cried with grief paternal fraught give me oh amabel to sooth thy care say what affliction has thy soul impress d reveal what storm thy bosomed calmness breaks reveal  and thus relieve this anguish d breast the tender father to his daughter speaks amabella ah what avails the praise the brave obtain through his white bosom rushed the hostile steel it was his to swell the number of the slain and mine afflictions keenest point to feel  harmodius her roving thought no trace of reason bears to her racked mind oh heaven thy peace impart a loving parent bathes thy cheek with tears harmodius holds thee to his breaking heart  amabella to thee i grateful kneel oh generous seer who do to one unknown thy care extend along thy path may peace her olives rear and heaven in battle shield thy dearest friend for me who droop beneath misfortunes shower i had a father  now alas a foe  thou wilt blush to hear  in sorrows darkest hour he leaves his child abandoned to her woe but to thy heart that is framed of softer mould what can to thee a wretch like me endear the spring the motive of thy love unfold say say for me why flows that friendly tear yet soft awhile  methinks that hoary brow  that plaintive voice  ah bear with my distress  or much remembrance is effaced or now a tender fathers teardewd cheek i press  harmodius on knees of gratitude i bless the skies that amabella to herself restore  amabella ah wherefore do thou joy thy daughter dies support me to yon couch  i can no more   i feel i feel the pulse of life retire ah deign to hear thy dying child reveal what in rebellion to thy just desire locked in her breast she dared so long conceal by thee unsanctiond did i plight my love and all to thee unknown a bride became  harmodius harmodius will to both a father prove   amabella to him thy pardon thou can never proclaim three fleeting hours had scarcely called me bride when he was summoned to the martial plain and there  forgive these tears  in beautys pride the much lamented valiant youth was slain what though unworthy of thy care i prove to thy remembrance let thy child be dear thy kind compassion let the daughter move when this weak frame shall press the untimely bier more would she say  her voice began to fail from her faint eye lifes lingering spark retired the ripening cherry on her lip grew pale she heaved a sigh and in that sigh expired
