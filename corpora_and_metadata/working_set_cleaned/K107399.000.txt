frontisepiece the works of the lord are great sought out of all them thath pleafure therein psalm cxi   lo these are part of his ways but how little a portion is heard of him job xxvi     a description of a great variety of animals and vegetables viz beasts birds fishes insects plants fruits and flowers   extracted from the most considerable writers of natural history and adapted to the use of all capacities especially for the entertainment of youth  being a supplement to a description of three hundred animals illustrated with above ninety copper plates whereon is curiously engraven every animal and vegetable described in the whole book  the treasures of nature are inexhaustible he spoke of trees from the cedartree that is in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springs out of the wall he spoke also of beasts and of fowl and of creeping things and of fishes   kings iv    london printed by j t for thomas boreman near childs coffeehouse in st pauls churchyard  mdccxxxvi  to the reader the description of three hundred animals the first essay of this kind for the use of young people having been favorably received encouraged me to make this second collection of animals and vegetables which i hope will prove as successful as the former i have some reason to expect it because every invention and improvement that tends to delight and please young persons that this does so is already manifested by experience will undoubtedly be a fresh motive to engage their attention  the minds of youth like their bodily appetites require to be fed with some suitable entertainment the most pleasing things being wont to cloy by long and frequent use natural history is an inexhaustible subject which will furnish them with a boundless variety of things fit to exercise their inquisitive minds and i cannot help thinking that to encourage youth in reading this subject must be of real benefit both now and hereafter it will introduce them into a habit of reading from their natural propensity to view the pictures read the names and history of the creatures etc which all seem delighted with but the great and chief service it will be to them hereafter is bringing them acquainted with the great creator of all these things by contemplating his stupendous works it will afford a delightful satisfaction to search into nature to trace her footsteps and the various methods she takes to bring her works to perfection indeed it cannot be expected that children can understand these things or be able to make a right use of them but by tuition persons of the lowest capacity may be made to know that the lord made the earth by his power established the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heaven by his understanding jer li    and that he has replenished the earth whereon we dwell with variety of plants animals etc some for use some for ornament and some for delight which give daily demonstration of the wisdom power and goodness of the maker and supporter of all these things  a new study seems at first to some persons hard intricate and difficult but after a little resolution and progress after they become a little acquainted with it their understandings are wonderfully cleared up and enlarged the difficulties vanish and the thing grows easy familiar and pleasant and sure i am such studies as these are vastly superior to the tales fables and stories of love used in schools and deserve the regard of parents and teachers as conducing more to the honor of god and the real benefit of youth and for our encouragement in this study observe what the psalmist says the works of the lord are great sought out of all them that have pleasure therein psalm cxi   which though it is principally spoken of the works of providence yet may as well he verified of the works of the creation  fig   bezoar goat   a description of a great variety of animals and vegetables book the first of fourfooted beasts fig   is a kind of wild goat bred in the east indies which is called in latin capricerva because they partake of the deer and goat the inhabitants otherwise call them bezoar from whence the name of bezoar arises this animal is very nimble so that he will skip from rock to rock and is dangerous to the hunter for he will defend himself and sometimes kills the indians that pursue him the head of this creature resembles that of the hegoat the horns are very black and are bended almost to his back the body is covered with an ashcolored hair inclining to red much shorter than that of the goat and nearest to the deers the tail is short and turns up again the legs are pretty thick and the feet are cleft like those of the goat bezoar is a stone produced in several parts of the belly of this goat it is taken likewise out of the bellies of certain other animals in the east indies it is found in balls of different sizes and shapes for some are as big as a wallnut others as a hazelnut this sort they say is taken from a kind of ape that is found particularly in a certain island of america and some as a large pea some are round others oval flat or bunched the superfices of all the sorts are smooth polished shining of an olive or gray color and is made use of in medicine  fig   the muskgoat is of the shape and color of a hind only it has a longer body it is produced in the kingdoms of boutan tunquin and several other parts of asia it frequents the woods and forests where they hunt it and when it is killed they cut out the bladder or pouch as big as a hens egg which is found under the belly then they separate the coagulated blood which they dry in the sun and reduce to a kind of light moss almost powdered of a dark reddish color this acquires a strong disagreeable smell they then wrap it up in bladders for transportation and this is the musk we use there are a prodigious number of animals that yield musk chiefly in the kingdom of boutan they catch them usually at springtime or in the beginning of summer for after they have been almost starved during the winter because of the snows that fall in those countries ten or twelve foot deep they come to seek for food their blood being then in a great heat and violent fermentation the musk then taken is likewise strong and spirituous which is the reason they do not expose it for some time to dry in the air lest it should quite destroy the smell they cannot take a great deal of musk from any one of these animals because they have but one cod a piece which does not yield above three drams of musk dried they say that the bag during the rutting of this creature has an abseess formed in it which when fully ripe it makes the beast itch and rub himself against stones rocks and stumps of trees till he breaks it and it is this corruption that when it is spilt and dried in the sun becomes musk there is no impossibility in this story but yet it is not to be thought that all she musk we have is taken from these abscesses for fig   musk goat fig   shamoy fig   the shagreen is it likely that they can follow the tract of these wild beasts through the woods and forests to gather up this matter which they have thrown sometimes into places inaccessible into mire and sands if we had no other musk but that it would be much scarcer and dearer than it is  fig   the shamoy or rockgoat is a wild goat no bigger than the common kind which frequents the rocks and high hills as the alps pyrenees etc the horns of this animal are odly turned for they rise upright first and then wind forward like a hook it feeds upon the plants that grows on the sands and tops of the rocks it is a very shy and timorous creature it is coated like a faun having a streak running all along the back there is a great trade carried on with these shamoy skins by which they convey oil wine and other liquids out of the mountainous countries and of which they make several other uses for these shamoy skins being dressed are converted into gloves breeches etc because they may be washed as linen is and likewise be dyed into what curious color you please sometimes in the bladder of these creatures is found a stone which is called german bezoar because the germans esteem this not inferior in virtue to the oriental bezoar the volatile salt and oil of which these creatures both male and female afford abundance are esteemed of very excellent use in physic  fig   the shagreen is a beast as represented by mr pomet very much like an horse or mule and is very common in turkey and poland which the turks and poles make use of to carry their baggage as in other parts they do mules horses etc when this animal is dead they take the hinder part of his skin and hang it in the air after having strewed it when raw with mustard seed they leave em thus exposed to the weather several days then take them in and tan em and when they are dressed export them this skin is very hard when dry and soft when steeped in water it is said that what makes this skin so hard is because the animal sits down and rests very much on his buttocks they bring two sorts of shagreen from turkey viz the gray or ashcolored which is the best and the white or salted shagreen the use of this shagreen is very universal for all sorts of pocket utensils watch cases toys etc they may dye these skins what color they please but the most common are black green and red the most beautiful and dearest is the red color because of the vermilion and carmine with which it is dyed shagreen skin is often counterfeited in work  fig   the antelope is shaped very much like a deer and about the same bigness of a chestnut color and white under the belly his horns are almost straight from his head up tapering gradually with rings like a screw till within an inch and an half of the top it has fine large black eyes a long and slender neck feet and legs there are many of these creatures in an herd when at the same time they have scouts who by running give them notice of an approaching foe they are taken by shot etc being too swift for a greyhound the antelope in shape and beauty excels most of the fourfooted race this creature is described in the book of three hundred animals but the figure there being very faulty nothing like the antelope and having since an opportunity of a true draught taken from the creature itself i hope giving it double will be excused  fig   the seaskink is a small amphibious animal living both on land and in water it is pretty much like a small lizard many of these little creatures are to be found about the river nile in egypt they are about half a foot long and an inch diameter having a sharp nose covered with scales it has two little piercing eyes the mouth is divided reaching to the place where the ears should be seated had this creature any it has a great many little white and red teeth it goes upon four feet little more than an inch long which fig   the antelope fig   the skink fig   the african mantiger fig   the indian mantiger are very much like those of an apes it is covered with little round scales different from those of the head that are long and large it is of a greyish color inclining to brown upon the back and of a silver gray under the belly the flesh of this creature is used in physic  fig   the mantiger is bred in africa etc it is of the bigness of a large ape or baboon of a brown color on the back and sides the belly neck and throat of a whitish color the buttocks and face of a light blue it has a bunch of hair standing up on the top of the head and another resembling a beard hanging under the chin the vent of this animal is placed very high on the hinder part of its back it is a beast that participates much of the subtle and mischievous nature of apes and baboons but much more bold and fierce some writers have confidently asserted that some of these creatures have had the boldness to attack the chastity of women mr bradley mentions one sort of ape brought from the east indies that is very vicious and he knew one that had more than once attempted to force a servant of the house where he was kept the mantiger is thought to approach the nearest the human species both in form and sense of all the brute creation  fig   is a mantiger brought from africa which differs something from the former it is copied from the figure mr bradley exhibits in the works of nature fig   is from a painting by a good hand from the creature itself  fig   this little creature is found at surinam merian calls it a sort of wood dormouse it carries her young ones with her on her back five or six of which she brings forth at a time it is of a yellowish brown color but its under part is of a whitish color when she goes out to seek for food her young ones run about her which when they are full or in danger or for weariness immediately mount upon their mothers back and twist their tails round the tail of the old one who forthwith carries them into her hole  fig   a wood dormouse   fig   the avosetta   book the second of birds fig   the avosetta is a bird common at rome and venice and do also frequent our eastern coasts of suffolk and norfolk in winter time its length from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail was fourteen inches breadth when the wings were expanded twenty one inches its weight nine ounces its bill was three inches long slender black flat or depressed reflected upwards which is peculiar to this bird ending in a very thin slender weak point the tongue is short not cloven the head of a mean size round like a ball and black above the eyes the color of the whole under side of the body was white and the upper side partly white and partly black or dark brown its legs are very long of a lovely blue color bare above the knees and the claws black and little it has a back toe but a very small one mr albin says he had this bird from newgatemarket it was brought to that place with other wildfowl  fig   the beardmanica or beardedtitmouse is in length from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail about six inches and an half in breadth when the wings are extended ten inches and a half in weight nine drams and a half the bill is short thick and of a yellowish color in the hen dusky the head is of a dark ash color from the eyes a tuft of black feathers hangs down ending in a point representing a picked beard from which mark it has the name of beardmanica the back upper part of the wings and lower part of the belly and tail are brown under the chin white the breast belly and thighs of a pale yellowish white with a tincture of brown the legs and feet black this bird is very singular in the care and love which he shows to the hen when at roost he covers her all night with his wing the hen is something smaller than the cock and of a more beautiful yellowish brown the wings and legs of the same color with those of the cock the hen is without the beard and more pale on the breast  they are found in the saltmarshes in essex and likewise in the fens in lincolnshire  fig   the jacobinepigeon or as it is vulgarly called for shortness the jack is if true the smallest of all pigeons and the smaller still the better it has a range of feathers inverted quite over the hinder part of the head and reaching down on each side of the neck to the shoulders of the wings which forms a kind of a fryars hood from hence this pigeon has its name jacobine because the fathers of that order all wear hoods to cover their bald crowns hence the upper part of this range of feathers is called the hood and the more compact these feathers are and the closer to the head so much the more this bird is esteemed the lower part of this range of feathers is called by us the chain but the dutch calls it the cravat the feathers of this chain ought to be long and close so that if you strain the neck a little by taking hold of the bill the two sides will lap over each other in some of the best but there are very few fig   the beardmanica fig   the jacobine pigeon fig   frigate bird now to be found in england complete the jacobine ought to have a very short bill the shorter the better and a clean pearl eye as for their color there are reds yellows blues blacks and mottles but be the color of the feathers what they will they ought to have a clean white head white feet and white tail of these pigeons some are featherleggd and footed others are not and both sorts are equally esteemed according to the various inclination of different fancies  fig   the frigate bird which the indians call so because of the swiftness of its flight has a body no bigger than a pullets but its stomach is very fleshy the males are as black as ravens the neck is pretty long the head small with two great black eyes and the sight more piercing than the eagles the bill is likewise pretty thick and entirely black about six or seven inches long the upper beak is crookd like a hook the claws are very short and divided as the vultures the wings of this bird are very large and not without a provident design of nature since his wings are sometimes employed to carry him above a hundred leagues from land it is with a great deal of trouble that this bird can raise himself upon the branches because of the extraordinary length of his wings but when he has once taken his flight he keeps his wings extended almost without any motion or fatigue if sometimes the weight of the rain or the violence of the winds force him he mounts above the clouds beyond sight in the middle region of the air and when he is at the highest he does not forget whereabout he is but remembers the place where the dorado or gold fish gives chase to the flying fish and then he throws himself down like lightning not so as to strike upon the water for then it would be difficult for him to rise again but when he comes within twelve or fourteen paces he makes a large turn and lowering himself as it were insensibly till he comes to skim the waters where the chase is given in passing he takes up the little fish either with his bill or his talons and sometimes both together he has a great red comb like that of the cock not upon his head but under the throat and this comb does not appear but in the old ones the females have none the feathers are whiter than those of the males especially under the belly these birds for a long time made a little island their habitation in like manner as the rooks have a rookery where all of that species thereabout come to roost at nights and build their nest in the proper season this little island was called the isle of frigates and bears the name to this day though the birds have left the place for in the year      and the following year several people chased them so severely that they were forced to forsake the isle father du tertre apostolical missionary in the antillees moved by the large commendations give of the oil drawn from these fowls with the assistance of two or three more persons took above one hundred of them in less than two hours time they surpised the old ones upon the branches of the trees or in the nests and as they rise with a great deal of difficulty to take wing it was an easy matter to beat them down with long sticks the oil or fat of these birds is a sovereign remedy for sciatica pains and for all others proceeding from a cold cause it is held in great esteem throughout all the indies as a precious medicine  fig   the bengal jay is something bigger than our english jay the bill is of an ash color the top of the head blue the neck and breast an ash with a mixture of light brown and red the wings are blue as also the under part of the belly and thighs the back and rump are of a muddy green color the tail is of a dark blue next the body of a pale or

covert feathers of the wing all the rest of the body is of a fine gold yellow it resembles the sterling in all its actions being very mischievous it is a native of jamaica and other of the caribbee islands four or five of these birds will set upon and kill a large bird or fowl and when dead each one according to his place of mastership choose his part viz the heart brains etc keepin the part which he makes choice of till he has satiate himself this says mr albin i have been eye witness too  fig   the warwovwen is almost as big a an eagle the top of his head and neck were o a flesh color

the claws black its food was raw flesh this bird i saw at the george tavern at charing cross with the cassowares his keepers called him the king of the vavows or king of the vultures he was brought by a dutch ship from pallampank in the east indies it seems to be somewhat like that bird which mr willoughby describes by the name of uruba or the brasil vulture  fig   the warwovwen   fig    the little

chase in the stomach of it was found bones and fur of mice  fig    is called the little owl it was taken on the coast of ushant by my brother it having lost its way at sea lighting on the mast of the ship was so tired that it suffered itself to be taken without any resistance and was preserved and brought home by him and given to me and from that bird this figure was taken by mr albin this little owl was about the bigness of a blackbird it weighed three ounces its length from the tip of the beak to the end of the tail was seven inches and a half breadth when the wings were extended fourteen inches its bill was like that of other owls the tongue a little divided as in the rest of this tribe the ears great the eyes lesser than in other owls the wreath or circle of feathers encompassing the

the flammant their traps that were laid for it which the gentleman observing ordered it to be shot which was accordingly done and sent to mr albin to draw the figure of it a cock bird of this kind was shot near winchester in hampshire these birds are not very common in england but about cologn and elsewhere in high germany are frequent where they call them widehuppe they sit for the most part on the ground sometimes on willows etc they feed like woodpeckers on beetles and other insects  fig    the flammant was in length from the tip of the bill to the end of the claws four feet ten inches and

time it is entirely red except the prime feathers of the wings which are black when it is at its full bigness its weight is about two pounds and a half its legs are long and of a red color bare of feathers a good way above the knees the toes webbd together the claws black these birds make their nests on hillocks in shallow water on which they sit with their legs extended downwards they breed on the coast of cuba and the bahama islands and frequent the salt water a man by concealing himself from their sight may kill great numbers of them for they will not rise at the report of a gun neither is the sight of those killed close by them sufficient to terrify the rest and warn them of the danger but they stand gazing and as it were astonished till they are most or all of them killed when they feed which is always in shallow water by bending their neck they lay the upper part of their bill next the ground their feet being in continual motion up and down in the mud by which they raise a small round sort of seed or grain resembling millet which they receive into their bill and as there is a necessity of admitting into their mouths some mud nature has provided the edges of their bill with fine teeth like those of a comb with which they retain the food and reject the mud that is taken in with it they are thought by some to feed on fish likewise this figure was taken from the bird itself by mr albin it was brought from sir robert walpoles where it had been kept alive in the kitchen some time  fig    the carasow cock is almost as big as a turkey its bill thick and hooked at the end partly ash and partly yellow on the base of the upper mandible is a round excrescence of the bigness of a nutmeg of a yellow color the eyes black the head and neck covered with feathers of a deep

carasow from whence they take their name they are called by the indians tecuecholi mountainbird or american pheasant  fig    the red bird from richmond this name is imposed on it for want of knowing its real name it was kept at richmond palace when her present majesty was princess of wales amongst her collection of rarities of this kind mr albin drew the figure from the bird itself but could not meet with any one to inform him from what country it was brought nor to answer some other questions he wanted to ask concerning it excepting in the color it is pretty much like the carasow hen and about the same bigness its head likewise is furnished with a beautiful crest very much resembling the crest of that bird and indeed it seems to be of the same species with that fowl the disagreement that is between them may perhaps be only owing to the different places they are brought from or such difference as is common amongst tame fowls the outer edges all round the crest was black the lower part of the crest next the head and part of the neck was of a lead color all the rest of the bird a fine red only the wings and tail somewhat darker than the body and the legs and feet black  fig

black it was webfooted its legs very long and bare above knee both legs and feet of a red color its food was the same with that of geese eating grass and corn the difference between the cock and hen

resembles the common starling in shape and size the whole bird is black except the upper part of the wings which is a bright scarlet under that a yellow the legs feet and claws are black this bird was shot near london it was thought to be a cage bird which had bot loose in its gizzard was found grubs beetles and small maggots it is a native of carolina and virginia in which countries they are very numerous mr catesby makes mention of its flying in companies with the purpledaws and destroying the corn wherever they come being the most destructive birds in those countries he says it makes its nest over the water amongst reeds and sedges the tops of which they interweave so artfully making an arch or covering under which they hang their nest after the manner of the reed sparrow and so secure from wet that where the tide flows it is observed never to reach them it is a very active and familiar bird and when kept in a cage will learn to imitate human speech  fig  0 the redleggd

this bird is found in the east indies  fig    the longtail hummingbird is the least of all the species of this kind of birds of which naturalists reckon nine different sorts and the least that we know of found upon our globe its length from the beginning of the head or insertion of the bill to the rise of the tail is two inches and a half that is the neck one inch and the body an inch and a half long the head small the bill a little more than an inch long black round sharp and almost straight the legs and feet like those of the rest the feathers also of the body and wings are alike disposed but differently colored it has a tail longer than any of the rest somewhat more than three inches consisting of feathers of which that which is nearer to its rise is shorter the second always longer the tail is forked and the bird in flying spreads it into two large horns so that the tips of the horns are an inch and an half distant from each other the whole head and neck of this bird is of a shining silken black color inclining to or interchanging with blue as in the necks of mallards the whole back and breast are green shining interchangeably with golden and seagreen as in the second kind of these birds the wings are of a livercolour the tail of of a blackish blue shining like polished steel blued over there are so great a variety of beautiful colors in the feathers of all the kinds of these birds and so wonderfully resplendent that they cannot be well represented by any painter the indians make of these feathers the representations of saints and other things so dexterously and artificially to the life that one would think they were drawn with a pencil in colors these birds are fed and nourished with honey dew and the juice of flowers which they suck out of them with

of waterhen its body is all over of a purple blue color the tail of a whitish ash color its bill legs and feet red pliny says that when it drinks it seems to bite the water and has this property by himself to dip and wet his meat now and and then in water and then with its foot instead of a hand to reach it to its bill the best of this kind he says are in coinagene mr willughby in his ornithology says neither gesuer nor aldrovandus nor himself had ever seen this bird but pictures of it only and seeing that the pictures of it do much vary and none of those who have compiled histories of animals do profess themselves to have seen the porphyrio we did says he sometimes doubt whether there were any such bird in nature especially seeing some of those things which the ancients attribute to it as for example that it has five toes on each foot are without doubt false and fabulous but because all the pictures fig    porphyrio fig    amadavad bird fig    crown bird of it do agree in the figure of its bill legs feet and some other parts we have now changed our minds and are more apt to believe the affirmative viz that there is such a bird as they picture let others says he who have the hap to see it describe it more exactly and so remove all doubt and scruple concerning this matter out of the minds of the learned and curious this figure i here exhibit was copied from a curious drawing belonging to a noble person whose name i am forbid to mention  fig    the amadavad bird in bigness scarce exceeds the goldencrownd wren its bill in shape is like a goldfinchs

birds of paradise are described by naturalists which differ in size figure or color from each other there has been diverse stories delivered by ancient authors concerning these birds that in former ages were generally received and accepted for true even by men of learning which are now discovered to be fables and rejected and exploded by all men such as their wanting feet and legs that they lived upon celestial dew that they flew perpetually without any intermission and took no rest but on high in the air their wings being spread that they were never taken alive but only when they fell down dead upon the ground etc these most beautiful birds as aldrevandus reports are called by the inhabitants of the molucca islands manucadiatoe that is god s birds fig     of paradise fig    cock maccaw and had in great esteem and veneration they are called birds of paradise both for the excellent shape and beauty of their bodies and also because where they are bred whence they come and whither they betake themselves is altogether unknown since they are found only dead upon the earth so that the vulgar imagine them to drop out of heaven or paradise all which things are now sufficiently refuted and proved to be false and fabulous both by eyewitnesses and by the birds themselves brought over entire as for that particular of their wanting legs these birds are now well known to have legs and feet as well as others and those not short small nor feeble ones but sufficiently great and strong and armed with crooked talons as being the members of birds of prey they are

on each side with yellow and rose color that exposed to the sun it represents a thousand varieties of shining colors and can hardly be expressed by a painter so that this bird deserves to be highly prized by great persons these paroqueets are brought from the east indies etc and are found chiefly in the midland countries they roost and build on the highest trees they fly in companies and with

bigger than the common with ears twisted like rams horns about an inch and a half in measure and a third kind brought to us from the west indies whose body is as large as a rat and the wings being extended measure from point to point above two feet in these creatures there is no remarkable difference but the size of their parts these animals partake of the fourfooted kind in the make of the head which agrees very much with those of the mouse or rat kind the shape of the trunk of their bodies likewise is much the same and are both covered with hair they also bring forth their young ones perfectly formed like the fourfooted kind and give them suck they partake of the bird kind in having only two legs besides the hooks at the pinions of their wings they have also the power of flying the note or voice of these animals is between the chirping of birds and the cry of fourfooted beasts these creatures have not long tails like animals with four feet it is said the batt sleeps all the winter in holes of old houses and walls it very rarely appears in the daytime but flies in the dusk of the evening only the wings of a batt are wonderful strange consisting of one entire skin webbd together somewhat like the feet of waterfowl the claws or hooks on the tops of the wings this creature makes use of to hang by to any thing it is minded whilst it is either feeding sleeping etc it feeds on bacon cheese etc the description of this creature would more properly have come in between the beasts and birds but being omitted there i chose to place it here rather than leave it out  book

fifteen days their eggs are first white till they put forth their black liquor thereon the young are excluded the egg as birds the male is known as being rougher and is said to assist the female when

 since it is fallen in my way in the above description to make mention of mr catesby i will take this opportunity of making acknowledgment of the very great assistance i have had from his history of the natural rarities of carolina virginia etc to which incomparable book i am indebted for most of my fish and to which i refer such curious persons as desire a more ample and particular account of

thick basis about three quarters of an inch in length and though but slender yet very strong with which it is capable of defending itself and like a bull give dangerous wounds to the sides of its enemy his hinder part is likewise well guarded with two long strong bones or fins like his horns one on each side of the belly near the tail and when closely chased he draws up his tail and bids defiance with these horns to his hungry pursuer it is said these fish swim in companies with their females for their mutual defense and notwithstanding they frequent the ocean exposed to the large the bold and voracious kind yet the male being so well fortified by nature both with weapons of defense and courage to use them few dare attack him the figures of both male and female were taken from the

reaching from the head almost to the tail two on the belly one large like that on the back and a long slender one toward the head the tail is large and spreads very wide both sides shooting into sharp points and as it wants teeth nature has supplied that deficiency by arming the tail on each side with a strong sharppointed bone which in defense of himself he extends when danger approaches this weapon with its prickly fins seem to deter the voracious kind that prey on others from attacking him yet i have seen says mr catesby a barracuda pursue and bite off a third part of him behind which when he had swallowed he deliberately bit off half the remaining part and devoured the whole fish at the third mouthful the tang is accounted a good eating fish  fig    the tang   fig    rock fish

shad is of a light gray with some of its scales tinctured with purple it has a small mouth without teeth but what is most remarkable in this fish is that the forepart of the head was of a cartilaginous substance the backpart strong and bony which seems designed for a shield to secure the defenseless part which he contracts under it when danger approaches it is esteemed a good eating welltasted fish  fig    the soldier is a kind of crawfish found in several of the american isles particularly in the island of st dominico in the west indies where there are great numbers it is about three or four inches in legnth and so called because he is clothed and armed with a foreign shell these creatures go down sometimes to the seacoast but whether it is to wash and to cast their eggs as the landcrabs do is not known but this is certain that they go to change their shells which every one endeavors to find out according to his size and finding what may fitem they run themselves backwards therein and so cloth themselves anew and being armed like soldiers with these foreign shells they march up again to the woods and take up their quarters among hollow trees etc living upon rotten leaves fruit etc where increasing in bulk and the shell becoming too straight for them they are obliged to go down to the seacoasts to change their houses again the curious who have made observations of what happens during this exchange have owned they took a great deal of pleasure in the sight for these creatures stop at every shell they meet with consider it diligently and having met with one they like immediately quit the old one and run themselves so swiftly backwards into the other that one would think they were either afraid of the injury of the cold air or ashamed to to be seen naked and if two of them meet at the same time stripped to enter into one and the same shell they will bite each other and battle it till such time as the weaker yields and quits the shell to the conqueror who having clothed himself with it takes three or four turns upon the shore and if he finds it does not fit him quits it again and has immediate recourse to his old one and then seeks out for another and thus they will change five or six times till they meet with one for their purpose they carry in their shells about half a spoonful of clear water which is a sovereign remedy against the pustles and blisters that the wet which drops from the manchineel tree raises upon the skin  fig    there soldier   caterpillar fig   fig     book the fourth of insects fig   is a curious caterpillar the body of an uncommon structure being exactly apiece and of a dark green color marked with yellow and red the edge of every square was furnished with little round heads or balls standing at an equal distance one on the top of each joint or partition all of them full of hair and of a fine scarlet color its feet and little claws were wrapped in a thin transparent skin as was also the covering of the belly that as it crawled no feet were seen but by means of this little skin the caterpillar sticks fast to any thing like a snail it was found crawling on a leaf of the battattes on the   d of july it made itself a web of an oker color from whence on the   d of august that beautiful flying insect figure   was produced  fig   the upper part of the body of this insect was black finely marked with a golden yellow the head and part of the wings before black veind with gold the outer part of a yellowish brown the under wings of a lovely rose color the legs and under part of the body were black these insects and some of the following ones are found in the indies described by merian  fig   is an indian insect of the chaer kind very common to be met with upon the pegranate tree of a heavy and sluggish nature and therefore easily caught it is furnished with a long tube or trunk under its nose which it very dexterously fixes in the sweet flowers to suck the honey out through the same when it prepares itself for its transformation it lies motionless for a considerable time till at length the skin on its back breaking of its own accord there comes forth the flying insect figure   the wings of which are transparent of a pale rose color streaked and veined with scarlet and bordered all round with a pale yellow but what is remarkable it preserves the same trunk or body which the foregoing chafer has from whence it is produced leaving its old skin or shell in situation shape and color resembling the primitive insect which color was of a deep green these flies are very frequently found about surinam they are very swift in flying insomuch that merian says she spent several hours in catching one only this fly makes a sound like an harp to be perceived at a distance by its singing for which reason it is called lyricen and by the dutch lierman from these kind of flies as the indians say are produced the famous fly called the lanternbearer  fig   fig

of a pale creamcolour inclining to white during this form it constantly undergoes four sicknesses each lasting about three days wherein it feeds not at all but grows thicker shorter and clearer and at each sickness changes its skin it after changes from that of a worm to an aurelia or chrysalis fig   whereunto it is transformed after its spinning time in which state it lies shut up in hot countries for fourteen or fifteen days in more temperate ones eighteen or twenty days without any food known to us during which time this insect leaves two skins both that of a worm when it is changed into an aurelia and that of an aurelia when it becomes a moth in its silkcase its last transformation is from an aurelia to a moth which eats its way out through the sharp end of the case fig   by a hole just big enough to creep through this last change into a mothfly is the perfection of this insect in this state the male and female couple and soon after die the female having first laid her eggs which are of a pale yellow color but in a few days change into a dark gray or liver color and what is wonderful these eggs are kept ten months in the year as a dead thing taking life again in their season the first silkworms that were brought into europe was in the time of justinian the emperor who began his reign a d     till then the europeans were so ignorant as to the knowledge of the production of silk that they imagined it grew on the tops of trees as cotton and was in all those western parts for a long time very dear being weight for weight of equal value with gold a pound of one costing a pound of the other persia was the only place which the europeans frequented for the sake of their silk and it is certain that the persians took care for many hundred years to keep their silkmanufactures to themselves not permitting the silkworms to be carried out of persia or any persons to pass from thence into the west who were skilled in managing them justinian looking on it as a great hardship that the subjects of his empire should buy this manufacture of the persians at so dear a rate in order to put an end to this imposition sent two monks into india understanding that there was plenty of silk in those parts to learn there how the silken trade was managed and on their return to bring with them if it was possible to be procured some of the species whether vegetable or animal from which the silk was produced that so he might set up the manufacture in his own dominions these monks when they returned told the emperor that the silk was produced by a living creature a worm which could not be brought so long a journey alive but understanding from them that its eggs might be brought from which the creatures might be propagated he sent them back a second time to bring him of those eggs who having effected what they went about brought to constantinople great quantities which they presented to the emperor in great state on horseback accompanied by many of his nobles senators and magistrates enclosed in a roll or horn of paper with instructions how to breed nourish and draw silk from the said creatures which was received with great applause and admiration and from those eggs have been propagated all the silkworms and their silk in europe  at the season of the year for hatching the silkworms eggs which as observed is about the beginning of may provide some sheets of fine white cappaper each of these sheets make into the form of a drippingpan by turning up the edges of the paper about an inch and half on every side in these paper pans put the silkworms eggs placing them in a chamberwindow where the sun shines powerfully upon them and securing them from cats birds etc there leave them day and night to hatch of themselves and when you perceive the worms begin to come out of their eggs give them young mulberryleaves or for want of them the leaves of lettuce till they can have mulberryleaves and then keep them constantly to that diet after this manner in these paper troughs or pans feed them till their spinningtime taking care to clean them as often as occasion requires and if you are minded to remove the worms to other paper troughs that they may lie thinner and cooler give them a few fresh leaves and the worms will come presently upon them these leaves remove with the worms but if they are grown large take them gently in your hands and put them into other troughs when the worms have fed their full time and are ready to spin their silk roll up white paper like a wafer these pin up against the hangings of a room or to lines tied cross the room in these papers put every single worm as you perceive it wants to spin which it will begin to do generally as soon as it is put into the paper when the worm has finished its case and changed into an aurelia which is known by hearing it rattle when it is shaken at the ear then proceed to wind off the silk never suffering the mothfly to eat its way out of the case not even of those that are designed to propagate seed for the next year a gentleman very curious in his observations and experiments upon the silkworm his method in winding off the silk is as soon as the worms have finished their bottoms and changed into aurelias to put the bottoms into warm water with some spirit of wine in it which he says facilitates the winding off the silk very much the ends he finds more readily and winds them on a card in his hand without any reel or machine at all and as the silkbottoms are wound off he takes the aurelia of each and places them in one of those clean paperpans erect upon the piqued end and when its time is accomplished to enter upon its last transformation of a mothfly it will assume its new state as well as if it had continued the whole time in its silkcase and this method is practiced by diverse other persons who wind off the silk after the same manner when the silkmoths are come out of their cases being perfectly transformed and are put into such paper drippingpans or troughs as they are bred in there they will couple and lay their eggs when that is over the papers with the eggs upon them never attempt to take the eggs off are to be put into a chest or trunk one upon another among woollen cloths and without any other art or means there let them remain till the next spring some ladies who keep silkworms besides the pleasure they take in feeding and observing these wonderful creatures make use of the silkcase which they cut after the outer sleave or down is off into artificial flowers to wear in their heads which they themselves paint and color to imitate nature  fig  0 the caterpillar from whence this curious butterfly was produced was of a fine scarlet color stripped with yellow they are frequently found crawling on the vanilla plant and likewise on that called the passionflower merian says she fed one of these caterpillars till the latter end of may it then according to the usual transformation of the butterfly kind changed into an aurelia and on the seventh of june following became the butterfly in butterfly fig  0 fig    fig    fig    fig    fig    the plate fig    the upper side of which was of a bright red curiously marked with black the inner side of a dusky yellow or pale saffron richly spotted with silver the upper part of the inside of the wings next the head was of a pale red with black spots studded with silver these kind of butterflies are found in the indies  fig    is a curious insect of the beetle or chafer kind its back was black with a yellow mark cross the middle in the form of a halfmoon the upper part of the wings the horns feelers and two joints of the legs next the body were all of a fine crimson color the ends of its legs of a pale yellow the body under the wings of a bright yellow this insect turns its horns back over its body the points of which meet and make a kind of circle it was produced from the worm or maggot fig    which was found feeding on the carduus or thistle growing in the fields of surinam  fig    the great black beetle or chafer is produced from the worm fig    called in dutch the palmytworm because it gets its food in the palmer tree the worms are generated in the trunk of this tree in great abundance which feed on the pith of it they are a little bigger than mites in cheese at first but at last grow to the bigness of the figure represented in the plate the indians lay these worms on the fire and when roasted eat them very greedily and think them a delicious food  fig    this insect was produced from a caterpillar of a bright red and white color with a black spot on the last crease or partition of its body the middle of which was remarkable for its little white skin shining like crystal which as often as the insect fetched breath did alternately rise and fall again on the   th of august one of these according to the usual metamorphosis of caterpillars became the aurelia fig    on a vineleaf prettily twisted and folded up and on the   th day of september that beautiful autumnal fly  fig    came from it of a green color with six white spots on the upper part of its body and two on each side toward the tail the under wings were finely painted with a curious sky and red color with a broad border of pale yellow this insect is furnished with a very long and remarkable proboscis or trunk with which it sucks the juice of the grape and very dexterously fastens it in each bunch which is the food it most delights in as does the caterpillar in the leaf of the vine  fig    chirelia fig      fig    fig      fig    this worm or caterpillar was found crawling on the root of the white battattes a fruit of the earth growing naturally about surinam which notwithstanding are not eat it produces a fine white flower by digging in a garden in the month of april some of these caterpillars were discovered lying at the root of a battattes wrapped up in a narrow compass one of these had just put on the form of a beautiful chaser others were less changed but approaching to the same all as yet were manifestly soft and whitish but in a few hours after growing hard they were all gradually changed into such a kind of painted chafer as is here represented fig    flying which was of a deep green a crimson with stripes of yellow etc the wings of which appeared in color much like unto a beautiful tulip variegated with curious colors  fig  0 this insect called in dutch hell wardelende blad as being a sort of locust though merian calls it a gloworm is bred from an egg which after natural conjunction the female lays in that place in which afterward the young creatures to be produced can get their food at hand a provident instinct implanted in the parents of most if not all insects first these little creatures become worms or caterpillars which feeding grow and increase and when come to a complete bigness they spin their webs and are transformed into aurelias some of which want a shorter some a longer time to attain their full vigor all of which at last come out of their shells and break forth moist and their wings very much twisted but sometimes their wings grow dry and are expanded in less than half an hour after they have stirred and shaken themselves a little so that they appear in every respect perfect as represented in the figure which being thus changed seem ten times larger than the aurelias in which they were just now shut up  fig    is a kind of locust found in the indies merian says her negro whom she charged to search for worms caterpillars and other little creatures every where in the woods brought her a leaf wrapped up which being carefully opened presented to her sight green eggs as big as coriander seed from which in a few days after little black creatures like small pismires were hatched which grew by degrees till they arrived to their full bigness as the figure shows without being changed into aurelias as the gloworms are but by the growth and increase of their parts only their wings are like a green leaf strengthened with suchlike fibers there are severalsorts of these insects that differ in color some are of a bright green others of a duller green and others again of various and ash color besides there are some to be met with whose wings look like dried leaves ignorant people have thought these little creatures themselves fig  0 fig    fig    fig    fig    sprung from the tree where they spin their webs because their wings are green and have the form of a leaf  fig    the cockroch or as merian calls them the kakkerlacae are the most remarkable of all infects in america because they every where do the inhabitants the greatest damage by destroying their woollen and linen and spoiling their victuals and drink all manner of sweet things are their beloved food for which reason they are much delighted with the ananas or pineapple which for the richness of its flavor is justly called the king of fruits these insects lay their eggs up in heaps which they wrap all round in a bag or web after the manner of some spiders when their little eggs are hatched and the young ones quite perfect they break their eggshells with gnawing and the little creatures run out with prodigious nimbleness and as they are no bigger when first hatched than ants they creep through cracks and keyholes into boxes chests etc with all the ease imaginable where they gnaw and spoil all they can come at till at last they grow to the bigness of the figure    in the plate of a reddish brown color marked with white having two very long horns six hairy legs with two sharp claws at their ends like forks the head black with a reddish circle round the upper part when the creature is arrived to this bigness or full growth it sheds or casts its skin which skin bursting on its back comes forth the cockroch figure    which is the insect in its perfect state with wings sost and tender at first whitish after of a reddish color the head horns legs etc both in shape and color the same as before the insect cast its skin its shell or cast skin remaining preserved its primitive form of an insect  fig    is a large spider seizing on the hummingbird of these kind of spiders merian tells us she found many on the guajava tree in which they make nests representing a caterpillars web their bodies are covered all over with hair they are besides furnished with sharppointed teeth with which they give dangerous wounds infusing some liquid matter from them at the same time pismires are their common food in scarcity of which they take the young birds out of their nests and suck all the blood out of their little bodies the hummingbird that this spider preys on is thought to be the least of all birds the body together with the feathers is scarce equal in bigness to a spanish olive they are very richly beautified with various colors wonderfully resplendent being finer than the very peacock himselfsee page    it makes its nest in the boughs of trees of the bigness of an holland schilling and lays very white eggs two for the most part of an oval figure not bigger than pease these birds fly very swiftly and suck honey from the sweet flowers with their wings expanded that they hang in the air as it were motionless in flying this little bird makes a noise like a hornet or be hence it took its name in english of hummingbird merian says she was told these birds are the food of the priests of surinam who are forbid to eat any other meat those kind of large spiders fig    shed their coats now and then just as caterpillars do but are not observed to change into the flying kind  fig    a large spider seizing on the humming bird   fig    fig        0         fig    this small spider was of a scarlet color it was found in a wood at the beginning of june they are likewise found in gardens on the bodies of trees but are something smaller than those found in the woods these spiders are accounted venomous and are the only species of the spider kind that are accounted so excepting the tarantula spiders being more frightful than prejudicial to mankind this spider and all the rest described in this book are drawn from the life and are of the natural bigness of the spiders themselves  fig    is a spider very remarkable for its legs and feelers each joint of the former appears as if it were placed in a socket the latter were globular and hairy and on the outer side of each there was a bright knob of white incircled with yellow which made it look as if a little stone had been set therein it had eight eyes standing as they are placed over the spider in the plate this is a male spider and was taken in a house in the month of april its color was black where the eyes stood the other part adjoining to the belly was of a reddish chestnut the upper side of the belly of a yellowish dark ash color and the legs of a reddish color  fig    is one of the sixeyd spiders it was taken in a wood in the month of april it was of a dark color with a broad streak of light hair color in the middle of its back and a mark of the same light color in the form of a diamond on the upper part of its belly the legs were finely spotted one of these spiders was taken at the beginning of june with its eggbag under its belly  fig    the small longleggd spider was so finely marked that it is impossible to describe it either in words or colors there being so fine a mixture of green red and black interchangeably put together in pretty shapes the legs were also curiously marked in the same manner the eyes were so small as not to be discerned it was taken on the bodyof a tree in canewood about the middle of april  fig  0 is one of the housespiders it had eight eyes its legs were finely spotted with black and from each joint grew certain hairs or bristles its feelers were long and slender the thick web of this and all the housespiders may be made use of in the cure of all intermittent fevers  fig    is one of the jumpingspiders it had eight eyes placed in a circular form as over the head of the spider in the plate and it is observable that all the spiders that have their eyes standing in that form catch their prey by jumping on it like a cat at a mouse it is a creature extremely nimble in moving any way it pleases twas taken in a garden if you look on it with a microscope it appears one of the most beautiful spiders that can possibly be seen there is so great a variety of marbling in pretty figures of several colors viz black chestnut red dish and white mixed all over the back belly legs and feelers as not to be expressed it seems to the naked eye to be a greyish speckled spider being all over rough and hairy the late ingenious dr hook in his micrography gives the following diverting account of this particular spider as observed by the most accomplished mr evelyn in his travels in italy of all the sorts of insects says he there is none has afforded me more diversion than the small gray jumpingspider prettily bespeckd with black spots all over the body which the microscope discovers to be a kind of a feathers like those on butterflies wings or the body of the white moth it is very nimble by fits sometimes running and sometimes leaping like a grasshopper then standing still and setting itself on its hinder legs will very nimbly turn its body and look round it self every way such says mr evelin i did frequently observe at rome which espying a fly at three or four yards distance upon the balcony where i stood would not make directly to her but crawl under the rail till being arrived right under her it would steal up seldom missing its aim but if it chanced to want any thing of being perfectly opposite would at first peep immediately slide down again till taking better notice it would come the next time exactly upon the flys back but if this happened not to be within a competent leap then would this insect move so softly as the very shadow of the dial seemed not to be more imperceptible unless the fly moved and then would the spider move also in the same proportion keeping that just time with her motion as if the same soul had animated both those little bodies and whether it were forwards backwards or to either side without at all turning her body like a wellmanaged horse but if the capricious fly took wing and pitched upon another place behind our huntress then would the spider whirle its body so nimbly about as nothing could be imagined more swift by which means she always kept the head toward her prey though to appearance as immovable as if it had been a nail driven into the wood till by that indiscernible progress being arrived within the sphere of her reach she made a fatal leap swift as lightning upon the fly catching him in the pole where she never quitted hold till her belly was full and then carried the remainder home i have beheld them instructing their young ones how to hunt which they would sometimes discipline for not well observing but when any of the old ones did miss a leap they would run out of the field and hide themselves in their crannies as ashamed and not be seen abroad for four or five hours after for so long have i watched the nature of of this strange insect the contemplation of whose so wonderful sagacity and address has amazed me nor do i find in any chase whatsoever more cunning and stratagem observed i have found some of these spiders in my garden when the weather toward the spring is very hot but they are nothing so eager of hunting as they are in italy  the spider fig    was beautifully streaked and speckled with black all over its body and legs it had eight eyes standing as they are expressed over the spider in the plate at the end of its tail there were little short things like feathers standing up which it opened and shut like a fan at pleasure it was taken in a chamberwindow about the middle of july  fig    was taken closed up in a leaf near to a web it had made it had eight eyes the back and legs of this spider looked transparent like clear horn     spiders    spiders    spiders    spiders    spiders   the spider fig    was curiously and regularly marked with lines and spots of white the legs were yellowish and very hairy and spotted with dark brown the feelers were also spotted it had six eyes placed as they are expressed in the plate it was found in a garden at the latter end of july  the spider fig    was of a haircolour marked with a spot and broad line of yellow the upper side of the belly had a mark in the shape of a cross of a yellow color the legs were of a light haircolour spotted with black having bristles of the same color on the joints it had six eyes standing as they are placed in the plate it was found in a web in bishopswood at the beginning of september  fig    the carter or longleggd spider for two particularities has very few creatures like it the first which is discoverable only by the microscope is the curious contrivance of his eyes of which he has only two and those placed upon the top of a small pillar or hillock rising out of the middle of the top of its back or rather the crown of its head for they were fixed on the very top of this pillar placed back to back with the transparent parts or pupils looking toward either side but somewhat more forward than backwards these eyes to appearance seemed to be of the very same structure with that of larger twoeyd creatures seeming to have a very smooth and very protuberant cornea and in the midst of it to have a very black puple encompassed about with a kind of gray iris whether it were able to move these eyes to and fro i have not observed but it is not very likely he should the pillar or neck seeming to be covered and stiffend with a crusty shell but nature in all probability has supplied that defect by making the cornea so very protuberant and setting it so clear above the shadowing or obstructing of its prospect by the body that it is likely each eye may perceive though not see distinctly almost an hemisphere whence having so small and round a body placed upon such long legs it is quickly able so to wind and turn it as to see any thing distinct this creature as do all other spiders differs very much from most insects in the figure of its eyes for the best microscope does not discover its eyes to be any ways knobbd or pearld like those of other infects the second peculiarity which is obvious to the eye is also very remarkable and that is the prodigious length of its legs in proportion to its small round body and which are jointed just like those of a crab but every of the parts are spun out prodigiously longer in proportion each of these legs are terminated in a small case or shell shaped almost like that of a muscleshell fastened to the body in so admirable a manner as does not a little manifest the wisdom of nature in the contrivance for these long leavers as i may so call them of the legs having not the advantage of a long end on the other side of the hypomochlion or centers on which part of the legs move must necessarily require a vast strength to move them and keep the body balanced and suspended insomuch that if we should suppose a mans body suspended by such a contrivance an hundred and fifty times the strength of a man would not keep the body from falling on the breast to supply therefore each of these legs with its proper strength nature has allowed to each a large chest or cell in which is included a very large and strong muscle and thereby this little animal is not only able to suspend its body upon less than these eight but to move it very swiftly over the tops of grass and leaves this creature seems to throw its body upon the prey not unlike a jumpingspider the whole fabric when viewed by the microscope appeared a very pretty one and could it have been dissected as many singularities might have been found within it as without perhaps for the most part not unlike the parts of a crab which this little creature does in many things very much resemble i omit the description of the horns of the mouth which seemed like that of a crabs the speckledness of his shell which proceeded from a kind of feathers or hairs and the hairiness of his legs his large thorax and little belly and the like and shall only take notice that the three parts of the body namely the head breast and belly are in this creature strangely confused so that it is difficult to determine which is which as they are also in a crab and indeed this seems to be nothing else but an aircrab being made more light and nimble proportionable to the medium wherein it resides and as air seems to have but one thousandth part of the body of water so does this spider seem not to be a thousandth part of the bulk of a crab  all kinds of spiders seem to be creatures of prey and to feed on other small infects but their ways of catching them are very different the shepherd spider by running on his prey the jumping spider by leaping on it other sorts weave nets or cobwebs whereby they ensnare them nature having both fitted them with materials and tools and taught them how to work and weave their nets and lie perdue and to watch diligently to run on a fly as soon as entangled  the foot of a spider is of an admirable and wonderful mechanism whereby he is able to spin weave and climb or run on his curious transparent clue mr albin in his natural history of spiders just published has collected near two hundred different sorts of these infects their thread or web seems to be spun out of some viscous kind of excrement lying in their belly which though soft when drawn out is presently by reason of its smallness hardened and dried by the ambient air  of the tarantula  fig    is the tarantula from baglivi fig    from the natural spider in sir hans sloans collection this infect is a spider of apulia in italy of the eighteyd kind and spins webs it has eight legs four on each side and in each leg three joints from the mouth proceed two darts in shape just like to a crabs claws these are solid and very sharp so that they can easily pierce the skin and between those and the fore legs there are two little horns or feelers which it is observed to move very briskly when it approaches to its prey  this as other spiders do propagates its species by laying eggs which are very numerous so that there are found sometimes in the female when dissected tarantula fig    tarantula fig    a hundred or more and these are hatched partly by the heat of the mother partly by that of the sun in about twenty or thirty days time in the summer months especially when the heats are greatest as in the dog days the tarantula creeping among the corn in the fields bites the mowers and passengers in the winter it lurks in holes and is scarcely seen and if it does bite then it is not venomous neither does it induce any ill symptoms but in the hot weather although the pain of its bite is at first no greater than what is caused by the sting of a be yet the part quickly after is discolored with a livid black or yellowish circle and raised to an inflamed swelling the patient within a few hours is seized with a violent sickness difficulty of breathing universal faintness and sometimes trembling with a weakness of the head being asked what the ail is makes no reply or with a querulous voice and melancholy look points to his breast as if the heart was most affected  during this mournful scene all the usual medicines applied to venomous bites and cordials are of no service for notwithstanding their repeated use the patient growing by degrees more melancholy stupid and strangely timorous in a short time expires unless music be called to his assistance which alone without the help of medicine performs the cure for at the first sound of the musical instrument although the sick lie as it were in an apoplectick fit they begin by degrees to move their hands and feet till at last they get up and fall to dancing with wonderful vigor at first for three or four hours then they are put to bed refreshed from their sweating for a short time and repeat the exercise with the same vehemence perceiving no weariness or weakness from it but professing they grow stronger and nimbler the more they dance  at this sport they usually spend twelve hours a day and it continues three or four days by which time they are generally freed from all their symptoms which do nevertheless attack em again about the same time the next year and if they do not take care to prevent this relapse by music they fall into a jaundice want of appetite universal weakness and such like diseases which are every year increased if dancing be neglected till at last they prove incurable as music is the common cure so they who are bitten are pleased some with one sort of it some with another one is raised with a pipe another with a timbrel one with a harp another with a fiddle so that the musicians make sometimes several essays before they can accommodate their art to the venom but this is constant and certain notwithstanding this variety that they all require the quickest and briskest tunes and are never moved by a slow dull harmony  while the persons affected are dancing they lose in a manner the use of all their senses like so many drunkards do many ridiculous and foolish tricks talk and act obscenely and rudely take great pleasure in playing with vineleaves with naked swords and red cloths and the like and on the other hand cannot bear the sight of any thing black so that if any bystander happen to appear in that color he must immediately withdraw or otherwise they relapse into their symptoms with as much violence as ever  fig    american ants fig  0 wood ant magnified   it may afford some light toward understanding the nature of this poison to observe that apulia is the hottest part of all italy lying eastward and having all the summer long but very little rain to temper the heats so that the inhabitants as one of that country observes do breathe an air as it were out of a fiery furnace hence their temperament is dry and adust as appears by their being generally lean passionate impatient ready to action quickwitted very subject to inflammatory distempers phrensies melancholy and the like upon which account there are more mad people in this than in all the other parts of italy as to the return of the symptoms the next year that is owing to the same excessive heat in those months acting again upon the small remains of the venomous ferment  fig    is the large woodant fig  0 the same magnified fig    the american ants as described by merian seizing on a cockroch this little animal is that great pattern of industry and frugality that solomon sends the sluggard to that he may learn by the example of the ant who borrows of none and yet is not in danger to starve laying up in store by a notable diligence sufficient provision in due season against a time of need dr hook in his micrography has some pretty observations on this little creature the ant says he is of a dark brown or reddish color with long legs on the hinder of which it would stand up and raise its head as high as it could above the ground that it might stare the further about it just after the same manner as the huntingspider is observed to do and putting my finger toward them they have at first all run toward it till almost at it and then they would stand round about it at a certain distance and smell as it were and consider whether they should any of them venture any further till one more bold than the rest venturing to climb it all the rest if i would have suffered them would have immediately followed many such other seemingly rational actions i have observed in this little vermin with much pleasure i have observed a very large kind that inhabited under the roots of a tree from whence they would sally out in great parties and make most grievous havoc of the flowers and fruits in the ambient garden and return back again very expertly by the same ways and paths they went it has a large head at the upper end of which were two protuberant eyes peard like those of a fly but smaller out of the nose or foremost part issued two horns differing from those of a blue fly though indeed they seem to be both the same kind of organ and to serve for a kind of smelling beyond these were two indented jaws which he opened sideways and was able to gape them asunder very wide and the ends of them being armed with teeth which meeting went between each other it was able to grasp and hold an heavy body three or four times the bulk and weight of its own body it has only six legs shaped like those of a fly which is an argument that it is a winged infect and though i could not perceive any sign of them in the middle part of its body which seemed to consist of three joints or pieces yet it is known that there are of them that have long wings and fly up and down in the air the whole body was cased over with a very strong armor and the belly was covered likewise with multitudes of small white shining bristles the legs horns head and middle parts of its body were bestuck with hairs also but smaller and darker in america as merian writes there are very large ants or pismires which will in one night strip whole trees of their leaves they have two crooked teeth cutting one upon another like a pair of pincers by means of these they cut the leaves of the trees so that they fall to the ground and the tree looks bare and naked just as it looks in the winter in europe thousands of ants waising for this booty catch up the leaf as it falls on the earth to carry to their homes not so much for their own food as their young ones as yet but little worms this whole proceeding seems as if it were done by a mutual agreement amongst themselves that one party should go up in the tree to cut the leaves whilst the other bears an equal share of the labor in carrying them to their cells these ants when they are arrived to their full growth shed their coats or skins in like manner as do some other of the insect kind and become winged in this state they lay their eggs just as the gnats do which are afterward hatched into little worms or mites and for the preservation of this their offspring it is that the provident ants are so eager and vigilant to feed and nourish them so great is their concern in this particular as appears by their indefatigable toil that they may very justly be esteemed as great patterns of tenderness and care of their young as they are for industry and good economy these industrious little creatures make caverns in the earth of a great depth so artificially contrived that one would affirm it to be a piece of mans ingenuity these ants they say have a perpetual enmity with the spiders and all other infects of that country in the west indies where they are found when they fally out of their caverns which they do once a year an innumerable multitude of them comes forth which enter peoples houses range from one room to another and kill diverse small creatures they meet with by sucking them to death that large spider page    was destroyed by this means in a moment almost it was beset with such heaps of em that it could not disengage and free itself from danger it is said that even men themselves must fly for it they make their way so in troops from one room to another and having ransacked and as it were swept the whole house they make to the next till at last they go back again to their holes  fig    is the blue fly in its natural bigness fig    the same magnified this kind of fly is a very beautiful creature and has many things about it very notable the head eyes wings and feet are full of ornaments and contrivances and afford no less pleasing an object to the mind to speculate upon than to the eye to behold there is a most admirable and curious mechanism in the foot of this little animal whereby the flies are enabled to walk against the sides of glass perpendicularly upwards and to contain themselves in that posture as long as they please nay to walk and suspend themselves against the under surface of many bodies as the cieling of a room or the like and this with as great a seeming facility and firmness as if they had a natural tendency upwards as we are sure they fig    blue fly    have the contrary for they cannot make themselves so light as to stick or suspend themselves on the under surface of a glass well polished and cleansed their suspension therefore is wholly to be ascribed to some mechanical contrivance in their feet which what it is being too long for my present design i refer the ingenious reader to hookes micrography where this particular as well as some others no less curious are largely and philosophically treated of all the hinder part of the body of this fly is covered with a most curious blue shining armor looking exactly like a polished piece of steel brought to that blue color by annealing all which armor is very thick bestuck with abundance of tapering bristles such as grow on its back as is visible enough by the figure it is a creature active and nimble so as there are very few creatures like it whether bigger or smaller insomuch that it will escape and avoid a small body though coming on it exceeding swiftly and if it sees any thing approaching it which it fears it presently squats down as it were that it may be the more ready for its rise nor is it less hardy in the winter than active in the summer enduring all the frosts and surviving till the next summer notwithstanding the bitter cold of our climate one of these put in spirit of wine was very quickly seemingly killed and both its eyes and mouth began to look very red but upon the taking it out and suffering it to lie three or four hours and heating it with the sun beams cast through a burningglass it again revived seeming as it were to have been all the intermediate time dead drunk and after certain hours to grow fresh again and sober the eyes of a fly are placed in two clusters and the number of the pearls or hemispheres in the clusters of a drone fly according to dr hookes calculation with the help of a glass was near fourteen thousand which he judged by numbering certain rows of them several ways and casting up the whole contents accounting each cluster to contain about seven thousand three thousand of which were of a larger size and four thousand to be the number of the smaller pearls though this may seem strange other insects he says he has observed to have yet a greater number of eyes as the dragonfly or adderbolt in living flies he has observed that when any small mote or dust which flies up and down the air chances to light upon any part of these knobs of the eyes as it is sure to stick firmly to it and not fall the fly presently makes use of his two fore feet instead of eyelids with which as with two brooms or brushes they being all bestuck with bristles he often sweeps or brushes off whatever hinders the prospect of any of its hemispheres and then to free his feet from that dirt he rubs them one against the other cleansing them in the same manner as i have observed those that card wool to cleanse their cards by placing their cards so as the teeth of both look the same way and then rubbing them one against another in the very same manner do they brush and cleanse their bodies and wings other creatures have other contrivances for the cleansing and clearing their eyes  fig    bookworm   fig    is the small silvercolourd bookworm magnified as among greater animals there are many that are scaled both for ornament and defense so are there not wanting such also among the lesser bodies of insects whereof this little creature gives us an instance it is a small white silvershining worm or moth found much conversant among books and papers and is supposed to be that which corrodes and eats holes through the leaves and covers it appears to the naked eya a small glittering pearlcolourd moth which upon the removing of books and papers in the summer is often observed to scud and pack away to some lurking cranney where it may the better protect itself from any appearing dangers its head appears big and blunt and its body tapers from it toward the tail smaller and smaller being shaped almost like a carrot the body is divided into fourteen several partitions being the appearance of so many several shells or shields that cover the whole body every of these shells are again covered or tiled over with a multitude of thin transparent scales which from the multiplicity of their reflecting surfaces make the whole animal appear of a perfect pearlcolour this insect was furnished on either side of its head with a cluster of eyes and each of these clusters were beset with a row of small bristles much like the cilia or hairs on the eyelids and perhaps they served for the same purpose it had two long horns curiously ringd or knobbd having at each knob small hairs or bristles here and there dispersed among them besides these it had two shorter horns or feelers which were knotted and fringed just as the former it had three tails in every particular resembling the two longer horns that grow out of the head the legs of it were scaled and haird just like the rest but are not expressed in this figure the creature being entangled all in glue and so the legs of this appeared not through the glass which looked perpendicularly upon the back the body is beset with sharppointed bristles like spears dr hook says this animal probably seeds upon the paper and covers of books and perforates in them several small round holes mr albin calls it the cloth worm or moth and says it is the very creature that eats the woollen cloth and that it is produced from a small gray speckled moth that flies anights and creeps in among woollen cloths and there lays her eggs which are hatched in their season by the natural heat of the woollen upon which these little creatures feed till they change into a flying insect like their animal parent to prevent the havoc that this little creature which is one of the teeth of time is wont to make among woollen cloths etc they should sometimes be aird and brushed before the warm season comes on for the eggs to hatch which will absolutely destroy the eggs and preserve the garments  fig    bookspider   fig    is the crablike insect or bookspider reading one day in september i chanced to observe a very small creature creep over the book i was reading very slowly having a microscope by me i observed it to be a creature of a very unusual form and that not less notable as the figure represents its natural bigness was about the size of a large mite or somewhat longer it had ten legs eight of which were topt with very sharp claws and were those upon which he walked seeming shaped much like those of a crab which in many other things also this little creature resembled for the two other claws which were the foremost of all the ten were exactly formed in the manner of crabs or lobsters claws which this little animal did open and shut at pleasure it seemed to make use of those two claws both for feelers and holders for in its motion it carried these aloft extended before moving them to and fro just as a man blindfolded would do his hands when he is fearful of running against a wall and if i put an hair to it it would readily take hold of it with these claws and seem to hold it fast the whole body was cased over with armourshells as is usual in all those kinds of crustaceous creatures especially about their bellies and seemed of three kinds the head seemed covered with a kind of scaly shell the thorax with two smooth shells or rings and the belly with eight knobbd ones i could not certainly find whether it had under these last shells any wings but i suspect the contrary for i have not found any winged infect with eight legs two of those legs being always converted into wings and for the most part those that have but six have wings this creature though i could never meet with more than one of them and so could not make so many examinations of it as otherwise i would i did notwithstanding by reason of the great curiosity that appeared to me in its shape delineate it to show that in all likelihood nature had crowded together into this very minute infect as many and as excellent contrivances as into the body of a very large crab which exceeds it in bulk perhaps some millions of times it being a general rule in natures proceedings that where she begins to display any excellency if the subject be further searched into it will manifest that there is not less curiosity in those parts which our single eye cannot reach than in those which are more obvious  hookes microgr  fig    the wevil or cornbeetle fig    the same magnified this little creature was all over of a fine reddish brown color upon the head and upper part of the body adjoining and likewise upon the lower part of its wings were regularly placed diverse black spots encircled with a resplendent white shining like silver and a small speck of the same silver color placed exactly in the middle of each of those black spots it had a very remarkable proboscis or trunk long and oddly shaped furnished with a pair of sharp forceps out of the end of this trunk the little creature blowed a small white shining bladder with which it moistens the corn before it eats it this bladder the insect could put out or draw in at pleasure as might fig    corn beetle magnified fig    wevil or corn beetle fig    american frog fig    water beetle be very plainly observed by the microscope its horns or feelers were knobbd as if they were turned by a turner tipped at the ends with white shining like silver these infects seed upon almost all kind of grain amongst which they breed and do very great damage especially if the corn be kept any considerable time such ships as go long voyages often experience this it being very common to have their corn overrun with the wevils though this little animal in its natural bigness scarce equals a grain of wheat yet the microscope discovers it to be a creature of great curiosity in the frame and structure of its parts as the figure expresses which was taken from the life and therefore not unworthy of a description  fig    of these kind of frogs meriana says she saw several swimming in the water at surinam their feet was furnished with a little ball at the end of each toe by the singular contrivance of nature that being so supported they could not only swim but also walk over the marshy and muddy waters they are of a brown and pale green color intermixed together as if they were watered with it these frogs leave their spawn on the banks of the waters where such persons as are curious to observe the change of these creatures gather it and lay it in an earthen vessel filled with water upon a green turf at the bottom the spawn or seed appears as a blackish point enclosed in a kind of white glue in which it lives and by degrees increases its motion till about the eighth day after that they have tails and the little things begin to swim in the water but they and shapeless young frogs in a few days more their eyes appear and a little after their two hind feet the two fore feet likewise coming out of the skin in about eight days more after which their tails being rotted drop off and the cremures become fourfooted and complete frogs often seen scampering out of the waters on the land but we must obsverve that both the water and the turf that the spawn is put into must be shifted every now and then and the little creatures as soon as ever we perceive them to move ought to be nourished in the water with a bit of bread  fig    is a water insect that preys upon young frogs which the inhabitants of surinam where it is found call a water scropion it seems to be rather to the beetle kind in the month of may it changes to a flying infect  having had occassion to make mention of surinam in some of the descriptions of infects it may not be improper to infrom the reader that surinam is a dutch settlement in guiana upon the contient of america it first belonged to the french who built a fort there from them the english took it and afterward the dutch took it from the english in whose hands it now remains madam meriana a gentlewoman of the dutch national if i am rightly informed published a natural history with curious figures of the insects etc found in and about surinam from which book the indian flies contained in this treatise are copied  a branch of the coffee tree   book the fifth of plants fruits and flowers thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits camphire with spikenard spikenard and saffron calanius and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrrh and atoes with all the chief spices slomons song iv       coffee is the fruit of a tree which grows in arabia fleix and is brough to us from mocha the flower of this tree is like the white jesfamine flower and the leaf like the bayleaf the coffee tree is propagated by seeds which should be sown soon after they are gathered from the tree for if they are kept but a short time out of the ground they will not grow which is the chief reason that this tree has not been spread into more different countries for the seeds will not keep good long enough to be sent to any distant place so that in order to cultivate this plant in any part of the world it is absolutely necessary to have it carried thither growing but as this difficulty is now overcome by the quantity of these trees there are now growing both in europe and america so we may expect to be furnished with them from many different parts but especially from the caribbee islands where the trees are found to succeed as well as in their native soil but whether the coffee produced in the west indies will prove as good as that brought from mocha time will discover the berries of this plant are commonly ripe with us in april coffee is of an excellent drying quality it comforts the brain eases pains of the head suppresses vapors dries up crudities in the stomach prevents sleepiness after eating and gives life and gaiety to the spritis etc  tea is the leaf of a small shrub which grows plentifully in several parts of the east indies it is brought over dried from china japan and siam these leaves they gather in the spring at which time they are little and tender and of the shape of the figure in the plate it bears a flower composed of five white leaves formed like a rose and some stamina which when gone is succeeded by a thick cod like a hazelnut of a chesnutcolour in which is found two or three nuts or berries which contain in each a little luscious almond of an ill taste the root is fibrous and spreads upon the surface of the earth this shrub flourishes equally in rich or poor ground the tea which the english dutch etc bring over in curled or twisted leaves is thus prepared by the natives of the country who after they have gathered it dry it gently before the fire and the leaves in drying curl up just as we have them brought over in buying tea choose that which is greenest the best scented and which is as little broke into dust or small powder as possible they say the chief reason that tea is become such a commodity throughout europe is because the duth etc change sage for it which the japonese and chinese are great lovers of which is not without probability since we have not a plant endowed with more virtues than sage especially that sort which tea coca or chocolate tree for its singular goodness is called sage of virtue among us and doubtless it would be much more valued here if it grew in india or as far off but because it is common we take little account of it notwithstanding the latin proverb cur morictur homo cum crescit salvia in horto why will any body die that has sage in his garden so that we need not wonder if the chinese etc exchange tea for it tho this liquor is more used for pleasure than for any medicinal purpose yet are there a great many good qualities attributed to it  the cocao tree that bears the chocolate nut much resembles our heartcherry tree but at its full growth spreads to a greater breadth in compass and is something loftier it is well supplied with leaves that resemble those of the orange tree but are longer and more sharppointed it is always flourishing especially toward the two solstices for as the leaves only fall off successively and as others grow again this tree never appears naked the blossoms are regular and like a rose but very small and without smell every blossom is joined to the tree by a slender stalk and leaves in falling off long stringly filaments which are green from which a yellow pointed fruit is formed of the size of our melons which adhere to the thick boughs or branches not admitting of any intermedium or stem as apples do each fruit contains from fifteen to twentyfive little nuts or almonds they are each of them covered with a yellowish thin skin which being separated a tender substance appears which is divided into several unequal particles that are olly of good nourishment and leave a certain sharpness upon the palate these trees grow in all the spanish west indies jamaica etc they commonly bear fruit within seven years space or less after their first plantation though in the interim they are sometimes twice or thrice removed and great care is taken to secure them with shades that they may not be injured by the overpowerful heat of the scorching sun of which they are not in danger when they once become great for being planted in ranks and regular walks shady plantane trees etc are ranged with them and one shelters the other both from the parching sun and boisterous wind as it is a tree of singular beauty having large broad ablong green leaves which fall back and hang like so many shields to preserve and defend the tender fruit so is it likewise a tree of great profit to the owner arising from its most desirable fruit which grows after an admirable manner in cods studded as it were in the very body of the tree from the earth upwards as well as the arms and large boughs but the fruit never grows at the ends of the small branches and herein we may easily apprehend that if nature had placed such bulky fruit at the ends of the branches their great weight must necessarily break them and the fruit would fall before it come to maturity the nuts they say among the indians and spaniards go for current money even in those countries where gold and silver are naturally produced being to them food and raiment riches and delight all at once it seems almost unnecessary to tell the reader that the use of these nuts is to make that wellknown liquor called chocolate every one being acquainted with it  the sugarcane grows plentifully in many parts of the west indies especially the caribbee islands as barbados jamaica nevis etc this plant bears on each joint a cane of five or six foot high adorned with long straight green leaves much like to some flags or flowerdeluces but not so broad and carries on its top a silvercolourd flower like a plume of feathers these canes are not hollow but the stalk is stuffed with a porous substance moist and sweet in taste when they come to maturity which the planters know by several signs as well as we know when our harvest is ready they cut the canes down at or above the first joint from the ground laying them in heaps as we usually lay our corn in harvest time then they clear them from their leaves and bind the stalks in bundles the sugar is made the sugar cane nutinegs and mace by pressing the canes through the rollers of a mill from whence there runs a great quantity of pleasant juice which being put into boilers the watery part is by the force of the fire evaporated till it comes to a consistency after which they cast it into a mixture made of certain ingredients fit to cleanse and prepare it for graining all the time it is boiling they take off the scum which rises in great quantities until it be fit to empty into coolers that is till it arrives to its just body from the coolers it is again shifted into earthen pots with holes in their bottoms and other pots they call drips under them for receiving the molosses which in about a months time will be separated from the sugar this is then knocked out of the pots and put into casks or hogsheads for transportation the sugarcane in england is very tender and cannot be preserved without a stove it is kept as a great curiosity in the gardens of such as love a variety of plants as being the plant from whence the sugar is produced  nutmegs are of two sorts distinguished by male and female the latter is the best and most commonly used the male which is a long and large nut is seldom used the female which is the rounder and lesser nut is that generally sold in the grocers shops and the trees which bear the female or common nutmegs grow not but in cultivated or improved lands but the males or long nutmegs grow in woods and forests which makes the dutch call them wild nutmegs the tree that produces the common or best sort of nutmegs is as large as a pear tree with leaves shaped like those of the peach but much smaller the blossom is in the shape of a rose of a pleasant smell after the flower is fallen off a fruit appears as large as a green wallnut the nutmeg is the kernel of this fruit which is covered with two barks the first is very thick and pulled off when the fruit is ripe the second is much thinner and finer of a reddish color inclining to yellow it is separated from the nutmeg in order to dry and is what we call mace when the nutmegs are separated from their barks they dry and preserve them the nutmegtrees grow plentifully in the great island of banda in asia and in several other islands in the east indies belonging to the dutch it being a commodity which none but themselves are masters of these isles they say are so stocked with nutmegtrees that it is almost incredible and the climate so good that the trees are always laden with this rich fruit and that they have three crops a year viz in april august and december this tree according to mr tavernier is not planted but grows by means of certain birds which swallow the nutmegs whole and throw them up again without having digested them and the nutmeg being then covered with a viscous and gluey matter and being cast upon the ground they take root and produce a tree which grows just as if it had been planted after the manner of others  cinnamon is a thin bark taken from a tree about the height of our willow which bears a leaf shaped like the indian leaf called malabathrum the flowers grow in little cups of a light blue color and odoriferous succeeded by a fruit of the shape and size of a small olive green at first but growing black as it ripens the tree which produces cinnamon grows without culture in the island of ceylon and the trade thereof is entirely in the hands of the dutch who are masters of the coasts of that island there are nine or ten different sorts of cinnamon the best sort which grows in great plenty in ceylon and is peculiar to that island is called by the natives rasse coronde that is sharp sweet cinnamon it is exported yearly by the dutch east india company who have ordered under several penalties that no other sort be mixed with it all the several sorts of cinnamon trees the best as well as the rest must grow a certain number of years before the bark is fit to be taken off those which grow in valleys where the soil is a sine whitish sand will be ripe in five years others which stand in a wet slimy soil must grow seven or eight years those are later cinnamon tree which grow in the shade of other larger trees and their bark has not that sweetness and agreeable taste observable in the bark of those which grow in a white sandy ground where with little wet they stand fully exposed to the sun but it is rather of a bitterish taste something astringent and smells like camphire if the bark be fresh taken off that juice which remains in the tree has a bitterish taste not unlike that of cloves on the contrary if you taste the inner membrane of the bark when fresh taken off you will find it most exquisitely sweet and extremely agreeable to the tasle whereas the outer part of the bark differs but very little in taste from that of the common trees which shows plainly that all the sweetness of it is owing only to the inner membrane but when the bark is laid in the sun in order to its being dried and wound up this oily and agreeable sweetness of the inner membrane diffuses itself throughout the whole outward part of it which however has been first stripped while yet upon the tree of its outermost greenish coat and imbues it so strongly that for the fragrancy of its smell and the sweetness of its taste it is coveted all the world over the bark may remain upon some trees without losing its sweetness and virtue fourteen fifteen or sixteen years according to the quality of the soil they stand in but after that time it loses by degrees its agreeable sweetness and tastes stronger of camphire besides it is then grown so thick that if it be laid in the sun it will no longer shrink and wind itself up but remain flat in order to account for the vast quantity of cinnamon that has been and is still yearly exported from ceylon several authors have affirmed that when the bark has been stripped off the cinnamon trees it grows again in four or five years and becomes fit to be stripped a second time but this is utterly false for though the trees after the bark has been once taken off are cut down to the very ground yet the root quickly pushes forth new shoots which grow up and ripen in five six seven or eight years some sooner some later and then yield their bark thus far the old roots are instrumental to the growth and plenty of cinnamon trees but their fruit likewise contributes very much toward the same end and it is particularly owing to a certain kind of wild doves which from their eating the fruit of this tree they call cinnamoneaters that they grow so plentifully in this island for the doves when they fetch food for their young ones disperse vast quantities of the fruit all over the fields which occasions the rise of many thousand young trees the oil drawn from cinnamon by fire is reckoned one of the strongest cordial medicines the camphire which comes out of the root is likewise of very great use in several distempers as are also the oil of camphire a very costly thing the leaves of the tree and the oil distilled out of them and lastly the fruits with their oil in short there is no part of the cinnamon tree but what is of some singular use in physic  cloves are the footstalk of the flowers of the clove tree plucked before they are full blown when the fruit begins to appear their color is of a whitish green afterward they grow red and at last when ripe of a dark brown these trees grew plentifully in the molucca islands till the dutch not being able to hinder the english and some other nations from going thither and bringing away cloves from thence thought it advisable to make themselves entirely masters of that commodity to pluck up all the trees and transport them to an island of their own called ternate by which means other nations are forced to purchase that valuable merchandise from them there is no other art used with the cloves after they are plucked from the tree but to let them dry in the open fields exposed to the heat of the sun and after that to keep them carefully from the air there is also described by some authors the royal clove so called from bearing on its top a sort of crown for which reason the king of the country keeps it in his own possession and because there is   common fabulous opinion that the other trees bow toward this as their king  clove tree   pepper   the black eastindian pepper is the fruit of a climbing plant we commonly call a creeper and grows in small clusters or bunches like those of our currants the seeds are small round and green at first but the ripe fresh fruit is about the size of a large current and of a red color which in drying turns to black they say the common white pepper is only the black stripped of its outer skin this is done by first steeping it in sea water then drying it and rubbing it in sand there is however another kind of pepper which is naturally white but in all other respects is like the black the english and dutch bring from the east indies three sorts of black pepper which differ not one from the other but according to the places where they grow the finest is that of malabar the tree or bush that bears the jamaica pepper grows almost after the same manner as the barberry tree but not so lofty and besides without prickles otherwise both for stock branch and leaf it is very much like that tree the grains or berries are about the size of juniper berries and of an aromatic taste which partaking of that of all the other spices it has by the english been called allspice this pepper grows plentifully in many of the plantations in jamaica  ginger is the root of a plant called the small club reed it represents in shape a sort of foot at the end of every root its leaves are large long and of a deep green it bears a reddish flower mixed with a little green the whole head of the flower resembling a club from whence by some it is called ginger with the clubflower there are two kinds of ginger the white or mealy and the hard black but the first is reckoned by much the best ginger grows both in the east and west indies and is very much cultivated in the isles of the antilles but the greatest quantities come from the leeward islands barbados nevis st christophers and likewise from jamaica and other places thereabouts we have now little out of the east indies but what is brought thence in a confection called green ginger which they prepare in india and is likewise made in england and other parts by steeping the fresh root two or three days in warm water keeping it in a balneo all that time by which means it will grow soft and swell they then boil it up either flit or whole with refined sugar to a syrup  ginger plant   the current vine   currants that are sold by the grocers of london etc and are well known for their excellent use in puddings cakes and c are the fruit of the vine and called the corinth grape or vulgarly the current grape of this kind there are two or three different colors as red black and tawney the vine that bears this fruit is low furnished with thick leaves very much indented and like all other vines sending forth claspers at the joints by which it fastens itself to whatever plant stands near it and the fruit is produced in bunches these vines grow plentifully in a vast spacious plain that is situated behind the fortress of zant in greece this plain is surrounded with mountains and hills and is divided into vineyards in which are abundance of cyprus olives and houses of pleasure which make together with the fortress and the mount discoppo a prospect perfectly beautiful when these little grapes are ripe which generally happens in august the people of zant gather and stone them then spread them upon the ground to dry and when dried carry them into the town where they are thrown through a hole into the great magazine called the seraglio and are there pressed so close together in a mass that they are obliged to use iron instruments to pull them out which done they put em into casks or bales of different sizes and to make them so tight as they are brought to us they employ men to tread them with their feet for which purpose they rub em well with oil beforehand currants are brought from several places in the levant but the sort we use is chiefly brought from the islands near the morea they say the people of zant where these currants grow believe that the europeans use them to dye cloths not knowing that they are for eating as currants are the fruit of the vine so likewise the several kinds of raisins are only so many sorts of grapes differing according to the countries where they are produced when the grapes are ripe they gather the bunches and put them to dry in the sun turning them from one side to the other by which means they dry equally and when dry they put em up into little chests etc for transportation though as some say before they expose the bunches to dry in the sun they first dip them into a certain liquor prepared for that purpose  the pomegranate tree is a shrub whereof there are two kinds one cultivated in gardens and the other wild the branches of the first are small angular armed with thorns the bark is reddish the leaves small and resemble those of the myrtle but less pointed hanging by reddish stalks of a strong smell when they are crushed or bruised the flower is large of a beautiful red inclining to purple composed of several leaves like a rose in the hollow of a cup representing a little basket of flowers the cup is oblong hard purplish large at the top having in some measure the figure of a bell at the bottom comes a fruit after the flower is gone which grows into a large round apple having a thick smooth brittle rind adorned with a crown formed by the top of the cup of a purple hue dark without and yellow within this apple is called the pomegranate the inside is divided into several cells or partitions full of seed heaped one upon another being fleshy of a fine red color abounding with a very pleasant juice and each contains in the middle of them an oblong grain of a yellow color and sometimes very irregularly formed the wild pomegranate is a shrub like the former but more rough and thorny they gather the flowers when in their prime these are dried to keep which are brought to us from the levant the wild pomegranate grows only in the hot countries the juice of the pomegranate is much valued in physic there are with us in england reckoned five sorts of pomegranate trees chiefly cultivated for ornament viz first the common pomegranate second the sweet third the wild fourth the double flowered and fifth the american dwarf pomegranate the first of these trees is now pretty common in the english gardens where formerly it was nursed up in cases and preserved with great care as was also the double kind pomegranate tree rice but now they are both hardy enough to resist the severest cold of our climate in open air and if planted against warm walls in a good situation the first sort will often produce fruit which in warm seasons will ripen tolerably well but as these fruits do not ripen till late in the autumn so they are seldom well tasted in england but notwithstanding the fruit of this tree seldom arrives to any perfection in this country so as to render it valuable yet for the beauty of its scarlet color together with the variety of its fruit it well deserves to have one planted in every good garden since the culture is not great which they require the chief care is to plant them upon a rich strong soil and in a warm situation the double flowering kind of this plant is much more esteemed than the other in this country for the sake of its large beautiful double flowers which are of a fine scarlet color and if the trees are supplied with nourishment will continue to produce flowers for near three months successively which renders it one of the most valuable flowering trees yet known a curious account of the whole culture and improvement of the pomegranate plant as managed in england may be seen in mr millers gardeners dictionary under that word punica  rice is the product of a plant much cultivated in most of the eastern countries and great quantities of it are brought into england and other european countries every year where it is in great esteem for puddings etc it being too tender to be produced in these northern countries without the assistance of artificial heat but from some seeds formerly sent to south carolina there have been great quantities produced and it is found to succeed equally as well there as in its native soil which is a very great improvement to our american settlements it being a seed of so great use and profit that it is called the manna of the poor and throughout several countries it is the chief support of the inhabitants this plant bears its stalk about three or four feet high much thicker and stronger than that of wheat and other corn the leaves are long like the reed and fleshy the flowers blow on the top like barley but the seed which follows is disposed in clusters each of which is enclosed in a yellow husk ending in a spiral thread and of an oblong or rather oval figure this plant grows upon moist soils where the ground can be flowed over with water after it is come up so that whoever would cultivate it in england for curiosity should sow the seeds upon a hotbed and when the plants are come up they should be transplanted into pots filled with rich light earth and placed in pans of water which should be plunged into a hotbed and as the water wastes so it must from time to time be renewed again in july these plants may be set abroad in a warm situation still preserving the water in the pans otherwise they will not thrive and toward the latter end of august they will produce their grain which will ripen tolerably well provided the autumn proves favorable though the chief use of rice be for food it is sometimes made use of in medicine it nourishes well stops fluxes is good in armies camps and sieges because it is of light carriage and excellent sustenance and easily prepared it increases blood and restores in consumptions choose the newest rice well cleansed large that is to say plump or well fed white and not dusty  there are several species of the corktree mentioned in some of the italian catalogues of plants but the chief are the broadleavd evergreen corktree and the narrowleavd corktree with smooth edges i shall speak only of the first the broadleavd cork that is always green is a tree of a moderate height very much resembling the oak but the trunk is bigger bearing fewer boughs and the bark a great deal thicker very light spungy and of an ash color tending toward a yellow which bark is taken from the tree first and afterward freed from an inner bark the leaves of the corktree are something like those of the oak but much larger and longer likewise foster and greener on the outside and cork tree tobacco plant a little indented the cups and the acorns are also like those of the oak this tree grows in the hot countries as spain italy toward the pyrenees and in gascony etc when the inhabitants of those parts would make a crop of this commodity they take off the bark of these trees from the top to the bottom and lay one piece upon another to a reasonable height in a pit or ditch that is full of water and having loaded it with weights to keep it down they leave it in this condition for some time and when it is well soaked and laid straight they remove it to another ditch and so to a third and fourth and after that take it out of the water to dry which being done it is transported in bales to different parts of the world choose your cork in fine boards all of a piece not full of knots or chinks of a moderate thickness yellowish both without and within and when it is cut firm and entire the less porous the better we commonly call this cork white cork of france because this sort is made in guienne chiefly about bayonne from whence almost all that is used in france comes there is brought from the same parts another kind of cork they call spanish cork which is likewise according to its usual quality light plain blackish without as if it had been burned which as they say proceeds from nothing else but its being steeped in seawater instead of fresh the inside yellowish and easy to cut not rotten but choose the thickest sort you can get that being much more esteemed and dearer than the thin  of the tobacco plant there are five different species the first is known by the planters in america under the title of oroonoko of which there seems to be two sorts varying in the largeness and texture of their leaves some having very broad rough roundish leaves and others are narrower smoother and do terminate in a point but neither of these sorts are valued by the american planters because the produce of this though it is much greater than the narrowleavd sort yet is not near so much esteemed by the english the second sort is the narrowleavd commonly called the sweetscented tobacco from its having a much more agreeable scent when smoked than the broadleavd sort the smoke of which is very offensive to most persons who have not been accustomed to it this sort is cultivated in great plenty in virginia cuba brasil and several other parts of america from whence it is brought to most parts of europe but especially to england it being prohibited to be cultivated in this country lest his majestys revenues should be thereby lessened excepting a final quantity that is permitted to be cultivated for medicinal use the third sort is the greater narrowleavd perennial tobacco brought from the french settlements in the west indies into the royal garden at paris where it is cultivated in small quantities for making snuff the fourth and fifth two smaller sorts of tobacco are preserved in botanick gardens for variety but are seldom propagated for use the tobacco plants are raised from seed which they sow first in a rich ground and when the plants are come up cover them every morning with branches of trees to defend them from the scorching heat of the sun and having cleared a piece of ground to receive the plants they transplant them in a rainy or moist season planting them down again in rows at about two or three feet distance from each other that they may have room to spread without the leaves touching one another so as to make them rot and corrupt after the tobacco is thus planted they will require no farther care but only from time to time to keep them clear from weeds until the plants begin to show their flowerstems at which time they cut off the tops of them that their leaves may be the better nourished become larger and of a thicker substance and likewise pulling off constantly the leaves underneath that hang on the ground so that they leave about ten or twelve leaves upon a stalk by which means they increase prodigiously and become much thicker when the tobacco is ripe they cut and spread it upon the ground after which they string it upon certain cords in little knots so that the plants may not touch one another then they cotton plant hang it up to dry in the air sheltered from the wet fifteen or twenty days and when it is rightly prepared they make or roll it into what form is best liked by the buyer  cotton is the product of a plant which bears a stalk about two foot high covered with a reddish hairy bark divided into several short branches the leaves are a little less than the sycamore leaves shaped almost like those of the vine hanging to long stalks adorned with a kind of nap or hair the flowers are numerous fine and large having the shape or form of a bell slit or cut into five or six divisions to the bottom of a yellow color mixed with red or purple when the flower is fallen it is succeeded by a fruit the bigness of a filbert which being ripe opens into three or four partitions from whence appears a flake of cotton white as snow which swells up or tumesies by heat to the size of a little apple it contains in it many gross seeds like small peace oblong and cottony each having in it a little oily kernel sweet to the taste there is another sort of cotton tree that differs from the former in bigness for this grows to the height of four or five feet the leaves indented deep into three parts without nap or down the flowers and fruit are like those of the other kind both these sorts of cotton grow in egypt syria cyprus candia and the indies in jamaica barbados and other places in the west indies the cotton tree usually grows to a reasonable height spreading sorth its branches on all sides with small green pointed leaves and bears a flower in form almost like the sweetbriar rose but of a yellowish color after the blossoms are fallen there follows a kind of greenish round button or knob almost as big as a tennis ball having a thin crusty shell which when full rice is of a dark brown or blackish color in these round buttons is enclosed the cotton which open when ripe in several partitions like the former out of which the cotton falls if not timely gathered it contains likewise a great number of small blackish seeds that grow enclosed in the same shell which before the cotton is made use of are picked out there grow likewise in some of the american plantations cotton bushes or shrubs which approach very near in likeness to those of egypt arabia etc  the mandrake plant is distinguished by two species viz the common with a round fruit called the male mandrake and that with the purplish blue flower called the female mandrake the leaves of the former rise directly from the root above a foot long broader than a mans hand in the middle and narrow at both ends smooth of a deep green color and a disagreeable smell the flowers of both these plants are of the shape of a bell divided at the tops into several parts which afterward becomes a globular soft fruit in which is conraind many kidneyshapd seeds the root as some say represents when it is whole the lower parts of a man from whence it is called anthropomorpha which signifies the figure of a man but as to this feigned resemblance of an human form which the root of this plant is said to carry it is all imposture owing to the cunning of quacks and designing knaves who deceive the ignorant with fictitious images shaped from the fresh roots of briony and other plants and what is reported as to the manner of rooting up this plant by tying a dog thereto to prevent the certain death of the person who should dare to attempt it and the groans it emits upon the force offered etc it is all a fulsome fable for several large roots of this plant have been taken up some of which have been transplanted into other places without observing any particular difference in this from any other deeprooting plant some persons worthy of credit have delivered as a truth that one of these roots will remain sound above fifty years and be as vigorous as a young plant but they should never be removed after their roots have arrived to any considerable size which would break their lower fibers and so stint the plants as that they will not recover their former strength in two or three years the female mandrake plant mandrake with the bluish purple flower differs from the former in that its leaves are smaller narrower more folded blacker trailing on the ground of a strong stinking smell and the fruit less and paler not formed like a pear as some authors will have it but round scented full of juice and containing very small black seeds the root is about a foot long divided into two branches brown without white within and furnished with some fibers but nothing like the male plant both sorts grow in hot countries in the plains or mountainous places but the last much rarer these plants are propagated in gardens from seeds which should be sown upon a bed of light earth soon after they are ripe where they should remain till the latter end of august observing always to keep them clear from weeds at which time they should be taken up very carefully and transplanted into the places where they are to remain which should be a light deep soil for their roots do always run downwards very deep and if the plants are not disturbed they will grow to a large size in a few years and will produce great quantities of flowers and fruit and they will abide a great many years there are mandrakes mentioned in the  0th chap of genesis which reuben is said to have found in the field in the time of wheat harvest and with which his mother leah purchased from her sister rachel no less a favor than the enjoyment of her husband what those mandrakes should be that were so desirable to rachel whether she coveted them for their delectable taste their fragrant smell or their beautiful color does not appear and as our learned commentators differ in their opinions about it i shall not venture to give my own but only observe that in the canticles it is said the mandrakes give a smell and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits which seems to intimate as if the mandrakes were a fruit of a pleasant taste a fragrant smell and delightful to the eye for when solomon says the mandrakes give a smell sure he must mean a grateful smell or methinks he would hardly have introduced them to adorn a pastoral song and as he immediately adds at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits it seems to imply that the mandrake was likewise a pleasant fruit which perhaps was so both to the eye and palate but be that as it will this we may venture to affirm that the mandrake plants known to us now whether wild or cultivated have no such desirable qualities as to render them so valuable to the good women of our days to give in exchange their husbands for them for these contrary to what is mentioned in scripture have a disagreeable smell  balm of gilead is a liquid white balsam that flows of itself though sometimes they make incisions when the liquor flows not freely during summer from the trunk of a plant called balsamum syriacum folio rutae that bears leaves like rue and white flowers shaped like stars in the middle of which rise little berries that are sharp at the end in which is a small kernel it sticks to the branches by means of a very small stalk is green at first and grows brown as it ripens when the balsam first runs it is of the consistence of oil of sweet almonds but by age becomes like turpentine loses much of its smell and grows sometimes blackish when fresh it is of a very agreeable aromatic smell and of a taste like citron peel jerico was once the only place in the world where this true balsam was to be found but since the turks were masters of the holy land they have transplanted these shrubs into their gardens at grand cairc etc where they are guarded by janisaries or soldiers during the time the balsam flows at which time it is very difficult for a christian to get a sight of these plants which are desended with very high walls as well as soldiers against their entering and as to the balsam it is almost impossible to get any upon the place unless it be by means of some ambassador to whom the grand seignior has made a present of it or by the soldiers who watch this precious liquor by which we may understand that what several persons pretend to sell for true balsam is nothing but white balm of gilead balsam of peru which they prepare with spirit of wine rectified or with some oils distilled mr pomet says a friend of his made him a present of one ounce which he brought from grand cairo it was of a solid consistence like that of turpentine of chio of a golden yellow color and a citron smell  the cedar of libanus is a very large thick straight tree its leaves small and slender being much narrower than those of the pine tree disposed in clusters along the branches and the fruit like our pineapples but grows upon the upper part of the branches and stands erect having a strong woody central style by which it is firmly annexed to the branch so as with difficulty to be taken off which central style remains upon the branches after the cone is fallen to pieces so that they never drop off whole as the pineapples do it is said that from the trunk and the large branches of this tree there flows during the great heats without any incision a sort of white resin very clear and of a grateful odor which they call cedargum of which the largest trees yield not less than six ounces a day the cones of the cedar are brought from the levant which if preserved entire will continue their seeds for several years the time of their ripening is commonly in the spring and are near one year old before we receive them for which they are not the worse but rather the better to get the seeds out of the cone they split it by driving a sharp piece of iron through the center lengthways and so pull the seeds out with their fingers which seeds are fastened to a thin leafy substance as are those of the firrtree for the ordering the cedar plant see millers directions in his gardeners dictionary what we find mentioned in scripture of the lofty cedars can be no ways applicable to the stature of this tree since from the experience we have of those now growing in england as also from the testimony of several who have visited those few remaining trees on mount libanus they are not inclined to grow very losty but on the contrary extend their branches very far to which the allusion made by the psalmist agrees very well when he is describing the flourishing state of a people and says they shall spread their branches like the cedar tree mr maundrel in his travels says when he visited mount libanus there were but sixteen large trees remaining some of which were of a prodigious bulk but that there were many more young trees of a smaller size he measured one of the largest and found it to be twelve yards six inches in girt and yet sound and thirty seven yards in the spread of its boughs at about five or six yards from the ground it was divided into five limbs each of which was equal to a great tree the wood of this famous tree is accounted proof against all putrefaction of animal bodies the sawdust of it is thought to be one of the secrets used by those mountebanks who pretend to have the embalming mystery this wood is also said to yield an oil which is famous for preserving books and writings and the wood is thought by my lord bacon to continue a thousand years sound of cedar wood was most of the timberwork of that glorious structure the temple of jerusalem  the ananas is a kind of pineapple adorned on the top with a little crown and a bunch of red leaves like fire it has a scaly rind or shell like the pineapple and the fruit like the cones of the pine in the form of a sugar loaf the inside appears like that of the melon the flesh is fibrous but dissolves in the mouth having the delicious taste of the peach the quince and the muscadine grape all together it is called the king of fruits because for the richness of its flavor it surpasses all the known fruits in the world and also for the crown upon the head of it which is a peculiar mark of its royalty and at its fall produces a young king that succeeds in all his admirable qualities this fruit is produced from an herbaceous plant which has leaves somewhat resembling those of an aloe and are for the most part sawed on their edges but are much thinner and not so juicy as the aloe from cedar of libanu the ananus great american aloe the fruits resembling the cones of the pine tree it is supposed to have its name where this plant is a native is not easy to determine but it was brought from the factories in the east indies and planted in the hottest islands in the west indies where they are in great plenty and extraordinary goodness but it has been very lately that it was introduced into the european gardens so as to produce fruit the first person who succeeded in this affair was monsieur le cour at leyden in holland who after a great many trials with little or no success did at last hit upon a proper degree of heat and management so as to produce fruit equally as good though not so large as those which are produced in the west indies as has been often affirmed by persons who have lived many years there and it is to this worthy cultivator of gardening who did not spare any pains or expense to accomplish it that all the lovers thereof are obliged for introducing this king of fruits amongst them and it was from him that our gardens in england were first supplied though we have since had large quantities brought from america from the juice of this fruit is made a wine almost equal to malmsey sack and will intoxicate as soon as the strongest wine  the aloe is a plant whose leaves are thick and succulent and for the most part beset with spines on the edges the flower consists of one leaf is tubulous and cut into six segments at the top like the hyacinth the fruit is oblong and cylindrical which is divided into three cells in which are confined flat and for the most part semicircular seeds there are a great variety of these plants in the curious gardens of botany in england near forty different sorts which are natives both of the east and west indies but the most curious sorts are brought from the cape of good hope most of the african sorts of aloes do produce flowers with us annually when grown to a sufficient size which is often the second and seldom more than the third or fourth year after planting from offsets but the american aloes which do for the most part produce their flowerstems immediately from the center of the plant seldom flower till they are of a considerable age and this but once during the life of the plant for when the flowerstem begins to shoot from the middle of the plant which for the most part is of a large size and grows to a great height it draws all the nourishment from the leaves so that as that advances the leaves decay and when the flowers are fully blown scarce any of the leaves remain alive but whenever this happens the old root sends forth a numerous quantity of offsets for increase and it is not till this time that some of these sorts can be increased there is a vulgar error or two relating to the large american aloe which is that it never flowers until it is an hundred years old this is a mistake since we have had several of them flower in england some of which were known not to exceed fifty years old and others that flowered many years ago cannot be supposed to have been in england so long as to arrive at that age since they were thought too tender for our climate at that time when greenhouses were not known another common error is that when the flower opens it makes a report like that of firing a gun this is sufficiently confuted by all those who have been where these plants have flowered but probably the rise of this story might proceed from some persons saying when one of these plants flowered it made a great noise meaning thereby that whenever one of them flowered in england it was spread abroad as an uncommon thing and occasioned a great noise among the neighboring inhabitants most of whom usually repair to see it as a thing that rarely happens and as a great curiosity in the year      in the month of september one of these great american aloes flowered in mr cowells garden at hoxton and though it was above forty years old did not shoot forth its stem till about eleven weeks before in which short time it shot up sensible plan to the height of twentytwo feet the deserved fame of this wonderful plant being spread abroad occasioned a vast resort of people of all ranks to see so great a curiosity  the contexture of the sensible plant is very surprising for upon touching any of the sprigs with leaves on all the leaves on that sprig contracting themselves by pairs joined their upper superfices close together upon the dropping a drop of aquafortis on the sprig betwixt the leaves all the leaves above shut presently those below by pairs successively after by and by the lower leaves of the other branches and so every pair successively with some little distance of time betwixt to the top of each sprig and so they continued shut for some time but returning to the garden the next day and several days after found all the leaves dilated again on two of the sprigs but where the aquafortis had dropped upwards dead and withered but those below on the same sprig green and closing upon the touch as before and continued so with a pair of scissars as suddenly as it could be done one of the leaves was clipped off in the middle upon which that pair and the pair above closed presently after a little interval those under and so the rest of the pairs to the bottom of the sprig and then the motion began in the lower pairs on the other sprigs and so shut them by pairs upwards though not with such distinct distances upon cutting off one of the harder branches there came out a liquor without pressure very clear and of a bright greenish color tasting at first a little bitterish but after leaving a liquorice like taste behind which probably the motion of this plant upon touching might proceed from this that there being a constant intercourse betwixt every part of this plant and its root either by a circulation of this liquor or a constant pressing of the subtiler parts of it to every extremity of the plant the above experiments were made by dr hook on some of these plants which grew in a garden in st jamess park i have read that in the passage of the isthmus from nombre de dios to panama there is a whole wood full of sensitive trees of which as soon as they are touched the leaves close and move with a rattling noise and twist themselves together into a winding figure  indian lanthorn fly   natural and philosophical conjectures on the ignis fatuus or jack in the lanthorn endeavoring to prove that the light so called proceeds from some flying insect and not from a fired vapor as generally believed  with a description and curious figure of the indian lanthorn fly a nocturnal insect which carries a light in dark nights equal to that of our will with a whisp  london printed for t boreman near childs coffeehouse in st pauls churchyard  mdccxxxvi  ignis fatuus or jack in the lanthorn a flying insect the notion that an ignis fatuus or jack in the lanthorn is a fired vapor exhaled from boggy places being founded on the judgment of many learned and ingenious persons has so far prevailed that the generality of mankind seem to acquiesce in that solution of this surprising phenomenon  an attempt therefore to prove the contrary and that the light called by this name proceeds from some nocturnal flyinginsect will perhaps be deemed vain and rash however i shall take the liberty to assign the reasons which induce me to believe it and my objections to its being a vapor which i submit to the judgment of the curious till time and experience shall demonstrate the real truth  if in my pursuit of the wanderer i should chance to be misled it will be in common with all that have followed the chase with this advantage that i can sustain no injuries from it and the attempt may invite others who may be more successful in their endeavors the conjecture must be agreeable and the probability will be of some use if it helps to dispossess fearful country people of their superstitious apprehensions  the first hint of my opinion i received from merianas account of the famous indian lanthorn fly published amongst her insects of surinam which account being not in the least foreign to the subject nor perhaps unpleasant to the reader i shall here insert  the lanthorn fly is a nocturnal insect that has an hood or bladder on its head which gives a light like a lanthorn in the night but by daylight is clear and transparent very curiously adorned with stripes of a red and green color such a shining came forth from this bladder in the night that it was possible by the light of it to have read writing of tolerable large characters she says that when once upon a time the indians she sent to seek for insects brought her of these lanthorn flies in great abundance she shut them up in a large chest not knowing as yet that they shone by night but being awaked and frightened in the night out of her sleep by an unusual noise jumping out of bed ordered a light to be brought not knowing what that uncommon disturbance which she heard in her house should be it immediately appeared that the noise came from the chest upon which with some disorder of mind they opened it but still more frightened they suddenly clapped the lid down again because in the opening there came as it were a flame of fire as often as a new insect flew out which at length being observed and coming to themselves again they gathered the little creatures together once more admiring that so considerable a light should proceed from them  the wings and whole body of this insect are elegantly adorned with a mixture of beautiful colors as red green yellow etc it is said the creature can contract or dilate the hood or bladder over its head at pleasure and that they hide all their light when taken but when at liberty afford it plentifully accordingly those which meriana enclosed having the liberty of a large dark chest displayed their light and it being their proper time to fly endeavored to escape as soon as the lid was open  the more i considered this wonderful account the stronger it inclined me to believe the jack in the lanthorn of our own country was likewise no other than the shining of some nightflying insect and indeed i was too well pleased with the discovery i thought i had made vainly imagining my opinion to be singular nor knowing that any person had formed the conjecture before my self till looking into the philosophical transactions i was agreeably surprised to find that two learned and eminent persons the late mr fr willughby and mr ray were both of the same opinion the late learned and ingenious dr derham indeed who published that account was of a contrary opinion believing those appearances to be fired vapors but with due submission to the judgment of so great a man the account he has given of this phenomenon seems in every circumstance to agree much better with that of a living creature than an inflammable vapor which account of the ignes fatui i shall transcribe from the philosophical transactions for the sake of such of my readers as are not possessed of those books  but i shall first give the reasons which incline me to believe these appearances only the shining of some nocturnal flies because they are the result of such thoughts as occurred from considering the subject itself before i knew the sentiments of those eminent persons abovementioned  i apprehend then that the ignis fatuus must be rather a flying insect than a vapor because the properties attributed to it such as its motion directing itself which way it pleases shunning whatever obstruction happens in its passage and the like in which almost all accounts agree correspond much better to that of an insect flying or the actions of something guided by sense than to that of a fired vapor which must be absolutely carried with the wind let it blow which way it will and may we not very naturally suppose that if it was only a vapor driven by the wind it would some time or other have been blown exactly to the spot where some persons were passing that might have discovered what it was or directly to some house village town and c i cannot imagine how a mere vapor could shun any of these obstructions and would a fired vapor if once extinct as these appearances are frequently observed to be suddenly dark and immediately to shine again be enkindled in a body any more  methinks if igues fatui were only vapors they would sometimes be raised higher in the air than these lights are observed to be which seldom exceeds six feet above the ground unless it be to mount over a hedge or some such thing but their passing along a few feet above the ground or surface of the water very much agrees with that of some insects in quest of their prey and does not their settling of a sudden and rising again immediately answer likewise it looks very much as if they had found something which they were in search after from hence there appears great reason to believe it nothing else but a nightflying infect and that the light it carries is given either to seek its food with or woo its female or perhaps both  all accounts agree that the ignis fatuus is never seen but in a dark night which is still a stronger argument of its being a living creature for a vapor might be exhalld when it was not so dark as well as when it was and be visible too but supposing it a creature that flies by night it may either not sally out in light nights or its organs of sight be so adapted as to see at such a time without the assistance of this extraordinary light and not expend its shining matter when its natural eyes will serve but use this lamp or lanthorn in dark nights only when necessity obliges it for perhaps the materials that this shining matter is composed of may cost the creature some labor to gather though nature may fit it for use afterward and it is not unlikely that the supposed little animal may have a receptacle to preserve its shining matter in which it lets out when occasion requires for this light is no real fire but the appearance only  but although we are not able to give a satisfactory account of what this light consists of this carries no real objection to its being a nightshining fly because we are well assured that there are flying insects peculiar to several countries that actually do shine in dark nights and yield lights not much different from those of our ignes fatui  to me it seems not altogether improbable that this supposed insect may be furnished with a kind of natural phosphorus perhaps in quality not unlike the great mr boyles noctilucal matter or nightshining stuff which when reduced to a powder and put into a phial gently heated at the fire and then shook whereby the small particles of this shining matter being put into motion would in a dark room yield a light very vivid  see mr boyles experiments and observations made upon the icy etc noctiluca that the like agitation may be performed by these shining flies naturally without any difficulty either by respiration or by the motion of its wings or legs seems not at all improbable  agreeable to this is what mr templer observed of the gloworm putting says he the gloworm into a small thin box such as pills are usually sent in may    between eleven and twelve at night i saw her shine through the box very clearly on one side the box shut putting white paper into the box and the worm into the paper it shined through the paper and box both the next morning about eight of the clock she seemed dead and holding her in a very dark place i could perceive very little light and that only when she was turned on her back and by consequence put into some little voluntary motion after sunset that night she walked briskly up and down in her box shining clearly as the night before the   th in the morning she seemed dead again at night recovered her self and shined as well as ever in the box i never says he saw her shine without some sensible motion either in her body or legs in her clearst shining she extended her body a third part beyond its usual length the gloworm having contracted her body into a bending posture shined little the light scarcely so big as a great pins head upon touching of her she extended her self walked in her box and at first extent shined as gloriously as ever philosoph transact no     the use that i would make of these observations on the gloworm is to strengthen the probability that the supposed jack in the lanthorn fly and other shining flies as well as the gloworm emit their light by putting the small particles of shining matter into motion from some voluntary motion in themselves  it has been objected first that these lights were too large for any insect whatever  second that they were always carried along with the wind  third that they were never seen but in saltmarshes or other boggy grounds  and lastly which seems to be the strongest of all the objections if this light proceeds from a flying insect how comes it that the creature has never yet been discovered or how was it possible to have escaped the narrow searches of so many curious persons as have with indefatigable labor collected all the insects possible to be procured both of our own country and likewise from abroad and have with so great care examined the contexture of most insects as well as larger animals and as it were anatomised their distinct parts have been able to render a consistent and rational account of the various use those parts seemed to be designed for and yet it should never enter into any of their heads that such a creature was a nocturnal luminous insect and probably the ignis fatuus that had so long amused and puzzled mankind to account for  the first objection urges the impossibility of an insect carrying a light so large as the ignis fatuus appears to be  most accounts agree that these lights commonly appear of the bigness of that of a middling candle and sometimes they have been seen much smaller though some indeed have said they have seen in other countries these appearances equal to that of a torch every one knows that light magnifies in the night the darker the night the bigger the light seems to be and what appeared so luminous at a distance the nearer you approach it the less it grows the same has been observed of the ignis fatuus which as before said is no real fire but the appearance only it is well known the lanthorn fly of the indies when at liberty sometimes emits a light not far short of what is reported of the biggest of our jack in the lanthorn and this light being contained in the bladder on its head the creature as is said can either contract or dilate at pleasure the gloworm can increase or diminish its shining and very probably the supposed jack in the lanthorn fly can do the same or its light appearing bigger or less may be in proportion to the size or perfection of the creature that emits it  the second objection is that this light was always carried along with the wind if that were true it would be impossible for it to shun any kind of obstruction in its way whether man beast bank hedge house etc but would unavoidably sometimes have been driven against some or other of them which i never heard it was but on the contrary shunned them as carefully as if guided by sense besides it can be proved by undeniable testimony that this light moves any way it pleases just as a flying insect would do busied in seeking its food sporting itself or some other employment it must be owned indeed that a flying insect is generally carried with the wind not caring or not able especially when it blows any thing hard to beat against it unless it be such who have homes and young offsprings to take care of and whose bodies are fitly balanced to resist such winds thus far the motion of an insect will agree with that of a vapor carried by the wind  the third objection that the ignes fatui are never seen but in saltmarshes or other boggy places is a great mistake i can produce persons of veracity that have seen these lights flying over fields heaths and other dry places a few days since a grave gentleman a person of exceeding good knowledge told me that in hertfordshire about eleven a clock in a dark night he saw one of these lights flying over a fallow piece of ground being within three or four fields of his habitation he was perfectly acquainted with the ground thereabouts and well assured there was no hazard of being led into bogs rivers or other dangerous places his curiosity led him to follow it resolving if possible to discover what it was for though he had heard it was only a vapor exhaled from the earth he had still some doubt about it it led him over a plowed field flying and twisting about from place to place sometimes it would suddenly disappear and as suddenly appear again sometimes it would drop down and presently rise again once it made directly to a hedge but a small distance from him which as soon as it came pretty near it mounted over and he lost sight of it after he had followed it a full hour without the least satisfaction he then turned about to make the best of his way home when presently he spied it again but finding it next to an impossibility to approach near enough to satisfy his curiosity about it and being pretty well tired gave over the pursuit and would follow it no further the same person says that in surry he has seen in a dark night six or seven of these lights at one time flying over a boggy common and that he has seen these appearances flying over lands where there has been neither ponds nor bogs  if the objection to its being an insect because seen only in boggy places would hold good it would infallibly destroy the last objection of its being always carried along with the wind for as these lights frequently hold collected in a body for an hour or more as has been oftentimes observed they might nay certainly would sometimes in half that time be driven over fields and other dry places according to the strength of the wind but it will admit of a doubt whether an inflammable vapor would continue collected in a body many minutes exposed to so much wind as would be sufficient to carry it along without being very soon dissipated  i dont deny that these appearances are more frequently seen in boggy and marshy grounds the creature may very probably feed on watery insects and as all animals are naturally endued with the sense of knowing the sure places where to find their food so may the jack in the lanthorn fly likewise frequent watery places for that very end at which places as the most likely the males may meet and woo their females also the flying state being the perfection and last state of all the winged tribes of insects in which they generate lay their eggs and after which few kinds of them long survive  this light being often observed to stand still as well as move and sometimes seeming fixed on the surface of the water we may naturally suppose at such a time it settles upon the ground grass or weeds as other insects do and may perhaps either have found and be devouring its prey or watching to catch it which it could not do without the assistance of this extraordinary light  to the last objection if an ignis fatuus were only the shining of some insect how comes it that the creature never yet was discovered etc i reply that the supposed jack in the lanthorn flys not being yet discovered may in a great measure be accounted for all nightanimals in general have places of retreat where they hide themselves in the daytime to these places of retirement they seem as naturally to betake themselves as other animals to rest and sleep some find a proper convenient receptacle under the earth in holes some in timber stone etc others lying on the ground amongst weeds or in hedges hollow trees or under the bark or in the wood etc it would be endless to recount the various methods nature has taught these little creatures to secure themselves from dangers  we all know that such animals as fly a nights are sluggish and heavy in the daytime not caring to stir and with difficulty are put on the wing hardly any thing less than their preservation will force them to it as the bat owl beetle chafer etc which creatures fly only for about an hour in the dusk of the evening and so do not stand in need of that extraordinary light as the supposed jack in the lanthorn fly which is always observed to sally out in very dark nights and if those animals are so sluggish that fly in the evening only what may we suppose of the will with a whisp which flies chiefly when late at night  the gloworm as mr templer observed always seemed as if dead in the daytime yet constantly at night would be brisk and shine as vivid as ever  if by chance in the daytime any person should disclose the sluggish jack in the lanthorn fly in its place of shelter or retreat which perhaps may have often happened both in its creeping and flying state likewise very likely they would destroy it as common people do most insects as noxious creatures especially when large and uncommon but if they should happen not to kill it not one in ten thousand but would leave it where they found it without regarding it at all  for this reason it is not only difficult to discover this insect in the daytime but if a thousand had been found it would be next to an impossibility to know they were shining flies because the part that contains the luminous matter like that of the indian lanthorn flies appears by daylight only clear and pellucid without any shining at all besides it may perhaps be an insect not of the multiparous kind consequently the seldomer to be met with  the difficulty of catching this supposed insect by night has been as great hitherto as that of knowing it by day for ignes fatui as all agree appear only in dark nights and commonly when late at which time the benighted traveller wants to be at home or perhaps the stories he has heard of the jack in the lanthorns leading such as follow it into rivers and other dangerous places deterr him from going after it but if it happened he was neither in haste nor afraid it would be almost impossible to follow it in a dark night amongst bogs lakes etc where this insect is usually sporting and frisking over the waters should we not conclude the person that would perhaps risque his life in attempting to catch what he thinks a vapor more infatuated than the ignis fatuus he is in pursuit after  it was never yet known that any person approached so near this light as to discover certainly what it was but as some persons have attempted to draw near it for that intent when by chance they have seen it in a place easy of access though not one in a thousand have had the courage to venture the cunning vapor as if sensible of their design and for its own security withdraws its light as it were a dark lanthorn and takes that opportunity to escape leaving the ignis fatuus hunter in the dark amongst bogs and fens to find his way out again whilst jack in the lanthorn appears again two or three hundred yards off sporting over the brooks and meadows exercised in its beloved employment  it appears upon the whole that the various properties observable in these lights carry evident marks of sense to attribute them therefore to fired vapors moving without any direction is an explication that renders the subject but more unintelligible  the late ingenious r bradley f r s his opinion of these appearances was as follows the ignis fatuus says he or jack in the lanthorn i suppose to be no more than a group of small enlightened insects rather than suppose it an inflammable vapor as some have taken it to be for if it consisted of such effluvia or corpuscula as rise from the earth or waters that were inflammable and by some cause or other had taken fire they could not be of so long lasting or duration as we find them to be and besides we might as reasonably expect that all the effluvia arising at the same time from the same body of water should equally be inflammable as these and so the whole surface of the pond lake or river appear all in a flame at one time the sudden motion of this light from place to place very much agrees with the motion observable in groups of gnats which move in a body sometimes very slowly and at other times drive together with great swiftness happening says he to discourse upon this subject with the ingenious mr godfrey the chemist that gentleman told me that he had often observed this enlightened body in some places abroad and had caught some of the insects which helped to compose it but allowing it to be as i say the occasion of the light in such insects remains yet to be discovered  of all the accounts that i have had from variety of people that have seen these lights and with which i could have filled a large volume i find no material difference in their several relations only that some and indeed the most have seen them in watery and boggy places others have seen them in dry grounds to some these lights appeared of the bigness of that of a middling candle which most agree in to others bigger and to some smaller i shall therefore add no other relations but what follows from the philosophical transactions  of the meteor called the ignis fatuus from observations made in england by the rev mr w derham frs and others in italy communicated by sir tho dereham bart frs no     p  0  philos transact  it being the opinion of diverse skilful naturalists particularly mr fran willughby and mr ray that the ignes fatui are only the shining of a great number of the male gloworms in england or of the pyraustae in italy flying together i was minded to consult my curious and ingenious friend sir thomas dereham about the phenomenon being informed that those ignes fatui are common in all the italian parts but of the pyraustae or fireflies he says he never observed any such effects although there is an immense number of them in june and july he says moreover that these pyraustae are called lucciolae ie small lights and that they are not the farfalls as mr ray thought which are butterflies but i have good reason to think that insects are not concerned in the ignes fatui from the following observations the first of which i made my self and the others i received from italy by the favor of sir tho dereham  my own observations i made at a place that lay in a valley between rocky hills which i suspect might contain minerals in some boggy ground near the bottom of those hills where seeing one in a calm dark night with gentle approaches i got up by degrees within two or three yards of it and viewed it with all the care i possibly could i found it frisking about a dead thistle growing in the field until a small motion of the air even such as was caused only by the approximation of my self made it skip to another place and thence to another and another  it is now about fifty five years since i saw this phenomenon but i have as fresh and perfect an idea of it as if it was but a few days and as i took it then so i am of the same opinion now that it was a fired vapor  the male gloworms i know emit their shining light as they fly by which means they discover and woo their females but i never observed them to fly together in so great numbers as to make a light equal to an ignis fatuus and i was so near that had it been the shining of gloworms i must have seen it in little distinct spots of light but it was one continuous body of light  thus far the doctor has related his own observation of an ignis fatuus before i mention the observations which sir tho dereham procured for him in italy i cannot help remarking that in the above account the dr has given of an ignis fatuus there appears a much stronger argument of its being a living creature than a vapor for when with gentle approaches he got up by degrees within two or three yards of it he found it frisking about a dead thistle growing in the field until a small motion of the air even such as was caused only by his continual gentle approach made it skip to another place and so to another and another its frisking and playing about a thistle agrees much better with that of an insect exercised in seeking its food or some other delightful employment as does its skipping from place to place likewise for i can hardly think it possible that the air agitated only by his body considering how gently he approached the light could have been sufficient so to affect it at two or three yards distance as to have driven it from him but if this was really the cause of its first remove its second third and after removes from place to place must be owing to something else and as it was a calm night we cannot attribute its flight to the wind nor does the doctor in the least assign that as the cause any further than what proceeded from his own slow easy motion which was to my thinking insufficient to effect it besides if the motion of the air was the only cause of this lights moving from place to place it could not be carried along in one continuous body of light but would at least be spread if not soon dissipated but an insect busied in seeking its food or some other employment we may naturally suppose that as soon as ever it perceived itself discovered which it might do by the help of its light it would move off in order to secure itself from any appearing danger and this solution of the motion of the ignis fatuus seems to me more agreeable to truth than that of a vapor and as to the lights exceeding that which the male gloworm emits flying and that he never observed them to fly together in so great numbers as to make a light equal to an ignis fatuus there seems good reason to believe that all shining flies can at pleasure add or diminish their light or perhaps the lights being more or less may be owing to the size or perfection of the creature but i believe it is not a collective body of small insects that composes the ignis fatuus but rather one single animal which of what tribe it belongs to remains yet to be discovered  the lanthornfly of the indies seems to be of the papilionaceous kind though the indians say it is produced from the insect fig   page    which agrees better with the chafer or beetle kind than that of the butterfly but whether the ignis fatuus be of the papilionaceous libella beetlekind or any other in must remain a doubt till time discovers it and all that is intended in this attempt is only to show the probability of its being a living animal rather than a vapor because many of the circumstances agree well with the former and hardly one with the latter  the observations which sir tho dereham procured for the doctor in italy agreeing in the general with most other relations and the whole being too long to insert i shall only extract the heads of what that gentleman has delivered and then leave the argument to some abler hand whose time and abilities are better suited to examine the subject  in italy there are of these lights both on the mountains and in the plains and are pretty common in all the territory of bologna to begin with the plains they are frequently observed there the country people call them cularsi perhaps from some fancied similitude to those birds and because they look upon them as birds the belly and other parts of which are resplendent like our shining flies they are most frequent in watery and morasse ground and there are some such places where one may be almost sure of seeing them every night if it be dark in the fields near the bridge della calcarata in a common belonging to a parish of s maria in dono north of bologna one of these fiery appearances is very often observed to move across the fields coming from another bridge there is another of them in the fields of bagnara almost east of bologna which scarce ever fails to appear in dark nights particularly when it rains or snows as also in cold and frosty weather both these lights are very large that at bagnara appeared to a gentleman as he was traveling that way it kept him company for a mile or better constantly moving before him and casting a stronger light on the road than the link he had with him  lesser ones there appear a good many some of them giving as much light as a lighted torch and some there are no bigger than the flame of a common candle all of them have the same property in resembling both in color and light a flame strong enough to reflect a luster upon neighboring objects all around they are continually in motion but this motion is various and uncertain sometimes they rise up at others they sink sometimes they disappear of a sudden and appear again in an instant in some other place commonly they keep hovering about six feet from the ground as they differ in largeness so they do in figure spreading sometimes pretty wide and then again contracting themselves sometimes breaking to all appearance in two and a very little while after meeting again into one body sometimes floating like waves and letting drop some parts like sparks out of a fire i have been assured that there is no dark night all the year round when they do not appear and in the very middle of the winter when the weather is very cold and the ground covered with snow they are observed more frequently than in the hottest summer nor does rain or snow in any wise prevent or hinder their appearance on the contrary they are more frequently observed and cast a stronger light in rainy and wet weather neither does the wind much hurt them though one should think that if it was a burning substance like common fire it should either be dissipated in windy weather or extinguished by rain and the same we might expect if it was a vapor but since they do not receive any damage from wet weather and since on the other hand it has never been observed that any thing was thereby set on fire though they must needs in moving to and fro meet with a good many combustible substances it may from thence be very reasonably inferred that they have some resemblance to that sort of phosphorus which does indeed shine in the dark but does not burn any thing as common fire does as to the appearance of this phenomenon in mountainous parts by what i have hitherto been able to learn they differ in nothing else but in largeness and all those i conversed with that saw them in the mountains agree in that they never observed any larger than the flame of an ordinary candle nor do those that live in the mountains call them cularsi which name is perhaps used only by the country people in the plains for those large ones above described one thing i will beg leave to add that according to the best informations i have been able to procure these lights are great friends to brooks and rivers being frequently observed along the banks of them perhaps because the air carries them thither more easily than any where else in all other particulars as in their motion the manner of their appearance their disappearing sometimes very suddenly their light the height they rise to and their not being affected either by rainy or cold weather they are the very same with the cularsi above described or the large will with a whisp as observed in the plains  a young gentleman a very accurate and knowing observer of natural appearances traveling some time in the month of march between eight and nine in the evening in a mountainous road not far from our lady del sarso about ten miles south of bologna as he approached a certain river called rioverde he perceived a light which shone very strongly upon some stones that lay upon the banks it seemed to be about two feet above the stones and not far from the water of the river in figure and largeness it had the appearance of a parallelopepid somewhat above a bolognese foot in length and about half a foot high its longest side lying parallel to the horizon its light was very strong insomuch that he could very plainly distinguish by it part of a neighboring hedge and the water in the river only in the east corner of it the light was pretty faint and the square figure less perfect as if cut off or darkened by the segment of a circle the gentlemans curiosity tempted him to examine it a little nearer in order to which he advanced gently toward the place but was surprised to find that insensibly it changed from a bright red to a yellowish and then to a pale color in proportion as he drew nearer and that when he came to the place itself it was quite vanished upon this he stepped back and not only saw it again but sound the farther he went from it the stronger and brighter it grew nor could he upon narrowly viewing the place where this fiery appearance was perceive the least blackness or smell or any mark of an actual fire the same observation was confirmed to me by another gentleman who frequently travels that way and who assured me that he had seen the very same light five or fix different times in spring and autumn and that he had always observed it in the very same shape and the same place which to me seems very difficult to be accounted for he told me farther that once he took particular notice of its coming out of a neighboring place and then settling itself into the figure above described how it comes to pass that the nearer one approaches to these or the like fiery appearances the fainter they grow till at last they disappear totally i freely own my self at a loss this is the substance of what i have been able to gather from several accounts relating to the ignes fatui but as to the causes of them i will not pretend to assign any i will only add that all that ever saw any of these fiery appearances agree and you may assure mr derham of it that they cast a light quite different from that of the shining flies and if you please to reflect on the several circumstances above related i believe you will find that they are not easily if at all to be solved by that hypothesis  notwithstanding this conclusion of sir tho derehams from the circumstances of his relation i am more strongly inclined to believe the light proceeds from a living animal than i was before for let any person but examine the particulars of the account sir thomas has given of the ignes fatui and try how far he can reconcile them to the appearance or notion of a mere vapor  in italy he says there are observed two kinds of these lights one on the mountains the other in the plains those in the plains are the largest the country people call them calarsi because they look upon them as birds the belly and other parts of which are resplendent like their shining flies that is their pyraustae or fireflies and c  one of these fiery appearances was often observed to move across the fields coming from one bridge to a spot of ground near the other would a fired vapor think ye be so often raised at the same place of the same size and so constantly go to the same spot and there fix it self can such an action be reconciled to the notion of a vapor is it not more agreeable to that of sense it rather looks as as if some shining animal sallied out at such a time from its lurking hole or place of retreat  another of these larger lights appeared to a gentleman as he was traveling and kept him company for a mile or more constantly moving before him how a vapor could do this is beyond my comprehension or i believe any ones else as to the different magnitudes of this light that is undoubtedly owing to the different creatures that emit it or perhaps to the size or perfection of the insect  the ignis fatuus appearing in a dark night in any weather as rain snow and the like at which times they are observed to cast a stronger light agreeeth much better with an animal than a vapor because the shining matter in an insect being enclosed can receive no damage from any kind of weather whereas a vapor would either not be exhaled or would soon be dissipated by the weight of the rain and c but an insect at such a time stands in need of more light and therefore displays its utmost  as to the ignis fatuus that appeared to the young gentleman in figure and size of a parallelopepid and c which observation was confirmed by another gentleman who frequently traveled that way that he had seen the very same light five or six different times in spring and autumn and that he had always observed it in the very same shape and the same place and that once he took particular notice of its coming out of a neighboring place and then settling itself into the figure above described let any person but duly consider the circumstances above related and as i said before try if they can be reconciled to the existence and motion of a vapor sir tho dereham freely owns himself at a loss to account for this as well he might in supposing it a mere fired vapor mistaken notions by skilful advocates are often made to appear like truth but truth itself though defended by far meaner parts generally carries a stronger conviction  postscript the following account of an ignis fatuus i had from an intimate friend an apothecary in london since the foregoing dissertation on this subject was sent to the press its confirming in a great measure some things that i delivered as conjectures only made me the more willing to insert it  himself in company with two other persons saw one of these appearances in a garden about nine of the clock in a dark night they at first imagined it some country fellow with a lanthorn till approaching within about six yards it suddenly disappeared and in a small space of time appeared in a dry field about thirty of forty yards off it disappeared as suddenly a second time and was seen again near an hundred yards off from thence it removed to a further distance and so to a further till at length they spied it in another field parted from the first by a thick hedge and so from field to field whether it went over or through the hedge could not be observed because it passed from one field to the other whilst dark  this gentleman told me he had seen this light diverse times afterward it always appeared the same without any discernable difference either in bigness or figure and that several other persons had seen it likewise  once he saw this appearance in a dry field fixed without motion the same two persons being with him that saw it in the garden the first time agreed to try how near they could get to it and having approached within ten or twelve yards one of the persons was for running to catch it which hasty proceeding made it immediately vanish it appeared again at little distances as before but seemed to pack away as it were in a fright  these observations were made at astley seven miles from worcester  finis a table of the animals and vegetables described in this volume book i of fourfooted beasts
