shadows of shakespeare i soon as the breath of rumor blew this solemn theme into the general ear to holy solitude i flew and bade the muse her sympathy prepare there closeted with thought the brain its shapeless travail wrought the season to the subject solemnly did suit days dazzling orb was wholly down pale cynthia sat upon her silver throne the obtrusions of the light were closed it seemed as silence self reposed for with the air the earth and all her sons were mute all but the wretched who like me the gentle vigils kept of sympathy with cordial awe i hailed the shading night and kissed her dusky robe which muffled thus the light ii base busy world begone begone i said to mighty garrick yield the serious mind this awful now be sacred to the dead and turn the cautious key on human kind iii the dead  ah me  what dead  here it began the florid poet felt himself a man and is he dead whose wonderworking art so often tore and touched and tuned the heart whose piercing eye intelligence could give and bid longburied beings look and live whose voice enriched the verse his shakespeare writ and gave to every word its weight of wit no sentence blemished marred no golden line but polished as he drew it from the mine whose tongue grew wanton in his shakespeares cause and gave to crowded theaters their laws whose powerful accents softened or sublime free from all frippery false pause false chime chained as to the attracting center every ear and all commanding sawyd the smile and tear is it to him the muse must pay her tributary lay for him must aching memory pour the strain must she her darling garricks loss complain iv the heart was hurt  it could no more  along each finer nerve swift shot the misery even nature shed her pensive shower the mighty mother wept alas with me the imperial goddess mourned her own decay mixed universal with our human clay and wished she could a second birth bestow on this her representative below but ah it cannot be so the rich debt was paid to poor humanity v then in the sable stole of woe all conscious of the blow pale her cheek her eye declining half obedient half repining her visage marked by many a tear poured from the crystal source of grief sincere in awful state unfortunate and great melpomene came on afflicted for her son and thrice methought the bowl she lifted high and thrice she threw on heaven the pitymoving eye then like the statue of despair stood fixed  her dagger poised in air vi now twas thalia first conceived a pain twas now she echoed back her sisters sighs again the jest the laugh the look were over her cunning was no more the comic mirth the comic pride her wit her whim with garrick died disdainful then the mask she flung to vacant air  and thus forlorn she sung and ah away with random rhyme tinsel illsuited to the time away with leisures coxcomb line the couplet quaint the stanza fine far from our verse be now the pun the point the period measured joint by joint the elaborate trade of poesy forbear  or rather paint the workings of despair scorn the vain edging able verse assumes and let dark elegy pass on in all her pompous plumes the honor of the dead in view a juster path will we pursue shakespeare himself who best our state can feel shall the sad tale in his own language tell vii the inspiring goddess mortals fancy name with all her magic armed now near me came her waving wand deep midnight deeper made with her i went  to where our garrick laid cynthia lent a feeble ray to light us on our way fancy with printless footsteps trod as if advancing toward a god methought we easy entrance found and the drear abbey walked around how fearful thus ye heavens to tread the dampsome vaults which close the dead viii but soft  as at the foot of mighty shakespeares tomb i kneel  sudden along the fretted ailes innumerous shady forms by the pale moons imperfect beam beheld  in various guise  each in the habit worn in days of nature appear and pour their potent spells upon me awed by a sight so strange aloft i stood and wist not what to do  the figures moved on near approach i knew them for the train of shakespeare in procession sad strait one by one his hallowed homage paid over garricks grave all bending ix ariel first not sightdeceiving as her custom was when in the bowels of the earth she dived or mounted on the sharp wind of the north or on the curling clouds or sunny ray nor like a spirit at ease but with step deliberate  she and her fellowministers brimful of sorrow and dismay stood mute then gazed upon the grave  then sunk in sighs x prospero the great magician next  whose high command waked sleepers in their graves and let them forth beheld the vanishing instruments of s art and spoke  have ye which are but air a touch a feeling of our loss extreme and shall not i one of his kind be kindlier our revel then is done and this our actor is no more lost is the book of conjuration  he regulated all our mystic charms  he is dead the cloudcapt towers the gorgeous palaces the solemn temples the great globe itself yea all which it inherit shall dissolve and like the baseless fabric of a vision leave not a wreck behind xi he said and passed the weird sisters then hagborn and horrid muttered their melancholy homage hoarse cold distillations of distress extreme fell down the furrows of each wintry cheek thrice paced they piteous round the hallowed earth acknowledging their lord to garricks grave bowed every swarthy she  to end their rites imaginations owl flappd her fell wing and wailing shrieked as cross the dome she slew sudden the whirring wizards disappear and horse themselves upon the viewless winds xii the gentle romeo was the third which came and oh he said turn back dull earth  ah me can i go forward when my friend is here it is even so  then i defy you stars romeo shall never more be romeo now his occupations gone  xiii the noble coriolanus was the fourth whose very shade looked martial  firm he strode and thus with roman dignity exclaimed in honor of the dead  my fame like thine demands an equal voice an equal tongue all eyes spoke of thee and the bleared sights were spectacled to see thee  the veiled dames commit the wave of white and damask in their nicely gauded cheeks to thwanton spoil of phoebus burning kisses such a pother as if that whatsoever god that tuned thy throat were slyly crept into thy human powers to give thee grace and posture often great shade the dumb men thronged to see thee and the blind to hear thee speak to thee have nobles bended as to joves statue and the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts as never were seen the like  the soldier passed xiv the fifth sad spirit that stalked by was lears mad as the vexed sea still and singing often crowned as of old by shakespeares hand with fumiter with hardocks hemlocks nettles cuckoo flowers darnel and all the idle weeds that grow in the suftaining corn  at sight of garricks tomb his wounds again bled fresh tottering he moved his words were wild you do me wrong to call me out of the grave and yet i know thee man  heaven has thee now thou were lears friend  in faith i do remember  yes we were both as stout a pair  but why this truant disposition is the greatest man so poor and forked an animal in death  off off you lendings come unbutton here  poor shade no more of that no more of that  xv the figure swift succeeding was the thanes languid and penitent  his hand he waved as twere in honor of the man whose voice did blow his base design in every ear malice was dead within him and he wept then striking thrice his bosom thus he cried oh nature how thyself thou blazondst in this thy son formed in thy prodigality to hold thy mirror up and give the time its very form and pressure  when he spoke each aged ear played truant at his tales and younger hearers were quite ravished so valuable was his discourse  yet being dead i am a man again  he rushed along xvi the gallant anthony then onward strode and paused  as erst over caesars corse  then spoke thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times here was an actor  when comes such another xvii the next a female form of percys line a race for ever noble  thus her tribute gave  thou were the very glass wherein the noblest youth did dress themselves there were no legs that practiced not thy gait there were no eyes that practiced not thy looks even those that spoke but low and tardily would turn their own perfections to abuse to seem like thee so that in speech in gait in accents and affections of delight thou were the mark and glass copy and book to fashion others and on thee as on  my harry and the sun bright honor stuck as sticks the sun in the gray vault of heaven xviii and now the melancholy jaques advanced and full of matter thus in few exclaimed why all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and this man in his time played many parts  life no more on it it is a tale told by an idiot signifying nothing xix at last with philosophic step swiftstreaming eye and arms entwined close the sacred shade of his own hamlet came long time he paused  long time around he looked then fixed his view upon the grave and spoke it is not now seems in verity it is oh what a grace was seated on that brow an eye like mars to threaten or command a combination and a form indeed where every god did seem to set his seal to give the world assurance of a man and is it come to this  but hush my heart he was a man take him for all in all we may not look upon his like aga xx while wrapped in wonder of these various shows the sovereign shade of shakespeare awful rose his manycolourd wand he waved and soon the mournful train again were engraved now was his genius even more divine and all alone he stood before his garricks shrine rest rest perturbed spirits then he said to me belongs thinestimable dead to each it is given to breathe to fall it is the fixed lot of all that soar or crawl for thee much honored friend what glories marked thy end applauding nations own thy fame and with their shakspeares blend their garricks name together then we mount on high it is ours to triumph it is the worlds to sigh the end
