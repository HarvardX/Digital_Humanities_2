soho and sold by all booksellers  m dcc xcii  united netherlands chap iv of the provinces of zealand utrecht and friesland zealand consists entirely of islands formed by the outlets of the scheld it is bounded on the north by the province of holland east by brabant south by flanders and west by the north sea its name sufficiently indicates its position it is said that these islands formerly joined and were separated from the continent only by a small channel like that which separates the island of anglesea from wales this province extends thirty miles in length and twenty in breadth its population is by no means considerable the number of inhabitants are estimated at ninety thousand the harbors in general are good and very conveniently situated for commerce  the islands on the western coasts are defended from the violence of the sea by sandhills and on the opposite side by large dykes which have a breadth of    german else at bottom and are so wide at top that two carriages may pass abreast their height is also proportionable to their thickness notwithstanding which in high tides and stormy weather the waves force a passage and even flow over them in many places  the construction of these dykes is calculated to have cost    millions of florins the annual repairs of them alone are supposed to absorb all the profits of the lands if placed in a straight line they would form a length of forty miles  though the inhabitants of the other provinces and foreigners complain of the atmosphere being thick and heavy yet no people enjoy a more confirmed state of health or look better than the natives who are born and bred up here the soil too is very fruitful and famed for its excellent wheat as likewise for its madder the cultivation of which furnishes great employment to the inhabitants of zealand it abounds also in good fruits and its rich pastures are covered with flocks of fine sheep the sea supplies them with plenty of fish particularly with oysters lobsters and muscles all of uncommon size and goodness fuel is very scarce here but this is in some measure remedied by the quantities of coal imported from england and scotland  the inhabitants are reckoned the most wealthy in all the netherlands in a great measure owing to their traffic by sea and for this indeed they have every convenience that can be desired their numerous privateers in time of war are supposed to have brought great wealth into the country  the soil of this province is extremely rich but not applied to pasturage there is much corn which appears to be fine and clean and also some large fields of madder which is a particular article of culture in this country it grows on flat lands formed into regular oblongs by small trenches and in rows about a foot asunder it is an odd straggling plant they keep it very clean by repeated hoeing and weeding for scarce a single weed is to be seen in a large field it lies three years in the ground unless the growth is very quick and then it comes up in two the root is its valuable part which when dry makes a very fine dye it is esteemed a more profitable plant than any other article of husbandry but the ground must be picked for it as it will grow only on certain kinds of soil the great point is to find out land that is both dry and fertile for no soil can be too rich for it great quantities are exported from zealand to london as the growth does not succeed well in this country notwithstanding the great endeavors that have been used to cultivate it  an acre of madder growing near middleburgh will produce one time with another from three to four hundred florins if it is in the ground for three years but then the expenses of the management of it run very high and several considerable buildings are necessary for manufacturing it but it is notwithstanding esteemed a more profitable article than either corn or grass  middleburg which is the capital of the province of zealand is one of the most considerable cities in the united provinces it is very large and well built the streets are broad regular well paved and kept so very clean and neat that they are frequently strewed over with sand and it is customary here for the women to walk about in slippers the public edifices are striking and some of them very magnificent here are twenty churches among which that called the new church is most admired for its beauty it has a very handsome cupola over it and there is great merit in the architecture merchant vessels come into the center of the city by means of a canal a mile and a half long from the sea so that middleburg enjoys a very great commerce particularly in spanish and french wines which are reckoned the staple of the place  the houses of this place are painted of different colors some red some white some green and some blue and every year as in north holland they are all fresh painted in the summer it is usual for the maids to get up every morning at   oclock to wash the outside of the windows by squirting water against them which they throw up from pails as high as the second floor and it is pleasant to see a range of industrious wenches through a whole street striving who can squirt the highest and the furthest  flushing the town of next notice in this province was famous some years since for the immense contraband trade that was carried on with this country in teas and brandies and to which the commutationact was a death blow several of the dutch men of war are laid up here and its harbor is capable of holding  0 or  0 sail of the line it lies three miles from middleburg to which there is a paved road lined with trees  the inhabitants of middleburg frequently make excursions to this place to which there are stagecoaches going and coming at certain hours of the day the town is but a small one merely surrounding the harbor over which there is a bridge of boats that rises and falls with the tide  this was one of the cautionary towns which the states general put into the hands of queen elizabeth for defraying the expenses of this nation in defending them against the king of spain it was afterward restored to them by king james when under his difficulties for a very small part of the sum which remained due by them to england this is one of the three places which charles v advised his son philip ii to preserve with great care the zealanders are in general very much attached to the orange family  the women in the island of walcheren are clad for the most part in red cloth and wear straw hats when any one dies there if it is a man they lay a great bundle at his door if a child a little one if a male it is put on the right side if it is a female on the left when a woman is brought to bed they give notice of what sex the child is to the neighborhood by tying a piece of lawn to the knocker of the door made up in the shape of a puppet and representing the sex of the newborn child  the province of utrecht is almost entirely environed by those of holland and guelderland it is esteemed one of the pleasantest and most healthful of the united netherlands for here we may be said to tread on firm ground whereas the maritime provinces are nothing but bogs rendered habitable by incredible labor and industry it is about five and twenty miles in length and nearly as much in breadth  utrecht the capital of this province stands in a delightful fine corn country on the river rhine which here divides into two branches it lies about twentyfive miles southeast of amsterdam and as far northeast from rotterdam the origin of this city has never been traced out nor the precise epoch of its being built it is known however to have taken its rise from one of those fortresses which the romans built when they conquered this country as winter quarters for their legions but whether by julius caesar or by drusus is uncertain it is rather conjectured to have been begun by drusus because the castle of utrecht went formerly by the name of antonia who was the wife of drusus this is one of the first cities in the united provinces and as it stands in an healthful air is much resorted to by persons of distinction who have fine houses here it is spacious and very populous the chief streets which are regular and well built are cut through with two canals called the new gracht and the vaert which run through the whole city having no fewer than thirtyfive bridges over them utrecht is larger than the hague and next to it is the principal residence of the nobility and people of fashion who live on their fortunes  the cathedral is in ruins nor are there any public buildings that deserve notice the steeple however of this church is one of the highest in holland and from the top of it may be seen an extensive prospect over five of the seven provinces and a great way further toward cleve in germany in a clear day more than fifty walled towns may be seen not above a days journey from this city among other pious curiosities they show in one of the churches a shift without any seam said to have been worn by the virgin mary  one of the most agreeable sights here is what they call their mall similar to the mall in st jamess park as it formerly stood about half as long and half its breath and consists of some parrallel walks regularly planted with lime trees but that in the middle is properly the mall with a ring at the end and enclosed with wooden kirbs to keep in the ball it being the ground for a dutch game here the best company in utrecht parade backward and forwards especially on sunday evenings in the summer  utrecht being on the side of two hills with a valley between one canal runs west into the city in this valley and low houses are built on each bank so as that their tops are on a level with the streets on both sides above and there is an arched way under one of the streets by which carts pass to this canal as if going into a vault the sides of the canal above the houses on its banks are defended by a parapet wall  the environs of this city are very pleasant being full of gardens orchards canals and walks but the soil is too sandy for the rich verdure of meadows and therefore there are arable lands very near the city  the fortifications are not strong by which means in      the french took it without firing a gun they kept it in their possession near a couple of years and were preparing to build a citadel here when the germans coming to the assistance of the dutch they were obliged to retire but not without having first levied a heavy contribution on the inhabitants to the amount of  00000 pounds in this city the peace in      was concluded between france england portugal prussia savoy and holland and here the union of the seven provinces was begun in       their university which was at first only a public school and founded in      is now in a very flourishing situation it is very much frequented by germans and by some english who come here for the sake of education and degrees which are to be obtained here sooner than in england the students wear their ordinary dress and board in the town there being scarce any endowed colleges in holland where they live together in societies as they do in our english universities  in the neighborhood of utrecht is the village of zeyst which strangers generally visit on account of the neatness of the place and the great harmony in which the inhabitants live together who are a society of people termed moravians that form a separate community from the rest of their neighbors this sect which made a great noise in europe some years ago had its origin in moravia as far back as the fifteenth century under the title of unitas fratrum or the united brethren in the sixteenth century they had upwards of  00 places of worship but not being permitted to exercise the function of their religion openly in moravia and bohemia where were their principal establishments they took refuge in the territories of the count de zinzendorf who openly espoused their cause and their sect has now expanded itself in all parts of europe and even in africa and america  the brethren have adopted the augsburg confession of faith in their synods any minister whether he be a lutheran a calvinist or a moravian may administer the sacrament among them without separating himself from the particular sect to which he belongs  their service does not last above three quarters of an hour they sing lutheran hymns read one or more chapters of the bible and preach their church music is the organ the violin and the french horn when the clergymen administer the sacrament they are dressed in long white garments tied round with red ribbon and a violet colored cap on their head they keep those festivals observed in the protestant church besides some few of their own  they bury their dead in tombs made on purpose and on easter sunday at sunrise they go in procession to their burying grounds which are not as in other places distinguished to the sight but places of repose ornamented and cultivated like pleasant gardens  what they call their communities are handsome buildings inhabited only by themselves one of them louis xiv resided in during his stay in the province of utrecht they are divided into different classes which they call choirs their classes are the unmarried men the unmarried women the married persons the widowers and the widows  these latter are distinguished by a white ribbon the unmarried women wear a pale red and the girls a deep colored red the married women a blue each class has its habitation apart under inspectors of their own sex except the married people who live by themselves the superiors of these communities can inflict no punishment besides excomunication and expulsion from the society  the finances of the society consist in a voluntary contribution every three months every member contributes only what he thinks proper without any question being asked him yet this confidence is not abused for the fund of the society is very great and here let it be observed that the term brethren is not a mere name they perform very scrupulously all the duties of brethren  this sect is composed chiefly of artists yet those who are in a much more elevated station frequently become members of it but every thing is so well regulated that the rich are not to insult over the poor equality is the grand principle which regulates all their actions the strongest arm assists the weakest the most industrious administers with his talents to the assistance of those toward whom heaven has been less bountiful violence and oppression do not snatch away the substance of the unfortunate the widows and the orphans  a brother of the unity can only marry a sister of the unity else he renounces the society he has not even the liberty to marry whom he pleases of the society he must take the wife they give him an american woman sometimes marries a german and both are ordered off for asia or some other place in other respects they conform in their marriages to the customs of the country where they live it is considered as a kind of disgrace to live single  amersfort the second town of the province fifteen miles northeast of utrecht stands in a fruitful country abounding in corn and pastureground at this port are shipped all the goods brought out of germany by the hessian wagons which are consigned to amsterdam but what is most remarkable in this neighborhood there is a hunting seat of the late king william abounding in game which stands in a forest near ten miles in length and five in breadth  friesland is so called from the frisons an ancient martial people who formerly possessed most of the territory of the united provinces and even some parts of germany it is bounded by the german ocean on the north by groningen on the east overyssel on the south and the zuydersea on the west its extent is about forty miles from north to south and twentyfive from east to west  friesland in its air and soil very much resembles holland especially in the northwest part which is lower than the sea and is particularly remarkable for its fine pastures in which besides excellent oxen cows and sheep are numerous breeds of large horses which are in very great esteem and are exported to germany and other countries in the more elevated parts are good corn lands and the wheat produced in them is very much admired for the fineness of the ears and its white flour the friesland peace have likewise an agreeable taste superior to most others  their best and almost their only firing is turf which burns as white and gives as good a heat as wood these turf meadows it is said being mixed with a bituminous matter have taken fire at different times and burnt up the country for several leagues  the inhabitants for want of sandhills along the sea coast are under the necessity of securing themselves against the sea by dykes when these dykes were repaired at the expense of the proprietors of estates bordering upon them they were built very low and frequently suffered to go so much to decay as to be unable to withstand the impetuosity of the waves driven against them by a northwest wind and from the breaches that have been made the whole country has been frequently laid under water and great numbers of persons perished not to mention the loss of their cattle in order to preserve themselves as much as possible when under these calamities the inhabitants raised several eminences from twenty to twentyfive feet high and of considerable circumference to which unless they were intercepted by the rapidity of the inundations they betook themselves with their cattle and household furniture and remained there till the flood had subsided  these eminences at first were called waerd or werd afterward terp in process of time houses or rather whole villages and towns were built on these mounts and hence it is that the names of many places in friesland end in werd and terp these dykes however are now constructed at the public expense and being consequently made higher and wider the eruptions of the sea are less frequent  in the number of the canals with which it is intersected freisland may vie with holland these canals as in holland serve not only for carrying the superfluous waters into the sea but for the facility of commerce  the inhabitants still retain that strong passion for liberty which distinguished their ancestors together with their old customs and manners of living even to the ancient frison dialect and accent which make their language as unintelligible to the rest of the dutch as the welsh language is in england  the people of this province are for the most part martially inclined and choose to follow the camp rather than apply themselves to trade their nobility and gentry in particular are very averse to marry into the families of merchants or mechanics and delight in dress and magnificent equipage more than their southern neighbors in their fashions the better class of people follow the french but in their hospitality and convivial mode of living the germans the lower class dress as do the peasants in guelderland  friesland however is not without some manufactures and is more particularly famous for its linen ones which are esteemed the finest in europe the price at prime cost being no less than twelve dutch guilders an ell  though the majority of the inhabitants are calvinists yet there are a great many catholics and still more of the mennonites in this province this is the less to be wondered at as menno simon from whom they derive their name first propagated his doctrines in this province  leuwarden which is the capital of the province is surrounded with some slight fortifications its streets are regular well built and kept very clean and in some part of it there are canals as in the towns of the other provinces with rows of trees it was formerly the residence of the stadtholder who has a palace here which however contains nothing in it worthy of of being noticed the states still continue to assemble here there was formerly a bay extending from the north sea up to this city but being gradually dried up the ground has been cultivated and built upon there is likewise a canal from this place to dockum a town which is only remarkable for having a bridge lofty enough to admit ships sailing under it full masted  the southeast part of this province is but poor land much of it sandy and not so well inhabited as the rest their farmers are in general reckoned good ones and though not equal to the best in flanders yet they cultivate several articles in greater perfection than in that famous territory particularly carrots and turnips in manufactures the province of holland exceeds them much though they possess some considerable fabrics of woollen cloths besides their famous one of linens which we have already noticed  chap v of the provinces of overyssel groningen guelderland etc the province of overyssel is bounded by groningen on the north by munster on the east by guelderland on the south and by the zuydersea on the west it extends near sixty miles in length and forty in breadth till the year    0 it made part of the province of utrecht and in ancient times it composed part of friesland this country is by no means peopled in proportion to its extent the soil is for the most part marshy and yields nothing but turf but along the yssel there is some very good corn land and some pasture ground but it falls far short of the richness of the pastures in the other provinces and instead of being the property of particular persons belongs in common to the inhabitants of the nearest villages it is also a fine sporting country the climate resembles that of westphalia very much on which it borders and like that part of germany it has very extensive commons which produce little or nothing  the nobility of this province are more numerous than any other and a nobleman in order to be admitted into the assembly of his class must not only prove his descent and that he is of the calvinist religion but likewise show that he is twentyfour years of age and that he has an estate in the province sufficient to qualify him to be summoned to the assembly that is to say of   000 guilders any nobleman likewise who is in the army and is possessed of these qualifications is capable of being a member of the regency provided he be not below the rank of captain but when military affairs come into consideration he must quit the assembly  the principal towns in this province are deventer campen and zwoll  the country about deventer is rich and well cultivated but there are some marsh lands and sandytracks in it the city carries a tolerable appearance of trade though nothing in comparison of what it possessed when it was a hanse town there are many people of fortune here who make it their residence which renders the town cheerful and the more agreeable to strangers but the public buildings have nothing in them deserving notice though strangers are shown an uncommon old tower of great antiquity called the tower of nuremberg built with brick and stone the walls of which are near twenty feet thick a remarkable fortification before the invention of that destructive compound with saltpeter in this city is brewed an excellent beer of which great quantities are exported and the deventer cakes are celebrated all over these provinces  zwoll was anciently a hanse town this was the birthplace of the celebrated thomas a kempis it is a very considerable city and lies between two rivers a branch of one of which runs through the town the streets are regular and well built and there are several public edifices that will catch the attention of a stranger the fortifications are its greatest ornament from being planted all round with trees it is also a very strong place being surrounded both with a wall and ramparts strengthened by large and good bastions and several outworks exclusive of three forts near the yssel to the southwest which communicate with each other and with the town by strong lines the view of erecting these forts in case of a siege was to secure to the town the means of receiving reinforcements from gelderland without the kampen saen and dieser gates are very handsome suburbs  campen has nothing to recommend it but a wooden bridge over the yssel of a very curious structure being     feet in breadth and  0 broad and built on piles which are at so great a distance from each other that the bridge seems suspended in the air though according to the modern system of fortification this town may not be ranked among the fortresses yet on an emergency they can lay all the country round under water  the province of groningen is bounded on the north by the german ocean on the east by emden and on the south by overyssel it extends thirty miles in length from east to west and about twenty from north to south  in air and soil it bears a very near affinity with friesland the land for the most part lies low and abounds in fine pastures though there is some arable land which says marshal seemed well managed for the crops were clean and the fallows well tilled on the south side of the province toward drenthe the ground is heathy sandy and interspersed with forests the whole country is exceedingly well peopled the people seem remarkably cheerful and happy this happiness and content among the lower classes makes traveling very agreeable for nothing is so miserably irksome as moving through a country whose inhabitants are oppressed with poverty and rags  these great distinctions are owing to variations of government arbitrary power spreads nothing but poverty and misery while a free government makes all the people happy who live under it all the parts of holland are much more heavily taxed than any country in europe where arbitrary power reigns that is a given number of people pay more to the state and yet the individuals are less oppressed and more wealthy  absolute power impoverishes so heavily that the people have nothing to pay the money torn from them by irregularity and private oppression amounts to infinitely more than all the wealth which goes into the monarchs coffers the king tyrannizes over the nobility the nobility over the gentry the gentry over the tradesmen and all of them combine to fleece and oppress the countrymen in such a system from whence can property come nothing can exist with security but estates in land for labor industry and ingenuity can only create an income sufficient to pay heavy taxes as wealth therefore is so much the idol and pursuit of all the monarchs in europe it is strange that some scheming head has not fallen upon the means of qualifying the effects of arbitrary power for an increase of their subjects wealth  the great objects that a traveller especially one who proposes to publish the result of his travels ought to attend to are those which have the greatest probability of being useful to his country it is on this principle we occasionally enter into their mode of agriculture as well as their police and other circumstances and it is for the same reason we shall extract the following conversation with a farmer on the eastern part of this province from marshal on the management of his land  this mans farm consisted of   0 acres in which were included pasture and arable land as well as marsh and a sandy waste besides an extensive right of common for which he paid after the rate of six florins an acre in walking over a piece of poor sandy ground with him i enquired whether he could not improve that soil he answered it was already very valuable for the fallow year yielded him without any tillage a great crop of fern this appeared strange that plant being represented in england as a pernicious weed but he explained himself by saying that this fern served him in the most ample manner for littering down his cattle in their winter stalls by which means this piece of sandy land yielded a very large quantity of manure for his better lands and at the same time furnished better litter for his cattle than straw which they wanted in feeding upon being told that our farmers kept their cattle in the field during the winter as well as the summer he seemed surprised and said all the cattle in his country both old and young and of all sorts were regularly kept in house through the winter upon my observing says marshal that this must prove an expensive management he replied no but that if it was so it was absolutely necessary first for the good of the cattle which he asserted would be so pinched by the frost in winter that twice the quantity of food would be insufficient to keep them in heart and such beasts as were very tender he thought would not outlive the winter in the fields but says the old man how is your dung raised if the cattle in england are kept all the winter in the fields by keeping our cattle housed says he we not only preserve them in good health but also raise a large quantity of manure with which we improve those fields that will probably pay the best for it we very commonly said he feed the cattle with hay turnips and winter cabbage and litter them down at the same time with straw but those among us who have fern on our lands give the straw to our cattle of inferior value and litter all sorts with fern which we find an improvement of the most valuable kind for it enables us to substitute straw as food instead of hay to great part of our stock  another material point is the value of dung we find from experience that fern makes better manure than straw and that two loads of dung made with fern are equal in value to three made with straw fern manure will likewise last much longer in the soil than straw this information says marshal i considered as very valuable for i remember that in england a great deal of fern grows on very extensive commons and that no use whatever is made of it being left to rot in the commons and warrens as if it was impossible to turn it to any account  this very intelligent farmer assured me he was the more attentive to this application of his fern because he found the goodness of his crops depended entirely on the quantities of such manure and that he should not be able to make any advantage of his farm if he neglected raising as much dung as possible in winter he not only made use of his fern for this purpose but he likewise procured a vast quantity of rushes nd flags to the amount of several wagon loads from a marshy bit of land he had which was so much overflowed that no cattle could get at it except for about two months in the height of summer these he applies to the same use as his fern that is for littering down his cattle in which he finds an equal advantage another circumstance he made me acquainted with which it may not be amiss to mention was a method he had in the management of his dung when he litters his cattle down with fern or rushes he strewed sand among it in pretty large quantities this he said would increase the quantity of manure and also the quality of it by absorbing all the urine and that it was not of the least prejudice to the cattle  his management of sheep is exactly on the same plan for instead of folding them in the fields as is the custom in england he all the winter folds them near his barn and litters them down in the same manner as he does his cows the old man observing me very attentive to his conversation extended his walk to show me his crops which seemed to be very good he had fields of most sorts of common grain and one or two of buck wheat which he said was very profitable the only peculiar one not known in the fields of england was carrots he had a long field of them in which he had a great number of women and children weeding this be said was the most profitable crop on his farm  groningen the capital of this province is very handsome and a remarkably regular built city the streets cross each other at right angles having numerous houses that make a very good appearance and the public buildings add much to the beauty of the place it is surrounded with a fortification which the inhabitants reckon very strong principally because the outworks were planned by cohorn st martins church is worth seeing they have a remarkable organ in it which is shown to strangers and they conduct them to the top of the steeple from whence there is a very extensive prospect over the adjacent country and well worth viewing from its being a country chiefly of rich land intersected with canals the great square is remarkably handsome regularly laid out and well built here also though groningen is an inland place is a beautiful harbor for ships well fenced with quays whereon is a good appearance of business the canal that brings up these ships is a very noble one there being other canals which branch every way from hence the town carries on a good trade with all the neighboring countries and pretty far into germany upon the whole says marshal i have not since my arrival in holland seen a place that pleased me better  the province of guelderland is bounded by the zuydersea to the north by brabant on the south by munster on the east and the province of holland on the west its extent is about fifty miles from north to south and nearly as much from east to west this province is usually subdivided into three lesser districts the veluve the betuwe or ancient batavia and the county of zutphen the air of this province is for the most part better than in any of the rest and the soil in general good though the middle part of the veluve consists of sandhills heath and furze the county of zutphen is also heathy but there is such a plenty of apples pears and cherries as to supply all the other provinces with their fruits though this province has precedence of all the others because it was decorated with the title of duchy at the time of the union yet it is at present one of the least important of any of them  it bears great resemblance to that part of germany with which it lies contiguous except in the state of slavery and misery of the peasants in no part of the united netherlands do we see the peasants groaning under the weight of their burdens and earning a miserable subsistence with the sweat of their brows the peasants in holland are always at their ease and oftentimes rich they frequently do not deign to reap their own corn but leave this task to some inferior germans who come into these provinces ready to undertake any work  the republican peasant is well clothed his dress ornamented with little gold or silver buttons to his coat and waistcoat all the way down placed close to each other like those on the garment of a romish priest with immense silver buttons on the waistband of his trowsers enormous silver buckles to his shoes and a large silver watch to show the hour he has also a gold button or clasp at his neck before and garter buckles of the same metal many of them drive about in their cabriolets and the height of their pleasure is to go full trot at the risk of the unfortunate foot passengers who happen to be in their way to whom they pay no regard  the female peasants whose taste of dress is different in different provinces deck themselves out with bits of gold in their hair and a kind of gold temple springs that press the temples from behind as our temple spectacles do from before and wear a gold or diamond cross hung round the neck and pendant on their bosom  with all these ornaments their dress appears ridiculous and without taste for dress ever appears ridiculous when it is not suitable to the station of the wearer with all these appearances of splendour their repasts are economical in the extreme some of their peasants even eat their meals without any drink and wait till they have their tea before they take any thing to quench their thirst  nimeguen is a large and considerable city strongly fortified being considered as one of the keys of the united provinces and is the capital of that of guelderland it is built in the form of a crescent on five small hills by the river side and is very populous having several manufactures that are flourishing in st stephens church is a very fine monument of catharine of bourbon wife to adolph vii duke of guelder the stadthouse is a considerable edifice but has nothing elegant in it from the old castle there is a very beautiful prospect of the adjacent country  within this castle are most delightful walks planted with several rows of lime trees this place is much noted for that famous treaty of peace negociated between france and the confederates in      and      called the treaty of nimeguen and of which sir william temple has left so excellent an account in   0  marshal bouflers formed a design of seizing this place as being at that time destitute of a garrison but the dutch general the earl of athlone made such expedition to its relief that the marshals scheme was frustrated  arnheim is another fine city extremely well built with several beautiful streets and delightfully situated on the banks of the rhine about ten miles to the north of nimeguen it lies at the foot of the veluve hills about two miles from the place where the yssel and the rhine divide their streams over the latter of these rivers it has a bridge of boats leading to the veluve and before the rhine gate is a commodious harbor of a quadrangular form the fortifications on the land side were considerably enlarged in   0  by that skilful engineer general cohorn who also enclosed within a strong line an eminence to the west of the town which in case of a siege might have been a great annoyance to it but is now capable of containing a small camp for its defense the walls are delightfully planted with lime trees and may be walked round with ease in an hour and an half  it is made the winter residence of many persons of fortune and distinction who spend the summer on their estates in the veluve the place is lively having a greater air of cheerfulness and ease than most of those that are to be met with in holland i here was treated well says marshal and served with a table that almost deserved the epithet of elegant and yet the expense was not extravagant  from this place says he i made an excursion to see loo the famous favorite seat of king william the whole is a vile country all heaths and forests and in the midst of which stands the palace it contains nothing to attract the admiration of an englishman who has seen the fine buildings of his own country the gardens are what the dutch most admire but these are quite in the old style with waterworks basins and regular cascades but they show you the shady walks with a kind of exultation as if none such were to be met with anywhere else they are indeed very well planted and the trees are very large but all is clipped and regular this was the seat where king william used always to retire when the affairs of state would permit him the whole country round abounding in game west of loo lies adel lake noted for its inexhaustible breed of fish  zutphen is situated in the midst of drained fens but is yet reckoned by the inhabitants to have a very wholesome air it is a large well built town and strongly fortified the public buildings are handsome and deserve notice particularly a bridge over the berkel the old church is a fine building and the steeple very high all the towns in holland have their stadthouses as well as amsterdam but many of them are very mean edifices like our town halls in english corporation towns which are generally heaps of rubbish this of zutphen however deserves notice the ruins of a palace are still to be seen here which according to the tradition of the place belonged to the ancient counts of zutphen and near it there is a high brick tower of a pyramidal form one of the greatest ornaments to the city the monasteries which were formerly here are part of them demolished and the rest converted into hospitals or other secular uses there are several pleasant walks particularly on the ramparts which like all the others in this country are planted with trees the suburbs for the most part consist of little pleasurehouses with small gardens elegantly laid out in the dutch taste it was formrely a hansetown like most of the towns in this province it was taken by the french in      most of the country of zutphen and a great part of guelderland consist either of marshes heaths or but half improved lands indeed the people are very unequally distributed the province of holland is full of cities and towns and every inch cultivated but these parts being much more out of the way of trade are not so thronged with people  chap xi generalite lands by the generalite lands is meant that part of the netherlands which the seven united provinces have subdued by force of arms and which have been solemnly ceded to them by treaties and conventions this appellation was given to them on account of their belonging to the united provinces in general the nobility and towns of these countries have frequently solicited to be declared members of the state and to be permitted to vote as a distinct province in the assemblies of the states general but have as often met with a repulse they retain however all the rights and privileges which they enjoyed when they came under the power of the republic the hereditary stadtholder of the united provinces is likewise governorgeneral over all these countries the established religion in these countries is the calvinist as depending upon the states general but the catholics being much more numerous they are likewise permitted an entire freedom in public worship processions and other open solemnities excepted  boisleduc which is situated in this district of the united provinces is one of the grand frontiers of holland it is extremely well fortified by art and still better by nature this fortress is situated on a rising ground in the middle of an extensive marsh through which there would be no possibility of approaching the place if there were not causeways made through the marsh and these are strongly fortified by redoubts the town is five miles in circumference and seated on the confluence of the three rivers domel aa and drese from this place passageboats go regularly to rotterdam as our boats go from london to gravesend the ditches round this place are filled by the waters of the rivers which contribute much to its strength and forms several very fine canals which run through the heart of the city over these there are fifty stone bridges ten good streets center in the principal square which has a fine effect but this square being surrounded by timber buildings gives it a mean appearance  as to public buildings the church of st john is a very noble one but the clock which is shown with much ostentation has nothing in it very striking the stadthouse is a handsome edifice raised on the plan of that of amsterdam but on a much smaller scale here are several very flourishing manufactures particularly in the linen and woollen way and some of knives and other hardware and also of needles the linen trade is not so flourishing as formerly but even this has no reason to complain the country for some miles to the southeast of this town has many extensive tracks of waste land which would answer the expense of cultivation but the inhabitants do not in general seem attentive to this business notwithstanding the success that some individuals have met with who have attempted it  breda deserves the travellers attention it is large populous and well built and one of the strongest towns in holland the fortifications are very regular and kept in excellent repair the situation of the place is low for the sea can be let into the ditches and from thence over most of the country which must render an armys access to it very difficult the whole barony and town comprehending    villages belong to the prince of orange who is the sovereign and has a castle which was rebuilt here by the late king william the river mersk running round like a moat and a small park with some fine gardens  the great church is a magnificent structure and adorned with several beautiful monuments two of which are of black and white marble and of such curious workmanship that sculptors have come from rome on purpose to view them that of anglebert ii count of nassau who died in   0  is reckoned inimitable being a perfect copy of nature and adorned with statues and inscriptions suitable to the occasion the spire of this church is very handsome and     feet high but scarce any of the other public buildings are worth notice  the environs of this city are very pleasant at the distance of about a couple of miles from this town at different angles are three delightful woods which are cut through in all parts into walks and vistas particularly the liesbosch which is the finest of the three  in      the treaty so often mentioned in history between england france and holland was concluded in this place under the mediation of the king of sweden this place is likewise famous for the treaty negotiated here to restore charles ii to his throne and for the manifesto that was issued hence to his subjects in great britain  bergenopzoom has long been celebrated as a strong fortress its wall which is about four miles in circumference is defended by five bastions and ten horn works the adjacent country can also be laid under water and as long as zealand continues clear of enemies any supplies or reinforcements may be thrown into it by means of the scheld the city is large and the streets regular the church and the palace were fine buildings before the siege in      the large square is very handsome but the fortifications are the principal objects in it the dukes of parma and spinola found this place too strong notwithstanding the great force they brought against it which occasioned the title of the virgin fortress to be given to it as being impregnable for such it was considered till marshal lovendahl came before it who took it in      after a two months siege by surprise  it stands in the midst of marshes so that every advantage of situation is united with those of cohorn who was long employed to construct whatever works he thought necessary to make it as strong as possible a canal keeps open the communication with the sea and to defend this canal there are redoubts forts palisadoes etc without number and a village strongly fortified in the midst in short no expense has been spared to render it impregnable and it is the general opinion in holland that it really is so and that the french would never have taken it with their cannon had they not loaded them with golden balls  there is a curious tower in this city which gradually grows wider toward the top the least breath of wind will put it in motion so that it appears to be tumbling down it formerly terminated by an arrow built in the same direction but this the count de auvergne pulled down at the request of the inhabitants they would gladly have seen the whole tower demolished which he would not consent to but made a platform on the top which he surrounded with a balustrade a considerable trade is carried on in this place in anchovies which are got out of the scheld  the states general keep a large garrison in this city and the governor is always a person of distinguished reputation  maestricht is one of the most ancient and remarkable cities in the netherlands it lies on the maese by which it is divided into two parts joined to each other by a grand stone bridge pollnitz relates that a young french nobleman of high rank once leaped over this bridge on horseback into the maese as a proof of his love for his mistress he was it seems urging the warmth of his passion whilst one day riding by the side of her carriage when she told him there was not a word of truth in what he said and that she would venture a wager he did not love her enough to leap his horse into the river he accepted the wager and won it at the risk of his life for he was so fortunate to keep his feet firm in the stirrups and his horse carried him safe to shore but after he had taken this dangerous leap reflecting on her capricious humor he broke off his courtship which was the least she deserved  the circumference of maestricht is about four miles and the fortifications which are in the modern way may be reckoned among the best in europe the great market place and other squares are very beautiful the streets broad and the buildings in general make a handsome appearance  the townhouse is a magnificent structure all of free stone and has one of the finest towers or steeples in the low countries it has also a good library both of printed books and manuscripts and other curiosities worth a travellers attention as for the neighboring country it abounds with game and there is scarce a town in europe where provisions in general and all the conveniences of life may be had cheaper than at maestricht it is a pleasant voyage down the river here from liege maestricht is not only one of the strongest fortresses belonging to the republic but likewise one of the principal keys on the maese some defects having been observed in the outworks william iv about four weeks before his death took a survey of them and a plan was formed for their removal its cloth manufactory which was formerly so considerable is now gone to decay  the sovereignty of the town belongs jointly to the states general and the bishop of liege but the former alone garrison it and are likewise possessed of the sole power over the convents and ecclesiastics in general by virtue of which they grant privileges and immunities of all kinds in other respects the town is under the joint government of the states and the bishop and the townsmen are divided into two departments each electing half the magistracy which consists of an equal number of calvinists brabanters and papists the latter are natives of the bishopric of liege  about two musket shots from this place stands the st petersburg being much higher than the town and having been very detrimental to it in a former siege in   0  the states general caused a very strong fort to be built on it under the name of st peters fort this fort lying within the territory of liege the bishop complained loudly of their procedure but in      the affair was accommodated on the hill is an excellent horizontal quarry with an entrance to it close by the maese so that carts go in and unload at the banks of the river within this quarry are long horizontal passages supported by innumerable square pillars which are every where twenty feet high and in many places more it has several ventholes cut in it as also some small reservoirs of water and in war time it is a safe retreat for the country people who being acquainted with all its meandrings secure their cattle and valuable effects in this subterranean repository which affords convenient room for  0000 men ellis who went into the quarry says it is more wonderful than has been described it is three leagues or nine miles in length and one league or three miles broad and capable of sheltering  00000 men that its excessive coldness cost him a fit of the ague and that the stone dug from it is like our kettling stone a stranger who should visit it without an experienced guide would be in danger not only of bewildering himself or of stumbling against the corners of the pillars but likewise of being suddenly shot by villains lurking in it the upper part of the hill is good corn land and on the side toward the maese stands the monastery of slavante  this city revolted from spain about the year    0 and was besieged by the duke of parma in      when after a very brave defense it was surprised in the night and the inhabitants were treated with great severity it was taken by the prince of orange in      after an obstinate siege of above two months and from that time it continued in the hands of the dutch till      when it was taken by the french king in person after thirteen days open trenches  the siege of maestricht in      by william prince of orange afterward king of england is very memorable the garrison consisted of  000 men and the besiegers were  0000 who carried on their attacks with such intrepidity for three weeks that it was generally supposed the place would at last be taken during this siege the english gave signal proofs of their valor but marshal schomberg advancing to the relief of the city with a superior force and the reinforcements which had been promised him from germany not arriving the prince was obliged to rise from before the place after fiftytwo days open trenches and the loss of  000 men this city however did not continue long in the hands of the french being restored to the states of holland by the treaty of nimeguen in      in whose possession it has ever since remained  sluys termed in flanders l ecluse is the largest town in all that part of the country belonging to the states general it is of considerable circumference but the greatest part is taken up with gardens and bleaching grounds it is a place of great consequence being strongly fortified and the most commodious part in flanders exclusive of its strong fortifications the country round it to the south and southwest may be laid under water but the north side being higher it has a double wall on that part being fenced by the zwin a morass which every flood is under water zwin is the name of the bay on which this city stands at its mouth it is called the horsemarket from the supposed resemblance its roaring bears in stormy weather to the noise of a market filled with those animals all the efforts of an enemy cannot hinder its communication with the sea by which it can receive all necessary supplies and reinforcements its air however is so unhealthy an inconvenience common to it with all the towns in this part of flanders that the garrison is changed every year  there is an old canal between sluys and bruges but since the dutch have had possession of sluys and consequently able whenever they please to obstruct the communication of bruges with the sea a navigable canal has been cut between that city and ostend  chap xii of their manners and customs the climate in all countries has such an effect upon the inhabitants that some striking and distinguishing marks will be found in their characters in all ages tacitus who was so accurate an observer of men and manners has given many striking touches of character in his accounts of the ancient germans gauls and belgi that are almost as applicable to the present french germans and dutch as they were to those ancient nations although the invasions of the northern kingdoms on the destruction of the roman empire made such a total change in all the provinces of the empire in arts manners languages opinions and other circumstances in a word a new people appeared in italy france england germany and holland nothing therefore can be a greater proof of the influence of climate on the inhabitants of a country than to find the present people of those countries bear in many particulars a striking resemblance to the ancient inhabitants  but these strong national characters which form the great distinction between different nations are not the objects to expatiate on since their being so strong is alone a sufficient proof that the authors of preceding ages have given us as just accounts as any in the present can do sir william temple has given us as judicious and satisfactory an account of the dutch in the last ages as can be met with in any nation indeed that writer was possessed of a truer philosophic spirit than most of the authors of his age and country all his works are equal proofs of penetration integrity and reflection  if we form an idea of the dutch in the last age from his writings and those of some other authors of credit we shall find a people emerging from a most consummate national frugality and beginning to enjoy the wealth they had been heaping together for two centuries but in that gradual change even luxury was parsimonious it made none of those gigantic strides with which it overwhelms monarchies its approaches were proportioned to the equality of a republican government  in the present age the dutch are very much changed luxury has made as great a progress as it can make in any country that is not under a monarchical government and in which the landed estates are not very considerable  holland is one of those countries which contains no persons of large landed property the most considerable part of the people are engaged in some trade or lucrative profession they hardly know what a landed interest means so that the number of idle persons who are rich consist almost entirely of people in office the military and foreigners hence arises that moderate degree of luxury found in the principal cities particularly the hague which is the great place of dissipation in london and paris there is an immense expense lavished upon every art and every means of enjoyment in these cities may be seen costly operas splendid theaters academies exhibitions and such a variety of diversions as would puzzle an inhabitant to name them all every day rears new temples of pleasure each more costly than the former but at the hague it is the very reverse they are expensive in concerts and private assemblies but even in these the cities above mentioned far exceed them there is more expense lavished in concerts at london in one spring than at the hague in a couple of years  in their edifices the people of large fortune in holland are expensive but not magnificent they build great houses with immense apartments but compared with the rooms of our english palaces they are but barns and more deficient in the article of fitting up and finishing than can well be conceived in the palaces of london and those which ornament our counties there is to be found every exertion of taste and magnificence in holland the furniture is what would be called handsome in england but not to be named with that which ornaments the houses of our nobility and rich gentry here however let it be observed that the national cleanliness of the dutch though by no means carried to that excess which the common people delight in renders their apartments much more pleasing than those in italy and france which are ornamented in the most superb taste  thus we find in the above articles there is no comparison in point of expense between holland and the great kingdoms of europe it must not however be taken for granted that every thing is conducted in holland in a mean style or in the manner of the last age on the contrary they are all in a much more elegant taste great improvements have been made in all a plainness and simplicity were found in all these and a humility but now a desire of making a figure is prevalent among them which shows they want nothing but the wealth to equal the greatest exertions of our richest nobles  the principal expense of the dutch is their table for in their entertainments their tables are spread in a most elegant and plenteous manner and their wines are much more numerous than is common in france or england with persons of equal or even of superior fortune four courses and a rich desert are often seen at the tables of persons whose income does not exceed  000l a year and their courses are not like ours of eight or ten dishes only but of twentyfive or thirty plate is more common at the hague than might be imagined for many of their rich nobility and others retired from business or from office eat off very superb services  the number of their domestics is not in general equal to those of persons of the same fortune in france or england in the latter country we have within these few years discontinued the abominable custom of suffering them to receive vails but in france says marshal the custom still continues and in holland i have feed says he no less than seven attendants at a single dinner  they make great feasts in holland on certain occasions such as weddings the birth of a son and heir the arrival of a son or friend from the east indies etc in which they exhaust every species of luxury their fortunes will allow them to indulge in i was present says the above author at one of these feasts at amsterdam where there were eight tables four times covered and each course above a hundred dishes  in england people of large fortune divide their time between london and the country their house in london and their seat in the country form a perfect contrast yet great expense is lavished on them both great improvements are made in rural beauties the whole neighborhood is ornamented private roads are constructed at great expense but in holland the country seats are all snug compact boxes with scarce any appearance of territory about them resembling very much in that respect the houses our london citizens have erected twenty miles round the capital they are neat and small with gardens of no extent but with much clipped regularity every thing is in the taste of england fifty years ago but not quite so expensive their gardens too have many fountains in them which are as preposterous in their cold damp country as they are agreeable in the sultry climes of spain or italy  relative to their youth the dutch have followed the french though with some variations their education consists in their colleges and subsequent traveling under a german tutor on their return home they either get some honorable and lucrative post or enter into the army or live at home upon their income these are their young nobility or persons of large independent fortune but the inferior ranks of people are very fond of sending their children to some of their own universities though it should be but for a year or two rather to boast of it than for any real advantage the number of persons in compting houses who have had what they call a learned education is very great but then it must be observed that there is not that variety of dissipation and expense at their universities which are the disgrace and bane of those of oxford and cambridge a young man may though designed for trade be ventured to leyden or utrecht without the danger of its giving him such a relish for literature as to induce him afterward to think of any other books besides his journal and ledger but a merchant in this country who designs his son for trade had better hang him than send him to one of our universities he acquires such a taste for extravagance as to be ever after totally unfit for the prudence and economy of commerce nor is this all for the morals of the youth at the dutch university are much purer than those at the english ones which marshal is pleased to say are little better than the seminaries of vice  it is astonishing says he that a new system of education is not introduced into england for the education of such youth as are not intended to be fine gentlemen for the sons of these parents who wish to preserve the morals of their children as well as their latin and greek the present method is diametrically opposite to it the principal school in this kingdom is in the capital and the boys are lodged at private houses and this says he is an early introduction into all the vice of london instead of this a school should be in as solitary a place as possible never in a town or even in a great village but in a retired spot to keep boys from the mischiefs which the capital every moment presents to their youth and inexperience the same rule should be followed at college instead of crowding them together and forming a great town they should be single and in the country this would be taking from their eyes constant examples of extravagance and expense which all the neighboring college must exhibit youth should spend their time in study and recreation but what recreation proper for them does a town yield do not the adjacent fields commons or forests exhibit a much better scene of amusement to brace their strength confirm their health and keep them active and lively  for young men whether educated at college or in private holland abounds in numerous masters who teach the french and other living languages and the polite exercises such as dancing fencing and music all which are easily learned at the hague and their other cities and they are generally fond of these accomplishments their daughters are most assiduously educated in every polite embellishment even with more care than our own are in england consequently all the women of any fashion affect very much the manners of the french  it is a great mistake to suppose that in this trading republic whose people have so long been famous for their frugality and modesty a knowledge and acquaintance with all those embellishments of life which luxury has spread through europe is wanting on the contrary though the dutch are very much changed their frugality is still more national than in other countries but it is confined to the lower classes or to people of small fortune but among those of higher rank and those who are rich there are scarce any people who spend their money more freely in order to pass the time agreeably and enjoy whatever their rank and fortune entitle them to large and well furnished houses are everywhere to be met with also plentiful and elegant tables numerous servants equipages as in other countries rich dresses and some public diversions and in the education of their children no expense is ever spared  with regard to the temper and disposition of the dutch i shall not says marshal pretend to analyze them it is an invidious task even for travelers who have long resided in a country and much more so for one who makes only a short stay i shall therefore only remark that i observed a great variety of characters at which i was not surprised for the vast number of foreigners of all nations and ranks who are resident in holland must certainly very much take off from the appearance of a uniformity of national character however the dutch are certainly a valuable people and in general possessing as many good qualities as their neighbors they are friendly and sincere and the better ranks have a politeness and unaffected ease which render them very agreeable nowhere are there to be found more learned men or such as have seen more of the world than in holland literature is much cultivated there and the presses of the country are continually teeming with editions of all the capital books printed in france germany italy or england and though this is often done with views of exportation and trade yet it serves to spread a general knowledge and taste for literature and the sciences such are marshals remarks on the genius of this people whose writings breathe much more the air of a gentleman than those of most of our modern travelers but these remarks seem more applicable to the higher ranks of people than to the subjects at large with respect to the lower class when their passions are once worked up there seems to have been in all ages a sanguinary ferociousness of character among them which knows no bounds in its cruelties for example among other horrors which history has traced back was the murder of woleferd de borselen whom the populace of delft tore to pieces in      under the reign of count john one of their last counts of holland next the massacre of barend provis burgomaster of utrecht in the time of the bishop of zwedere whom the people had the barbarity to hack to pieces whilst he was in bed without paying any respect to the holy sacraments which were profaned in the hands of the priest who was administering them to him afterward the massacre of nicholas van ruiven high bailiff of haerlem in      who was torn to pieces alive in the hoteldeville and whom his assassins had the coldhearted cruelty to cut in pieces and pack up in a basket which they sent to his widow with this horrible inscription mrs ruivan eat these limbs witness the assassination of the de wits in      whose remains were thrown about the streets with the utmost indifference for several hours after it is only in these provinces says some french writer that the common people have the courage to tear the human heart in pieces and eat it at the siege of leyden a sailor devoured the heart of a spaniard part of one of the de wits was also bit off and if history does not misinform us the heart of admiral coligne was likewise eat up by the people add to this the risks which so many brave citizens have run the insults they have met with for having served their country and the disturbances which are so frequently made before the magistrates houses and likewise before those of foreigners of distinction if any trifling boon which they think proper to solicit is refused them nor should the inhumanity with which they treat their pickpockets be omitted whom the lower class of people treat with such a barbarous severity if ever they happen to get hold of them that it is very seldom a pickpocket escapes alive out of their hands or if he should the miserable wretches generally die of their wounds all these incidents and marks of cruelty at such distant intervals from each other demonstrate an invariable and indelible character which nothing can root out  this ferociousness seems the more surprising when contrasted with that phlegm which predominates in their temperament a people from whose appearance we might suppose them grave tranquil and even dull could never be suspected to possess so much irascibility but anger assumes force and energy in proportion to its concentration by its reaction on the springs of the machine almost every author asserts that the dutch are laborious but it is rather by perseverance than activity this may be seen in the watermen who pull gently hang on their oars a long time rub through the day in this employ and return to it the next with alacrity and without complaining of their profession slow and sure nor does this slowness prevent their arriving at perfection philosophers pretend to say it is their hot drinks such as tea and coffee which has weakened the nerves of the dutch the lower class of people however who live at a distance from great towns are a plain civil kind of people and will readily hear reason if sufficient time be given them for that purpose as a proof of their honesty should a stranger give them a shilling for what is worth but a groat they would return him the change and ask him why he could be such a simpleton their food is chiefly roots herbs or milk and they seem to have no further views than to supply themselves with what nature requires and make some small addition to their stock it may probably be owing to their diet that their strength and vigor is not answerable to their bulk for they are in general tall and apparently strong built but very unwieldy and awkward in their motions both women as well as men the seamen are a much rougher kind of people surly and illmannered which is mistaken for pride but proceeds from their conversing with the winds and waves sailors being a set of people that seldom choose to use more words than are necessary as for the mechanics and the lower order of merchants their wits are much sharper than either of the above classes and like the scots aubergiste at middleburg exert all their skill to take advantage of the folly and ignorance of those they deal with this anecdote is as follows and the editor of this work was present when it took place  a frenchman went to the house of a scots landlady and called for some coffee the price of which in holland is a penny a dish he drank three  what had he to pay not understanding dutch nor his hostess french as she pretended he takes from his pocket some doubledutchee pieces of the value of twopence each and began to count them into her hand one two three looking her in the face all the time and then stopped  our landlady not content nodded and pointed to him to go on he did but more slowly than before as with greater reluctance stopping at every interval as much as to say is not that enough she nodding at him to go on when he came to eight or nine his patience was exhausted at which she roars out with great impetuosity for she then could speak french croyez vous que je serai content avec ca and thus made him give her two or three more being asked by an english gentleman present when the frenchman was gone how she could in conscience take near halfa crown for three dishes of coffee value only threepence she replied with a significant smile  as he had never been in middleburg before it was proper to make him pay his footing  the members of the states will sometimes employ their money in commerce by keeping houses and servants for that purpose but the generality of them live upon the pensions of their offices and the rents of their land or houses and it is seldom that these families get great estates though they are continually in the magistracy the salaries of their office being very inconsiderable the nobility as has been observed are not numerous in holland many of their families having been extinguished in the wars with spain and it does not appear that there is any power lodged in the states general or the stadtholder to create fresh nobles they affect rather the garb of the neighboring courts than the popular air of their own country they look upon it so dishonorable to marry beneath their rank that they will scarce submit to it to patch up a broken fortune frugality all ranks of people possess more or less this enables them to bear the heavy burdens that are laid upon them and from hence proceeds the beauty and strength of their towns the magnificence of their canals and public buildings their pleasant shaded walks to all which a dutchman contributes with as much alacrity as people in other countries expend their property in the embellishment of their private estates  certainly nothing adds more to the beauty of their cities as well as of the country in general than the plantations of trees for the public use and pleasure in england things of this sort are often done but more for private gratifications than the general delight of the people so that the lower classes are more apt to crowd to gardens where they pay their money waste their time and sometimes debauch themselves with excesses we may observe however to the honor of great britain that within these thirty years great inprovements have been made in many parts of the kingdom works of this nature for the public recreation are worthy of the best citizens the most zealous patriots and the greatest princes  the accuracy of the dutch in casting up their expenses is so just that no person engages in any thing he is not prepared for and it is very unusual to hear of any public or private building not being finished by the time it was agreed on their charity is rather national than directed to the common objects of compassion hospitals they have out of number but there are none perhaps more admired by all foreigners than the one established at enchuysen for aged seamen which is so contrived as that those who have passed their lives in the dangers and hardships of a seafaring life should enjoy in this retreat every satisfaction and convenience which old age is capable of  the dutch says hanway are distinguished for the number and economy of their useful charities which seem to exceed those of england not in extent for in beneficence the english have hardly any bounds as if they meant in good earnest to cover a multitude of sins but in regard to discipline and wholesome severity we have not supported it so well as the dutch who make all their poor perform some useful labor it does not indeed seem possible to engage the lowest sort of people of any nation to work from a sense of duty if they are left to their choice or the materials of labor withheld from them it cannot be expected that they will work but if the make and constitution of man render labor necessary to his support it follows that he who can work and will not work shall not have food given him charities founded on principles not consistent with this rule instead of drawing down blessings produce calamities as is often experienced  all passions that of avarice excepted run in general lower and cooler here than in other countries quarrels are very rare revenge seldom heard of nor is jealousy scarce ever known their tempers and dispositions are not airy enough for joy or strains of humor nor warm enough for love this is indeed sometimes talked of by young persons as a thing they have heard of but never felt and as a discourse that becomes rather than affects them some writers account for this indifference to the sex as proceeding from the heaviness of the atmosphere which renders them less susceptible of more refined passions others consider it as the close application which every man gives to his own concerns this uncommon assiduity is remarkable in every thing they undertake there are instances of persons who have bestowed between twenty and thirty years in making and finishing a globe others a still longer time in the mere inlaying of a table nor is it to be conceived how much this assiduity of application in never giving over what they have once taken in hand may have contributed to the atchieving of those wonderful actions which they have performed not committing that fault which people of a more volatile disposition are apt to run into the leaving of one pursuit to follow another this constancy of employment and coldness of complexion and perhaps the nature of their food also may contribute to their being but little given to gallantry the same causes may here have had the same effect among the married women who have the whole management of their domestic concerns and who are generally of a very irreproachable character chastity being hereditary and habitual to them the men place such confidence in their wives as to make them acquainted with all their private affairs and seldom undertake any thing without their knowledge and approbation another writer speaking of the middling ranks of life says that the women have the reputation of being very faithful to their husbands though they do not seem to pay much regard to chastity before marriage some of them have good complexions though not very beautiful and their teeth are in general bad their children for the most part till they arrive at the age of eight or ten years are weak and sickly and indeed the women seem so incessantly employed in cleaning their houses and other offices of which some are in common with their husbands that they do not appear to afford themselves rest enough to breed children or at least give sufficent attention to them after they have brought them forth the women in this country seldom breed after the age of thirty as the men are remarkable for the many breeches they wear so are the women for wearing one pair they use pots with live coals of wood or turf which they set in boxes bored full of holes and put between their legs to warm them in cold weather this is not only apt to make them old from the waist downward before the time ordained by nature but the smell of the coals is offensive and they have a proverbial saying in holland that the dirtiest piece of furniture in the house of a dutchman is his wife  whether it be the remains of any jealousy which they have retained since the time of the spanish government or the mere effect of prudence i could not help observing says hanway that many of them will not mention their wives in company nor do they seem pleased that others should speak of them though in the most respectful terms it might be presumed that where the laws are so favorable to the women as to give them at least an equal share of dominion with their husbands that conversation should be more free this conduct however may be imputed to that incommunicative manner of life in which the lower and middle sorts of the people are bred up  as a proof of the extraordinary neatness of the dutch which is fully expatiated on under the article of north holland as well as the ascendency which women have over their husbands sir william temple relates that being at the house of one of the burgomasters of amsterdam whilst he was ambassador in holland and having a severe cold he observed every time he spit that a clever handsome wench who stood in the room with a clean cloth in her hand presently wiped it up and rubbed the board clean sir william expressing some uneasiness at the trouble he gave the master of the house told him if his wife had been at home he would not have come off so well for that she would probably have turned him out of the house notwithstanding he was an ambassador adding that there were two rooms in his house which he durst never go into and he believed they were never opened but twice a year to be cleaned sir william remarking that the wives of amsterdam generally governed their husbands and that this seemed part of their constitution the burgomaster replied it was true and that all a man could hope for was an easy governess this occasioning many pleasant stories to be told concerning the extragavant neatness of the dutch ladies in their houses the secretary of amsterdam who was present pointed to a house opposite where he said one of their magistrates went to pay a visit to the mistress a strapping north holland lass happening to open the door to him and observing as he was coming in that his shoes were not very clean the wench took him by both arms threw him on her back and carrying him through two rooms set him down at the bottom of the stairs and then pulling off his shoes and putting a pair of slippers on him she told him without having said a word to him before that he might walk up to her mistress who was in her chamber  with respect to their dress the tradesmen merchants and higher class of people dress very much after the manner of the english and french as will be hereafter noticed with this difference that their clothes do not vary according to the seasons as in france any more than the furniture of their houses which are covered with carpets in midst of summer as in winter the dress of the lower class of people to an englishman appears clumsy and awkward though it is admirably well adapted to the coldness and moisture of their climates their coats have neither shapes nor plaits and their long pockets are fixed as high up as their ribs they are also remarkable for wearing very large breeches but the dress of the women appears still more singular their clothes coming only half way down their legs headdress they have scarce any but content themselves with tying up their hair and wearing three black knots on their head and sometimes a hood their ladies of pleasure who frequent the spillhouses are generally dressed in a coat and jacket very much resembling the riding habits worn in england their burgomasters like our counselors usually dress in black full trimmed with a flowing wig  as to diet that of the hushandman or boors consists as we have already said chiefly of roots herbs sourmilk and pulse in towns the common people fare something better about november the country people purchase an ox or sometimes more than one according to the largeness of the family this they salt and afterward smoakdry it to eat with bread butter and sallad pickled herrings bologna sausages and other savory dishes are much admired by the dutch when they have fresh fish it is generally eaten with oiled butter which those who are accustomed to it prefer to good melted butter they have several other methods of dressing their fish to which a little use will reconcile an english palate slounders they dry gradually and eat them with salt without any further dressing their butter and cheese are esteemed very good of which the common people are so very greedy that they seldom travel without a butterbox in their pocket this box is made in the shape of a churn and will hold about half a pound of butter as they travel on their canals a peasant with his roll and butterbox and halfapint of gin makes a very comfortable meal and so extravagantly fond are the dutch of this article of diet that they will sometimes eat it by spoonfuls but the dutch do not now feed upon that simple diet they were accustomed to formerly and the dishes of every neighboring nation are to be met with in holland the tabledhotes in the first repute at amsterdam and the hague more particularly are furnished with a profusion of eatables and delicacies fit for the table of a nobleman among the higher class of citizens they carry their luxury to a great pitch in the article of poultry alone it is customary in the month of march to give a guinea for a green goose which at that season of the year in holland is very scarce the method to rear them is by keeping them in a large barn in the middle of which they have a pond and a large fire  in liquors they have very much the advantage of us for they have not only good beer but also wine and brandy equally good and in great plenty their geneva also to which the common people are known to be no enemy is equally good and cheap sir william temple observes that it is necessary these people should tipple as well for the improvement of their understanding as the preservation of their health for though excess of liquor may clog the parts of those who live in better climates and are of a warmer constitution yet it benefits those who are of a cold constitution and live in a heavy atmosphere and perhaps may be even necessary to thaw the frozen and inactive spirits of the brain yet the magistrates and persons of high office are seldom addicted to this vice as for the merchants and tradesmen with whom it is not unusual they never drink in the morning and will not even offer a stranger any liquor in a morning but excuse themselves on account of the time of day  the diversions of the dutch are bowls billiards chess and tennis games of chance they seldom play at angling in summer and shooting wild fowl in winter make another part of their recreation in winter when their canals are frozen skaiting and being drawn along in sledges is an amusement of which they are very fond it is incredible with what rapidity some of them will move with their skaits so that no running horse can keep pace with them the women as well as men are accustomed to this exercise in holland and will frequently skait with their goods on their heads  0 miles to market and return in the evening their sledges are either drawn by a single horse or pushed along by a person with skaits on when the snow is on the ground and the streets frozen the young persons of rank in the republic appear abroad in magnificent sledges every gentleman drives his own horse which is covered with a rich skin and the horse likewise is adorned with a fine tuft of feathers and the gentleman and lady for there is generally a lady in the sledge behind whom the gentleman sits wrapped up in furs the sledges are of various shapes finely painted gilt and varnished and the horses harness very rich and glittering numbers of these are frequently seen in amsterdam making a very long train and which appear a very beautiful sight we have given a plate of such traineaus in our description of vienna in summer multitudes of people may be seen walking on the banks of these canals which are shaded by trees or on the sea shore or in the public gardens but at the end of every walk is the tavern where they do not fail to meet with a thousand little amusements and agreeable entertainments such as cool summerhouses and grottos excellent wines and other liquors with fruits and cakes to which are added musical instruments of all kinds nor are these pleasures dear ordinary workmen may indulge themselves in these recreations whilst in other countries it is observed that this class of people generally wants bread to eat nor are the same distinctions kept up in holland between the wealthy traders and the mechanics as in other countries they converse very much on a level and it is not very easy to know the man from the master or the maid from the mistress such liberties do they allow to their servants who may not be struck or corrected by them but the dispute must be settled before a magistrate it not being proper that any one should be judge in his own cause they will sometimes take a boat and go with all their family to a considerable distance in order to eat riverfish at some tavern in the country nor should it be forgotten that the drinking of tea has long been universal among all sorts of people and not esteemed one of the worst of their entertainments  the dutch says hanway are so well convinced that much diversion not only creates expense but likewise calls the mind from business and domestic duties that in amsterdam they permit no public shows within the walls of their city after seven in the evening every person that passes the gates pays one stiver and a coach five stivers so that diversions are taxed with this impost it is not however very considerable for the people have not a great passion for theatrical entertainments which are not permitted on sundays they have a theater at amsterdam where dutch plays are performed but it is a poor one the amusements in which the dutch have the greatest pretense to delicacy is that of gardening almost every merchant has his little garden fitted up with great neatness and expense in which there is generally a small summer house situated on the borders of some beautiful canal where he goes the latter part of the week to regale himself with his pipe and enjoy the picturesque views of his garden and the moving scenes which the canal affords him till the monday following in the great commercial towns of holland there are clubs on a similar footing with those in england in which the members must be balloted for and where they meet every evening to take their tea to smoke and talk over the topics of the day any stranger is admitted into these societies on being presented by one of the members nor must we omit a very ridiculous custom kept up among the middling and lower class of people  that of weighing themselves in all the fairs it is customary for the dutch to have themselves weighed as it is with the lower class of people with us to purchase fairings there are persons who attend with weighing scales in the markets and fairs to weigh people for which they charge a doit each person from whence so absurd a custom could have had its rise is not easy to conceive unless it is that they esteem their consequence in proportion to their weight the dutch are in general large unweildy people partaking of the moisture of their climate the better class of elderly women add a hoop to their dress to increase that bulk it is a bellhoop that incloses them all round equally whereas servantmaids who wear hoops occasionally wear such hoops only as spread their hips this with the customary question to strangers at the first interview of how old are you  how much do you weigh and the circumstance of weighing scales at markets and fairs would naturally lead a stranger north hollanders to suppose as i observed that they estimate their consequence in proportion to their increase of weight  it is not unpleasant to see an amsterdam girl going to a teahouse without the city with her gallant figure to yourself a large bouncing wench square built with her arms dangling by her side trimming up her head and taking pains to distort her figure she turns in her toes to walk as she thinks genteelly on her little head is a plain muslin cap that scarce covers her ears and a black silk hat stuck on behind on the crown of her head a muslin handkerchief hermetically closed with a pin before and crossed and pinned under the arm on her neck above the handkerchief hangs a gold or gilt beadnecklace her rump is enclosed in a hoop that gives her a barrel form below and a pair of stays that rolls her into the form of a smaller tub above her upper garment is a short striped cotton bedgown laced before that drops just below her hips and a red or green stuff petticoat strutting a foot and a half on each side the waist the whole forming a bulky contrast to her little head this petticoat is short enough to expose a very thick leg and large foot which scarce enters a small black shoe with red heels and fastened on by an enormous buckle on the toe her gallant with his hair rolled up above his ears his large hat right up and down three quarters of a yard from corner to corner coat buttoned tight over the breast strutting before her with his hands in his pockets leaves her to follow him all the way on the road and when they have got there he funks her with tobacco though in a sultry hot evening  the ordinary mode of traveling in holland is in trechschuyts drawn by one horse and which are in shape much like a citybarge in london only more simple and less ornamented they move at the rate of three miles an hour for which the fare does not amount above a penny a mile the only stops they make are at certain little towns where they stop to regale and from which they expect to take in fresh passengers these boats hold about fifteen passengers in the cabin or covered room with convenience but the mischief is the master or skipper will crowd it with twenty or even fiveandtwenty on account of the profit of the fares and indeed if he could stow them as close he would stuff it as full as a barrel of herrings some persons says marshal who pretend to give an exact account of holland say that traveling in these boats is the most agreeable thing in the world in respect to cheapness it is so we are told likewise says he the passengers may talk knit sew read and do whatever they like which is most undoubtedly true they perform all their agreeable functions just in the same manner as they are performed in an english stagecoach in which six are crammed all perhaps great fat or corpulent wretches that are made only to be a a trechschyt plague to the next on the seat i can conceive that a stagecoach half full and with none but agreeable company in it may prove a very pleasant conveyance but what are these boasted trechschuyts when there is a dozen dutch boors in them who setting at naught the cleanliness of their country will spit close at your feet whatever be your rank will show as little idea of civility or even humanity as the most drunken hackneycoachman at london and will continue smoking though a foreign lady should be present unaccustomed to this practice and faint with suffocation the better class of people who travel in them generally bespeak the cabin or roof as it is called to themselves and pay a price accordingly in which case no other person is admitted on the journey but what can be expected from a conveyance that carries persons at the rate of a penny a mile if traveling is very cheap very low very vulgar people will travel at london there are stages that go five or six miles for a shilling what can be more detestable the cheapness induces all the blackguards who were born to use their feet not coaches to become passengers and a gentleman or any man that has two ideas in his head is offended at the lowness of the company he meets in them nothing can be more selfevident than that every thing which is cheap is made or managed with a peculiar view to those that are poor and will in general suit them only it may be said that men of education genius and science are often poor but what then is a person to be pestered with the company of half a dozen of dutch boors because it is probable a man of genius may now and then honor it with his presence but to do justice to these boats if the fare was more they would be a most agreeable mode of traveling they are well built the cabin a good room with windows so disposed that a traveller has a pleasing view of the country these boats in general set off every hour or every two hours on the ringing of a bell and so very punctual are the skippers that they will not wait an instant for a passenger who is not at the waterside by the time the bell has done ringing those who travel with much baggage in these trechschuyts are liable to great imposition the skipper will charge as much for a small trunk as for a large one and the porters whose business it is to carry the baggage from one boat to another will frequently demand three or four times as much as they ought to have against which imposition there is no remedy a passenger must employ the porters belonging to the boat or none in those parts of holland in which there are no canals the usual mode of traveling is in light open wagons coaches may be had in all the capital cities but then being obliged to be drawn by four horses traveling charges come high they have likewise two or four wheel carriages drawn by two horses the bodies of which very much resemble the worst of our oldfashioned onehorse chaises the pace they travel is about that of a higlers cart though they are fine beautiful black horses    hands high coalblack without a discolored speck with very long crested necks or forehands heavy but stately these will trot  0 miles an hour and are called vasttrotters and they will sell in holland for   0l the pair it may be easily imagined in a low country like holland where the soil is either very loomy or very sandy which it is in the upper parts of holland that the roads cannot be very good except in some particular parts where they have within these few years made paved roads carriages like our english postchaises they have none either in holland or on any part of the continent a traveller in holland is sure to meet with good beds and clean linen and in the hotels with civil treatment and reasonable charges that is they will not take advantage of a stranger making a bargain beforehand but in the lesser publichouses are frequently guilty of very gross impositions upon strangers particularly those foreigners who keep inns in the seaport towns and who are the refuse of these countries and france whenever they have an opportunity to fleece a traveller they show him no mercy and if a person attempts to dispute their bill they are affronted and instantly increase it this frequently happens even in the first hotels complaint being made that a bill is three or four shillings overcharged it is instantly returned with an additional two shillings or eighteenpence which is pretended was forgot the rest of the charges remaining as before in this country it is always the custom for a person to pay for his passage before he has well begun his journey for as soon as the passengers are set down in the boat a fellow comes round with a hat and collects the money so that if any accident should happen to prevent their reaching their places of destination which sometimes is the case in passageboats by their running on some sandbank the traveller is obliged to be at the expense of a fresh conveyance when any person takes one of these passage boats on his own account either to cross the zuydersea or to go from rotterdam into flanders or to the brill it is not unfrequent with them to extort a guinea extraordinary for a bed in the cabin after they have made their agreement in short there is no country where strangers unaccustomed to their manners and traveling with baggage is liable to more imposition than in holland to which they are encouraged as the magistrates almost always take their parts much more than those of other countries do there is a mean however which every traveller should remember in holland or elsewhere to be neither too economical or litigious nor too profane or negligent marshal has a very good remark on this head in the account of the treatment he met with at a little inn in north holland i stopped says he at an inn where i met with indifferent accommodations the landlord showed me on my first coming into a kind of a common room where there were many sorts of guests i told him i must have a room to myself he replied in english that he had none upon which i ordered the best supper his town would afford a bottle of claret and another of white wine on condition that i had a room this brought him to his best behavior and i was accommodated to my wish this is one instance in a thousand says marshal in which travelers receive a treatment in proportion to the money they spend nor should those who are apt to be too economical condemn the inns and landlords of a country when they mind only keeping their money in their pockets but whenever a tour is in contemplation either at home or abroad it is surely never worth while to save fifty or threescore pounds in five hundred and thereby render a long journey disagreable this is a remark which every traveller should continually bear in mind and not suffer himself to be put out of temper on his journey by trifling impositions which are perpetually occurring and in lesser inns nowhere more than in holland  marriage in this country is considered as a civil contract it is the magistrate who publishes the banns and joins the parties and there are many persons who consider the ministers blessing as no longer necessary the ceremony of marriage is made as simple as possible the only distinction is wealth when a couple therefore present themselves to the magistrate to be joined together in holy matrimony he gives them a paper divided into different classes of riches in which each couple names the column they choose there are five of these columns the first are for those who are immensely rich the second for those who are very rich the third for those who are less rich the fourth for those who are still less so and the fifth and the last class for those who are poor the column being fixed on the tax is in proportion to the wealth of the parties who seldom fail inscribing their names in a column above their real situation there is likewise an additional tax to be paid for coming to the townhouse in a carriage  the processions for the burials in holland are similar to those in england they usually inter their corpses as in scotland about the middle of the day with a long train of coaches following the hearse in holland there is a particular person in every parish whose business it is to go round and give notice to the friends of the deceased of his death and invite them to the funeral they are called bidders this man accompanied with the footman of the family goes dressed in black with a cloak a large hat and disshevelled hair and gets a deal of money by this means the greater signs of grief he shows the more money he collects they likewise give notice of the day of baptizing any child to the friends and acquaintances of the parents who are to be invited to the baptismal festival and in this service they are distinguished by a large white cravat with gloves of the same color  we should not however omit the singular customs which takes place at the burial of the bourgeois  the persons who have escorted the corpse to the burial ground return back to the house of the deceased in order to pay their compliments to the widow or the husband or the children these by custom are obliged to give drink to sixty or an hundred people which is the number that generally attends a funeral after having drank two or three glasses every one returns home except the intimate friends of the deceased to whom an elegant entertainment is served up at which it would be very indecorous for the widow or widower not to be present and even to do the honors of the table all the guests of course do their utmost to console the afflicted party the glass goes circling round bumper after bumper the fumes of the wine mount to the brain and from drinking they fall to singing and dancing till the next morning daylight and it is not infrequent to see a widow at their entertainments all in tears and dancing with the greatest glee imaginable the ancient laws of overyssel forbid the custom of drinking at burials  chap vii of their commerce the trade of holland was raised chiefly on the ruins of antwerp once the mistress of the commercial world till the fiery zeal of priests and the insolence of military authority trampled equally upon justice and humanity and lastly upon commerce the support of nations toward the sixteenth century the portuguese also from being the greatest traders to the east began to decline in their commerce which gave the more room to this new colony of merchants who had many of the requisites to carry trade to its highest pitch though their country does not produce a single material for building ships  but to consider things as they stand amsterdam is a prodigious magazine of timber corn wine and many other commodities of foreign european productions the inhabitants excel in dying sugarbaking bleaching of linen and wax manufacturing of paper and sailcloth with no inconsiderable quantity of silk and wool their whalefishery generally produces great riches and their east india trade is of the highest importance to them both in europe and asia the article of spices only is a mine of gold which they have preserved with more care and assiduity than if it had been really such here are also great repositories of gold and silver precious stones and choice drugs from different parts of the world in regard to the balance of trade between great britain and the united provinces the linens flax sailcloth tiles juniper berries etc which this nation takes of the dutch much exceed in value the lead tin tobacco and coals which they take of british subjects  i must not forget says hanway from whom we give this extract that their herring fishery is a source of riches to them persons of every age and denomination delight in this sort of food there is hardly a family in the united provinces but consumes a barrel the quantities which they send into foreign markets and convert into money is very great one would imagine that the happy situation of the british subjects should have rendered this trade unnecessary  such is the concise account which this writer distinguished for his commercial as well as literary abilities gives of their trade but as this is an object of much research it may not be amiss to dilate a little more on this subject by making some extracts from another writer marshal the principal bent of whose travels was to lay before his readers such accounts of the agriculture manufactures and commerce of the countries he had passed through as had never before been presented to the public navigation the fisheries commerce and manufactures says de wit are the four columns o the state and these marshal seems to have treated with brevity accuracy and judgment he divides the dutch commerce of europe into the different countries to which they trade  the country with which he begins is the baltic before the act of navigation made in cromwells time took place in england the commerce of the baltic employed near   00 dutch ships annually which for the most part went half loaded and returned wholly so norway alone employed three hundred ships every year this act having restrained the carrying trade of the dutch to the commodities produced in holland their commerce to the north at once suffered a great diminution and the increase of our marine augmented in england the consumption of the commodities of the north proper for the construction of ships which weakened the commerce of the dutch in the north sea by the competition of the english the number of ships we now send to petersburgh is more than double that of the dutch the principal trade which the dutch have at present in the baltic is with dantzick from whence they bring amazing quantities of corn and in return supply poland through that city with more commodities than any other nation in europe particularly east india goods wines brandy and all sorts of manufacture  the trade of very considerable tracks in the north of germany centers at hamburgh but the central and southern parts of the empire are supplied in a great degree by the dutch they have also a large trade with bremen and embden for the supply of the interior country but the commerce of the rhine is most considerable this navigation goes far into switzerland and by means of the moselle the maine and the necker a prodigious extent of populous country with many great town are connected and trade immediately to holland the industrious city of nuremberg sends a variety of manufactures particularly toys of which in england there is a vast consumption and which are called dutch toys because we have them from holland  by means of the navigation of the rhine the dutch serve the four electorates of the rhine sarbruck deuxponts baden wirtemberg the brisgau spireback alsace almost all switzerland and the greatest part of lorraine with all sorts of spiceries drugs oils rice whalebone tin copper brass wire sugar tea coffee the wines of france and spain brandies dried fruit and dried salted fish etc of most of these commodities there is an immense consumption through all this extent of country holland maintains by her commerce that of frankfort which is only a grand magazine subordinate to those of holland so that almost all the connexions all the correspondence and commerce of that city which extend themselves far into germany are nothing but a commerce at secondhand of which that of holland is the first  the dutch also furnish a variety of different articles to the austrian provinces particularly wine east india goods and the produce of italy and the levant the commerce of thse provinces is one of the most advantageous branches of that of holland the administration of the austrian netherlands has made several efforts from time to time for drawing their commerce out of the hands of the dutch but these attempts are yet too weak for giving a sensible decrease to the dutch trade though they have laid heavy duties on the importation of herrings from holland and taken every precaution for having all the spanish wool that is wanted imported at ostend which the manufactures of verviers and aixlachappelle draw at present from amsterdam and rotterdam  holland formerly carried on a very considerable trade with england this has declined very much since      the epoch of the act of navigation in england the dutch take of england tobacco tin woollen goods jewels hardware corn lead etc from scotland and ireland saltbeef and salmon butter tallow hides coals etc this commerce is almost entirely in favor of england the exports from holland being nearly reduced to spices  the commerce of holland with france has always been very considerable and of great importance to both nations particularly to the french from the prodigious quantity of merchandise the dutch draw out of that kingdom for their own use and for exportation it may also be truly said that this commerce is of great consequence to the dutch not only for their homeconsumption but by losing this trade they would lose the benefit of their exportation to france and in their importations the benefit of their assortments for the north a branch of freight and navigation very extensive  the interior consumption of holland founded on luxury takes many commodities imported from france for although economy reigns among the dutch the consumption in their tables and their dress is infinitely increased and this importation from france furnishes a rich reexportation it was estimated before the last war that the returns from america to france in sugar coffee indigo and cotton amounted to between six and seven millions sterling near hall those commodities is sent into holland either on account of the dutch or to be sold on commission all this rich part of the commerce of france is employed in reexportation for holland draws from her own colonies as much as is necessary for her own consumption in all these articles  this immense importation from france is made entirely by dutch ships thus in leaving to the advantages of commerce the uncertainty which accompanies the result of buying and selling we ought to calculate a very great sum by which the riches of the republic are increased with a physical certainty that is in the freight importation and exportation the customs loading and unloading in the ports of holland the duties of stowage etc and the commission  the french have made great efforts to get the trade of the north into their own hands but this commerce demands very considerable sums to be advanced for a long time on very moderate profits whilst the interest paid for money in the commerce of france is always reckoned at six per cent few of the french merchants have funds sufficient to wait the return for so little profit they are used to trade on small capitals and make their greater operations on their credit rather than on their capital but in the commerce of the north nothing can be done by credit especially in russia where they must give a years credit in selling and in buying pay a year beforehand in order to trade to the best advantage there are but few merchants in france able to sustain so long a credit so as to do holland any mischief by competition  the dutch have also a very great trade to italy it is a capital market for their merchandise of the indies of america and of their fisheries and for almost all the merchandise which they import from germany and the north this trade is principally carried on at the ports of genoa leghorn venice naples and messina these five places being the magazines of all the merchandise which the rest of italy furnishes to foreign countries and of that which they receive in return  of the commerce of freight those of banking commission and insurance are the best branches of the dutch trade but particularly those of freight and commission which are always sure and accompanied with no risks but these branches have their source in the aggregate of all the other branches of commerce in the state so that their increase and decrease vary according as the general trade in the state is more or less flourishing  since the act of navigation in england we may observe a decrease in the commerce of holland  they are not the importers or exporters of our manufactures to other countries  the dutch east india company says marshal is without exception the most considerable trading establishment that ever appeared in the world the conquests of the portuguese in the indies were achieved under the command and power of the crown and were extended to an amazing degree but with all the regal attention of the portuguese they never equalled the dominion which the dutch have gained under the direction of a private trading company  we are not to wonder at the superiority of this company over all others for succeeding to most of the portuguese acquisitions on the downfall of their power in the east they laid such a foundation of future power for themselves that no other company ever had such auspicious beginnings  their acquisitions were so extensive and so very important that the company found it absolutely necessary to keep up a very strong force by sea and land in the indies this has given rise to the very magnificent descriptions we have had of the great armies navies and state of the governorgeneral at batavia some of these circumstances are exaggerated but many of them appear to be true the number of islands some of them the largest in the world which are in their possession or in their power make it necessary that great fleets and considerable landforces should be in readiness at batavia and other settlements in order to protect and defend such numerous coasts and countries  but notwithstanding these advantages superior to those of any other country in the indies this east india company has been long on the decline this has been principally owing to the establishment of so many others the english have robbed them more than any other country france had for a few years a company that flourished so much as to prevent all importation from holland except spices and even exported a great quantity of eastern merchandise to spain germany and italy denmark and sweden have between them supplied their respective inhabitants so that the dutch company has not the benefit of the markets she once totally supplied  in the last age there was no place comparable to holland for numbers of flourishing manufactures in the principal cities of the province of holland were found the finest and richest fabrics of all sorts of stuffs of silk in every variation of gold silver etc of wool and linen of all sorts colors and dies the finest and most rare ribbons and laces of gold silver and silk velvets gauzes flowered and plain tapestries leathers gilt etc all these manufactures exist at present but with less eclat than formerly they are especially in those of wool silk gold and silver rivalled by the competition of genoa venice france and england  the cloth manufactures of leyden and utrecht support their reputation the superfines are as good and as fine as those in foreign manufactures and the blacks of utrecht are always superior the camlets of leyden equal those of brussels there is a difference between these fabrics and those of france verviers and aixlachapelle of nine or ten per cent which in foreign markets is an immense disadvantage to the manufactures of holland this disadvantage to them is in common with those in england in the same kind of goods  the manufactures of linen in the provinces of groningen friesland and overyssel are always equally supported the fabrics of france flanders and germany make none that approach them the linens which are called dutch are distinguished as much by the whiteness the fineness the grain the equality and the goodness as by being measured by the ell or manner of folding the most famous whitening grounds in europe are at haerlem they give their linens the luster and fine white that distinguishes them they also enable the dutch merchants to appropriate to themselves foreign manufactures which they buy in westphalia flanders and brabant and which being whitened at haerlem are produced in commerce under the name of dutch linens for this whitening adds a new price to the linen when it is of good fabric they take care in this whitening without the assistance of any regulation not to give the linens an artificial length as is done in the whitening grounds of flanders  the manufactures of a paper are in a flourishing state it is surprising they have been able to sustain themselves since they have been multiplied so much in france and in the austrian provinces where the price of labor is low which is a great advantage in a manufacture that employs a great number of hands  but the manufacture of all others the most important the most extensive the richest and most necessary is the construction of ships the timberyard of the admiralty and of the india company are immense but they are not comparable to those of the village of sardam which peter the great chose as the first school of europe for the construction of all sorts of naval buildings and where he remained a long time unknown in the quality of a simple workman for the instruction of himself and for raising a marine in his vast empire  the manufacture of colored linens and printed cottons has lost prodigiously its former advantages they have been too much multiplied in countries where labor is at a low price as in france switzerland and the austrian low countries this is a competition which it is impossible holland should stand against  the city of amsterdam possesses a manufacture which is sheltered from the effects of competition at least she has only that of london to fear who to the present time has been very weak in it and that of antwerp and london is scarce any thing it is the cutting of diamonds amsterdam is the only city that possesses in any very high degree of perfection this art and also that of reducing into small diamonds those large ones that are degraded by black spots and flaws this art is supported by the merchants of amsterdam who give very much into the commerce of rough diamonds both in the east indies and brasil by which they fix the art among them for independent of the diamonds brought from the east indies they purchase the rough ones from london and lisbon and if a person buys rough diamonds in any other country he is under the necessity of sending them to amsterdam to be cut on her side amsterdam has not much to fear says marshal from the desertion of the workmen who could not find work elsewhere this trade is an object every year of many millions of florins  bookselling was heretofore in a very flourishing state we still see in holland great fortunes which have no other source but this branch of commerce and the editions of elzevir show that the art of printing has been carried on there to the highest degree of perfection this branch of commerce is at present very much fallen it nevertheless maintains a great number of printinghouses especially at amsterdam leyden and the hague and a foundry of characters at haerlem which is renowned and merits its reputation  the superiority gained by the booksellers of france has restrained those of holland very much the dutch booksellers have many disadvantages paper is dearer than in france and they have fewer opportunities of procuring good manuscripts than the french booksellers they are likewise more liable to receive prejudices from counterfeit editions the recourse of this trade in holland is in the fairs of leipsic of which books make the principal riches leipsic is an immense magazine of books all the booksellers in europe trade there in person or by commission if we except those of france and england who having a great consumption attend little to the commerce at leipsic booksellers there sometimes get a sale for entire editions they make exchanges and many sales for which they get credit from one fair to another that is to say for six months there is perhaps no branch of commerce which is executed in a manner so simple so easy and with so much good faith  but before we quit the subject of dutch commerce we think it necessary to remark that there are two ideas respecting it in england both of which are erroneous some persons imagine that the commerce of the dutch is sunk to such a degree that her decline is swift and foretells at no very distant period the desolution of the state or at least its subjection to some neighboring power others on the contrary who have heated their imagination with the ideas of the great commerce they once possessed will not readily allow the declension it has experienced but consider the republic equal in wealth and power to what it was the beginning of the last century few persons make due allowances for changes nor will they willingly steer a mean course when extremes are so much more dazzling and brilliant the truth is the dutch still possess a very considerable commerce it is however much inferior to that of england within these last thirty years the trade of england has increased very much and that of holland has been on the decline the other powers of europe have likewise increased their commerce france indeed has not except in a few branches but the spaniards italians germans danes swedes and russians are all very much advanced in their trade and at the expense of the dutch were this quite general the dutch commonwealth would soon sink into inanity this declension of commerce has not altogether arisen from the rise in the manufactures but from the spirit in every country of supplying itself when kingdoms and states are bent upon becoming trading nations they do not enquire into the prices of labor in holland but take every measure for supplying themselves with those manufactures and products formerly taken of foreigners  but notwithstanding these general causes which have and still continue to operate toward the decline of the dutch commerce that nation is in the exclusive possession of some branches which will continue them in a great trade whatever opposition they may meet with first the spicetrade which is totally theirs without any competition and amounts to between one and two millions sterling per annum this is the only instance of a monopoly we meet with in the world spice is generally sold all over the world and yet the profits of an absolute and complete monopoly do not amount to two millions a year some writers value it at no more than one million monopolies have in their very vitals the principles of decay prices must and ever will be so raised that the consumption will generally decline and the vast expense of preserving it will reduce the profit to a much smaller sum than could have been imagined  the herringfishery is another most important article of which the dutch have so great a share that it not only brings in immense sums to the republic but also breeds them an infinite number of excellent sailors and the same observation is applicable to the whale fishery in which they carry on a great trade  chap viii of the government etc when charles v was emperor of germany he was king of spain and sovereign of the low countries not only of the united provinces but of the ten others those now known by the names of austrian brabant and french flanders and retiring from his sovereignty not only the empire but these countries devolved on his son philip ii who was married to mary of england this monarch being a spaniard by birth and having a great deal of the haughtiness of that nation in his composition endeavored to govern them by laws and maxims entirely spanish employed none but spaniards in his councils quitted the low countries to reside in spain continued the spanish and italian forces in pay and insisted on supplies to maintain them thus he soon lost the affection of his flemish subjects and thinking it beneath him to attend to the grievances and discontents of so inconsiderable a people or to be limited by their ancient forms of government it created in them such a dislike to his person and administration as made them ripe for a revolt but the worst of death of the prince of orange all was his introducing a species of inquisition which the spirit of the flemings could not brook just having adopted the protestant doctrines determining therefore to get rid of the tyranny of this prince aggravated by his appointing the duke of alva governor a man in his nature a much greater tyrant than his master they arose one and all in opposition to his measures placing the prince of orange at their head and meeting with succor from france and england by sea some of these provinces now the united states of holland carried their point and became independent of spain this was in the year      the only misfortune they had was the death of their hero and protector the prince of orange who in the year      was assassinated in his palace at delft by balthazar gerhard a burgundian he shot him with a pistol as he was going down the stairs to his carriage the other ten provinces remained with the duke of austria to whom philip gave them as a marriage portion with his daughter elizabeth by the treaty of vienna      seven provinces were annexed to the german empire and the other three by exchange in      were vested in france  most of the cities in holland are constituted on a plan somewhat similar to amsterdam and governed by a regency sending deputies to the assembly of the states which deputies are obliged to vote in that assembly according to the instructions given them by the regency as the members of the regency hold their places for life and likewise elect each other it plainly marks the government of the republic to be aristocratical it is not however true that they always hold their places for life there being instances of their being removed sometimes alterations have been made in cases of gross misconduct sometimes by the stadtholder in pursuance of the unanimous resolution of the provincial state and sometimes as in the unhappy disturbances which took place in holland about four years since by an armed force which assembled tumultuously for that purpose  and it was by this means that the stadtholder was deprived of some of his functions in the state and driven from the republic the majority of the lower class of people in holland have always been strongly attached to the stadtholders party it is chiefly the higher class of traders with their adherents which composed the party of patriots these people who in their sphere of life correspond with many of our justices in the counties round london and consist of persons who have acquired wealthy fortunes by commerce when once they can become members of the regency in any town in holland would if there was no stadtholder acquire a patronage and consequence equal to that of our first nobility which makes all men of this description in the province of holland very averse to the office of stadtholder in the other provinces where the people choose the regents the opposition to the stadtholder is very inconsiderable the body of the people who are then the electors being very much attached to that office  by a late regulation which has taken place in the dutch government on account of the last disturbances the prince of orange has a power of making such alterations as he may think proper in the mode of electing the regencies of those cities in the province of holland which sends deputies to the states general that is the regents instead of being elected by each other shall be chosen by the burghers which was the ancient custom and which seems much more rational and just this regulation has taken place in consequence of the king of prussias marching a large army into holland to demand reparation for the affront offered to his sister the princess of orange who was stopped in her journey to the hague where she was going to mediate between her husband and the states general during the time of his being suspended and very indignantly treated and kept prisoner several days by the persons who stopped her in her journey the states at first attempted to justify the conduct of their officers in this business as a matter which the circumstances of the times rendered expedient but the duke of brunswick marching to the gates of amsterdam after having taken possession of utrecht which the patriots deemed their strong fort and which was evacuated without the firing of a gun the regency of amsterdam and the states of holland who were the principal fomenters of the disturbances thought proper to lower in their demands and consent to the satisfaction required which was that the senators in the different cities who had been the principal instruments in this business should be deposed and the princes friends restored to their offices in the state and further that a committee of the state should wait on the princess to apologize for the indignities that had been offered to her in consequence of which the princes friends being restored to their offices in the state the prince of orange reassumed his function and things now continue to go on in their former channel  thus much seems necessary to premise before we enter upon the government of the united provinces which arose to such grandeur in the course of fifty years as to rival the most formidable powers in europe and even to dispute the dominion of the sea with england who had raised them from obscurity and enabled them to engross almost every valuable branch of commerce  we will now proceed to their government the united provinces are a confederacy of many independent states for not only every province is sovereign and independent of any other power but there are in each province several lesser republics independent of each other which are not bound by the degrees of the states of the province till such acts are ratified by each particular city or republic which sends deputies to the provincial assembly the several republics according to the ancient rank stands thus gelderland holland zealand utrecht friesland overyssel and the city and territory of groningen and the country of drenthe is also under their protection the collective body of deputies of the united provinces who are invested with the conduct of public affairs bear the title of the assembly of the states general of the united provinces affairs of daily occurrence or little moment and such as admit of no delay are determined by them without their being particularly empowered to do so or even so much as previously acquainting the provinces but in matters of importance they are obliged to refer to their respective provinces for instructions how to proceed  sir william temple relates that during his embassy in holland he had the good fortune to prevail with the states general to ratify their treaties within the space of five days without passing the essential forms of their government in having recourse to the provinces who must likewise have had the consent of the several cities and he assures us that the deputies by concluding these alliances without commission from their principals might have lost their heads if the treaties had not been approved but the necessity of using this expedition being apparent they were so far from being censured that they even gained great applause  the deputies of holland are allowed by their provinces after the rate of four florins a day and those of the other states six the place where this august assembly is held is the palace of the old counts of holland at the hague each province may send what number of deputies it pleases the charge attending it being its own but all together are possessed only of one vote the number of votes being always equal to that of the provinces that is to say seven but notwithstanding this the number of deputies sent frequently amounts to forty or fifty in this assembly of the states general no ceremonials of precedence are observed every province alternately succeeding to the presidentship in its week they sit also throughout the whole year without adjournment the stadtholder may come into their assembly to lay before them any overtures on public concerns but he has no seat in it  their power too is so far limited that without the unanimous consent of all the provinces they neither make war nor peace levy troops impose taxes or conclude alliances with foreign powers and if they are possessed of the legislative authority the laws they enact are only binding in those provinces that gave their consent to them but notwithstanding these limitations the power of the states general is still very considerable war and peace is made in their name and it is they that send and receive ambassadors and other foreign ministers the commander in chief for the time being and other military officers take an oath of fidelity to them and in wartime some of their members or of the council of state follow the army sit in the council of war and so far represent the united majesty of the seven provinces that without their consent nothing of any importance can be undertaken in time of war the states likewise grant licenses and protections lay duties on goods imported or exported and pardon deserters the states also confer diverse commissions on the members of their assemblies the title assumed by them is that of hogen mogen high and mighty lords and in public addresses they are styled their high mightinesses  their arms are ruby a lion rampart holding in one paw a sword and in the other a bundle of seven arrows beneath the shield which is surmounted with a ducal coronet is the following motto concordia res parvae crescunt concord makes small things great  the states of holland are composed of the deputies of the nobility and of eighteen cities or great towns making in all nineteen voices of which the nobility and gentry have only one  the nobility who are not numerous in holland being such as were created before they became a republic are called graafs or counts they are represented in the provincial state by eight or nine of their own number and when one of them dies they elect another to succced him but these altogether have only one voice equal to the smallest of the abovementioned towns they are very considerable however in the government as they possess many of the best posts both civil and military and as they vote first in the assembly they influence the towns very much who give their voices afterward these nobles are called the equestrian order  the grand pensioner of holland who sits with them delivers their vote and assists in all their deliberations previous to the general assembly he is always a person of great credit and seldom removed though by their constitution he ought not to remain in that post more than five years his place is behind all the deputies or representatives being in fact but the servant of the province though he frequently influences the rest of the deputies for he proposes all matters that are to be debated by the states collects their opinions and digests their resolutions like the speaker of the house of commons in england and sometimes assumes a power of delaying and postponing the most important affairs though a majority of the assembly are for the question pretending it will be of bad consequence to the province  the representatives of the cities are elected from the magistracy and senate of each town and their number is more or less according to the pleasure of those they represent though they have all but one voice and are paid by the towns who send them  the council of state the admiralty and the treasury are subordinate to the states general and very nearly resemble the same councils established when these provinces were subject to their several princes or united under the houses of burgundy or austria  the stadtholdership which was originally elective was in      made hereditary in the house of orange and like the crown of england to descend to the female line in default of male issue many persons were of opinion that it would be politic to offer the sovereignty of the united provinces to the prince of orange but he chose rather to decline it the high and indelible obligations which the dutch owe to william the great and the renowned patriotism and fidelity of the illustrious house of orange through every succeeding generation have ever thrown the choice on this family as a kind of necessary consequence  notwithstanding their having made the stadtholdership hereditary in the family of the prince of orange the people of amsterdam and of the province of holland in general the lowest class excepted are by no means reconciled to that high post being made perpetual and hereditary in the republic they conceive a stadtholder to be an office necessary only in time of war or when the country is threatened with an invasion  the office of stadtholder is not a barren title destitute of any emoluments on the contrary he has wherewithal to support a very brilliant court  it is very difficult to find out exactly what his appointments amount to the prince is paid by every province for being stadtholder he is paid for being captain general he presides in the councils of state at the head of the different admiralties and in all the courts of justice except in the grand council of holland and he is paid for part of these honorary presidencies for example as president of the council of state he receives twentyfive thousand florins he is likewise paid for being governor of the east and west india companies he is grand forester of some of the provinces which forms a tribunal and separate judicature in each province and this charge is not without some advantage the amount of all these different charges is very difficult to be ascertained but it is in general computed at three hundred thousand florins or nearly fifteen thousand pounds a year in time of war they mount much higher he is further entitled to a tenth of the prizes taken in wartime which he has generously given up to be divided among the ships crew to these considerable appointments he adds an immense patrimony which renders him the richest prince in europe  the present stadtholder has a court equal to that of the most sovereign prince he however conformable to the characteristic of the nation takes very little state upon him he constantly attends the parade every morning and if any foreigner or reputable merchant is introduced to him will take him by the hand and invite him to dine with him the prince has the command of all their forces by sea and land as admiral and captain general he has in consequence the disposal of all military commands the constitution has likewise invested him with the power of pardoning criminals and it is asserted that when there is no stadtholder that indulgence is not vested in the states general the soldiers are likewise obliged to take an oath of fidelity to him after having taken one to the states but the stadtholder has no power of raising troops but by their order previous to cardinal richlieus time the stadtholders had only the title of excellency given them it was he who first ordered the french minister at the hague to address the prince of orange with the title of highness in order to carry some favorite point which title has been continued to every succeeding prince as well by the dutch as by foreigners  it is a common observation that if the ancient sovereigns of these countries had imposed half the taxes the people groan under at present they would never have borne it but now their governors consisting of the principal men in every great town and province have such an influence over the whole that it is next to an impossibility for the common people to form themselves into a body so as to endanger the state their sovereigns are always on the spot and should the mob prevail in one city or province if they do not meet with the like success in the rest of the provinces they must expect to be very soon reduced to subjection so that a rebellion or what others denominate a noble struggle for their liberties is almost impracticable by the subjects of holland be their oppression ever so great holland being indeed a country which depends entirely upon trade navigation and manufactures and in all which their governors are some way or other interested they must naturally be supposed to promote them to the utmost of their power consequently that part of its subjects which is concerned in these which it must be admitted are by far the greater number is sure to meet with all manner of encouragement  if we consider a government of so complex a nature as that of the united provinces in which such a variety of interests and inclinations is necessary to support it in full force and efficacy we shall wonder how it has lasted so long rather than be surprised that of late years it has tottered and been in danger of subversion it is no mean entertainment to trace this republic to its origin historians seem to agree that the people of which it is composed so early as the roman time when the commonwealth gave laws to great part of the world were in the highest degree impatient of any encroachments on their liberty the vigilance sobriety and industry of the dutch supported their revolt against the crown of spain and after many years spent in laborious trials of their own constancy they formed at length that plan of government which now exists how long it will last is hard to say the foundation of it does not appear very stable a house divided against itself cannot stand whilst these people are not agreed concerning their first magistrate they will never invest him with power sufficient to answer all the various exigencies to which the state is subject  it seems evident from their late conduct from the present condition of that state and from the nature of their constitution that they are in no happy or secure situation hence they require the help of a first magistrate whose power though limited shall be sufficient to support him as the umpire of all their interior contests and who by a proper direction of their strength may restore them to a real independency  sir william temple remarks more than a century ago that the dutch had passed the meridian of their trade and from the events of the last fifty years nothing is more evident than the declension of their power in the middle of the last century they were a match at sea for the combined fleets of france and england but in the successive war their navy was much sunk and in that of      their maritime force was not to be compared to that of england at present it is quite sunk if we consider it as a navy which when put in competition with that of england was called a maritime power that they have a fleet cannot be denied but their ships are very few in number in bad order and scarcely have they any force ready for real service so we may safely speak of it as an annihilated marine it is true they have a great number of sailors but these alone do not constitute a force at sea ships regularly built in succession and kept in excellent order stores magazines yards docks timber and an hundred other articles all different from what trade employs are necessary and must be kept regularly or a powerful fleet will never be constituted the marine of england costs an immense annual sum and yet the best judges of it assert we are much too sparing of our expenses on that head but in holland the expense of the navy is so retrenched and curtailed that it is hardly an object in the finances  with respect to their laws those learned civilians grotius noodt huber vinnius etc have done their utmost to improve upon the ancient civil laws of nations the president schorer took a wiser course he has proved that the roman laws which are the basis of the civil laws of those provinces have no connection with the physical and moral circumstances the manners habits commerce and character of the people of the present day yet there is less reason to complain here of the roman law than of the forms which the lawyers oblige their clients to undergo and which incur expenses and delays to which there is no end the judges here decide very impartially and as far as the weakness of human understanding will permit with great integrity besides the roman law they place great confidence in the light of reason juster far than all written laws they also follow the municipal laws of the towns and provinces and the ordinances of the states  although it is no small sum that is requisite to defend a cause in any of the different courts of justice yet there is a very good regulation those persons who are poor can obtain from the judges the privilege of pleading for nothing and the youngest advocate is generally pitched upon to plead their cause but what renders this institution still more commendable is that this privilege extends to strangers as well as to natives  the sheriffs are the ordinary judges of the inhabitants an appeal lies from their sentence to the courts of justice established in different parts of the province and although the decrees of these latter are without appeal yet by an address to the states of the province a revision of their decrees may be obtained which is done by commissioners appointed under the authority of the states for that purpose  the criminal code of these provinces is very severe the party accused whether guilty or innocent undergoes two examinations one called the ordinary and the other the extraordinary except the accused be immediately convicted and own his guilt the extraordinary one takes place  the grand bailiff whose business it is to prosecute questions the prisoner in the presence of the magistrates if there are strong proofs of guilt and he refuses to confess the judges order the preparatory question which is commonly put in their presence when a confession of guilt has been forced from the prisoner by torturing him the definitive question is put to him which the sentence pronounced against him mentions but if he will make no confession notwithstanding his being tortured his trial continues but he cannot be put to death when the trial goes on in the usual manner both parties plead one against the other according to forms prescribed by the state the prisoners cause is pleaded by an advocate and it is by such causes as these that the young lawyers rise into fame the judges hear both parties examine the evidence and determine accordingly this trial may be reheard in any of the superior tribunals at the request of the person convicted but then it must be done at his expense being looked upon only as a civil action though death may be the result of the verdict yet this is a sentence very seldom pronounced the judges are very much inclined to show lenity and always mitigate the punishment where the criminal has not been guilty of murder if the criminals are robbers or coiners against which the law has decreed the punishment of death they are exposed on a gallows with a rope about their neck and whipped or marked and then confined for life or for a limited time which punishment the burgomasters often remit when they visit the prisons  by the laws of the country no person can be imprisoned but one against whom some crime has been alleged as soon as convicted imprisonment ceases whipping banishment or branding are the only punishments that can be inflicted yet the judges are not supposed to transgress this law when they doom a person to perpetual imprisonment whose crimes merited death as in these cases imprisonment is a favor which the judges are supposed to show a criminal  the prisons where these criminals are confined are called rasphouses which are noticed under the article of amsterdam they are there employed in sawing brazil wood if they have strength if not they are put to some other work the ordinary task is to saw three hundred pounds of wood aweek the saws are taken away from the prisoners every evening lest they should do some mischief with them by a privilege granted to the houses of correction no person is allowed to have this wood sawed elsewhere on his own account  what is very singular if a person is attacked by another who endeavors to murder him it is not permitted here for the person so attacked to kill the other though in his own defense except he has behind him a wall or canal which he cannot swim over or some other obstacle which prevents making his escape some years since an officer was beheaded at the hague by this very law having killed another in his own defense who had first attacked him with an intent to murder him  notwithstanding the severity of the laws against murderers the common weapon of attack in holland is a large pointed caseknife called a snickersnee which the lower class of people carry about with them and use as familiarly in the skirmishes with each other as the common people in england do their fists having however learned the art of handling these weapons in which as in all others there consists a science it is very rare that they kill one another there is however a very severe penalty denounced against any one who makes an assault on another with these weapons though it is seldom enforced with that rigor which such a law seems to demand  no citizen can be taken up or imprisoned for any trivial crime on giving bail to the sheriff the high bailiff cannot even oblige any citizen to appear before him without sending a formal summons much less can he imprison him without leave of the burgomasters except it be for some very heinous offense such as murder setting fire to a house or the like and even then there are certain forms which he must comply with to take up a citizen he must go himself with two or three other magistrates to his house a citizens habitation is a sacred asylum which cannot be violated under pretense of making any search the officers of justice have only the privilege of entering taverns and publichouses a citizen must be summoned three times before he is obliged to appear  for a very trifling sum any person whatever may purchase the right of a citizen he likewise acquires it by being married to the widow and daughter of one a man however enjoys none of the privileges of a citizen till he has been made one a twelvemonth and even then he must have occupied or had an apartment during that time in the city where he inscribed his name it is strictly speaking only the son of a newmade citizen who can be elected into the magistracy which opens a door to strangers for their children they seldom however get elected except they ally themselves with some of the principal families in the magistracy  there is an old custom in holland which had its rise so long ago as during the time when the dutch were shaking off the spanish yoke and which is continued to the present time though the necessity of it no longer remains and this is that the magistrates are authorized by a particular law to send away suspected inhabitants without assigning any reason or ever allowing them to be heard in their own defense the states however have decreed that such a right shall only be exercised in cases of great emergency and have even offered to receive any petition on that head but having no power to act further than as mediators not arbitrators the banished citizen still remains exposed to the envy and malignity of the person who had prosecuted him this abusive privilege does not extend to all the provinces it is more particularly in holland where its baneful influence is felt  the laws respecting bankrupts bear some analogy to those of our own and from the great facility with which traders in holland get relieved from their encumbrances it is said there are many people in that country whose object in setting out in trade is to embezzle their creditors effects and then make their fortune by declaring themselves bankrupts when a person cannot pay his debts in holland he carries an inventory of his effects with the state of his affairs to certain commissioners delegated by the magistrates to examine and arrange all the concerns respecting bankrupts there as in england the lesser number is obliged to follow the greater threefourths of the creditors and twothirds of the debt or threefourths of the debt and twothirds of the creditors are required to make a man a bankrupt a failure being declared the debtor has six weeks allowed him to arrange his affairs after which time he must keep at home if he will not run the risk of being arrested though a person should have contracted debts in different countries yet he becomes liable to them in holland but the difficulty of recovering them increases in proportion to the distance provided the debts have not been contracted by bills of exchange the expenses which a person must make himself liable to before he can arrest a citizen are very considerable and are still much more so if the creditor should live at any considerable distance when a person fails in holland if there is no surmise of fraud it is said to be customary for the states to allow a certain sum to the bankrupt to assist him in launching out again in the world and that without interest  the amount to which taxes are carried in holland forms a very remarkable criterion of government are we to esteem the countries where taxes are low as the most free and happy or those where they are the highest it is amazing that this question cannot be answered in the manner which the first consideration of it dictates which is that the lower the taxes are the more free and happy are the people but this is not all taxes run higher in some of the free states of europe than in any of the absolute monarchies of this holland is a strong instance for in that country a given number of people pay double what the same number of people used to do in france and in england though the people are not so high taxed as in holland yet they pay more than they used to do in france this shows evidently that taxes are not inconsistent with liberty and yet arbitrary power is not able to squeeze out of the people so much as a free government gets with ease  the imports in holland are divided into three capital branches the duties upon exportation and importation and the duties on valuation which under that denomination is not a useless title but an additional duty upon exportation and importation this is the first branch of taxes and the only one which is paid alike by all the inhabitants of the seven provinces and this import is laid on by the direct order of the states general and its produce carried into the treasury belonging to the republic the two other principal branches consist in duties upon weights in the provinces and cities in duties upon consumption and in others personal and real the whole of these taxes are estimated at   0 million of florins the manner in which the taxes are collected renders them liable to great fraud but whenever it is discovered there are very heavy punishments inflicted of fine imprisonment and corporal chastisement holland is perhaps the only country in which a traveller can go in and come out and not be molested by those harpies of customhouse officers who exercise their power with such tyranny in other states the expenses in collecting the taxes are so great that they consume nearly half of what is collected  beside the duty on merchandise imported or exported almost every article of homeconsumption pays an excise to the amount in many of them of one third of their value such as bread beer wine turf especially in the province of holland servants horses coaches chaises pleasureyachts pay taxes as well as fruits and there is likewise a tax on horned cattle  every family pays a sum of money in proportion to their circumstances even for the privilege of drinking tea or coffee the proprietors of estates and houses likewise pay an annual tax for them according to their supposed value which generally amounts to two and an half per cent when the state is pressed for money this tax is doubled and sometimes trebled which becomes very burdensome to the renters all public sales legacies collateral successions as well as those in a right line are subject to a tax of from five to thirty per cent marriages and funerals likewise pay a very heavy duty in proportion to the opulence of the parties to be wedded or interred these two taxes seem very curiously regulated when the parties present themselves for marriage which in this country takes place before a civil magistrate a tariff is presented to them consisting of a number of columns of different classes of riches in which every person is free to set their name down in what column they think proper and the tax is proportionate to the property which they rate themselves worth  the tax on funerals is upon a similar scale those who are interred before two oclock in the afternoon pay scarce any duty but after that hour has struck there is a duty of    florins at half past two it amounts to  0 florins if the time exceeds three oclock before the corpse is brought to be interred it is  00 florins at half past three  00 florins and so it continues augmenting proportionably every half hour it is usual likewise to pay the bearers of the corpse from thirty sous to fourteen florins each according to the rank of the person  these taxes as well as those on lands houses carriages public sales legacies etc are very proper objects of taxation as they do not attack the industry of the people they fall only upon wealth and superfluity and might be imitated with great advantage by the other nations of europe  but with regard to the excise laid on the consumption of necessaries though it is less burdensome in the commercial cities than elsewhere it is nevertheless very destructive especially in cities where the commerce consists of buying and selling these excises evidently render the necessaries of life much dearer to the people and consequently increase the prices of labor and from thence another bad consequence arises that all the works required in the navigation and shipping become dear and the maintenance of the crews likewise in proportion dearer by which the nation loses the advantage of a low freight the fishing likewise becomes dearer for the same reason  the influence of excise from commodities of the first necessity is much more sensibly felt in cities at a distance from maritime commerce where the evil has made a much more rapid progress and produced a failure of all manufactures which are not supported by interior consumption or which cannot support the competition of foreigners through the single effect of the dearness of labor this has visibly diminished the population and consumption of the states which must necessarily tend very much to weaken it  chap ix of their army and navy and first with respect to the army which though perhaps of less importance to the state than their navy has in most countries the precedence the dutch stand in need of a considerable military force for their defense notwithstanding which it has not hitherto been put on a proper establishment every province keeps on foot as many soldiers as it can conveniently maintain but the swiss regiments are paid by the states general in times of peace the forces of the republic seldom exceed  0000 men and their number is very often less on the peace of westphalia in      the army was reduced to thirty thousand in      it was  0000 and in      thirtytwo thousand after the treaty of aixlachapelle in      the reduction was made gradually first the greatest part of the hired troops were dismissed then the new raised regiments the number of men in each company of the national scotch and swiss regiments was also considerably reduced in      some further reductions were introduced which made the standing army very low but in lieu thereof a better discipline was introduced among the troops perhaps the time may come when it shall be perceived adds busching of how little service new raised regiments are and how detrimental it is to a state to disband veteran troops how great soever may be the savings it is attended with  in time of war the republic takes into its pay some of the regiments belonging to the german princes the chief command of the army is vested in the stadtholder as captain general but the executive part particularly in wartime is filled by the field marshal general the expenses attending the military establishment amount to about ten millions of guilders annually  the pay of a common soldier in the dutch service is four stivers or four pence sterling a day clothes deducted for which one stiver is taken off so that their full pay is three shillings aweek or thirtyfive stivers with some small allowance of bread the captains are likewise allowed twelve hundred florins a year for clothing their company with which they are obliged to furnish their men with a new suit of clothes every year the uniform of the dutch regiments is blue similar to that of the prussians with this difference that the cloth in the dutch regiments is of a quality superior to that with which the king of prussias soldiers are clad the sergeants of the guards have silverlaced regimentals the dutch are distinguished from the hessians and swiss by white breeches they make a fine figure on the parade their hair being dressed very neat in the manner of the prussian soldiers and their clothes not quite so short they perform their exercise with great exactness and are examined every fourth day in order to see if their arms are kept in proper order and little faults are punished in the ranks by a certain number of blows on the back with the majors cane they wheel out of the rank on their heel at the word of command to receive the punishment and then wheel into the rank again the invalids have pensions nearly equal to the half pay of a private soldier in england amounting to    florins a year the dutch seldom punish any of their soldiers with death desertion in this country different from all other states being only punished by making the deserter work on some of the public works it should be mentioned however that there is no other country that pays their troops so liberally as the dutch so that a soldier is sure not to benefit himself by deserting from this service to enter into any other there are three scotch regiments in the dutch service most of the officers of which are from scotland in our late war with the dutch they were incorporated with the national regiments  the soldiers of the states general cannot be quartered in any of the cities belonging to the different provinces without their permission which was the chief reason of their losing so many towns in the french invasion of      for while the magistrates of the different cities were deliberating whether they should receive the soldiers under the orders of the states general the french took advantage of their dissentions and made themselves masters of some very important places without the delay of a formal siege the forces of the republic are for the most part quartered in the conquered country or what is called the generalite lands and not in any of the seven provinces except at the hague most of the capital cities in the dutch netherlands have respective militias of their own amsterdam in particular has a body of two or three thousand troops in its pay who regularly mount guard and to whom the defense of the city is entrusted  the naval force of the republic made formerly a great figure and in some of their wars the dutch have had no less than an hundred sail of the line in commission but the usual number kept up in time of peace is not more than thirty and those are not always properly equipped for service it is however very certain that the different admiralties can in a very short time equip fifty or sixty sail of the line the ships in commission in time of peace are generally employed to cruize in the mediterranean in order to protect their trade against the corsairs or else as convoys to the homeward bound eastindiamen  the admiralty colleges which from the heavy charges attending the employing so many clerks and other superior officers corresponding with our lords of the admiralty are looked on as a burden to the state provide for the safety of the sea and rivers and likewise for the shipping in general equip men of war and appoint convoys for merchantships the number and rank of these colleges are as follows first the college of rotterdam secondly that of amsterdam thirdly that of zealand or middleburg fourthly that of west friesland or north holland and lastly that of friesland each of these colleges extends to that part of the navy assigned to it and these several expenditures gave rise more particularly to the duties on exportation which are accordingly levied by the admiralty colleges in time of war and in cases of extraordinary naval equipments heavier duties are laid on the several imports and exports as likewise on all ships coming in or going out of the different ports exclusive of large contributions from every province the stadtholder of the united netherlands is likewise high admiral of the naval force of the republic he sits also as president in the admiralty colleges and sometimes even issues orders for the conduct of the fleet or particular ships when a fleet is fitted out for sea the vice admiral general or any other commanding officer usually divides it into the van center and rear  the deputies of the different colleges have  000 florins a year appointment besides their apartments and when they are in employ an additional four florins a day besides the expenses of their journies to and from the different seaports  when the states general have resolved to equip a sleet the council of state sends orders to the different colleges to fit out their respective quota of ships if the different colleges of admiralty have not wherewithal to fit out a fleet the respective provinces make good the deficiency or give the admiralty leave to borrow the sum that is necessary  it is incumbent on the several colleges to assign the complement of men requisite for each ship after which the captain uses his utmost diligence to procure as good hands as possible to man them and undertakes to provide provisions and all other necessaries for his ships crew the college for this allows him a fixed sum per day for each man this occasions great emulation among the captains and is one of the best means possible to get a ship well and speedily manned there is not a set of people who fare harder than the subaltern officers in the dutch navy such as lieutenants etc their appointments are very slender and they have no more than the ratios of two foremast men the lieutenants of menofwar in the dutch service are appointed by the different colleges according to a plurality of voices  in time of war the states general give permission to their subjects to fit out armed ships to cruise against the enemy but they must besides have a special commission either from some of the admiralty colleges or from the states otherwise they are considered as pirates  the neglect of their marine is a most impolitic conduct in the dutch for a trading power to rely more on its landforces than on its navy is such an insatuation that nothing but a very favorable complexion of affairs among its neighbors can prevent extreme ill consequences from ensuing the dutch army has generally proved insufficient for their defense in a landwar whereas their fleet have more than once brought them off in triumph and concluded their quarrels to their advantage  chap x on their religion learning arts sciences and language at the time of the reformation the inhabitants of the united provinces declared for lutheranism adhering only to the augsburg confession but in      a different system of articles corresponding with those of geneva was drawn up for the netherland churches and in      the states of the united provinces unanimously resolved that the calvinist doctrine alone should be supported without tolerating the exercise of any other religion but the last clause never obtained the force of a law in      the calvinist doctrine as set forth by the synod of dort received the sanction of the states of each province notwithstanding which the jews are more numerous than the christians who agreeable to that rational maxim of dominion over the conscience belonging to god alone enjoy liberty of conscience and the free exercise of their religion provided they do not oppose that of the state and attempt to discharge subjects from their obedience to the civil power the calvinists alone however are admitted to any share in the government the ecclesiastical persons here consist of four orders of prosessors of divinity at the universities of beneficed ministers of elders and deacons all matters respecting religion are canvassed in different assemblies called consistories classes and synods in every parish there is a consistory composed of the ministers elders and deacons in which are discussed all matters more particularly relating to that parish it should be observed here that the parishes in holland are not like those in england comprehending a small district with only one minister but there are several belonging to one church the classes are meetings similar to our archdeacons visitation the synods seem to have great affinity with our houses of convocation  in the ecclesiastical government there is no dignity or rank higher than that of minister of a parish the ministers are likewise independent of each other they have no other distinction among them than that of longest standing when they have been ministers sixty years they are generally declared approved and preserve their appointments during life though they no longer perform the duties of their office their largest stipends do not amount according to some writers to more than two thousand florins or about a hundred pounds a year others make them a hundred and fifty this salary is paid them by the magistrates as to tithes and church lands the states took possession of these when they first established their independence and have retained them ever since so that the dutch clergy depend entirely on their magistrates and if they disapprove the doctrines of their minister or dislike his preaching it is said as a signal to get rid of him they send him a pair of shoes and a staff by which he is to understand that it is their pleasure he should quit their territories and he is not permitted to offer any exculpation of himself none of the clergy in holland are permitted as with us to hold a plurality of benefices the professors are indeed allowed the privilege of having church preferment the widows of the clergy likewise enjoy a pension for their life besides one year of their husbands stipend  to be elected a minister or clergyman in the dutch church it is necessary to undergo two examinations in one of these synods the first is to obtain that rank in their church which corresponds with that of deacon of england and which gives an authority to preach but not to administer the sacraments when there is a vacancy in any church the consistory desires permission of the province or city to which it belongs to appoint another minister they then proceed to the election of one in the same manner as the fellows of colleges in our universities fill up their vacant fellowships by plurality of voices this election of a new minister by the consistory must afterward be approved by the magistrates of the town or district or else the consistory must be obliged to proceed to a fresh election  the duties of a parish priest in holland are similar to those in england except that in holland they are forced to preach two or three times aweek the minutiae of their functions are more attended to in holland such as catechizing in their churches examining into the lives and characters of their parishioners and visiting their sick  the elders in holland are persons distinguished by their years their morals and rank in life who are elected generally from among the magistrates to inspect into the affairs of the church and visit the different parishes they are removable every two years  the deacons are elected and removable in like manner their business is to collect and distribute the charities to the poor the collections for the poor are made by them while the minister is preaching at which time they go round the church with a purse and a b fastened to the end of a staff in order to make contributions and what is very singular all those places of worship which are not of the established religion are obliged to give part of the money they collect for their own poor to the poor of the established church perhaps there is no country in the world where there is so much money collected in charity as in holland every city and every sect has its establishment apart where both the old and the young are received and taken care of the revenue of the abbes and convents which were suppressed at the reformation have ever since been employed for this purpose in some cities they likewise levy particular taxes for these institutions no children are received in any of these charities above fifteen years old they have masters who teach them to read and write and they are afterward instructed in some branch of business the old people admittde into these establishments must at least be fifty years old each institution has its different rules and customs in many of these charities they are admitted without any expense in others a sum of money is previously required  the dutch churches are seldom without organs and no part of their service seems to delight them so much as singing psalms the psalms to be sung in the course of the service are usually written down on slates hung up in different parts of the church the dutch are not very strict in their observance of the sabbath after the duties of the day are over but will follow their recreations in the evening more than the presbyterians in this country  with respect to their marriages before they take place in holland there is a solemn contract made between the parties in presence of their friends by which their choice is so far determined that there is no receding from it and after this ceremony has been gone through they make no scruple of living together as man and wife and the woman is frequently pregnant before the marriage has been solemnized in a church there are in some towns commissaries chosen from the principal citizens who take down the names of the persons who wish to be married in order to see if they have the consent of their friends after which they deliver the names of those who are to be married to the minister of the parish if approved who publishes the banns three times in the church before or after sermon according to the custom of the place it is said if a parent or guardian refuses his consent without just cause being shown that the commissaries will not only permit the marriage to take place but also oblige the parents or guardians to advance a sum sufficient for the maintenance or setting up in business of such persons according to their station in life and circumstances as for those who are not of the established church it is the custom to publish their banns before the town hall in the presence of two senators though this is sometimes dispensed with and their marriages are suffered to be solemnized when the banns have been published in their respective places of worship  though the dutch women in their bloom are very handsome yet applying themselves after marriage to all sorts of drudgery their beauty usually goes off by fiveandtwenty if the husband be a tradesman his wife manages every thing in the shop and her man as she calls her husband has very little to do within doors and can scarce indeed be called master of his family his very children insult him especially if favorites of his wife and from his servants he has but little respect  at the burials of the calvinists there is no funeral service read nor any bell rung to give notice of the interment in some places both men and women attend their friends to the grave in others the women are prohibited the time of mourning for a parent a husband or a wife is a year and six weeks  the catholics and lutherans in holland lay great stress in tolling a bell at the death and burial of their friends and having them interred in consecrated ground for which the government makes them pay very dear indeed there are no rites how superstitious soever the dutch will not tolerate if they are paid for it  the roman catholic churches in the united provinces are about three hundred and fifty and the proportion of them is still greater in the generalite lands the papists in this country are admitted to military employment but no person of that sect is ever created field marshall they are computed at onethird of the inhabitants  the lutherans are likewise permitted the free exercise of their religion in the towns and their places of worship in the external appearance look like churches but an edict of      prohibits them from having any churches in the country though in some paces they are connived at they are however rendered incapable of all posts and employments  the quakers at present in this country are dwindled to a very small number but the moravians form a very considerable body of people the american christians likewise enjoy the free exercise of their religion the many other sects which have no settled congregations we pass over in silence  the jews have been permitted the public exercise of their religion ever since the year      and have many privileges in common with the rest of the inhabitants except that they are excluded from most trades it is usual to divide them into portuguese and germans the former of whom came from portugal in great numbers in    0 and    0 and were very kindly received here  as to the state of learning in holland it cannot be expected that a nation so absorbed in commerce as the dutch should bestow much time or attention on works of literature this country has notwithstanding produced eminent men in the commonwealth of learning such as grotius spinosa vossius who was afterward canon of windsor van swieten meursius erasmus helvetius and boerhaave who is said to have acquired above two millions of florins by his profession besides the abovementioned illustrious literary characters who were born in the country there have been many other eminent men invited there who have made it their place of residence there are no less than five universities in the united provinces leyden utrecht harderwyck franecker and groningen with two gymnasiums one at amsterdam and another at deventer besides several grammarschools of note and in haerlem there is an academy of sciences  dutch writers are generally censured for an intemperance of learning most of them load their writings with such numerous extracts and quotations that if any person was to select the original ideas of the author there would probably often be found not more than a few lines in a large volume  extracts are certainly useful in works of jurisprudence and medicine to assist the reader and enable him to have recourse to authors from whom they are taken but in the belleslettres they only serve to load the sentences and to divert the attention of the reader from the original idea it is in these provinces that politics have been most learnedly treated of the most eminent civilians have been dutchmen or such as have been invited from other countries to preside in their seats of learning the ornamental parts of learning have never been cultivated with success they have neither poets nor orators at least they have none that would be esteemed as such in other countries  in the fine arts the dutch have chiefly distinguished themselves in painting and engraving though they are not without skilful statuaries their school of painting says sherlock deserves to be viewed in order to have an idea of the height to which the mechanism of the art may be carried their finish is much more perfect than that of the italians but as they only servilely copy an ungraceful nature one of their pictures never makes us wish to see it again their absurd want of taste makes them despise all that belong to the italian school the antique with them is a term of ridicule and if an artist were to work there on those ideas he would die with hunger  rubens to whom nature by mistake gave birth in their neighborhood is not relished by the dutch and the proof of it is that no young painter imitates him if they value his pictures it is because they sell well and if some of his pictures still remain among them it is because travelers will not give six times more for them than they are worth  the languages of the united provinces is a dialect of the high german but more corrupt and clownish the people of fashion usually speak french their lords prayer runs thus onse vader die in de hemel nzyn uwen naam word gehey light uwkoningkryk

climate and country round constantinople this empire consists of european asiatic and african possessions and is thought to be the largest in the world some affirm it is  000 miles in length from east to west and    0 from north to south turkey in europe is divided by the mountains of the castagnas into north and south  it was part of the ancient christian empire of the east and is bounded on the east by poland russia and asia on the north by croatia sclavonia and transylvania on the west by the gulf of venice and on the south by the mediterranean sea this part of turkey comprehends ancient greece to the south in which are seven large provinces albania map of turkey in europe from d anville map of turkey epirus macedonia janna or thessaly livadia the morea and the islands of the archipelago the northern part contains walachia moldavia bessarabia croatia bosnia dalmatia servia bulgaria and romania or romelia formerly thrace turkey in asia comprehends five large parts natolia georgia turcomania diarbeck suristan and syria some writers reckon arabia and armenia but these countries are almost wholly independent of the grand signor in africa they possess egypt and a small part of abyssinia and barbary there are also other countries in asia and europe which they are not masters of alone but conjunctly with other princes  it is proper in this place to add likewise the nations who are or were allied in a particular manner to the port without being entirely subject to it these are the tartars of the crimea and the cantons of barbary the precopite tartars inhabitants of the chersonnesus now called the crimea or little tartary and who are likewise called nogayan tartars are a people dependent on the ottoman port but they rather deserve the title of allies savs habesci for there exists between them and the port a reciprocal convention that if the male line of the ottoman emperors fails the khan of crimea shall succeed to the empire and in the same manner the ottoman monarch shall inherit the crimea this convention was the cause of that strict union which has always subsisted between them the grand signor does not treat despotically with them as he does with his other subjects and as he had in former times begun to do even with them when he sends any order to the khan he does not make use of a firman or absolute mandate but written letters expressing his will and pleasure which however are always complied with  though these people are not under any obligation to pay tribute they very often send presents to the sultan and the grand vizier the present state of the crimea is very different to what it was some years ago for in the last war between the turks and the russians the latter conquered the whole country at the peace however every thing was nearly restored to its former state a principal article of the peace was the independence of the crimea and the free election of the khans but of the two chief candidates on the death of the reigning khan one was partially supported by the port of which the russians complained as an infraction of the article of independence the memorials of the court of petersburgh were not listened to upon which the russians supported vigorously the party of the other competitor whose name is sahib guerai the enemies of guerai were overpowered he was elected khan and russia actually reigned in the prince she had protected all the fortresses were in the power of the russians caffa the principal town in the crimea not excepted the black sea is full of russian vessels and every effort of the turks to drive them out has been ineffectual  the country comprised under the name of little tartary contains besides the crimea the cuban a part of circassia and all the lands which separate the empire of russia from the black sea in this latter district lies the important fortress of oczakow at the influx of the dnieper into the black sea which was lately taken from the turks by the russians and which the empress stipulated to be ceded to her as the basis of a treaty of peace concluded with the turks together with the territory surrounding it from the bog to the dniester inhabited but only in the valleys and by the sides of the rivers by the tartars called nogayan tartars and subject to the khan of the crimea these tartars are even more numerous than those in the crimea this country is likewise sometimes called oczakow tartary but of these countries we shall afterward speak more fully  the states of tunis algiers and tripoli are almost on the same footing with the port as the crimea these barbarians often receive orders from the port which they do not attend to when they clash with the respective interests of each state they are however obliged to join the ottoman fleet with all their maritime forces in time of war the same compact obliges the port to support them with all its forces against any enemy who shall attack them they do not pay any tribute but send presents every three years like the crim tartars to the grand signor and he in return sends them some armed sloops and frigates properly equipped for sea except being manned these states therefore are more properly considered as allies than subjects  the turks are of tartarian or scythian extraction this appellation having been first given them in the middle ages as a proper name it being a general title of honor to all the nations comprehended under the two principal branches of tartar and mongul nor do even the turks appropriate it peculiarly to themselves both the monguls and the tartars properly so called esteeming it a mark of honor due to them the word tur as an adjective meaning sublime and preeminent and as an appellation a governor turci therefore may import both the governor of a hord  ki among the tartars signifying a hord or company as well as the hord itself the scythian or tartarian nation to which as we have before observed the name of turks has been peculiarly given dwelt between the black and caspian seas and became first known in the seventh century when heraclius emperor of the east took them into his service under whom they distinguished themselves so much that the arabian and saracen caliphs not only had particular bodies of them for their guards but their armies were likewise filled with them thus they gradually got the power into their own hands and set up and dethroned caliphs at their pleasure this happened about the ninth century by this strict union of the turks with the saracens or arabs the former were brought to embrace the mohammedan religion so that they are now become intermixed and have jointly extended their conquests  we shall now enter into a detail of turkey in europe nature has blessed the inhabitants of turkey beyond measure its soil is luxuriant without dressing its air is salubrious the seasons are regular and pleasant and the waters are so pure and delightful as to invite them to frequent bathings in all parts of the kingdom  it would seem says lady craven in her description of the beautiful climate of this country that every thing in nature which has remarkable advantages attending it should likewise have certain disadvantages to counterbalance them so as to reduce the portion of happiness to a level for mankind this beautiful enchanting country the climate the objects the situation of it make an earthly paradise but the plague  the earthquakes  subjects that would make the rational part of mankind fly it for ever render it terrifying to every mind if things and persons may be compared is it not like a beautiful woman handsomer than most of her sex with accomplishments equal to her beauty whom the world her very inmates envy but yet whom the base passions that surround her communicate a horror to her best admirers and frighten them from her bewitching charms  though the air of turkey is so very healthy in itself pestilence is brought there from egypt and has more than once swept away one fifth of the inhabitants of constantinople yet from the prevalence of custom and the turkish doctrine of fatality they give themselves very little concern about it  the provinces says busching are universally fruitful though with some difference insomuch that both agriculture and graziery turn to great profit in this country great quantities of excellent grain and fruits are exported every year into foreign states but of this we shall speak more at large in the separate description of each country all the necessaries of life are equally good and cheap in turkey  the mountains in the different countries of this empire are the most celebrated of any in the world and many of them at the same time the most fruitful mount athos lies on a peninsula running into the aegean sea the mountains pindus and olympus celebrated in grecian fable separate thessaly from epirus parnassus so famous for being consecrated to the muses is well known mount hemus is likewise often mentioned by the poets but most of the other mountains have changed their names such as the mountains suha witoska staras plamina and many others even the most celebrated mountains abovementioned have had modern names given them by the barbarians in their neighborhood but of these mountains we shall treat more particularly when we come to the respective countries in which they are situated  the principal seas in this quarter of the globe are the black sea the palus moeotis or sea of asoph the sea of marmora which separates europe from asia the archipelago and the ionian sea the black sea formerly called the euxine sea lies between europe and asia it is bounded on the north by tartary on the east by mingrelia circassia and georgia on the south by natolia and on the west by romania bulgaria and bessarabia thus reaching from the crimea to within twenty miles of constantinople to which and the white sea it is joined by a very narrow strait it is about   0 miles across from the crimea but wider in some places and   0 miles in length and has some good harbors and several currents such as those of the danube boristhenes tanais and several other less considerable rivers which throw themselves into it run quite across it these currents occasion ships to be tossed backwards and forwards and oftentimes by the violence of the storms to be dashed against the rocks  about the mouth of the euxine sea where the passage is narrowest about twenty miles from constantinople lies a rock in the shape of an island about fifty or sixty yards from the shore here formerly stood a pillar of white marble called pompeys pillar because according to the received opinion pompey erected it after he had conquered mithridates as a lasting memorial of his victory near this rock are several lesser rocks of which the ancients have related such a number of fabulous stories asserting they floated on the water at the mouth of the bosphorus near these rocks the sea appears to be black all round the horizon it is supposed to have had that name given to it by the turks from its being very dangerous to sail across the turks call the sea maurothalassa the turkish word mauro signifies likewise sad and lamentable as well as black perhaps also it may receive its name from the black clouds which rise up here more frequently than in other places for the waters of this sea are not blacker than those of any other but violent storms very often come on so suddenly that it is impossible to be guarded against them and these will sometimes rise up instantaneously in the finest weather lady c who traversed this sea from the crimea to constantinople relates that there is a large rock on the european shore near the spot on which pompeys pillar stands but so far distant from it that unless a map or pilot directs the mariner how to steer he must infallibly take it for the entrance of the bosphorus or canal of constantinople several hundred turkish boats are wrecked upon it yearly  baron tott says that when he was at constantinople seventy sail of ships loaded with corn were cast away in one night by missing the mouth of the straits which brought on such a scarcity of corn within the city as nearly to have occasioned a very serious insurrection this event however he attributes more to a species of abuse and iniquity which will scarce appear credible than to the dangers of the sea for says the baron two lighthouses very lofty and placed at the mouth of the black sea on the headlands in europe and asia have been erected to point out to sailors the entrance into the straits the oil they consume is furnished by government and persons are appointed to light them up and keep them in order yet this same government permits the fabrication of charcoal all over the coast though it is easy to perceive that under this pretense the inhabitants frequently kindle fires which in bad weather deceive and mislead the mariner nay further the keepers of the towers frequently hide the lights says the baron to procure shipwrecks which they very well know how to turn to their advantage  from the crimea to constantinople it is usually a passage of two days or a little more but i have told my company says lady craven i expect to be seven why i have chosen the number seven i cannot guess i can give you no other reason than that i have long resolved in my mind to expect a treble dose of any bitter draught i am obliged to swallow and i assure you in this method of calculating events i shall not be so often disappointed as i have been when the natural cheerfulness of my mind made me always foresee prosperous gls near this spot there are a great many sacalls or wild dogs which resemble a fox very much especially about the snout they are supposed to have been engendered from wolves and dogs in the evening and sometimes in the middle of the night they set up a dreadful howling especially in bad weather or when it is very cold and in winter when food is scarce they are as fierce and ravenous as wolves  the bosphorus of thrace or canal of constantinople as it is generally called begins at the point of scutari nearly opposite to constantinople and extends to pompeys pillar it is about twenty miles in length and a mile and a quarter in breadth where it is narrowest this canal or channel is formed by the body of water which runs from the black sea into the sea of marmora or

archipelago there is a very strong current says chishull at the entrance of the canal from the black sea it appears however that these currents are more sensibly selt at the straits of the dardanelles the surplus of waters which the black sea receives and which cannot be evaporated pouring into the mediterranean through the canal or bosphorus of thrace and the propontis another name given by the ancients to the sea of marmora occasions likewise at the dardanelles says tott currents so violent that frequently ships can scarcely stem them with all their sails set  it does not appear however that the current is in the least troublesome in the canal as part of what are called the suburbs of constantinople stand on the opposite side in asia nothing says lady mary wortley montague can be pleasanter than the canal and the turks are so well acquainted with its beauties that all their pleasure seats are built on its banks where they have at the same time the most beautiful prospects in europe and asia so that there are near one another some hundreds of magnificent palaces for an extent of twenty miles as far as pompeys pillar the asiatic side is covered with fruit trees villages and the most delightful landscapes in nature the canal winding all along in a serpentine figure from the euxine sea on the european side stands constantinople situated on seven hills with a great number of seraglios fine gardens and pleasurehouses called by the turks kioshs so that both these shores make a most enchanting and delightful prospect  the bosphorus takes a sudden turn at bouyukdere says lady c who approached it from the black sea but my pen will but feebly repeat what mr gibbon in his account of the singular situation of constantinople has described in language majestic as the subject deserves but i am certain no language can amuse or please in comparison with the view which the borders of this famed straits compose rocks verdure ancient castles built on the summit of the hills by the genoese who once possessed it the modern kioshs or summerhouses with blinds all round minarets and large plantane trees rising promiscuously in the valleys large meadows multitudes of people and boats swarming on the shore and on the water and what is particular nothing to be seen like a formal french garden the turks having so great a respect for natural beauties that if they must build a house where a tree stands they leave a large hole for the tree to pass through and increase in size conceiving the branches of it to be the prettiest ornament for the top of their house in truth contrast a chimney to a beautiful foliage and judge if they are right or wrong this coast is so safe that a large fleet of turkish vessels is to be seen in every creek masts of which are intermingled with the trees and a graceful confusion and variety make this living picture the most picturesque scene i ever beheld  the sea of marmora propontis or the white sea for it has all these different names extends from constantinople to gallipoli it is called white sea in opposition to the euxine or black sea and it derives its name of marmora from some islands so called in the middle of it this sea of marmora is properly a large gulf communicating both with the black sea by the canal of constantinople and with the archipelago by the hellespont or dardenelles it is   0 miles in length and  0 broad there is scarce any part of the world except holland that can show within so small a circumference so many large cities as are to be seen round this pleasant sea the famous chizico the celebrated nice the pleasant apamia the charming nicomedia the unfortunate chalcedon and several other cities which asia could formerly show on the banks of the propontis are sufficient marks that in this quarter of the globe nothing was wanting to render the seashores beautiful  in the propontis there are several islands which give name to the whole sea the principal one marmora is about ten leagues in circumference the caloyers or greek monks have here several convents or hermitages there are also three others which go by the same name and which lie at a small distance from each other these islands abound in cattle corn wine fruits cotton etc they have also great quantities of fish nearer to constantinople lies another cluster of small islands were these islands in the hands of the christians they would be so many gardens of paradise but being exposed to the ravages of the turks who go there on parties of pleasure and frequently plunder the gardens and vineyards of the greeks when elevated with liquor they lie almost wholly uncultivated  from the straits of the bosphorus to those of the hellespont is a distance of about  0 leagues the last twelve of which are those of the hellespont dividing as does the bosphorus europe from asia the intermediate space between the two is the little sea of of marmora where the waters have considerable breadth and contains the isle of marmora exceeding high ground so called from the quarries of marble contained in it and lying about twelve leagues from the straits its ancient name was proconesus the sea of marmora and the black sea have been called the two breasts of constantinople for let whatever wind blow it is always furnished by one or other of these seas with abundance of provisions  on the narrowest part of the hellespont next the archipelago where the strait is not more than half a mile wide called the dardanelles so called from dardanus formerly a king of that country two castles are erected on each shore where every ship that passes from the archipelago is examined and they thus become a key to constantinople on a rock in the middle of the hellespont stands a town in which the turks have some small cannon the turks use it as a watchtower and it is a good seamark to steer by in the middle of this rock is a spring of fresh water  this famous strait is said to have received its name from hell daughter of athamas king of thebes who with her brother phrixus endeavoring to escape from the treachery of their motherinlaw ino perished in these waters  chandler in sailing through the dardanelles toward constantinople says we now saw a level and extensive plain the scene as we conceived of the battle of the iliad with barrows of heroes the narrowness of the hellespont the smoothness of the water and the rippling of the current reminded me of the thames xerxes but slightly degraded it when he called it a salt river he crossed it  000 years ago with an army almost innumerable over a bridge of  00 boats the turks crossed it since with more success  the hellespont was the strait across which leander tried to swim and they have a town on the asiatic coast that still bears his name when lady miller saw the short distance between the two shores she saw nothing impossible in the story of leander or any thing wonderful in xerxess bridge of boats it is so narrow a gut says she that it is not surprising a young man should attempt to swim across it or an ambitious king to pass his army over it but then being so subject to storms it is no wonder the lover perished and the bridge was broken the months of july and august are most unfavourable for passing them  the hellespont xerxes leander and hero says bisani what a contrast of ideas do not these names excite in us  how much is the fate of leander to be envied  xerxes thy greatness was but smoke for tormented by ambition thou had no enjoyment of any thing but leander was loved his passion constituted his happiness  these ideas present themselves so naturally on our passage through this celebrated strait that for the moment we feel love superior to ambition  the principal rivers of turkey in europe are the danube which runs into the black sea by different embouchures the dneister on the western borders of oczakow tartary running a little above the danube into the black sea and the dnieper on the eastern borders of the same country which likewise falls into the black sea at oczakow there are also the don running into the sea of asoph and the save which empties itself into the danube below belgrade the course of these rivers has been treated of already when we spoke of russia and hungary there are also many other smaller rivers which have been celebrated by the poets and historians particularly in natolia and the morea of which we shall take occasion to speak hereafter when describing greece  the lakes are not very remarkable nor are they mentioned with any degree of accuracy either by ancient or modern writers the principal ones are those in albania communicating with each other the largest called lago di scutari remarkable for a town in one of its islands which was formerly the seat of the kings of illyricum in the morea are likewise the stymphalis well known for the many ravenous birds that frequented it and the phineus which was the source of the river styx whose waters were of such remarkable coldness as to freeze those persons to death who drank of them they also corrode iron and copper for which very singular virtues the ancient poets feigned this river to be the river of hell  the principal cities of this empire are constantinople adrianople smyrna and belgrade belgrade we have described when speaking of hungary the other three we shall describe in their turns  the province in which the two great cities of constantinople and adrianople stands is the ancient thrace of which such frequent mention is made by the greek and latin historians what is very remarkable is that though so near each other these are the two principal cities in the whole turkish empire and the only cities of any celebrity in european turkey this province was anciently divided into twenty nations who according to pliny were afterward made tributary to the macedonians it was conquered by the romans under caius stribonius curio the proconsul and possessed by the eastern emperors till it fell under the dominion of the turks about four hundred years since  the country is for the most part level though interspersed with some large and remarkable mountains the most considerable of which is mount hoemus dividing the province to the north from bulgaria the next in size is rhodope celebrated by the ancient poets for the catastrophe of orpheus hoemus and rhodope the former of which will be more fully noticed in our account of bulgaria are two long ridges of mountains extending from the frontiers of macedonia to the black sea  the only river of any note is the mantza anciently the haebrus which rises at the foot of mount rhodope on the borders of macedonia and running eastward by philippopoli and adrianople turns to the southward and runs into the aegean sea  chap ii of constantinople constantinople is doubtless one of the largest and most celebrated cities of europe its situation at the eastern extremity of romania is the most agreeable and advantageous that can be imagined the strait which separates it from asia is nearly as broad as the thames at gravesend the city stands on more ground than that of london and the inhabitants are computed at a million and a half including those of the suburbs of galata pera and scutari  its original name was byzantium and it was built by pausanias king of sparta the emperor severus demolished it to punish the rebellion of the inhabitants but constantine the great rebuilt it and called it after his own name in the year   0 it was consecrated by him for the seat of the roman empire a more eligible situation than its ancient capital rome after the division of the empire it became the seat of the eastern emperors from whom in   0  it was taken by the venetians and french but recovered by the paloeologi fifty years after and fell into the hands of the turks on whitsunday      who have kept it ever since  byzantium in its pristine state consisted of no more than that triangular spot of which the present seraglio forms one of its angles and whose two sides are washed by the harbor and the sea of marmora so that was constantine alive at this day he would not know the place constantinople in its present form is one of the finest cities in the world for its situation and its port it is frequently called the port by way of eminence the prospect from it is noble it abounds with antiquities the mosque of st sophia once a christian church is thought to exceed in grandeur and architecture st peters at rome the city itself is built in a triangular form with the seraglio standing on the point of the angles from whence there is a delightful prospect of the coast of the lesser asia which is not to be equalled it stands like ancient rome on seven hills and by an express order inscribed on a stonepillar was called new rome but so little of the ancient city remains that constantine as i have observed would scarce know it again though ancient byzantium was reckoned the most delightful and at the same time the most convenient place for trade in the whole world yet of the present constantinople it may be said that nothing can exceed it in point of situation and neighborhood  plan of the city of constantinople

the sea running from the canal of the black sea and washing one side of that triangular piece of ground on which byzantium stood to form a better idea of this description we must refer the reader to the plan annexed this harbor is about three miles long and one broad capacious enough to hold   00 sail of ships and so deep that ships of great burden may unload at the very quays it is necessary only to throw out a plank to get on shore the harbor is in the form of a crescent north of the city and a small river of fresh water empties itself into it at the upper end here the fresh water is dammed up for convenience and formed into square basins to imitate those of marly the noblest view of this metropolis is either taken from the middle of the harbor or from the suburbs of galata on the opposite side from hence as the city standing upon ground rising gradually from the waters edge a considerable way back and the houses being so disposed that one does not obstruct the sight of another the whole forms a circular and magnificent amphitheatre so as that the whole may be seen at one view and when the sun shines upon it the multitude of glittering domes and gilded spires seen intermixed with groves of cypress and evergreens exhibits a sight unparalleled in any part of the globe  the seraglio as we have observed stands on the point of the triangle which runs out between the white sea and the harbor and underneath this palace on the declivity of the hill are the gardens at the other angle on the white sea stands the castle of the seven towers built before the city came into the possession of the turks and used as a prison for statecriminals on the third angle at the extremity of the harbor are the ruins of constantines palace  the harbor of constantinople says sertini is about two miles in circumference and the city about twelve the number of gates that we reckoned up in making the tour of the walls including those which go into the seraglio and into the gardens amounted to twentyfive  we must say something more of this harbor so worthy admiration its entrance being placed between the white and black sea whose streams are opposite each other when the wind prevents ships from coming to the city by one of these channels it serves to bring them down by the other for there are but two sorts of wind that blow here the north and the south when the north wind blows nothing can be brought from the white sea to constantinople because vessels cannot get into the canal or bosphorus but then ships coming down the canal from the euxine or black sea having a fair wind can get up to the city and furnish it with provision and whatever else is wanting on the contrary when the wind is in the south nothing can be brought from the black sea but any ship may sail up the canal from the white sea so that these two winds may be considered the two keys of constantinople which open and shut up the passage  the air in summer would be very hot and sufficating were it not for a breeze which comes every afternoon from the mouth of the harbor yet the city is so very healthy that no diseases are known here besides the plague but it is very subject to earthquakes two of which are sometimes felt in a day  this city is of uncommon extent having twentyfive gates six of which are on the land side and nineteen toward the sea there is a double wall on the land side each of which has a large trench belonging to it the cannon and the portholes are near twohundred and fifty in all the inner wall is at least eighteen feet high so that it serves to defend the outermost wall both of them are built up in some places with freestone and in others with brick  this double wall is said to have been built under the reign of the younger theodosius by cyrus the governor with which the people were so pleased that they gave public demonstrations of their joy and made verses in its commendation which were sung about the streets they said constantine had indeed erected the city but that cyrus had enlarged and adorned it they even went so far as to propose changing its name into that of cyrople at this theodosius was so jealous that he ordered cyrus to be confined in a monastery where he died of grief  the style of the architecture of these walls and towers says lady craven is exactly like that of warwick and berkeley castles but many of the square towers which serve as gateways are mouldering away under the negligence of the turks most of whom believe in an ancient prophecy which announces that the time is near when the empress of russia is to make her public and triumphal entry through one of these towers as empress of greece into constantinople many of the turks have even made up their minds and already taken measures to transport themselves across the bosphorus into asia nay some go so very far as to point to the very identical gateway through which the empress is to proceed to some nations it would be very agreeable that the turkish empire were driven from a situation which seems by nature formed as an universal passage for trading nations which the inactivity of the turks has too long obstructed and it is to be wished by all those who bear any respect to the best monuments of sculpture that athens and all it yet contains might not by mohammedan ignorance be entirely destroyed at present ruins that would adorn a virtuosos cabinet are daily burnt into lime by the turks and pieces of exquisite workmanship stuck into a wall or a fountain  situated at the eastern extremity of europe near the black sea it is only separated from asia by the bosphorus of thrace which channel forms a communication as has been before remarked between the two seas and discharges on the south side that surplus of waters which the black sea pours into it from the north as the current runs first into the harbor and circulates round it before it rejoins the stream into the white sea the port of constantinople is continually cleansing itself from all the rubbish and filth with which it is daily encumbered  if ambition desirous of universal dominion had consulted a map of the world to discover the most proper situation for the capital of its empire that of constantinople without doubt had been preferred placed between two seas this city would be at once the center of agriculture commerce arts and sciences did not the infatuated hand of despotism break every instrument of culture and industry for twenty leagues round constantinople enclosed within the circle of its ancient walls presents the traveller with nothing on the land side but an appearance of dissolution while toward the sea a thousand vessels in the center of an immense amphitheatre are continually arriving from all nations to bring that tribute which the whole world owes to its metropolis ancient byzantium the walls of which serve at present for the boundaries to the seraglio of the grand signor placed on the extremity of the cape which forms and shuts in the port presents to the eye a forest of cypresstrees the tops of which surmounted by an infinite number of cupolas covered with lead and ornamented with gilded globes form a pyramid with the tower of the divan which rises above them this group strongly shaded seems to detach itself from the rest of the picture which presents no other variety but that of some scattered edifices that heavily overpower the objects by which they are surrounded the port from the headland of the seraglio to the fresh waters the name given to that river which falls into the sea at the bottom of the port extends above two thousand fathoms farther in length than the other sides of that triangle by which constantinople is bounded  on the opposite shore are the immense suburbs which enclose the city of galata and these present a picture the richness of which is still farther increased and diversified by the successive villages which unite and blend themselves on the edge of the bosphorus for six leagues toward the black sea this chain of buildings continued on the coast of asia rejoins at scrutari which city being only a little more than a mile from the entrance of the port to which it is opposite is as it were another suburb to constantinople and affords it a most enchanting prospect the boats which incessantly traverse the space that lies between the two cities seem to unite europe with asia in the morning other boats convey the villagers of the bosphorus to the labor of the capital by which they are maintained and bring them back to their houses in the evening an infinite number of small vessels are likewise employed for the convenience of the inhabitants and if we add the transports passing and repassing and carrying those provisions to the capital which the black sea and the archipelago daily furnish together with the activity of foreign commerce pouring in perpetual supplies for elegance and luxury we shall have some small idea of the motion which constantly agitates this busy scene  how shall i give you an adequate idea says sertini of the prodigious quantity of different kinds of vessels which are to be seen in the harbor of constantinople the number of persons continually going from constantinople to galata and other places is so great that the harbor has more the appearance of a high road crowded with passengers than of a sea the boats most frequently made use of are so light that they are only to be kept in a proper equilibrium when sailing by the watermen skilfully humouring their oars and the position of their bodies to the motion of the wind  but though nothing can please the eye more than the external appearance of constantinople the charm is immediately dissolved on entering the city the narrowness of the greater part of the streets where the overhanging roofs of the houses scarcely leave a passage for the light the flinty pavement of which no care is taken and the want of every kind of cleanliness are says baron tott among the smallest faults of this capital  the number of houses in this city must needs be prodigious since one fire alone has been known to burn down  0000 in a day without greatly changing the aspect of the city they compute about    0 streets in the city small and great but they are seldom or ever clean to add to the inconvenience of being narrow and dirty they are likewise slippery as they in general run along some declivity and most of the houses are low being built only of wood and plaster yet crowded with inhabitants the best houses stand in places which are least subject to any great concourse of people and where the city is most thinly inhabited and the finest buildings are without the city near the harbor the street called adrianople is the longest and broadest there is no order no architecture no dignity to be found in the houses says habesci the mosques or churches alone merit the attention of strangers and of these there are     great and small ten of them are called royal mosques and are truly superb but after viewing that of st sophia which we shall hereafter particularly notice there is little to be seen in the rest for they are all built on one plan however their situations are delightful and not incumbered with surrounding buildings as in other cities and on that account they attract the notice of passengers st sophia is nearly opposite the great gate of the seraglio from whence the ottoman court takes the name of the sublime port  there are a great number of large squares in constantinople but only two of them kept in good order the rest are filthy and quite neglected the principal and the most beautiful is the square of sultan achmet in the center of which are two superb marble pyramids one ornamented with hieroglyphics the other plain the bases of these pyramids rest upon four large marble globes which repose upon fine square pedestals in the same square are the remains of a noble column in the form of a serpent made of brass which the turks when they took constantinople mistaking for gold began to demolish but were prevented by their officers on finding it to be merely base metal  the square which habesci calls the square of sultana achmet is called by the turks atmeiden or a place of horses and by the ancients the hippodrome or circus in the time of the eastern emperors this was the place where the horseraces were held and on extraordinary occasions public shows were exhibited the custom of exercising horses in this place still continues feats of activity are likewise displayed by the turks here in throwing the gerit or dart on full gallop its dimensions are still the same as formerly  00 paces long and  00 broad forming an oblong square flanked on three of the sides with houses and on the fourth with the walls of the mosque of sultan achmet between friends says lady montague our squares would make a pitiful figure compared with this as our cathedral of st pauls would with the mosque of st sophia the account which lady m  gives of the column and pillar seems so much more accurate and more to be depended on than that of habesci that we shall take the liberty to notice it in the midst of the hippodrome is a brazen column of three serpents twisted together with their mouths gaping  it is impossible says she to learn why so odd a pillar was erected the greeks can give nothing but fabulous legends when they are asked the meaning of it and there is no sign of its ever having had any inscription at the upper end is an obelisk of porphyry probably brought from egypt the hieroglyphics all very entire which by many persons are considered as so many ancient puns it is placed upon four little brazen pillars a pedestal of square free stone full of figures in basrelief on two sides one square representing a battle another an assembly the others have inscriptions in greek and latin  it is supposed this obelisk was built in the time of the emperor constantine from the inscriptions it appears that the emperor theodosius caused it to be set up again after it had lain a long time on the ground and the engines which were made use of in raising it are represented in basrelief the obelisk is described to be of granite or thebaic marble composed on one single shaft about fifty feet high and terminating in a point  the turks says chishull inform travelers that this brass serpentine pillar was erected by the emperor leo as a charm against the malignity of those dreadful serpents which at that time infested the city and neighhood others imagine that by the three serpents are symbolically represented the three parts of the world for the fourth was not then discovered and that the union of them into one represented the union of three parts of the world which at that time was but one body by the union of the eastern and western empires  in the great street which runs from the gate of adrianople to the seraglio there is another column without any sculpture but yet much richer than any of the former because it is of porphyry at present it is scarce possible to distinguish it from common marble it being very much discolored by a fire that many years since burnt down the houses surrounding it this pillar says chishull has been defaced by different conflagrations and has been bound with seven rings of iron by the emperor manuel as an inscription upon its summit denotes  habesci says it is of a surprising height and the chief material is bitumen but badly put together yet it appears says he to have been purposely constructed in that rude manner upon the whole this column is a great mystery for no person can explain its meaning the turks hold it in veneration and different sultans have occasionally alighted from their horses and descended into the subterranean chambers under it to view its curiosities the christians likewise venerate this column and pretend that there may still be seen in the cavern those baskets which our savior ordered to be filled with the fragments of loaves and fishes after he had fed the multitude in the desert the mussulmen do not deny this but they add that in the said cavern there are in a small box made of a single brilliant some drops of the seed of mahomet and that whoever touches this box is sure to have children  there stood another pillar in this city called the historical pillar now no more it dropped down says lady m  about two years before i came into this part of the world it was a column in honor of arcadius and being almost the only vestige of antiquity in that famous city of the world we shall relate chishulls account of it who saw it this lofty and aspiring pillar says he is of the doric order and built with wonderful regularity and exactness of architecture bearing on the basis and on the whole shaft from top to bottom various warlike figures of men in arms chariots galleys and other ornaments which in a spiral manner encircle the whole pillar every figure being so well proportioned to the distance from whence it is seen that those at the top the middle and the bottom appear to the eye exactly of the same size  it is called the historical column because all the remarkable events during the reign of arcadius were represented on its different sides in the same manner as those of trajan are represented on his pillar at rome but this latter is only     feet in height whereas the former was     feet high according to gylliuss account who has given so accurate a description of constantinople it is a pity that so remarkable a monument should have been suffered to have perished by the negligence of the turks to which it was probably more owing than to the barbarous hand of time spon and wheeler mention their having discovered in the house of a private turkish nobleman a column of the emperor marcian it is entirely of spotted marble about fifteen feet high and its capital of the corinthian order upon its top is a square hollow stone adorned with four eagles at the four corners in which the heart of that prince is supposed to be deposited two verses at the foot of the column acquaint the reader also that the body of marcian lies beneath the column  the square of sultan bajazet is not quite so large as the former but it is delightfully situated on one of the seven hills on which constantinople is built this square is ornamented with some stately buildings particularly with the mosque of sultan bajazet and the old seraglio which was formerly the palace of the emperor constantine the great and of some of his successors the house of the aga or commander in chief of the janissaries stands upon the ascent to the square and on this account is much frequented by persons of rank fairs are likewise kept here which makes it the resort of merchants and traders  near the komcapi or sand gate there is a small mosque formerly a christian church every christian is prohibited entering the street in which it is situated under pain of death and the reason given for this by the turks is that the prophet occasionally shows himself in this mosque in all his glory and delivers his special orders to his faithful disciples there are mussulmen says habesci above the common sort who assured me very sincerely that they had had the happiness to see the sacred prophet but that the splendor of the rays with which he was surrounded deprived them for a short time of their sight  after having passed the gate of the seraglio which leads to the first court on the left hand there is a large building which was formerly the private church of the patriarch st john of chrysostom but at present used as a repository for the arms and banners taken from the enemy in the time of war in the gallery of the second floor is the tomb of the holy patriarch and his effigy in stone from the tomb issues a spring of water which the superstitious esteem as a remedy for all diseases the christians make use of it and pay the turks very dear for this medicine near this tomb is a large chamber which is always kept shut and is said to be full of the bodies of saints the turks keep a lamp constantly burning in it it was upon the square before this church that the empress eudoxia caused her statue to be erected that she might be held in veneration by the people which occasioned the ruin of st john of chrysostom  those who wish to see enormous columns of marble larger than any to be found elsewhere may visit the square of abla sultana before the seraglio in which great quantities may be seen lying on the ground there are also two lions made of one block of marble with the pedestals on which they are supported  many other curiosities were dispersed in different parts of this city but the sultans osman mahomed and mustapha took them to adorn the side of their seraglio where they are hid from public view  the exchanges says lady m are all noble buildings full of fine alleys the greatest part supported with pillars and kept wonderfully neat every trade has its distinct alley where there are shops in the same order as in exeterchange at london the bisisten or jewellers quarter exhibits so much wealth such a profusion of diamonds and all kinds of precious stones as to dazzle the sight whilst the port says lady c delays erecting batteries upon the most important posts under the pretense of wanting money to purchase materials necessary for the defense of the empire the jewellers cannot find diamonds enough to supply the demands of the haram but it is the quantity not the quality of this stone that they prize  scarcely any other than rose diamonds are to be seen here the embroiderers quarter is also very glittering and the people walk here as much for diversion as business the markets are most of them handsome squares and admirably well provided perhaps better than in any other part of the world  the bazars and the khans deserve to be noticed for their public utility though they are plain simple edifices that do not add to the splendor of the city these are stone buildings well secured from fire and thieves the bazars contain two rows of shops all supported by arches and which receive their light from the cupolas at the top they are shut every night with iron gates and guards are placed within each bazar has an aga or superintendant who lets the shops at a high price but which is paid with cheerfulness on account of the safety of the effects  the khans are a different kind of buildings which serve for the residence of foreign merchants and as warehouses for their commodities they very much resemble the convents of friars in christian countries having cloisters open to an interior quadrangle in which each merchant has a little chamber to sleep in a kitchen and one or more rooms for his merchandise there are likewise large vaults under these cloisters to which the merchandise may be removed in case of fire but it was never known to be necessary for as the whole building is of stone supported on arches and every necessary precaution taken no instance can be given of any damage happening from either fire or thieves to the effects lodged in a khan  a merchant has only to apply to the superintendant and he will assign him a lodging on paying down a quarter or half a piaster which is about four shillings besides two or three aspers a day whilst he remains there an asper is something more than a halfpenny so that the demand is not very exorbitant the noblest khan is that called valide khan it was built by a dowager empress here foreigners always find accommodations on very easy terms and a quilt or two a carpet and some cushions are all the furniture requisite the revenue arising from these khans is usually applied to some pious or charitable institution  there are some khans appropriated entirely to travelers where they are not only lodged gratis but are also furnished with rice and flesh if they will accept it which is seldom taken provisions being so exceedingly reasonable in this metropolis  the new seraglio most of the mosques the bazars and the khans are the only stone buildings all the private houses are built with wood they are painted on the outside with different colors which gives them an air of gaiety and the novelty of the sight cannot but be pleasing to strangers though the houses are built only of wood and plaster as has been observed before they are very convenient and richly furnished most of them command fine prospects toward the sea there are no carriages for the transportation of goods in this city porters are the general vehicles made use of except for timber which is carried on the backs of horses  the inhabitants are extremely clean and well dressed especially the turks in gay colors and the cleanest turbans each person here is distinguished by his dress and the variety of different shaped turbans denote the situations of the different wearers  the ladies wear robes of green red yellow and blue covering their under dress entirely which is very rich they wear a large wrapping piece of muslin over their head as low as their eye brows and another on their chin reaching says lord baltimore to the top of their nose so that their eyes only are uncovered they walk very much about the street contrary to the received opinion hitherto of their never stirring from their houses and the boats on the canals are full of them  the marketplaces and large streets in the city of constantinople says his lordship are almost covered with sheds the merchandise is set forth in the neatest manner but the dust among such a number of people being confined is exceeding troublesome the quantity of boats in the canal is very great the boats themselves adds his lordship are the best built he ever saw and the rowers most incomparable  the streets of pera and constantinople likewise remarks lady craven are so narrow that few of them admit a carriage the windows of every story project over those under them so that at the upper story people may sometimes shake hands across the street no turk makes a visit if it be only four doors from his own house but on horseback and on my arrival here says her ladyship i saw one who landed in a boat and had a fine gray horse led by four men that went a long way round which he mounted gravely to alight from in a few moments  the ravages made by fires at constantinople are not to be wondered at when it is considered that wooden houses are destroyed in a few minutes and that the flames meet with no interruption from party walls sometimes the communication has been so rapid that all efforts to stop the devastation have been fruitless in the reign of sultan mahmud   000 houses were destroyed by one fire and the sultan finding every effort to prevent the spreading of the flames unsuccessful at last cried out that he was convinced the fire came from heaven and ordered the workmen who were endeavoring to stop it to desist but the most remarkable circumstance concerning fires in this city is that after the destruction of four or five thousand houses the whole is rebuilt again in twenty or thirty days and no appearance remains of the calamity  there are several causes of the frequent fires in this place very few of them happen by accident though the houses are of wood but it is this circumstance which is the great temptation to setting them on fire wilfully  the principal incendiaries are the janissaries when they are discontented with the administration but more particularly when they dislike the grand vizir they set fire to different parts of the city at once and repeat this villainy till they oblige the grand signor to remove his prime minister fires from this cause have even been the signal for deposing the sultans when their wishes were not gratified upon the breaking out of a war they will likewise set fire to the city or suburbs that they may pillage a booty sufficient to defray the expenses of the campaign before they marched against the russians in the last war they set fire to three different quarters of galata and raised a considerable sum of money at the expense of the poor sufferers yet such was the weakness and timidity of the government that no example was made though undoubted evidence was given of the fact  the slaves when they can place a confidence in each other and can get together secretly in any number set fire to particular quarters to revenge themselves on their masters and for the sake of plunder lastly the timber merchants and ironmongers whose fortunes depend on frequent fires are strongly suspected of employing private agents to promote these diabolical practices  to effect their purpose says baron tott they commonly use coundaks these consist of a small bundle of splinters of pine wood in the middle of which is a piece of amadoue a kind of combustible fungus like tinder wrapped up in cotton and dipped in sulphur these coundaks they secretly place behind any door they find open or put it within side of a window and having set it on fire make off no more is necessary he adds to cause the most terrible ravages in a city where the houses being built of timber and painted with oil of aspic are easily reduced to ashes by the first villain who makes the attempt  lady m mentions their extraordinary way of warming themselves as another cause of frequent fire which is neither by chimnies nor stoves but by a certain machine called a tendour about two feet high in the form of a table covered with a fine carpet or embroidery this is made of wood and they put into it a small quantity of hot ashes and sit with their legs under the carpet at this table they work read and very often sleep and if they chance to dream and kick down the tendour the hot ashes will then set the house on fire most families says her ladyship have had their houses burnt down once or twice and when fires of this sort happen the owners seem not at all concerned at their misfortune but put their goods into a bark and see their houses burn with great composure their persons being very seldom endangered having no stairs to descend  the vizir and all the great officers of the port are obliged to hasten on the first notice to any place where a fire breaks out in order to give such directions as may be thought necessary and if it increases to any alarming degree the grand signor himself never fails to attend the means of his conveyance are always at hand horses stand saddled and boats are kept in readiness both by day and night for this purpose the great officers likewise take the same precautions and are frequently awaked out of their sleep to attend on these occasions  certain watchmen are appointed at the different quarters whose business it is to give notice of any fire on the appearance of which they run through their district beat the pavement with great staves headed with iron and awake the inhabitants by the cry of yanjenvar there is a fire and tell in what part of the city it is there is likewise a watchman placed in a very lofty tower built in the palace of the aga of the janissaries which commands a prospect of constantinople and another in a tower of galata whose vigilance is employed on the same object from these towers an alarm is given by beating on great drums which is presently spread a long way round and brings together great numbers but too deeply interested in the accident and who often arrive too late at their several shops to prevent their being either burnt or plundered  baron tott mentions a conflagration which during his residence destroyed the palace of the grand vizir and above twothirds of this prodigious city the fire broke out near the sea and the walls of the seraglio the wind which blew from the north drove the flame along the walls and about seven oclock they reached the palace of the vizir the grand signor had gone thither but neither his orders nor the endeavor made to save this immense edifice could preserve it and the embers it afforded by giving a fresh activity to the flames continued to extend the fire with great rapidity it was nevertheless hoped that when it reached the mosque of sancta sophia that massy building would have proved its boundary every exertion was therefore made in that quarter and the prospect of being able to put a stop to the progress of the flames became probable when the lead of the cupola melted by the flaming atmosphere streaming down the stoney gutters on the guards and assistants formed an open field for the fury of the fire  from that moment all hopes of restraining it were given up and it was suffered to destroy every thing quite up to the walls near the sea on the other side of the hill the consternation now became general yet it seemed some consolation to suppose it had reached its utmost limits when the wind suddenly changing to the east and blowing strong took this line of fire of more than   00 fathoms in length crossways and driving it toward the center of the city divided it into thirteen branches the roots of which successively uniting presently rendered constantinople one continued dreadful sheet of flame  a whole regiment of janissaries employed to pull down the houses at the end of one of the branches where the fire spread was hemmed in on every side and perished by the rapid advances of the flames the cries of these unhappy wretches with those of the women and children who underwent the same fate the noise of the falling buildings the crackling of pieces of timber driven into the atmosphere by the violence of the fire the tumult of the inhabitants whom the conflagration threatened on every side and who to secure themselves from the miseries of want hazarded their lives to preserve some part of their property all concurred to form a scene of horror which no language can describe  the environs of constantinople are delightful galata is the principal suburb and pera is properly speaking the suburb of galata these are the places in which the christians have fixed their residence all the foreign ministers inhabit pera it stands upon an ascent from which there is a distinct view of the greatest part of the city the streets of pera are so full of europeans as to give it the appearance of a capital town in some christian country the canal says habesci which separates this fine country from natolia in asia is about twice the breadth of the thames at london and the opposite shore presents the same chain of villages that commence with scutari which is opposite the seraglio and precisely on the point of land is the tower of leander as it is called which is at present a lighthouse for ships coming in and going out of the canal and on the coast of the black sea this tower says le brun which the europeans call the tower of leander and the turks the tower of the virgin lies between scutari and the seraglio but nearer to the coast of asia than that of europe it is a very strong place well fortified and serves to defend the pass between the black and white seas why it should be called leanders tower does not appear since it was not there but at the dardanelles where leander swam over to see his mistress hero  the name which the europeans give it would make us believe that they supposed it to have been formerly the habitation of hero but we must be very cautious in these kind of conjectures to avoid being exceedingly absurd some travelers have placed a pompeys pillar at the mouth of the black sea which was never visited by that illustrious roman they have called by the same name another column at alexandria which he certainly never erected and to return to constantinople there is to be seen near the euxine sea an ancient tower still remaining among the ruins of several others of the same kind which built in a line at proper distances from each other were formerly used to repeat signals on the approach of the vessels of the cossacks who had made themselves dreaded by their piracies on the black sea this desolate tower wanted a name in that country of ignorance and barbarism and our europeans who have the opposite folly of seeming to know and explain every thing have called it the tower of ovid  scutari though situated in asia on the opposite side of the canal is generally considered as making part of the suburbs of this immense city it is the rendezvous of the merchants and caravans which come to constantinople from armenia and persia and is the only considerable town on the asiatic side of the bosphorus  there is a way from the city of constantinople to the suburbs of galata and pera by land in making the tour of the harbor but then there is the small river to cross which we have noticed before at the upper end in going this way the road lies over a spacious plain called the ocmeidan where the turks exercise themselves with their bows and arrows and where they go in procession at the commencement of a war to implore success on their arms near the waterside is their great arsenal where the principal officers belonging their marine reside the inhabitants of galata are chiefly supported by the taverns and publichouses with which this town abounds and where wine is drunk as customarily as in other cities strangers not being here under the least restraint either in their mode of living or of worship even the turks themselves will sometimes come here in order to carouse the private houses in pera are much more splendid than those within the walls of constantinople and chiefly tenanted by the greeks of high rank as well as by the foreign ambassadors two of these ambassadors we should have observed are privileged to reside within the walls of the city those from the emperor and the king of poland so that necessity as well as choice obliges the rest to reside here pera being upon a prominence overlooks as it were tophana which is situated under pera on the canal opposite the seraglio the houses of galata pera and tophana are so situated from their being one higher than the other that they form a kind of amphitheatre which commands a pleasant view of the city of constantinople the harbor and the sea  in the burial place of the dervises at pera is the tomb of the famous count de bonneval whose debts and extravagances obliged him to leave france and turn mohammedan the inscription mentions him to have been a person highly esteemed by the franks who besides having had the good fortune to embrace the only true religion had likewise the additional happiness to die on the anniversary of the prophet a proof says bisani that the turkish beaux esprits may very justly put in their claim for the honor of founding an academy of inscriptions  to avoid being circumcised this celebrated character in the french annals had recourse to artifice he never went to public prayers not even on fridays but kept an iman in his house whom he used to term his father confessor he dined frequently with the foreign ambassadors where he partook of every thing that was brought to table without exception but at home he eat no pork not drank any wine and kept the fast of ramazan very rigorously he had a french cook in his service and any foreigner of his acquaintance that chose to dine with him had only to say pilau and a cover was laid for him to show what a singular kind of man he was we will mention some traits of humor in him which seem rather puerile but which will help to form some idea of the eccentricity of his character in his salle a manger there was a prodigious quantity of birds among other kinds a great many parrots as soon as the company were assembled and began to talk the birds immediately set up their notes and the parrots in particular accompanied them with a noise that perfectly stunned every one and this harmonious music used to delight the count beyond expression afterward before the dinner was served up he had a very large dish brought to him full of bits and scraps of meat on a signal given all the cats in the neighborhood were collected together to the number of above three hundred he then threw out these scraps of meat to them which the cats in contending for used to fight and scratch and tear one another to pieces this skirmish among the cats pleased him very much among them there was one very small and entirely white but which contrary to the usual custom of cats was very dirty and filthy the count called this the kings son  this extraordinary man was always singing jouissons du present lavenir est des sots etc i e let us enjoy the time present and leave futurity to fools ambition was the rock he spilt upon and made him commit faults which he could never after retrieve one evening while there was a concert at the ambassadors he was seen in tears as our first ideas like our first habits present themselves again to our imagination as old age comes upon us and the present moment no longer occupies our thoughts so it was with the count he began at last to grow tired of his situation and to regret his country and his religion he accordingly wrote to his friends to obtain his pardon measures were in consequence concerted to procure him his liberty and the pope was already disposed to receive this prodigal son again into the bosom of the church whom necessity had obliged to abjure his religion but fate which so often counteracts the best concerted plans of mortals did not permit him to enjoy this happiness for the gout to which he was subject attacked him afresh in his stomach and he died a priest had been sent to him in disguise but the turks finding out who he was would not suffer him to remain in the house he died in a kind of transport saying quand les cochons sont sortis de letable il faut en fermer la port i e when the pigs have quitted their sty the door should be shut which shows says bisani that his thoughts were turned toward christianity for it is well known the turks do not like this animal and never keep any of them he was made a bashaw of two tails and had an income from the port of   000 piastres a year  tophana which is the remaining part of the suburbs has its name from being the foundery of cannon and artillery for the turkish empire which are all cast here  including these suburbs constantinople is about thirty miles in circumference but within the walls it is not calculated to be more than eleven or twelve exclusive of the seraglio which makes an additional three or four miles there is also another seraglio two miles in circumference called the old seraglio and which is the residence of the sultanas belonging to former emperors  the unequal heights of this city says lady m make it seem as large again as it is though one of the largest cities in the world showing an agreeable mixture of gardens pine and cypress trees palaces mosques and public buildings raised one above another with as much beauty and appearance of symmetry as ever was seen in a cabinet adorned by the most skilful hands where jars show themselves above jars mixed with canisters babies and candlesticks this is a very odd comparison but it gives me says her ladyship an exact idea of the place  nothing can be imagined more delightful than the approach to constantinople by water one is in the midst of three large arms of the sea of which one comes from the northeast another runs to the northwest and the third formed of the other two throws itself into the white sea these three arms of the sea wash as far as one can see fields which terminate in little hills covered with gardens and villas and the nearer these channels approach the city the more houses stand upon them which seem to be raised one above the other among these houses the fronts of which are painted after various manners is to be seen an incredible number of large domes cupolas and minarets or circular turrets gilt which overlook the rest of the buildings  the verdant foliage of the cypresses and other large trees which are in most of the gardens add very much to the delicious prospect the many ships which lie in the harbor make a spacious circle of trees whose leaves seem stripped off on purpose to give the spectator a full view of all the beauties that lie behind them and the prodigious multitude of caicks gondolas and other smaller wherries to the number of above   000 some with sails others with oars some on parties of pleasure and the rest for the necessary intercourse of the inhabitants continually represents a sort of sea fight  in short let a person cast his eyes in whatever direction when in the middle of the harbor of this great city and he will not cease to admire how much nature has contributed toward the beauty and ornament of its situation  no wonder therefore constantine could so easily give up the pleasures of rome to transfer the seat of his empire to byzantium and call it by his own name there is not in the universe a city more proper to be the seat of an emperor of the world it overlooks at once two of the most considerable districts and in less than a quarter of an hour orders may be dispatched from europe in which it is situated into asia that seems to approach it so near in order to be subject to its laws and should art and nature combine to form a situation where beauty and plenty might meet they would never succeed better than in making constantinople what it is  the land produces all kinds of delicious fruits which can either please the eye or gratify the taste nor is any thing wanting that conduces either to the comforts and conveniences or to the luxuries of life the water both fresh and salt furnishes every thing that can be required from that useful element the air is admirable and the continual chirping of an infinite number of birds on the trees in the gardens and upon the cottages seem to proclaim this climate to be the finest in the world the amphibious creatures which live sometimes in the water sometimes on the land and sometimes in the air are very numerous which would induce one to believe that these three elements are here in the highest degree of perfection and temperature  this prodigality of nature in her gifts made the emperor justinian say it was better to abandon all the rest of the world to live at constantinople than leave so pleasant a country depopulated which had been the fate of several other great cities on this idea he changed its name into that of the everlasting city however these were not the only names it has received having had almost as many names as masters  the castle of the seven towers which joins these walls is the first building on the landside and forms one of the angles of constantinople that catches the eye in approaching it by the propontis or white sea it was formerly one of the gates of the city and consisted of four large turrets the ancients called it the gilded gate either because the decorations with which it was adorned were really gilt or because the public entries were generally made through this gate  to the four ancient towers of this gate mahomet ii added three new ones in order to make it strong enough to keep the treasures of the empire it is built of freestone and environed with a wall and several smaller towers some of which in the year      fell into ruins it is at present used as a state prison  the beautiful remains of this gate are still admirable says chishull though suffered by the turks to be almost concealed by a dead wall and the shade of the neighboring trees it is a regular and carved arch of white marble supported by two beautiful pillars adorned in the pilasters with a sculpture representing several military achievements and flanked on each side the pillars with twelve tablets of carved work extremely well performed containing many poetical stories among the rest is that of hercules and the nemaean lion the beast prodigious and terrible but confessing its conqueror by an agreeable posture luna and endymion a winged pegasus managed by some of the muses a portraiture of the known combat of whirlbats and an imperial figure crowned by two celestial machines  this city excels in fine mosques the most remarkable is that of st sophia it was built by the emperor justin and afterward enlarged and beautified by justinian the dedication of it was to the divine wisdom and for that reason it was called sophia a title which the turks still retain this church says le brun which is square without and round within is alone worth the trouble of a journey to constantinople to have a view of it the situation is very advantageous being upon an eminence in the finest part of the town from whence there is a gradual descent to the sea it consists of a spacious court enriched all round with fair and regular cloisters formed by pillars some of whose shafts are carved with white marble some with serpentine stone and some with porphyry but all the capitals are of the modern turkish figure next is the body of the mosque covered outwardly with domes and supported inwardly with four massy pillars from the tops of which rises a regular cupola forming the roof of the whole mosque this dome is not to equalled in the world it resembles that of st peters at rome only of a much greater circumference and is said to be one hundred and thirteen feet in diameter built upon arches sustained by vast pillars of marble of which the pavement and staircase are likewise marble it has two rows of galleries by pillars of particolored marble and the whole roof is of mosaic work its composition a kind of paste with which counterfeit jewels are made  a portico or piazza thirtysix feet in breadth supported by marble columns extends the whole length of the front this in the time of the greek emperors served for a vestibulum this piazza has a communication with the church by nine large folding doors the leaves of which are brass and adorned with basreliefs extremely magnificent the church was painted after the mosaic manner with crosses and images of our savior the virgin mary and other saints which appear still though the turks have defaced the heads of them suffering no images in their mosques there is a tomb in this church which they imagine to be that of constantine on the day of their bairam or passover there are generally above  0000 persons assembled in it at which time there are above seven thousand lamps lighted up in the church besides above three thousand in the minarets  the minarets have the appearance of pillars and are little hollow towers four or five feet in diameter rising of an equal thickness from the corner of the mosque as high as the cupolas where a gallery projecting about twenty or thirty inches communicates with the winding staircase leading there by a small door always directed eastward toward mecca the minaret then diminishing about a quarter of its thickness continues to rise a fifth or sixth part higher and ends in a pointed top covered with lead and terminated by a kind of crescent the two extremities of which curved like spirals and brought near together commonly enclose the name of god cut in metal  the floor of this and indeed of all the mosques is fine marble and covered with mat the mahometans being expressly enjoined to take off their slippers when they enter them agreeable to our text of scripture take thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou stand is holy ground  different sultans have built small chapels round this mosque of st sophia which serve as tombs for themselves and their families in these oratories lamps are continually burning and persons paid to pray for the souls of the deceased these persons live there lest they should lose time in going and returning it must be acknowledged however in order to counterbalance this superstition that the custom of giving considerable sums daily to the poor at this mosque at certain hours is meritorious and exemplary  there are some other mosques says chishull which claim the admiration of strangers the mosque of sultan achmet which exceeds that of st sophia in dimensions and is built of very fine marble brought from the ruins of troy and chalcedon the mausoleum of its founder and his sultana are placed in one of the chapels the coffin is covered with fine embroidery representing the town of mecca and at the head is placed his turban decked with a tuft of herons feathers and enriched with precious stones the whole chapel is also illuminated with an immense number of lamps and tapers kept constantly burning secondly that of sultan bajazet which though less in circumference than the former is more to be admired for its ornaments and workmanship in this mosque on great festivals the turks are accustomed to display the name of the grand signor or some besieged town on the walls with particolored lamps  at the festival of the great beiram the grand signor goes in procession to this mosque the cavalcade which issues from the seraglio on this occasion is one of the finest sights in europe says lord baltimore it consists of vizirs bashaws and all the great civil and military officers of the empire who go to pay their respects to the sultan they begin to issue forth from the seraglio at four oclock in the morning and the procession continues till nine when the grand signor appears there is a deep silence every where the janissaries line the street from the palace to the mosque they are without arms and stand with their arms across bowing themselves down only to the grand signor and the vizirs who return their salute i asked a captain of the janissaries says his lordship why they had no arms arms said he you infidel they are for our enemies we govern our subjects by the law  that of sultan solomon says lady m is an exact square with four fine towers in the angles in the midst is a noble cupola supported with beautiful marble pillars two lesser at the ends supported in the same manner the pavement and gallery round the mosque of marble under the great cupola is a fountain adorned with such fine colored pillars that i can hardly think them natural marble on one side is the pulpit of white marble and on the other a little gallery for the grand signor a fine staircase leads to it built with gilded lattices at the upper end is a sort of altar where the name of god is written and before it stand two candlesticks as high as a man with wax candles as thick as three flambeaux the pavement is spread with fine carpets and the mosque illuminated with a profusion of lamps the court leading to it is very spacious with galleries of marble with green columns covered with twentyeight leaded cupolas on two sides and a fine fountain in the middle  this description says her ladyship may serve for all the mosques in constantinople the model is exactly the same differing only in size and the thickness of the materials  in passing by a mosque says sertini which the present sultan is building we saw in one of the angles a public fountain very elegantly decorated with a great number of beautiful marble columns from seravezza and arabia this fountain is surrounded with an iron grate or bars in the inside of which are a great number of silver embossed goblets and a turk who stands there to fill them with water for any person who may wish to quench his thirst this service is performed gratis to every one for such was the will of the founder the turks says the above author are naturally inclined to these acts of public beneficence there are even some who will leave legacies as we have before remarked for the maintenance of cats and dogs others again who will lay out their money in purchasing birds merely to give them their liberty by letting them fly  about six miles from this city are some famous aqueducts built by valentinian and repaired afterward by solomon the magnificent the most remarkable of these forms three great and lofty fabrics that are built over so many valleys between the hills in order to convey the water from one hill to another till it reaches the city these valleys being very deep and no arch being sufficient to raise a structure high enough one bridge is as it were erected upon the back of another arch over arch till the top of the bridge is on a level with the mountain a hill from which the water flows on this upper bridge is a canal to convey the stream and on each side of the bridge is a colonade through which foot passengers can pass and repass  these aqueducts which supply constantinople with water often serve for a boundary to the excursion of the turks but it will easily be imagined it is neither to admire the architecture nor judge of the salubrity of the waters that they go there in crowds they take great care to carry wine and every thing with them on which they choose to regale and take their post in some ruined kiosks which the emperors built at the same time with the edifices intended to collect the rain water and convey it to the capital  these aqueducts which the turks have been obliged to substitute for the ancient cisterns are so illconstructed that a comparison between them and those of the greeks must make the latter appear a work of great merit yet this edifice built in the time of justinian is no ways remarkable either for the boldness or the lightness of its construction and still less so for true taste the architect seems to have studied only to deceive the eye by a number of masses which appear as if hanging in the air resembling invented cones with too great an angle at the base for as the valley spreads above the upper part of the bridge is considerably longer than the lower  chap iii of the police and the slaves the guard of the city consists of a body of janissaries with their colonel at every gate in all the frequented parts there is also another corpse and in each of the streets another party of two or three men and a patrole continually going their rounds day and night these men are armed only with cudgels but they manage them so skilfully as to be dreaded as much as if they had firearms in almost all the streets there are likewise gates which cut off the communication with other streets such is the manner in which this immense city is guarded where murders seldom happen and where malefactors are almost instantaneously discovered on their commission of any crime  if a robbery or an assault is committed here all the inhabitants of that street are doomed to bear a part of the punishment  such is the invariable law from whence it follows that every inhabitant exerts himself strenuously in driving out any person who begins a dispute from the street where he lives they are also careful that no thief or pickpocket introduces himself among them and being all responsible for each other it is very difficult that any crime can be committed with impunity  this law seems rather severe and in some cases is very much so for instance if a dead body is thrown up on the sea shore which has been strangled or murdered the inhabitants of the village nearest to the place where such dead body is thrown up are obliged to pay a certain fine if they do not discover the parents of the deceased  each quarter has its tribunal where justice is administered in which a cadi or judge attended by his clerks sits the whole day to hear complaints and administer justice which is brought the more speedily to an issue because the payment of the expenses immediately follows  one of the most respectable officers of the civil police is the stamboeffendi whose power is similar if not superior to the lord mayor of london or the lieutenant of police at paris this post is considered as the first step of a professor of the law to those great offices of the state which are in the nomination of the grand signor without any respect to seniority of rank this person has the inspection of all saleable commodities and particularly of the provisions of the capital it is his business to procure an abundance of whatever is requisite for the subsistence of the inhabitants and if any particular article begins to get scarce he endeavors to make an equal distribution of it according to circumstances this post is always filled by some person of consummate prudence and integrity it is highly lucrative as there is not a single article or necessary of life consumed in constantinople from which he does not draw some revenue  he fixes the prices of all kinds of commodities proclaims them publicly and takes care either by himself or his officers that the weights and measures are just and honest he generally goes round the city once amonth or oftener on horseback preceded by four janissaries dressed in their habits of ceremony with their staves in their hands with one of his attendants by his side holding the scales whilst another carries the weights a third the hammer and the rest who accompany him are provided with cudgels and other weapons to punish those who are found guilty  this troop is always preceded by persons in disguise who unexpectedly seize on the bread of some shop or the weights and scales of some fruitseller or vender of any other commodity that may convict a fraudulent dealer  the bread is then brought to the magistrate and put into the scale against the weights it ought to weigh whilst the baker already seized and in the presence of the judge is waiting the sentence which is to acquit or condemn him to the bastinado if not to some more severe punishment such as having his ear nailed to his shop or even to be hanged according to the caprice of his judge but what is most remarkable is that the real baker the proprietor of the oven he whose knavery should be punished is not concerned in this affair he quietly preserves the daily profits of the false weight which incurs punishment and leaves to one of his journeymen or the foreman of his shop all the danger and trouble of this shameful practice who for double pay agrees to personate his master and this advantageous post is immediately solicited by some other when the first gets hanged for such a trifle discourages no one punishments of this sort however are by no means so frequently inflicted as they merit  to these precautions intended to insure honesty in the sale of provisions the government adds the right of fixing the price but things are not paid the less for on that account the multitude is easily deceived they think they have obtained their end when to remedy the dearness of provisions the vizir commands them to be sold at a lower price and going out incognito perhaps orders some bakers journeyman to be hanged no one enquires on what evidence the wretch was put to death but every one thinks the bread better  is it not singular so great a contempt for humanity should be accompanied by the most absurd benevolence toward animals the least useful to society while government enforces the most rigorous monopoly of the corn consumed in the capital by an exaction ruinous to the cultivator and a distribution less burdensome to the baker than the consumer it allows so much per cent in favor of turtle doves a cloud of these birds says baron tott constantly alight on those vessels which cross the port of constantinople uncovered in order to carry the commodity to the magazines or the mills the boatmen never oppose their greediness this permission to feed on the grain collects them together in great numbers and familiarises them so much that i have seen them standing on the shoulders of the rowers watching for a vacant spot where they might fill their crops in their turn  the turks are great lovers of order he who brings his provisions to market first has the privilege of vending them before those who come after him but then he is not to exact more than a fixed price for them if he sells any kind of provisions whatever dearer than the price put upon them by the proper officer appointed for that purpose he is liable to be punished this punishment is of three kinds according to the nature of the offense hanging the bastinado or some pecuniary fine the bastinado is inflicted on the soles of the feet  the divan is a tribunal open to every one to strangers as well as natives a grand council is always held once aweek on tuesday evening in the seraglio of the grand signor who is present without showing himself at a latticed window above the place where the grand vizir sits which is opposite the door of the councilroom where every one enters in this manner he can hear the debates and the orders given by the grand vizir and the rest of the ministers without being seen  there is perhaps no monarch so accessible as the grand signor all his subjects indiscriminately mahometans christians and jews may present him a petition every friday as he goes publicly to the mosque the form usual on such occasions is singular and merits being described those who imagine themselves aggrieved and determine on preferring a complaint immediately to the sultan range themselves in a line in the square fronting the great gate of the seraglio each person carries a kind of match or wick on his head lighted and smoking which is considered as the allegorical emblem of the fire that consumes his soul when the emperor passes along and sees the smoke he stops and gives orders to some of his attendants to collect the petitions which he receives and puts in his bosom mustapha iii who was very attentive to public business always used to read the petitions himself and has frequently in consequence performed some very exemplary acts of justice that do honor to his memory  in their courts of judicature there have sometimes been bold and resolute pleaders who seeing or suspecting some prevarication in the judges have had courage to cry out in open court hassir yakarum i will light up the match  on each side of the grand vizir are the two chief justices of romania and natolia and the rest of the judges according to their respective rank but these are not seated no advocate is employed in any suit every one pleads his own cause when a memorial is presented to the grand vizir if the request it contains be granted he signs it with his name but if it is refused he tears the memorial in pieces and there the matter ends all causes are decided very expeditiously because in general they depend upon viva voce evidence but if any cause should be at all intricate the grand vizir refers the inspection of it to some officer under him and directs him to make his report upon it within a limited time  every thing relative to religion and the morals of the people the grand vizir leaves to the decision of the two chief justices without appeal mondays and fridays are vacation days but on all other days the divan is open either at the seraglio or at the grand vizirs nothing is more astonishing says habesci than to see a grand vizir who has oftentimes had scarce any education direct so vast an empire as the ottoman and govern it perfectly well  lady c relates that while she was at constantinople the captain pacha introduced a lion into the divan which he had taught to follow him about like a dog but the ministers were so terrified that some of them jumped out of the windows and one of them was very near breaking his neck in flying down stairs and the high admiral and his lion were left to settle the councils of the day together  great misrepresentations having been made respecting the state of slavery in the ottoman empire we shall take this opportunity though it does not come immediately under the article of police of removing an odium from a condition of life which by the degrading appellation given to it has induced men to believe that slaves in general lead a life of sorrow pain and oppression  the slaves who suffer hardships in turkey are either criminals sent to the galleys or prisoners taken at sea by the ottoman corsairs the government sends out two or three zebecks in a year more to keep up an ancient custom than with the view of taking prisoners the commanders have strict orders to attack none but maltese vessels and if they take any of the inhabitants of that island they are brought in triumph to constantinople amidst the acclammations of the turks and are sent on board the row galleys to hard labor being chained to the oars the number of galleyslaves is likewise increased by those sent annually from the states of barbary to the grand signor amongst whom there are subjects of almost every european nation but the major part of them are neapolitans genoese and spaniards among those sent by the tunisians a few years since was a grandee of spain who was known at constantinople by his dignity of deportment and solemn gravity for some private reasons his friends would not ransom him and no foreign protection could save him from the galleys where he worked several years however on a peace with russia some persons found means to interest prince repnin in his favor and he was released but it is supposed the change of air and a different mode of life hurt his constitution for he died at an inn on the road as he was returning to spain another species of slaves are those stolen by the turkish marauders from georgia mingrelia and other greek settlements in their infancy the servitude of these is not severe for the merchants clothe them well and feed them with the best provisions that they may sell them to the greatest advantage a handsome girl is sold to some turkish lord who treats her according to her beauty and good behavior she may or may not chance to be his concubine and by good fortune she may be his wife as to the boys they are sold to masters who instruct them in such accomplishments as are proper for young turkish gentlemen they are genteelly clothed well fed and sleep upon excellent beds their whole service consists in waiting in the antichambers to carry in pipes coffee sweetmeats etc to their masters and in taking care to keep the apartments and the wardrobe in order if they are faithful and good mussulmen they generally marry their masters daughter by this channel they rise in the state especially if they are distinguished for personal valor and at this present time most of the bashaws of provinces and great officers of the port have originally been slaves  a third sort of slaves in turkey are prisoners taken in time of war in the late war with russia all the prisoners taken by the turks were sold as slaves they took a great quantity from different countries who were all confounded under the name of russians because they were not mussulmen one of the articles of the peace stipulated that all the prisoners of war should be released on both sides the individuals among the turks who had bought great numbers of russian prisoners were very much embarrassed by this article but they relied on the difficulty of their being discovered by the russian ambassador as they were concealed in their houses and dispersed all over the turkish empire  an intrepid little man however a georgian by birth named sergio undertook the difficult task of being agent for the russian prisoners at constantinople armed with the firman of the grand signor he went about in search of russian slaves and took away by force even those who had embraced the mohammedan religion amongst the rest was a russian girl who had been taken prisoner during the war and having been brought to constantinople was sold to a scherif of the race of emirs who had married her the husband enraged at the pretensions of sergio turned him out of doors and was on the point of caning him but the undaunted sergio instantly repaired to the vizir to whom he showed the grand signors mandate which allowed no exceptions of religion or situation the vizir was very much perplexed but at length replied if the woman persisted in being a mohammedan it would be impossible to recover her but if she would voluntarily turn christian again the emir must give her up her husband was very rich and very fond of her he therefore made no doubt she would remain firm in the mohammedan faith this confidence made him readily obey the summons of the vizir to attend him at the divan and bring his wife with him to answer the claim of sergio being come before him the vizir asked her if she would remain a mohammedan or return back to her old religion she replied she would live and die a christian the vizir on this decreed that sergio should take away the woman the husband was quite distracted and the more so as his wife was with child as his last resource he insisted the child should not be removed out of the ottoman empire for it is mine said he and belongs to the sacred family of mahomet wearing green turbans sergio had the courage to reply in full divan  if the child is born with a green rag upon his head it will be a certain proof that it is a descendant from mahomet if not mahomet has nothing to do with it and it belongs to christ there was no standing the force of this argument and the woman was given up and sent to her russian friends  this sergio made all the turks tremble and they dreaded him much more than they did prince repnin though before he arrived at constantinople they thought of nothing less than that he was coming to swallow up the city and enforce every article of the peace with the utmost rigor  their apprehensions of his excellency arose from an extraordinary incident that happpened at adrianople by the preliminary articles of peace it was agreed that the russian ambassador who should be sent to constantinople to conclude the definitive treaty of peace should have a certain number of troops in his suite and that they should be allowed to pass through the towns and cities of the ottoman empire sword in hand in consequence of this stipulation prince repnin and his attendants marched into adrianople in this manner it struck the janissaries that this was the etiquette of conquerors they considered it as a national affront and flew to arms the russians were not to be intimidated and fought their way through the janissaries though greatly inferior in numbers several of them were killed in the skirmish and two or three of the russians after which the prince continued his journey to constantinople but sent a courier to inform the port of what had happened the vizir was in the utmost consternation and hardly knew how to impart this humiliating intelligence to the grand signor at length however a secret council was held the result of which was that the vizir and the aga of the janissaries set off privately for daud bacha a pleasant village where it is usual for the foreign ambassadors extraordinary to stop a little in order to adjust the formalities of their entrance into constantinople as it is only a few miles distant but the negotiation could not be kept secret the janissaries at adrianople had contrived to send information of the insult as they termed it to the janissaries at constantinople who vowed vengeance against the russians if the prince should attempt to enter the capital sword in hand the arrangement of this delicate affair took up several days in the end a medium was resolved upon which satisfied both parties the port however issued strict orders that no person should be in the streets when the ambassador make his entry intending thereby to avoid the exposure of the imbecility of government in suffering such an article to be inserted in the preliminaries and the meanness of evading it in part by the following modification it had been settled between the prince and the vizir that the former in consideration of a few purses should enter the city with his sword only half drawn out of his scabbard and that his soldiers should observe the same formality with their sabres  in this manner the procession which was very splendid passed through the streets of constantinople crowded with people of all ranks notwithstanding the prohibition as for the janissaries they were satisfied with having humbled the pride of the russians and the ambassador like most other ambassadors made the glory of his nation give way to his private interest this entry likewise changed the sentiments of the turks respecting him for when they saw him in the midst of his splendid and numerous retinue and upon such a solemn occasion as an embassy for concluding a peace between two potent empires indulging himself in all the levities of a french petitmaitre eager only to pull off his hat every instant to the greek ladies who were at the windows and kissing his hand to some and bowing to others as he passed along so contrary to the turkish idea of dignity their fear was turned into contempt and the sequel will show they were not mistaken for although the empress had given very positive orders in her negociations with the port for a restitution of prisoners of war and had allowed half a piastre a day for their support till they were sent to russia each piastre is four shillings yet prince repnin says habesci would scarce receive the slaves who ran away from their masters and took shelter at his hotel soon after his public entry i saw fortythree women lodged very miserably in three chambers with only straw to lie on to whom his excellency allowed only the sixteenth part of a piastre or five paras a day for their subsistence the consequence was that the greater part of these poor women stole away to the turks and eightyone persons of his excellencys retinue deserted from him and embraced the mohammedan religion  however such was the dread of the turkish government lest any fresh misunderstanding should happen between the two courts that when prince repnin was on the point of returning home the port adds h offered to restore him all the russians who had quitted his service which was an infraction of their laws for having embraced the mohammedan religion they were become turkish subjects  the number of black and white slaves brought yearly to constantinople is said to amount to near  0000 none but turks are allowed to purchase any under the most severe penalties the slavemarket is in the middle of the city it forms a quadrangle surrounded with apartments for white slaves and in the area underneath sit the black ones almost naked the white female slaves are dressed up in very gaudy colors when they are exposed for sale and some of them fetch a great price and are very proud of it they are by no means unhappy from being next to savages they are well fed well dressed and treated with great urbanity they are taught a variety of things get into good families women as well as men and oftentimes acquire great riches  with respect to their being in a state of slavery many situations in life says lord baltimore are much more so if a slave is determined to quit his master he is obliged to dispose of him to some other person and as far as i could observe says his lordship if they are in the least handsome they are excessively proud haughty hardened obstinate and ferocious and require indeed a turk to have to deal with them the turks inspire them with the utmost disdain and hatred of the christians  it may not be amiss to give some idea here of the georgian and circassian slaves whose beauty is so much celebrated georgia and circassia are not more enslaved than any other province more immediately subject to the grand signor the slaves from these provinces are furnished by the lesguis tartars who are situated between the caspian and black seas and are perpetually at war with the georgians and circassians these tartars carry over to the eastern coast of the black sea the slaves they have taken and sell them to the turkish merchants who come thither at certain times it is usual likewise for parents in these countries to sell their own children to the merchants who afterward educate them in such accomplishments as will enhance their value an indecent dance accompanied by castanets is the most valuable of all others this method of dealing for circassian women we have represented in our description of tartary and given a plate upon the subject to which we refer uor raeders  see p     vol iv   georgia is divided into two parts one of which was subject to the ottoman emperors and the other under the dominion of persia at present they are entirely independent having thrown off the yoke of the turks as well as the persians tott says peysonel should not have neglected informing his readers that circassians alone have the honor of being admitted to the sultans bed the turks says he have an anecdote universally believed among them that one of the ottoman emperors of the last century having slept part of the night with a georgian slave asked her toward morning if it was almost day she replied with vulgar simplicity she believed it was because she felt a certain pressing necessity which she usually experienced about break of day the emperor was disgusted and dismissed her a few days after he put the same question out of curiosity to a circassian who supplied the place of the disgraced georgian she answered she perceived the approach of aurora for the morning zephyr already wantoned in her hair  the prince delighted with the delicacy of her reply declared with an oath no georgian should from that time be admitted to the bed of himself or his successors  neither the greeks the armenians nor even the jews are subject to a natural slavery any more than the turks the despotism of the sultan cannot seize the person of a young girl whatever desires she may have excited in him and though we still find among the greeks the same beautiful forms which served as models to praxiteles the turkish annals furnish no example of such an enormity  lady m has a similar remark in one of her letters you desire me says her ladyship to the person to whom she is addressing herself to buy you a greek slave who is mistress of a thousand good qualities the greeks are subjects and not slaves those who are to be bought in that manner are either such as are taken in war or stolen by the tartars from russia circassia or georgia and are such miserable awkward poor wretches that you would not think any of them worthy to be your housemaids it is true that many thousands of them were taken in the morea but they have been most of them redeemed by the charitable contributions of the christians or ransomed by their own relations at venice the fine slaves that wait upon the great ladies or serve the pleasures of the great men are all bought at the age of eight or nine years old and educated with great care to accomplish them in singing dancing embroidery etc and their patrons never sell them except it is as a punishment for some very great fault if ever they grow weary of them they either present them to a friend or give them their freedom those that are exposed in the markets are always either guilty of some crime or so entirely worthless as to be of no use at all  chap iv of the court seraglio etc it is difficult to form a just idea of the ottoman empire without being previously made acquainted with what is meant by the seraglio and the port they having both so intimate a connection with the government that it is necessary to understand them thoroughly to comprehend the system of turkish policy  when the turks speak of the seraglio they do not mean the apartments in which the grand signors women are confined as we are so apt to limit the meaning of the word but the whole enclosure of the palace in which the ottoman monarch resides together with his household that is to say all the officers guards women and slaves employed in his immediate service the extent of this vast enclosure might very well suffice for a moderate town it entirely occupies the ground upon which the ancient city of byzantium stood that is to say one of the seven hills on which constantinople is built its circumference is very near six english miles there are nine courts within it most of them large quadrangles the buildings have never been exactly numbered as no person is permitted to take down an exact account of them but the number is almost incredible and they are most part of brick but the kitchens and what is called the treasury are very superb and built of stone or marble the whole is covered with lead and the domes and turrets are ornamented with gilt crescents the arch which surrounds the seraglio is thirty feet high with battlements embrasures and towers in the style of ancient fortifications it is called the new seraglio to distinguish it from the old one built by constantine it is situated opposite to scutari except one part which is at the very entrance of the harbor and faces the arsenal at pera on this side at a small distance upon the sea shore there is a kiosch or summer house for the recreation of the grand signor iti sultry weather it is an irregular building of about sixty feet in circumference and twenty in height consisting of one large saloon very magnificently furnished and having a seat of massy silver so placed that the monarch can have a view from both sides of the hall as well as from the door  there are nine gates to the seraglio but only two of them can be called magnificent the first is the entrance from the square of st sophia this gate is very superb and will be frequently mentioned hereafter as it is from this port or gate that the ottoman court takes the name of the port or the sublime port in all public transactions and records on one side of this gate may be seen the pyramids of heads that have been cut off with labels denoting the crimes of the owners fastened upon the sculls the second gate leads to the first interior court and is supported by marble pillars but it is not so stately and magnificent as the first the rest are not worth notice except a little gate on the side next scutari through which the grand vizirs are let out privately when they are sent into exile and at such times they have generally a large barge ready to convey them away without being seen  a person may walk all round the wall that surrounds the seraglio in that part which rather leans over the sea facing the arsenal there are two chambers with three latticed windows where the grand signor frequently places himself and hears what the passengers say as they go along without being seen  there is an arabic inscription over the great gate in gold and azure signifying that that gate and the palace of the seraglio were built by mahomet ii the guards who do duty here have no other arms but a small staff which they carry in their hands even the janissaries themselves are seldom seen with any offensive weapons and ridicule the franks for wearing swords as part of their dress asking them if they mean to attack the dogs with them by which they are sometimes pursued in troops and forced to draw in their defense this circumstance is attributed to the novelty of their dress but to return to the seraglio through this gate we enter the first court which is open to every one here stands the infirmary in which people are so well attended and taken care of that they will frequently it is said counterfeit sickness to get admittance they have likewise the privilege of drinking wine in all the turkish hospitals and this is another inducement wine being considered by the turks as a kind of medicine  on the left side of this court stands an old building with a cupola that was formerly a greek church in which their armor and trophies are deposited in this square are also the mint and apartments on both sides for the inferior servants of the seraglio the second court into which any person may enter is occupied by the court of the divan the walls are paved with marble and there are several large grass plats in it surrounded with trees and fountains in the middle all round this court there is a piazza of no great height but not ill built supported by a great number of marble pillars on the opposite side is the asna or treasury and the stables in which are some of the finest horses in the world kept purposely for the grand signors own riding it is impossible to conceive any thing more splendid and brilliant than the bridles saddles housing and other furniture with which the horses are equipped on any public occasion being enriched with precious stones and refulgent with gold silver and other ornaments but neither the treasury or stables where this rich furniture is deposited have any thing very magnificent in their architecture  the kitchens are also on the left hand of this court which contain several large handsome buildings with cupolas over them but with no chimnies holes being made in the cupola to let out the smoke for the hearth is always in the middle of the room as used to be the custom in our great halls and is still so in our colleges and inns of court  no person but the grand signor is allowed to ride through the second court and there is such an universal silence observed through the palace that notwithstanding the immense number of people who resort to it there is not the least appearance of noise and bustle but every thing is as hushed and still as if no person lived in the seraglio and the conversing by signs contributes to this not a little for if any person wishes to advance himself at court he must accustom himself to such sort of conversation and which the grand signor is said to understand extremely well  at the bottom of the upper court is the divan in which the councils of state are held and where justice is likewise administered and beyond this court no strangers are admitted except ambassadors who pass on to the hall of audience where the grand signors throne is erected and which is encircled with pearls and precious stones this room is very magnificently furnished its roof and sides glitter with gold and azure besides being adorned with very fine paintings after the persian manner  some travelers it is said have found means of visiting the more interior parts of the seraglio and among others one who attended a clockmaker that had been ordered to repair some of the curious clocks which had been presented to the grand signor they were conducted by a black eunuch into the hall of the haram where there was an english clock out of order the whole hall says this traveller was lined with china tiles and the cieling of the cupola adorned with azure and gold in the middle of the hall was a fountain the basin of which was of fine green marble having the appearance of jasper  these artificial fountains are very frequent in the turkish apartments and serve for the ablutions which precede their prayers as well as to entertain the eye especially in the harams of the women who never go into their mosques without having the alcoran previously read to them in such places as these which serve as so many chapels these halls have large windows which are not only glazed but they have likewise bars or lattices before them and sophas all round the room or elevated wide seats covered with rich carpets where the ladies sit and amuse themselves with viewing the gardens and enjoy the refreshing breezes which are occasionally wasted into them from the propontis  from this hall our traveller was conducted through several little rooms like the cells of monks only excelling them very much in the richness of the furniture particularly in one where there was a fine pendulum that wanted putting to rights the clock stood on a massy silver table before a looking glass the frame of which was silver gilt and curiously carved and embellished with foilage in basrelief two lofty stands of massy silver stood on each end of a rich sopha which had a covering of plain green silk under which on its being uncovered there appeared a very rich brocade with a gold ground the cushions being of green velvet very richly worked this chamber was adorned more than the hall with paintings and ornaments but the lowest part of the window frames were higher than the tallest man could reach the glass was likewise painted but without any living creature represented upon it on his return back he was led through several fine halls and chambers the floors of which were covered with rich persian carpets and the rooms ornamented with fine sophas and gilded cielings the gardens he went through were full of groves of cypress trees and different kinds of evergreens planted without any order or regularity about twenty yards from the staircase leading into the gardens was a pillar of granite marble it consisted of one single shaft larger in circumference and about one third higher than marcians pillar and stood upon a square pedestal adorned with some mutilated festoons and latin inscriptions but they were so defaced that it was impossible to discover any thing upon them but the name of justinian it being dangerous to stop long enough to copy any of the inscriptions  these gardens says chishull are wild and uncultivated affording nothing pleasing to the eye but what nature has furnished them with an admirable situation rising into convenient ascents and capable of infinite improvement if they were in the hands of any christian prince the whole plat of ground called the gardens of the seraglio is so covered with cypress and other trees as to resemble a grove through which shady walks are cut where pleasurehouses of various sorts are seen the most eminent and remarkable of which is that called the blue kiosh fronting the town of scutari  in the sides of one of the kioshs are three orbicular stones of fine porphyry the middlemost of which is curiously polished and serves to reflect the prospect of the seraglio and adjoining city like a lookingglass at the farther end of these gardens are the entire walls of an ancient christian church and near it the grand signors aviary where are kept the hens of grand cairo that are remarkable for having blue gills and feathers curiously colored with gray circles and in the center of each circle a spot of black  besides the above buildings there are many others in which the inferior officers reside and where all the provisions and necessaries for the seraglio are deposited particularly on the left hand of the entrance quite down to the water side there are prodigious piles of wood which some thousands of baltagis or wood cleavers are continually employed in cutting into billets and carrying to the different apartments on the opposite side is a large square where those who are intended for military employments are taught their exercises at which the sultan is sometimes present  the number of persons inhabiting this immense pile of building is in proportion to its size on the best authority says habesci that of personal knowledge i can say that nearly  0000 persons constantly reside in it the grooms and those who constitute the corpse of guards make the major part of that number  the following is a very exact list of the inhabitants and their respective employments for the sevice of the stables   00 bostangis that is to say gardeners  000 baltagis that is carriers of wood for the use of the seraglio  00 white eunuchs   0 black eunuchs  00 women   00 esoglans or pages  00 cooks and confectioners   0 menial servants  00    0  this is the number of persons who usually reside in the seraglio except that of the women which is increased or diminished according to the taste of the reigning sultan  the provisions in the seraglio are dressed by such of the agliamoglams as are brought up to cookery they begin their business early in the morning for the grand signor rising early there must always be something ready for his breakfast his dinner hour is ten oclock in the morning and he sups at six in the afternoon both summer and winter his manner of sitting down to table is with his legs across after the turkish fashion with a rich embroidered napkin spread before him he carves for himself but uses neither knife nor fork his meat being so tender and delicately dressed that he easily pulls it in pieces with his fingers he makes use of two wooden spoons with one he takes his soups and with the other his syrups dinner or supper over he washes his hands in a gold basin set with precious stones he scarce ever speaks at table except to some favorite aga to whom he sometimes throws a loaf as a mark of favor  the queen and sultanas are served at the same time but in copper dishes except the sultan be with them their food may truly be said to come from far their sherbet is made of snow water brought to constantinople at a very great expense and kept under ground their only cheese is parmesan furnished from venice the bread is made of wheat brought from bursa reckoned very white and savoury the rest comes from greece their rice lentils and other pulse are the produce of egypt great quantities of sugar are used in sherbets but they eat very little spice except pepper the honey served up at the sultans table comes from chio but the rest from walachia and moldavia their oil is had from greece but that which the grand signor eats comes from candia and zant their butter comes from the borders of the black sea and the crimea they eat scarce any butter or milk except it be in clouted cream very little fish is eaten at constantinople by the turks though the sea yields great plenty and therefore the christians purchase it very cheap the seraglio is plentifully supplied with fruit from the sultans garden and as large presents are frequently made to him a great deal of it is sold and the money given to the grand signor for his pocketmoney the utensils of the sultans kitchens are of brass but kept so clean and bright as to do the eye good  it must be observed that the individuals who compose this immense household are most of them born of christian parents who have been made captives in time of war or stolen at a very early age in time of peace it being a maxim with the ottoman empire to be served only by persons who are unacquainted with their native country their parents or their religion they being the more likely to be attached to the prince by whom they are protected and well taken care of  when one of these children is presented to the seraglio they first examine very minutely if he has any corporeal defect if so he is not accepted though his countenance should speak very much in his favor the mahometans believing that a brave mind cannot exist in a body materially deformed but on the contrary if they meet with such a person as they wish for they write down his name and the country he comes from in a register which remains in the chancery of the private treasury of the grand signor and give the treasurer an order to pay him his daily pension which is four aspers a day he is then sent to be educated in one of the old seraglios either of pera or constantinople here it may be necessary to remark that there is a seraglio at pera to which the grand signor goes two or three times a year to spend the day and it is chiefly in this edifice that those slaves who are destined for his personal service are brought up those that remain in the seraglio of constantinople for their education are principally those who are raised to posts and dignities of the greatest consequence after having gone through the usual exercises  such was the custom when the turkish conquests furnished a considerable number of these children as substitutes to those who were promoted to other employments but as at present the christians are more careful to guard their children from the rapacious hands of the turkish emissaries this source for slaves has failed and they are obliged to confine their ancient custom of furnishing the seraglio with christian slaves to pages only those christian princes who formerly presented a certain number of boys and girls as an annual tribute for the service of the grand signor have refused to pay this tribute any longer prince heraclius who governs georgia so admirably shook off this inhuman tribute during the late war between the turks and the russians and since that time none but the pages are children of christians  we will now relate the manner in which the seraglio is guarded it being well known that it is watched very strictly the whole circuit is confined to the care of the bostangis or gardeners who form the first guard the second is composed of the baltagis or of those who are employed in furnishing the firing for the seraglio these are armed with an axe to them succeed the guard of the white eunuchs and the fourth and last corpse are the black eunuchs who are nearest the person of the monarch  the number of   00 persons which are employed for the service of the stables will at first seem very great but if the great quantity of horses to be taken care of is considered our surprise will instantly vanish these horses which belong particularly to the monarch and which no other person must mount are in number  000 which number can neither be increased nor diminished such being the law or custom whenever a good horse is presented for the personal service of the grand signor and is accepted they part with that which is of the least value and when a horse dies or loses any of his good qualities he is parted with and another immediately purchased in his room by this means the fixed number of three thousand is always kept up these horses are all procured either from arabia or egypt as being in much greater estimation than those in natolia or romania  in order to insure the best horses for the service of the grand signor there is an old law enjoining under pain of death that all persons who bring any horses to constantinople with a view to dispose of them shall first make an offer of such horses to the equeries of the seraglio  all the horses are divided into three separate stables the first contains   00 the second  00 and the third  00 there are also  00 mules in another stable kept for transporting the sultans baggage and that of his suite when he goes into the country such a number of mules is the more necessary as there are no wagons in turkey  to the number of horses which more particularly belong to the grand signor must be added those that belong to the principal officers of the seraglio which are very numerous the kislaraga or chief of the black eunuchs has  00 for his own private use and the rest of the ministers in proportion even the pages have each of them no less than three horses we may therefore reckon says habesci without the least exaggeration that there are  000 horses in the grand signors stables  this number it is true would not require   00 persons to look after them but as these men are obliged to go and come different ways and have likewise to take care of themselves as well as their horses such a number seems indispensably necessary  the environs of this place says sestini are very mountainous and the valleys full of pastures for the horses and mules of the grand signors stables these horses which come chiefly from arabia are some of the finest that the world can produce the grooms for the most part are tartars bulgarians or arabians they live under tents during the time that the mules and horses are ordered to remain out at grass which gives a very picturesque view to the country round  the day that these horses are first brought to grass the groom observes some kind of ceremony on entering the pastures at the conclusion of which one of their horses has all his hair shaved off and is even ecorche the horse which comes in last always undergoes this ceremony which they do with a view to avert what they call the evil looks and every other misfortune that may befall these animals this superstition though equally singular as it is ridiculous may be traced back to the most remote antiquity  the neatness of these grooms round their tents is so great that little square buildings on the borders of the canal at different distances are appropriated for privies so constructed that the water may carry every thing away with it  the bostangis who form the first exterior guard of the seraglio have their chief who is called bostangibashaw he is in general superintendant not only of the imperial gardens that are in the city of constantinople but likewise of all the other buildings fountains gardens and delicious places destined for the grand signors amusement the jurisdiction of the bostangibashaw extends to the mouth of the black sea and having under his inspection all the villages on the coast of constantinople and the bosphorus he draws very great revenues from his office when the sultan goes upon the water it is the bostangibashaw who has the conducting of the barge he is seated behind the sultan and guides the helm according to his orders having an opportunity by this means to converse freely with the grand signor he is particularly esteemed and respected the sultan mustapha caused the heads of three bostangibashaws to be cut off because the barge had been agitated too much by the sea  the bostangibashaw lives without the walls of the seraglio his habitation however communicates with the seraglio itself it is in the palace of this minister that the torture is applied to malefactors or such as are suspected to be so among all the people who compose the seraglio the bostangis are the proudest rudest and most cruel  to the bostangis succeed the baltajir or cleavers and carriers of wood to the different apartments of the seraglio this class forms the second guard they wear the same uniform with the others except that the baltagis have a little blue collar distinguishing them from the bostangis by its very long point which descends to their breasts and they both wear a large scarlet cap above half a yard high these wood cleavers are very expert in the exercise of running leaping and boxing and above all are very skilful in throwing the lance and in all other bodily exercises that have a tendency to make them robust and active  the cooks and confectioners are likewise taken from this corpse the former wear a very fantastical cap made of shining hair forming a point turned backwards the latter wear a cap of camels hair in the shape of a sugar loaf and of a dark yellow color the butchers were likewise formerly taken from this corpse and wear the same kind of cap with the confectioners there are also a great number of domestics in livery who wear a short dress made of gold stuff with a cap of gilt metal ornamented with a large plume of feathers which originally belonged to this corpse as were the menial servants of the officers belonging to the seraglio but christian slaves being now grown very scarce the turks are obliged to be served in all the abovementioned offices by poor people who obtain their places for a livelihood  of all the oriental nations none give way to their sensual inclinations so much as those who profess the mohammedan religion this accounts for the sultans having their women guarded always by eunuchs for love and jealousy are their strongest passions all the turks of rank and fashion adopt a similar custom  in the seraglio the white eunuchs form a kind of bodyguard to the sultan and the black ones to the women of the haram the chief of the white eunuchs has command over all the pages and white eunuchs of the court three very considerable officers the grand chamberlain the principal major domo and the governor of the pages are dependent upon him there are also inferior officers belonging to the white eunuchs from the white eunuchs are selected some of the curates of the royal mosques who are very glad of these appointments which generally yield very fine incomes one mosque in particular produces an hundred ducats a day  the black eunuchs are employed chiefly to guard the women formerly they were imperfectly castrated much in the same manner as the castrati of italy but sultan mustapha predecessor to the reigning emperor having entertained some suspicions ordered that from that time all the black eunuchs should be entirely cut which method is still followed their chief is called the kislaraga that is the aga of the women of the seraglio as he has the general superintendance of the haram which is that part of the seraglio where the women are kept besides the income he draws from the royal mosques he has a thousand ways of amassing immence riches the blackest of the eunuchs are brought from africa  all the pages of the seraglio are the sons of christians made slaves in time of war the incursions of turkish robbers in the neighborhood of circassia and other christian countries afford means of supplying the seraglio even in time of peace with such children the city of akeska was the rendezvous of these robbers its situation in the vicinity of georgia was very convenient for them as they could assemble two or three thousand horsemen and make unexpected irruptions into georgia and carry off the inhabitants and every thing they could lay their hands on they afterward brought those slaves that were fittest for the seraglio to constantinople and the rest were sold at zoserum from whence they were dispersed all over the turkish empire but since prince heraclius has refused the accustomed inhuman tribute already mentioned and put a stop to the irruptions of the turkish banditti and the tartars the georgian slaves are seldom to be met with and it is with the utmost difficulty that the usual number of pages can be kept up  when one of these christian children is first admitted into the service of the seraglio he is put under the direction of the chief of the white eunuchs who places him either in the great or little school in the great chamber or school there are usually  00 children and in the lesser  00 these children are brought up under a very rigid discipline and taught first of all modesty and politeness they are then instructed in the mohammedan religion and in the arabian and persian languages in order to enable them to speak the turkish with greater propriety and as it is spoken in the seraglio their clothing is very neat and their diet good and wholesome they lie in large chambers and have separate beds placed in rows between every third or fourth bed there lies a white eunuch these eunuchs watch them very closely to keep them from unnatural vices which the people in the seraglio are very much given to when these youths are old enough to bear the fatigues of strong bodily exercise no pains are spared to render them robust active and valiant they are likewise instructed in the mechanic as well as liberal arts  from these chambers they take the bravest and most capable to employ them about the person of the grand signor they afterward distribute the rest according to their capacity either in the service of the treasury of the seraglio or in the repository for drugs and cordials which are carefully prepared for the use of the grand signor and his women from the service of the treasury and this repository are taken those who are esteemed most worthy to be promoted to more important charges in the seraglio by virtue of their employments they are admitted to the presence chamber and to the private apartments of the seraglio so that they can see and speak to the grand signor almost at any time  in the room of him who quits the seraglio entirely another is appointed from the body of the pages such is the order of rotation to the offices of the seraglio and the gradations of services through which they pass before they quit it that it seldom happens any officer leaves the palace before he is turned of forty a time of life when he may be supposed most capable of conducting the weighty affairs of state with which he may be entrusted most commonly on leaving the seraglio they are raised to the dignity of bashaws or agas of the janissaries or generals of the cavalry and sometimes instantly appointed grand vizirs it is pleasing to see them take leave of their friends and acquaintances in the seraglio adds habesci as the ceremonies they use on such occasions demonstrate a very refined taste and nothing further would be wanting to convince a byestander that the turks were a most polite people  contrary to the ideas of all other civilized nations the turks set little value on the sciences they always prefer men of valor to men versed in the sciences for any high office yet notwithstanding their slight opinion of the sciences they cultivate some of them in the schools they teach the youth of the seraglio to read and write they then make them learn arabic as their books of religion and the laws of their empire are written in that language it is not till they have perfectly learnt the arabic that they are taught the persian language which being melodious and sprightly corrects the harshness of the turkish they then teach them arithmetic and by suffering their reading persian novels and romances replete with gallantry and lively animated expressions the youth acquires a gay and sprightly turn of mind besides these studies some of them apply themselves to learning the alcoran by heart others translate valuable books from the arabic and persian into the turkish language and each youth makes his remarks and annotations on them for the instruction of the ignorant many apply themselves to the persian and arabic poetry and succeed admirably well the study of music likewise occupies a good part of the time allotted for the instruction of these young men most certainly the turkish music is barbarous with respect to the terrible noise it makes but it is also certain that it has its softness and harmony which may very well be relished except the abovementioned sciences and a slight knowledge of medicine and astronomy the turks are in general extremely ignorant  that nothing may be wanting to the splendor and ostentation of the ottoman court there are a number of mutes and dwarfs kept persons of this description who in other courts serve only to amuse the prince at the turkish court are employed not only for the amusement of the sultan but to instruct the pages in an art which is not practiced in other countries this art consists in making themselves understood by signs out of respect to the grand signor that he may not be disturbed by the sound of their voices there are in the seraglio   0 of these mutes who being born deaf cannot express themselves but by signs at night they lie in the great chamber of the pages and are in the schools in the day where they teach the young christian slaves to comprehend very long discourses on different subjects in this manner two or three of the oldest of these mutes are admitted to the chamber of the sultan for his amusement the dwarfs are employed in the same manner if a dwarf happens to be a mute he is very much prized and if an eunuch likewise he is considered as a prodigy and no pains or expense spared to procure such a rarity we will now speak of the women  all the women in the seraglio are for the service of the grand signor no persons whatever are permitted to introduce themselves into the first gate that encompasses the haram that is the apartments in which the women are shut up it is situated in a very remote part of the enclosure of the seraglio and looks upon the sea of marmora no person can possibly see these women except the sultan and the eunuchs if any of them goes out of the seraglio on an excursion into the country with the grand signor the journey is made either in a barge or in a close carriage and there is a kind of covered way made with linen curtains from the door of their apartment to the place of embarking or getting into the carriage all these women have the same origin as the pages and the same means which are employed to procure the boy slaves are used to supply the haram with women the handsomest only or those who give hopes of being such are received into the seraglio who must all be virgins they like the pages are divided into two chambers and their manual employment consists in learning to sew and embroider with respect to their mental and personal accomplishments they are taught only music dancing voluptuous attitudes and such other allurements as decency forbids expatiating upon by which says habesci they endeavor to excite the passions of the sultan the number of women kept in the seraglio depends on the pleasure of the grand signor sultan selim had near  000 sultan mahmud had but  00 and the present emperor has nearly   00  these two chambers have windows but they look only on the gardens of the seraglio among such a great number of women there is not a single servant and the method in which they wait on one another is not a little peculiar the last entered waits upon the one who entered before her and likewise upon herself so that she who is at the head of the list is served without having any one to wait upon and she who entered last has no one to wait upon her they all sleep in separate beds and between every fifth there is a preceptress stationed to superintend their conduct their head governess is called katon kiaia or the governess of the noble young ladies if there is a sultana mother she forms her court from their chamber having liberty to take as many young ladies as she thinks proper  the grand signor very frequently permits them to walk in the gardens of the seraglio on such occasions all the workmen are ordered to retire and black eunuchs are placed in every corner with drawn sabres and others ordered to walk round the gardens to prevent any person from looking at them should any one be found in the gardens at this time either through ignorance or inadvertence he is instantly put to death and his head brought to the feet of the grand signor who rewards the eunuchs very liberally for their vigilance sometimes the grand signor himself goes into the gardens when the ladies are there and it is then that by dancing singing enticing attitudes and other alluring gestures they practice all their little arts to endeavor to ensnare his affections  it is generally imagined the grand signor may take to his bed all the ladies of the seraglio whenever he is so inclined this is a vulgar error it was so in former times but the immense presents which it is usual to give to those ladies who are so favored by the grand signors determined them to make regulations that have been adopted by all their successors in which the number time and etiquette of cohabiting with them is limited it is true the sultan can if he pleases break through these rules but he seldom does especially as besides the immense expense in presents it may likewise cost the lives of those girls whom the prince is so partial to in the reign of sultan achmet above   0 women were poisoned who by their allurements had enticed the grand signor to be connected with them contrary to the established etiquette the sultan is not permitted to take a virgin to his embraces except upon some extraordinary festival or great rejoicings on these occasions if he wishes a fresh companion for his bed he goes into the ladies apartment who are ranged in files by their governesses and intimates the one he wishes to have the ceremony of the handkerchief which the sultan is said to throw to the favored fair is an idle tale without any foundation when the grand signor has fixed on the lady he has destined to be the new partner of his affections all the others follow her to the bath washing and perfuming her and after having dressed her very superbly conduct her singing dancing and rejoicing to the grand signors bedchamber who on such occasions is generally already in bed to receive her as soon as the newelected favorite enters the chamber introduced by the principal eunuch upon guard she kneels down and when the sultan calls her gets into bed at the foot except the sultan should order her as a special favor to approach at the side after a certain time on a signal given by the sultan the governess of the ladies enters the apartment with her suite and conducts her back to the womens apartment if by good fortune she becomes pregnant and is delivered of a boy she has the appellation of asaki sultaness or sultanamother on the birth of the first son she has the honor of being crowned and the liberty of forming her court eunuchs are also assigned her for her guard no other ladies though delivered of boys except the first are either crowned or entertained with any extraordinary magnificence they have however separate establishments with very handsome appointments  thevenot says that in the grand signors bed chamber there are large wax tapers burning all night and moorish women sitting by them and that on these nights he sleeps in a chamber belonging to the haram or womens apartments and in the morning on his rising changes all his dress and leaves them to her he slept with besides whatever money was in his pockets and that on his returning to his own apartments he sends immediately a present of jewels money and magnificent dresses of greater or less value according as he was captivated with her charms  after the death of the sultan the mother of the male children are shut up in the old seraglio from whence they can never come out unless one of their sons ascend the throne the old seraglio was the palace of constantine the great it is situated nearly in the center of constantinople there these sultanas are confined as also those ladies of the new seraglio who are indisposed those who are brought to bed of girls are allowed the privilege of marrying when the sultan dies of which they generally avail themselves to some of the principal persons of the empire who are very glad to have them for their riches and the connexions and patronage which they generally have in the seraglio  lady m mentions a favorite sultana who on being presented with an absolute order to leave the seraglio and choose herself a husband among the great men of the port at the decease of the sultan threw herself at the feet of his successor and begged him to poignard her rather than use his brothers widow with that contempt she represented to him in agonies of sorrow that she was privileged from this misfortune by having brought five princes into the ottoman family but all the boys being dead and only one girl surviving this excuse was not received and she was compelled to make her choice she chose bekireffendi then secretary of state a turkish nobleman above fourscore years old to convince the world that she firmly intended to keep the vow she had made of never suffering a second husband to approach her bed and him she chose as a mark of her gratitude since it was he that had presented her at the age of ten years to her late lord but she never permitted him to pay her one visit though she had been fifteen years in his house when lady m visited her and she was then but thirtysix but passed her time in uninterrupted mourning with a constancy very little known in christendom  all those ladies who have been connected with the deceased sultan but borne no children are shut up for life in the old seraglio those with whom he has had no intercourse remain in their apartments for the new grand signor  baron tott in his remarks on the ottoman empire says that the daughters and sisters of the grand signor when married to the vizirs and great men of the empire dwell in their separate palaces but that all the male children who are born to them are instantly smothered by the person who delivers the mother this says he is the most public of all their laws and that which is least infringed no attempt is made to conceal these horrible assassinations a despicable fear is the cause of them more than the interest of the throne  the daughters who alone escape this murderous law only preserve the title of sultana by adding to it that of hanum common to all women of tolerable fortune and their children of both sexes whom these princesses may preserve now enter into the general class of the people and are not distinguished by any title born of a granddaughter of the emperor the influence of paternal notice no longer reaches them the great grandfather has lost sight of them in the obscurity of their birth  it may not be amiss to observe before we finish this account of the seraglio that unnatural vices reign in it to excess not only among the pages but also among the ladies the violent excesses of the pages and their shameful amors with those who are placed about the persons of the monarch might lead to very dangerous consequences if fire and sword were not employed to restore tranquillity but notwithstanding the utmost vigilance of the eunuchs and their governors these vices are not to be entirely eradicated indeed how can it be expected when it is well known says habesci that almost all the sultans have themselves been guilty of such crimes sultan amurath was so enamoured of a young armenian that he made him his sword bearer mahomet iv paid such public homage to a young greek that all the court noticed it he was declared chief favorite with great ceremony and became despot of the empire we could produce examples more modern and very recent but those already mentioned sufficiently prove the contagion is ancient and deeply rooted and that it can never be extirpated it is too general among the mahometans  the most indecent practices are also very common in the apartments of the ladies nor is it to be wondered at in girls well fed leading an idle undisturbed life and whose chief employ is to prepare themselves for sensual delights notwithstanding the fatal doom that awaits them on discovery the violence of their passion hurries them precipitately to their ruin alas how many of these unhappy girls are thrown tied together in guilty couples from the seraglio into the sea in the reign of mustapha iii some hundreds thus fell victims to their incontinence and not a year passes even at present though their governesses are ever on the watch without some such sacrifice so shocking to humanity  chap v in continuation having now given as full and descriptive an account of the seraglio and its interior regulations as is to be met with it remains only to speak of the pomp and splendor with which the sultan gives audiences to the ambassadors of foriegn powers and of the grandeur and magnificence which attend him on other public occasions  the turks take care that no ambassador shall be admitted to their audiences but at certain times when the grand signor is prepared to display all the pomp and splendor of the court for this reason they are commonly appointed on the days of paying the military establishment the formalities of such audiences merit a detail and we shall fix on one given to a venetian ambassador as surpassing those of the ministers of other nations  the reader should be apprized that the ottoman court retains all the ancient oriental magnificence in its numerous train sumptuous apparel costly jewels and luxury so often described by other writers and that it is fond of displaying every external appearance of grandeur that can impress the minds of its subjects or strangers with awe surprise and terror a hint necessary to be given to reconcile to the reader that great and unbecoming haughtiness so visible in some part of their conduct on these public occasions  on the day appointed for the royal audience the ambassador with his dragoman and secretary embarks on board a very superb galley from the arsenal at galata belonging to the grand signor its chief ornaments and the entire outside of which are of pure massive gold upon their landing the ambassador and all his train for he is preceded not only by all his household but by all the venetian subjects either at pera or constantinople are received by the chiaus bachi or commanding officers of the police who conduct them to a building on the shore near at hand to which the grand signor occasionally resorts to enjoy the cool sea breezes here refreshments are provided and some time is spent while the order of the entry is adjusted the procession then moves on slowly in the following manner  first three hundred janissaries on foot dressed in their habits of ceremony the chief article of which consists of long bonnets of white cloth which descend a considerable length over their shoulders their head cook closes the rear habited in a black pellice covered with silver chains to which are suspended in miniature and likewise in silver all the utensils of a kitchen he is followed by sixty chiaus on horseback headed by their officer after them thirtysix slaves belonging to the ambassador dressed in his liveries with their chief next to them the ambassadors master of the horse his horse led by six grooms in rich liveries then the majordomo and another officer on horseback at the head of fiftysix horsemen belonging to the ambassador covered with liveries still more superb than the former next his excellencys chief page on horseback followed by ten other lads who are linguists and six dragomen or interpreters on horseback a colonel of the janissaries surrounded by six chiocadars leads up the second division of this procession last of all follows the ambassador in a robe of purple velvet embroidered with gold flowers wearing a ducal cap and mounted on a stately horse richly caparisoned and sent to him by the grand signor on each side of the ambassadors horse six slaves in rich liveries three noble venetians two secretaries of embassy and two others follow his excellency and after them all the venetians on horseback this procession passes on in this order to the seraglio and lasts two hours from the time of the ambassadors landing  having entered the sublime port in the first square an immense number of guards are drawn up through the middle of which as they fall back his excellency passes on horseback to the gate of the second square where he alights no person except the sovereign being permitted to pass that gate on horseback there he is met by the dragoman of the port and after a few minutes passed in the second square his excellency ascends the flight of steps leading to the divan chamber preceded by the chiaus bachi and the master of the ceremonies very richly dressed and both carrying silver maces which they strike against the ground like walking sticks the grand vizir being already seated on his sopha to receive petitions and memorials  the divan chamber resembles westminster hall but is neither so long nor so lofty the breadth appears nearly the same it is badly lighted by a large dome in the center and at the upper end are the tribunals of the grand vizir exactly in the same position and raised in the same manner above the hall as the passage between the courts of chancery and kings bench leading to our house of commons behind the vizirs sopha and no great height above his head is a small window grated with iron bars double gilt within which the grand signor is seated he cannot be distinguished but it is known when he is there by the brilliancy of the large diamonds in his turban in one angle at a distance from the vizir but at the same end of the hall are seated on sophas the two chiefjustices of the ottoman empire their heads covered with large turbans the one white the other green from an opening in the wall at the left angle there is an entrance into a second hall which seems united with the first and in this there are a great number of other high officers of state seated on sophas according to their rank  but the poor ambassador has a great deal to suffer in the divan chamber before he proceeds any further the audience of an ambassador is the time of all others chosen to present publicly a great number of petitions and memorials to the vizir purposely to show his authority while this business goes forward the vizir sends the dragoman to his excellency with complimentary messages to fill up the time the next trial of his patience is issuing the money for payment of the military establishment for six months and as a proof of their ostentation it will often happen that the day of giving audience to an ambassador cannot be put off till it is due in which case to the great joy of the military it must be paid in advance for they will not omit this display of their riches it may indeed happen the six months are expired and then the payment is put off to the day of audience  the money is all brought into the divan chamber in bags called purses and flung upon the ground without any order the grand vizir orders one of them to be opened and counted pro forma the first troops to be paid are the janissaries of whom not less than  0000 are assembled in the outward courts before the sublime port upon occasion of the audience of an ambassador as impatient to receive their pay as to have the order given to receive what they call the ministers being a kind of rice soup given to them on such days by the grand signor the colonel of the oldest regiment of the janissaries appears first at the door of the divan chamber when he is called in and as many bags as will pay him and his men are flung out of the door down the steps upon which he retires bowing all the way and constantly facing the tribunal so that he walks out backwards the colonel of every regiment does the same but before the second enters the money belonging to the first must be cleared away which is done by throwing the bags through an aperture like a window into the square below where the janissaries of his regiment count the money again and then carry it off to their quarters as fast as possible he who can carry away most being most esteemed by his officers this absurd ceremony lasts three hours and it requires the patience of a stoic to sit it out  when this business is finished three tables are covered for dinner one before the vizir another before the tefterdar and a third before the nissangi the ambassador alone dines at the vizirs table and his suite at the other two this repast is very short though the number and variety of the dishes are inconceivable these are all served up in green china and one at a time according to the turkish fashion but then they are removed every two of three minutes the servants however who attend use equal dispatch in laying the best parts on the plates of their guests who if they like what is served on their plates may let the next dish pass without exchanging it after dinner the ambassador returns to his seat and the reiseffendi presents to the vizir his memorial requiring an audience of the grand signor the vizir reads and signs it then wraps it up in a piece of embroidered silk and seals it over this cover he puts a sheet of white paper and a private mark and then delivers it to the chiaus bachi who carries it to the grand signor upon the return of that officer with the sultans answer the vizir quits his sopha and goes to the door of the divan chamber to receive it he touches it with his forehead as an act of submission then returns to his place opens and reads it after which he gives orders that the ambassador should be conducted through the second hall where the other great officers are araged as before mentioned and where the chiaus bachi attend with the presents brought by the ambassador for the grand signor from thence he proceeds to an open saloon the door of which opens into the grand signors apartments here his excellency and his attendants put on their caftans as soon as the proper officers have opened this door the ambassador is introduced by the grand vizir and the aga of the janissaries supported on each side by two capicibachis in this manner his excellency and his train enter the presence chamber where the grand signor is seated on his throne consisting of a sopha raised several feet from the ground and placed in the upper corner of the room on the right hand with upright cushions to support his back and arms if he chooses it these cushions are richly embroidered and adorned with pearls and other jewels the canopy over the throne is extremely magnificent made of crimson satin lined with white satin and faced with plated gold interspersed with brilliant diamonds and pearls but nothing can exceed the splendor of the sultans dress his turban and caftan being almost covered with jewels the ambassador then bows to the grand signor and addresses him in a short harangue in the venetian language the purport of which is to assure his sublime highness that the republic of venice ardently desires to cultivate an eternal friendship with his highness and all his subjects his credentials are then delivered to the grand vizir who places them on the throne upon this the sultan speaks a few words to the vizir charging him to deliver an answer on his part to the ambassador that he will grant peace friendship and protection to him and his countrymen throughout the empire the ambassador then makes his bow and retires  as the ambassador and his train reach the second court where their horses are left before the vizir can get ready with his immense suite his excellency is obliged to wait some time before this parade is adjusted for upon this occasion the vizir and all the other great officers of the seraglio go before the ambassador to conduct him out of the port on his return after which they separate the ambassador and his train proceeding toward pera and the vizir attended by the other officers going to his own house the procession therefore from the second square of the seraglio to the street though short is very magnificent  such was the etiquette attending the reception of an ambassador from the republic of venice  a remarkable political axiom in the turkish laws respecting their imprisoning the foreign ministers has been totally overlooked by all writers upon their system of government which we think it right to notice perhaps they were ignorant of the fact the ottoman court considers every ambassador as having two distinct characters the one representative the other personal in the exercise of the first they view him as representing his sovereign and in this light treat him with great respect and even allow that he may assume the tone of a master and state his demands to the grand signor complaining of any infringement of treaties or acts of injustice committed by the turks against the subjects of the state he represents and even to insist upon satisfaction in the most peremptory terms  but if he offers to threaten them with an approaching war or proceeds nearly to a declaration of it before he leaves their dominions they say he has a personal character which is that of hostage given by way of assurance and security to the court to which he is sent and where he resides that he will not violate the treaties subsisting between them and in this capacity they make him responsible for the rupture with which he threatens them and justify their disregard to the universal law of nations which declares the persons of ambassadors to be sacred even in time of war  though there is no distinction of title between the foreign ministers residing at constantinople yet greater honors are shown to some than to others as soon as the imperial ambassador arrives on the turkish frontiers he and all his suite are maintained at the expense of the grand signor till his return be his stay ever so long the same conduct was observed with respect to prince repnin ambassadorextraordinary from russia but this was upon a very particular occasion namely to negociate a peace and is no precedent for other ministers from the same court the imperial ambassador likewise brings very rich presents to the grand signor who sends back to the emperor presents still more valuable by his ambassador at vienna whereas the ambassadors of france england and holland make very considerable presents to the sultan who makes no acknowledgments whatever in return these presents the grand signor lays a kind of claim to from those powers for the permission granted them to send ministers to reside at his court and for the protection and privileges allowed to their trading subjects  there is a peculiar distinction shown the venetian ambassador besides that of a public entry namely to fire a number of mortars on st marks day according to the age of the doge and to keep the festival with as much noise and mirth as his people shall think proper this is never permitted to the ambassador of any crowned head even on such occasions as the birthdays marriages or coronations of their respective princes  the homage they pay the emperor of germany is very great and in cases where they have had reason to complain of the conduct of the imperial minister at constantinople they have suppressed their complaints and quietly submitted to the violation of their most sacred rights  an instance of this kind occurred during the late war between the russians and the turks of so singular a nature that it merits an ample recital of all its circumstances the ceremony of exposing the sacred standard of mahomet by carrying it in grand procession through the principal streets of constantinople previously to its being transported to the camp is a solemnity held in the highest veneration by the turks and so sacred that they will not permit any person of what ever rank or religion besides mussulmen to see it on which account three days before the day of the procession heralds are sent into every street of constantinople to proclaim that on such a day the standard of mahomet will be carried through the city on its way to the army and that no person who are not mahometans are to be in the streets through which it passes or even looking into them from any of the houses on pain of death notwithstanding this public prohibition the imperial minister unmindful of his public character which should have made him more delicate than a private individual on such an occasion was persuaded to gratify the curiosity of his wife and two daughters who were determined to see this grand procession for this purpose he hired a chamber in the house of a moulah or lawyer the price of which was fixed at fifty piastres two days before the solemnity was to take place the minister found out a more convenient apartment at an inferior price which he immediately took and relinquished the first the moulah in vain represented that europeans generally kept their word but more especially ministers in public characters he was refused every kind of satisfaction and dismissed with taunts the minister well knowing that no tribunal would dare to proceed against him and that though the order of moulahs have the most powerful interest with the government yet their dread of offending his royal master was superior to every other consideration the moulah submitted in appearance without murmuring but secretly vowed vengeance and only waited a proper opportunity to gratify this darling passion in the breast of a turk  in the very moment that the holy standard was passing through the street in which the ambassador his lady and two daughters had taken a chamber and as it approached the house from a window of which half opened they were looking at the splendid show the moulah set up a loud cry that the holy standard was profaned by the eyes of infidels who were viewing it through the latticed window of such a house the multitude which was immense as all ranks of people attend such a solemnity instantly took the alarm and a party consisting of near three hundred enraged janissaries detached themselves from the procession and broke open the door of the house determined to sacrifice to the prophet those daring infidels who had profaned his holy standard the imprudent minister in vain represented to them that he was the imperial ambassador he was instantly knocked down and the inner doors being forced they found the ambassadress whom they stripped of her jewels and clothes and nothing but her age protected her from further insults as for the young ladies they had fallen senseless upon the floor in a swoon from which they were only recovered by the extreme torture of having their earrings torn from them with such violence that part of their ears went with them they were likewise stripped to their shifts and what they suffered besides no mortal can tell it was reported that some of the janissaries had compassion on their youth and beauty and the wretched situation to which they were reduced while another party were deaf to all entreaties be this as it may after they had plundered them they retired and in the evening this deplorable family were secretly conveyed to galata  as soon as the grand vizir received information of the horrid outrage committed on the person of the ambassador and the ladies he communicated it to the grand signor who condescended to send him compliments of condolence and excuse in his own name accompanied with a rich pelice which is a distinguishing token of peace in turkey and as his sublime highness knew the minister loved money a very handsome sum was sent to him privately and separate purses to the ladies besides jewels far superior to those the janissaries had taken from them having received such ample indemnifications the whole family seemed perfectly satisfied and the young ladies related the adventure to their christian friends in a manner that did no great credit to their modesty  had the piece finished with this act all would have been well but unfortunately the divan thought something was due to public decorum and that an example of severity was requisite in point of policy that other foreign ministers might be assured of the safety of their person and property the strictest search was therefore made to discover the individuals guilty of these personal insults and indignities to the ambassador and the ladies without effect but the heads of  00 persons janissaries and others concerned in the riot were cut off and information sent to the ambassador of this bloody execution with a request to know if that would satisfy him to which he replied so far as respected his own person and family he was satisfied but that having sent dispatches to vienna on the subject he could say no more till they arrived the courier impatiently expected by both sides at length arrived and brought such an answer as might be expected from so discerning a prince as the emperor it contained no complaints against the port but an order of recall to the minister couched in such terms that struck him to the heart for he instantly fell sick and either died by his own hands or a natural death in a few days his wife and daughters soon after returned privately to vienna where the story of the young ladies had arrived long before them and was represented in such a light to the empress dowager then living and absorbed in devout exercises that they were ordered to retire to a convent for the remainder of their life  baron tott relates a singular trait of the late emperor which accords little with that immense state and splendor with which the turkish emperors receive ambassadors from foreign powers this prince says he violent and hasty in his temper but weak impatient and curious to excess exhibited to us on our return from the seraglio when mr de vergennes had his audience as ambassador a very singular scene we saw him disguised like a professor of the law accompained by two of his officers who appeared as footmen he had stopped in a street to see us go by and as we passed on into the acmeidan or hippodrome we presently perceived he had overtaken us and was running by our side but slackening his pace when he came up to the ambassador he accompanied him to the end of that square and then beginning to run again he crossed the street in front of the procession and entering one of the gates of the seraglio went out of it again near the sea to meet us when we were to take water there he remained till our departure and then returned again to his palace and we saw no more of him  i remarked adds the baron during the whole time this prince kept us company in the hippodrome where we were surrounded by numbers whom curiosity had drawn together no one gave the least sign or intimation which could discover him though every one knew him and trembled at his presence but depotism tyrannizes over every thing and forces its slaves to dissemble even the very fear it inspires  on the opposite side of the canal nearly adjoining to scutari is a very magnificent kiosh or pleasurehouse of the grand signors situated at chalcedon a town of ancient note of which but little remains are to be seen it had formerly two very celebrated temples dedicated one to apollo the other to venus when chalcedon was an eminent city scutari was an ignoble village but by the contrary events of fate the former is now reduced to nothing and scutari is a fair and spacious city its canal among other names had that of fretum chalcedonium  the situation of this kiosh is very pleasant it is in the center and on the highest spot of a very fine garden most of the walks are shaded with trees and there are several noble parterres of very considerable length they all end at the kiosh from whence there is a most delightful prospect  it was the natural beauty of this place that inclined soliman ii to build this kiosh where he might retire occasionally with some of the ladies of the seraglio and for this purpose he had a stately sopha built in a place a little higher than the rest furnished with quilts cushions and rich carpets and surrounded with marble balustrades this sopha is a square and placed in the middle of a large basin of the same form which is insensibly filled with a great many cascades so high as to be fit to bathe in  soliman who took as much pleasure in the delights of venus as he did in those of mars had this place enriched with all the voluptuous ornaments which the skill of mohammedan artists could invent and often crossed over from his seraglio at constantinople that he might indulge himself more freely in those extravagant pleasures to which his inclinations prompted him  from lady cs late account of constantinople and its environs it should seem these kioshs are no longer the reigning taste the sultans says she formerly built different palaces or pleasurehouses on the borders of the canal which are now forsaken there is one on the asiatic side in the midst of a fine garden falling to ruin very fast there are however some very magnificent lookingglasses and furniture still remaining in it and what seems very absurd these are not removed but suffered to fall and perish as it may please the wind and rain no one being permitted to touch or remove any thing the port and the public are equally losers the garden large enough to make a beautiful park is left quite wild and as no person goes into it one of the most beautiful spots on that coast just facing the seraglio is lost to every one this is the case with every royal residence which when abandoned by the caprice of the sovereign is neither demolished nor even unfurnished but suffered to continue in the same manner as if it was inhabited  that we may enable our readers to form some idea of the splendor of the country seats of the great men of the ottoman empire we shall give lady ms description of one on the banks of the canal belonging to a grand vizir who married a sultana daughter of the reigning sultan it is situated says she on one of the most delightful parts of the canal with a fine wood on the side of a hill behind it the extent of it is prodigious the guardian assured me there are near eight hundred rooms in it it is certain the number is very large and the whole adorned with a profusion of marble gilding and the most exquisite painting of fruit and flowers the windows are all sashed with the finest chrystaline glass brought from england and here is all the magnificence that can be supposed in a palace founded by a vain luxurious young man with the wealth of a vast empire at his command  but no part of this palace is more to be admired than the apartments destined for the bagnios there are two built exactly in the same manner answering to one another the bath fountains and pavements are all of white marble the roofs gilt and the walls covered with japan china adjoining to them are two rooms the uppermost of which is divided into a sopha and in the four corners are falls of water from the very roof from shell to shell of white marble to the lower end of the room where it falls into a large basin surrounded with pipes that throw up the water as high as the room the walls are in the nature of lattices and on the outside of them there are vines and woodbines planted that form a kind of green tapestry and give an agreeable obscurity to those delightful chambers i should go on says she and let you into some of the other apartments all worthy of being described but it is harder to describe a turkish palace than any other being built entirely irregular there is nothing that can be called front or wings and though such a confusion is pleasing to the sight yet it would be very unintelligible in description suffice it therefore only to add that the chamber destined for the sultan when he visits his daughter is wainscoted with mother of pearl fastened with emeralds like nails there are others of mother of pearl and olive wood inlaid and several of japan china the galleries which are numerous and very large are adorned with jars of flowers and porcelane dishes of fruit of all sorts so well done in plaster and colored in so lively a manner that it has an enchanting effect the garden is suitable to the house where harbors fountains and walks are thrown together in an agreeable confusion there is no ornament wanting but that of statues thus it may be seen that those people are not so unpolished as they are represented it is true their magnificence is of a different taste from that of europeans and perhaps of a better one is apt sometimes to think they have a right notion of life they consume it in music gardens wine and delicate eating while we are tormenting our brains with some scheme of politics or studying some science to which we can never attain or if we do cannot persuade other people to set that value upon it we do ourselves it is certain what we feel and see is properly if any thing is properly our own but the good of fame the folly of praise are hardly purchased and when obtained poor recompense for loss of time and health we die and grow old before we can reap the fruit of our labors considering then what shortlived weak animals men are is there any study so beneficial as the study of present pleasure  the grand signors dress differs very little from that of other persons except in length and richness his turban is like that of the bashaws except only that he wears plumes and breeches which they do not he sleeps upon velvet mattresses or such as are made of gold cloth covered in summer with sheets embroired with silk and in winter with furs when he sleeps in his own apartments two old women keep watch in his chamber to light him if he chooses to count his beads at the hours of prayer which are twelve at night and two hours before daybreak the womens dress is much like that of the mens for they wear breeches and buskins and sleep in them wearing thin ones in summer and thick ones in winter  when he goes to the mosque on fridays he is accompanied through the city by all the bashaws and grandees besides a large retinue of servants who walk by his side the people as he goes along follow him with repeated acclamations of health and happiness which he returns by a nod if he goes abroad by water he is carried in his barge covered with crimson velvet richly embroidered under which he sits his officers standing all round him if by land he is always on horseback  it appears even at other times his retinue is very splendid i went says lady m to see the grand signor in his passage to the mosque he was preceded by a numerous guard of janissaries with vast white feathers on their heads as also by the spahis and bostangis  these are foot and horse guards and the royal gardeners which are a very considerable body of men dressed in different habits of fine lively colors so that at a distance they appeared like a parterre of tulips after them came the aga of the janissaries in a robe of purple velvet lined with silver tissue his horse led by two slaves richly dressed next him the kislaraga this is the chief guardian of the ladies of the seraglio in a deep yellow cloth which suited very well to his black face and lined with sables last came his sublime highness arrayed in green lined with the fur of a muscovite fox supposed to be worth a thousand pounds sterling and mounted on a fine horse decorated with jewels six more horses richly caparisoned were led for him and two of his principal courtiers bore one his gold and the other his silver coffeepot on a staff another carried a silver stool for him to sit on it would be too tedious to tell all the various dresses and turbans by which their rank is distinguished but they were all extremely rich and gay to the number of some thousands  chap vi of adrianople this city is     miles from constantinople and was anciently called orestes but now receives its name from the emperor adrian it was the first european seat of the turkish empire and has been the favorite residence of many sultans its situation is very fine and the country round it very beautiful but the air is extremely bad and the seraglio itself is not free from the ill effects of it the town gardens included is eight miles in compass the river maritza anciently the hebrus on which the city is situated at the place where it receives the tunsa and the harda is dried up every summer which contributes very much to make it unwholesome in winter it is a large and spacious river but with a slow stream there are two noble bridges over it the city which is fair and compact rises gently from the banks of this river the exchange is very spacious being above half a mile in length the roof arched and kept extremely neat it holds three hundred and sixtyfive shops furnished with all sorts of rich goods exposed to sale in the same manner as at exeterchange in london but the pavement is kept much neater and the shops are all so clean that they seem just painted idle people of all sorts walk here for their diversion and amuse themselves with drinking coffee or sherbet which is cried about as oranges and sweetmeats are in our play houses  near it is the sherski a street of a mile in length full of shops of all kinds of fine merchandise but excessive dear nothing being manufactured here it is covered on the top with boards to keep out the rain and that merchants may meet conveniently in all weathers the besisten near it is another exchange built upon pillars where all kinds of horse furniture are sold and glittering every where with gold rich embroidery and jewels it makes a very agreeable show  in most of our accounts of turkey says lady m it is observed that their houses are the most miserable pieces of building in the world on the contrary says she the manner of building here appears to me very agreeable and peculiarly adapted to the country it is true they are not at all solicitous in this city to beautify the outsides of their houses and they are generally built with wood which is the cause of many inconveniences but this is not to be charged to the ill taste of the people but to the oppression of the government every house at the death of its master is at the grand signors disposal and therefore no man cares to enter into any great expense which he is not sure his family will be the better for all their design is to build a commodious house that will last their lives and they are very indifferent if it falls down the year after every house great and small is divided into two distinct parts joining together only by a narrow passage the first house has a large court before it and open galleries all round it which to many people will appear very agreeable the gallery leads to all the chambers which are commonly large and with two rows of windows the first being of painted glass they seldom build above two stories each of which has galleries the stairs are broad and not often above thirty steps this is the house belonging to the lord and the adjoining one is called the haram that is the ladies apartment it has also a gallery running round it toward the garden to which all the windows are turned and the same number of chambers as the other but more gay and splendid both in painting and furniture the second row of windows is very low with grates like those of convents the rooms are all spread with persia carpets and raised at one end of them about two feet this is the sopha which is laid with a richer sort of carpeting and all round it a sort of couch raised half a foot covered with rich silk according to the fancy or magnificence of the owner some are of scarlet cloth with a gold fringe round about this are placed standing against the wall two rows of cushions the first very large and the rest little ones and here the turks display their greatest magnificence they are generally brocade or embroidery of gold wire upon white satin nothing can look more gay and splendid these seats are also so convenient and easy that a person accustomed to them will never endure chairs again whilst he lives the rooms are low which some people think no fault and the cieling is always of wood generally inlaid or painted with flowers they open in many places with folding doors and serve for cabinets more conveniently than ours between the windows are little arches to set pots of perfume or baskets of flowers but what is most pleasing is the fashion of having marble fountains in the lower part of the room which throw up several spouts of water giving at the same time an agreeable coolness and a pleasant dashing found in falling from one basin to another some of these are very magnificent each house has a bagnio which consists generally in two or three little rooms leaded at the top paved with marble with basins cocks of water and all conveniences for either hot or cold water  the harams or womens apartments are always built backwards removed from the sight and have no other prospect than the gardens which are enclosed with very high walls there is none of our parterres in them but they are planted with high trees which give an agreeable shade and a very pleasing view in the midst of the garden is the kiosh that is a large room commonly beautified with a fine fountain in the midst it is raised nine or ten steps and enclosed with gilded lattices round which vines jessamines and honeysuckles make a sort of green wall large trees are planted round this place which is the scene of their greatest pleasures and where the ladies spend most of their hours employed by their music or embroidery in the public gardens there are public kioshs where people go that are not so well accommodated at home and drink their coffee sherbet etc neither are they ignorant of a more durable manner of building their mosques are all of free stone and the public khans or inns are extremely magnificent many of them taking up a large square built round with shops under stone arches where poor artificers are lodged gratis they have always a mosque joining to them and the body of the khan is a most noble hall capable of holding three or four hundred persons the court extremely spacious and surrounded by cloisters that give it the air of our colleges and this no doubt is a more reasonable piece of charity than the founding of convents  the greatest beauty of this city and as some think of the whole empire is the mosque of sultan selim the second built by him out of materials brought chiefly from the ruins of famagusta in the island of cyprus yet the area not being square nor supported with such rich or correspondent pillars four only excepted that adorn the front i esteem it says chishull inferior to the two noble mosques of solomon and achmet at constantinople  it is situated very advantageously in the midst of the city and in the highest part of it making a very noble show the first court has four gates the innermost three they are both of them surrounded with cloisters with marble pillars of the ionic order finely polished and of very lively colors the whole pavement is of white marble and the roof of the cloisters divided into several cupolas or domes headed with gilt balls on the top in the midst of each court are fine fountains of white marble and before the great gate of the mosque a portico with green marble pillars which has five gates the body of the mosque being one prodigious dome it has two rows of marble galleries on pillars with marble balustrades the pavement is also covered with persian carpets it is no small addition to its beauty that it is not divided into pews and encumbered with forms and benches like our churches nor are the pillars which are most of them red and white marble disfigured by the little tawdry images and pictures that give roman catholic churches the air of toy shops the walls seem to be inlaid with such very lively colors in small flowers as to give them at first sight the appearance of precious stones in the midst hangs a vast lamp of silver gilt with at least two thousand of a lesser size this must look very glorious when they are all lighted but being at night no women are suffered to enter  under the large lamp is a great pulpit of carved wood gilt and just by a fountain to wash which is an essential part of their devotion in one corner is a little gallery enclosed with gilded lattices for the grand signor at the upper end of a large niche very like an altar raised on two steps and covered with gold brocade are two silver gilt candlesticks the height of a man and in them white waxcandles as thick as a mans wrist  this mosque is adorned with four regular and beautiful minarets each of which has     stairs leading into the uppermost balcony each minaret has three balconies that imitate the capitals of pillars between which the whole body of the column is regularly channelled one of them is remarkable for having three staircases winding one within another so that three priests may ascend to each of the balconies without meeting one another it is from these balconies that the imans call the people to prayers from the uppermost of them says chishull we had an opportunity of viewing the several parts and precincts of the city the plat of the seraglio the course of the rivers and the face of the country below with the busy cares of the several mortals wandering about like so many ants on that spot of earth then subject to our eye  adjoining to one of these mosques is a madhouse a noble building of a circular figure covered with a regular cupola and having a large area in the middle with a cistern of water but conveniently divided all round into chambers made archways and opening on one side into the area here the madmen are kept who are all furnished with clean mats and tied close down to the pavement by an iron chain fastened about their necks for greater security  for some miles round this city the whole ground is laid out in gardens and the banks of the rivers are set with rows of fruit trees under which the better class of people divert themselves every evening not with walking that not being one of their pastimes but a set party of them choose a green spot where the shade is very thick and they spread a carpet on which they fit drinking their coffee and are generally attended by some slave who has a fine voice or plays on some instrument every twenty paces one of these little companies may be seen listening to the dashing of the river and this taste is so universal that the very gardeners are not without it i have often seen them and their children says lady m sitting on the banks of the river and playing on a rural instrument perfectly answering the description of the ancient fistula being composed of unequal reeds with a simple but agreeable softness in the sound there is not a single instrument of music she adds among the greek or roman statues that is not to be found in the hands of the people of this country the young lads generally divert themselves with making garlands for their favorite lambs which they paint and adorn with flowers and who are lying at their feet all the time they are singing or playing such are the ancient amusements here and which are as natural to them as cudgelplaying and football to our british swains the softness and warmth of the climate forbidding all rough exercises which were never so much as heard of amongst them and naturally inspiring a laziness and aversion to labor which the great plenty indulges these gardeners are the only happy race of country people in turkey they furnish all the city with fruits and herbs and seem to live very easily they are most of them greeks and have little houses in the midst of their gardens where their wives and daughters take a liberty not permitted in the city that of going unveiled these wenches are very neat and handsome and pass their time at their looms under the trees  to those who visit this province of turkey theocritus will no longer be looked upon as romantic he has only given a plain image of the way of life among the peasants of his country who before oppression had reduced them to want were probably employed as the better sort of them are now had he been born a briton his idyllium would have been filled with descriptions of threshing and churning both which are unknown here the corn being all trodden out by oxen and butter unheard of  many of the customs and much of the dress recorded in the writings of homer will still be found retained by the inhabitants of this country the princesses and great ladies pass their time at their looms embroidering veils and robes surrounded by their maids who are always very numerous in the same manner as we find andromache and helen described the description of the belt of menelaus exactly resembles those that are now worn by the great men in turkey fastened before with broad golden clasps and embroidered round with rich work the snowy veil that helen threw over her face is still fashionable their manner of dancing is certainly the same that diana is said to have danced on the banks of the eurotas the great lady still leads the dance and is followed by a troop of young girls imitating her steps and if she sings make up the chorus  lady m tells us she paid a visit here to the kahyas lady an officer equal in rank to the grand vizir i was met at the door says she by two black eunuchs who led me through a long gallery between two ranks of beautiful young girls with their hair finely plaited almost hanging to their feet and dressed in fine light damasks brocaded with silver i was sorry that decency did not permit me to consider them nearer but that thought was lost upon my entrance into a large room or rather pavillion built round with gilded fashes which were most of them thrown up and the the visit to fatima trees planted over them gave an agreeable shade which hindered the sun from being troublesome the jessamines and honeysuckles that twisted round their trunks shed a soft perfume increased by a white marble fountain playing sweet water in the lower part of the room which fell into three or four basins with a pleasing sound the roof was painted with all sorts of flowers falling out of gilded baskets that seemed tumbling down on a sofa raised three steps and covered with fine persian carpets sat the kahyas lady leaning on cushions of white satin embroidered and at her feet sat two young girls about twelve years old lovely as angels dressed perfectly rich and almost covered with jewels but they were hardly seen near the fair fatima for this was her name so much did her beauty efface every thing i have seen says lady m nay all that has been called lovely either in england or germany i must own i never saw any thing so gloriously beautiful nor can i recollect a face that would have been taken notice of near here is she stood up to receive me saluting me after their fashion putting her hand to her heart with a sweetness full of majesty that no courtbreeding could ever give she ordered cushions to be given me and took care to place me in the corner which is the place of honor i was so struck with admiration that i could not for some time speak to her being wholly taken up in gazing that surprising harmony of features that charming result of the whole that exact proportion of body that lovely bloom of complexion unsullied by art the unutterable enchantment of her smile  but her eyes  large and black with all the soft languishment of the blue every turn of her face discovering some new grace  my first surprise being over i vainly endeavored by nicely examining her face to find out some imperfection and was clearly convinced of the error of that vulgar notion that a face exactly proportioned and perfectly beautiful would not be agreeable nature having done for her with more success what apelles is said to have essayed by a collection of the most exact features to form a perfect face add to all this a behavior so full of grace and sweetness such easy motions with an air so majestic yet free from stiffness and affectation that could she have been suddenly transported upon the most polite throne of europe nobody would think her other than born and bred to be a queen though educated in a country we call barbarous to say all in a word our most celebrated english beauties would vanish near her  she was dressed in a caftan of gold brocade flowered with silver very well fitted to her shape and showing to admiration the beauty of her bosom only shaded by thin gauzes her drawers were pale pink her waistcoat green and silver her slippers white satin finely embroidered her lovely arms adorned with bracelets of diamonds and her broad girdle set round with diamonds upon her head a rich turkish handkerchief of pink and silver her own fine black hair hanging a great length in various tresses and on one side of her head some bodkins of jewels  her fair maids were ranged below the sopha to the number of twenty very much resembling the pictures of the ancient nymphs i did not think all nature could have furnished such a scene of beauty she made them a sign to play and dance four of them immediately began to play some soft airs on instruments between a lute and a guitar which they accompanied with their voices while the others danced by turns nothing could be more artful or more proper to raise certain ideas the tunes so soft  the motions so languishing accompanied with pauses and dying eyes  half falling and then recovering themselves in so artful a manner that the coldest and most rigid prude upon earth could not have looked upon them without thinking of a something not to be spoken of  when the dance was over four fair slaves came into the room with silver censors in their hands and perfumed the air with amber aloes wood and other scents after this they served me coffee upon their knees in the finest japan china with soucoups of silver gilt the lovely fatima entertaining me all this while in the most polite and agreeable manner when i took my leave two maids brought in a fine basket of embroidered handkerchiefs she begged i would wear the richest for her sake and gave the others to my woman and interpretess i retired through the same ceremonies as before and could not help thinking i had been some time in mahomets paradise so much was i charmed with what i had seen  this description of lady ms reception by the fair fatima may serve to give some faint idea of the beauty splendor and elegance that reign in the harams of the turkish officers of state not only in adrianople but throughout the east beauty in general adds lady m is more common here than with us it is even surprising to see a young woman that is not very handsome they have naturally the most beautiful complexions in the world and generally large black eyes they generally shape their eyebrows and both greeks and turks have the custom of putting round their eyebrows a black tincture that at a distance or by candlelight adds very much to the blackness of them  the ladies in this city have in reality more liberty than we have no woman of what rank soever is permitted to go into the street without two murlins one that covers her face all but her eyes and another that hides the whole dress of her head and hangs half way down her back their shapes are also wholly concealed by a thing they call a ferigee which no woman of any sort appears without this has strait sleeves that reach to the fingers ends and it laps all round them not unlike a winding sheet reaching to the feet in winter it is of cloth and in summer of plain stuff or silk in this dress there is no distinguishing the great lady from her slave it is impossible for the most jealous husband to know his wife when he meets her and no man dare touch or follow a woman in the street  this perpetual masquerade gives them entire liberty of following their inclinations without danger of discovery the most usual method of intrigue is to send an appointment to the lover to meet the lady at a jews shop which are as notoriously convenient as our houses in london where they sell india goods and yet even those who dont make use of them do not scruple to go to buy pennyworths and tumble over rich goods which are chiefly to be found among that sort of people the great ladies seldom let their gallants know who they are and it is so difficult to find it out that they can very seldom guess at her name whom they have corresponded with for half a year together it may easily be imagined the number of faithful wives is very small in a country where they have nothing to fear from a lovers indiscretion neither have they much to apprehend from the resentment of their husbands those ladies that are rich having all the money in their own hands  most of the rich tradesmen in this city are jews that people have incredible power in this country they have many privileges above all the natural turks themselves and have formed a very considerable commonwealth here being judged by their own laws they have drawn the whole trade of the empire into their hands partly by the firm union among themselves and partly by the idle temper and want of industry in the turks every bassa has his jew who is his homme daffaires he is let into all his secrets and does all his business no bargain is made no bribe received no merchandise disposed of but what passes through their hands they are many of them immensely rich but they take care to make little public show of it though they live in their houses in the utmost luxury and magnificence  horses are not put here to any laborious work nor are they at all fit for it they are beautiful and full of spirit but generally little and not so strong as the breed of colder countries very gentle however with all their vivacity and also swift and surefooted the beasts destined to the plough are buffaloes these are larger and more clumsy than an ox they have short thick black horns close to their heads which grow turning backwards it is said this horn looks very beautiful when it is well polished they are all black with very short hair on their hides and have extremely little white eyes that make them look like devils the country people dye their tails and the hair of their forehead red by way of ornament  they carry all their burdens on camels these animals are much higher and far swifter than the fleetest horse but very ill shaped and disproportioned they are never thoroughly tamed the drivers take care to tie them one to another with strong ropes fifty in a string led by an ass on which the driver rides there are sometimes three hundred of them in one caravan they carry the third part more than a horse but it is a particular art to load them because of the hunch on their backs  the seraglio is built in a flat verdant plain at the foot of the city between the hebrus and the tunsa but more immediately on the banks of the latter it is surrounded almost on all sides with a thick grove of beech and elm which forms the resemblance of a park from within the walls of the seraglio and from the city affords a very beautiful prospect the whole country round being very bare of wood a square wall encloses the fabric which is truly mean and of a confused intricate figure but as it is commonly said well contrived for convenience the walls are plain free stone and the covering lead nothing can be more grateful to the eye than the sight of this level verdant situation and yet on account of its lowness and too near approach to the rivers no situation can be more unwholesome it seems to stand on the very spot where constantine gave that famous defeat to licinius  philippopolis is a pretty large town near this city situated on a rising ground in the way to constantinople from the lower part of germany the country from hence to adrianople is the finest in the world vines grow wild on all the hills and the perpetual spring they enjoy makes every thing gay and flourishing this town was first founded by philip father of alexander the great from whom it received also its name in    0 the turks made themselves masters of it the neighboring country abounds remarkably in rice the flourishing state of the sciences and beaux arts among the greeks has been chiefly owing to the thracians but at present there is scarce a person of any eminence in literature through all romania  in this town there is a sect of christians that call themselves paulines they show an old church where they say st paul preached and he is their favorite saint after the same manner that st peter is at rome neither do they forget to give him the preference over the rest of the apostles  chap vii of the people etc the number of inhabitants in this great empire is very disproportionate to the extent and goodness of the country and may be attributed to three causes pestilence polygamy and war this accounts for such large tracks of fine soil lying waste though the avarice of the governors is likewise in part culpable for this desolation  some years since owing to the tyrannical oppression of the bashaws of the provinces the people removed their persons and effects to the capital in such numbers that it was impossible to find room for them and the old inhabitants the divan therefore published an order that all those families who had not been established twenty years in the city should leave it and guards were placed at the gates to prevent the arrival of any more subjects from the provinces  the inhabitants consist of various nations of turks greeks armenians servians bosnians bulgarians walachians and tartars with no small number of jews especially at constantinople and in sclavonia  the turks are stigmatized among the christians as a slothful stupid and inhuman people but they by no means are so wicked and dreadful as the french and other writers have thought proper to represent them turkey is not without men of talents probity and honor and there are many very benevolent liberal ingenious and enlightened characters to be found in every part of the empire no people are more punctual in their dealings than the turks in compassion and love toward our neighbor they excel all the rest of mankind one striking mark of their charity is their building khans or public inns called by the asiatics caravanseras for the accommodation of travelers which are to be met with in almost every little village in these every traveller of whatever religion or country he be may continue three days gratis and in many of them he is likewise found in victuals the turks are very fond of erecting these buildings considering it to be a work of charity and which will be acceptable to god  with the same laudable view they search out the best springs and dig wells which in those countries are a luxury to the wearied traveller in their demeanor the turks are rather hypocondriac they are grave sedate and passive but when their minds are agitated by passion they are furious raging and ungovernable in matters of religion tenacious superstitious and morose the morals of the asiatic turks are said to be far preferable to those of the european they are more hospitable to strangers and if there be any vices among them those of avarice and inhumanity reign chiefly among their great men  not only the caravanseras and wells or cisterns but likewise the roads and bridges in turkey are kept in repair by the labor and industry of private individuals who consider it a work of charity which will be highly accepted by heaven to provide for the entertainment and comfort of the weary traveller even those who live by their daily labor and have nothing else to contribute will spend part of their time gratuitously in this employment and it is said in the eastern part of the empire that the hospitable natives like abraham of old will invite strangers as they pass through their towns to their tents and houses and contend for the honor of entertaining them  piety says peysonnell and not superstition as tott affirms has multiplied the namasgiahs and the fountains have been constructed by humanity and charity those who founded the latter very justly esteemed it a highly meritorious action to relieve the thirsty passenger in the streets or the parched traveller on the roads and to supply them witth the means of making those ablutions which must infallibly precede their prayers many have even carried their benevolence so far as to assign sums of money for furnishing snow during the summer that those who drink at these fountains may render the water more cool and refreshing  to the slaves and servants who are about them they behave very commendably and frequently much better than the christians do to theirs in the first years of their servitude these people suffer most especially if they are young as the turks endeavor partly by fair means and partly by threats to bring them over to their own religion but these trials being over captivity is nowhere more tolerable than in turkey insomuch that if a servant understands any art or trade the only thing he can want is his freedom being supplied with every other thing he can wish for  as there is a great mixture of inhabitants throughout the empire so is there more particularly in the capital if constantinople had no other inhabitants than turks it would not be half so populous as it is the greeks armenians and jews form a considerable body of its citizens the greeks are the most numerous and though they have lost the confidence of the turkish government as a nation they still preserve as individuals an influence greater than that of any other christian subjects of the ottoman empire the governments of moldavia and walachia are always bestowed on greeks where they exercise a sovereign authority almost independent of the port there are at constantinople many descendants from the ancient families of greece who have preserved their pedigrees entire but they bear no other marks of their antiquity than the names of the illustrious persons from whom they descend and a few useless privileges which they enjoy in consequence of their noble birth almost all the great and opulent creeks live at fanari a suburb at a small distance from constantinople but which joins the chain of buildings continued on from the walls of that city in the same manner as newington and vauxhall are adjoining to london  the dragomen of the port and of all the towns on the frontiers are greeks the turks place a great confidence in these men knowing their family connexions and that all their hope of life are centered in turkey  great numbers of greeks likewise embrace the ecclesiastical life and by means of patronage at the port obtain benefices in the greek church and the dignities of bishops and patriarchs other greeks shut themselves up in the numerous monasteries throughout turkey such are the resources of the better sort as to the common people they are engaged in commerce and the mechanic arts the sea service also employs great numbers and many of them work in the arsenal in general they are very poor and as they despise the armenians and all other christians not of their own church and nation they have a great number of enemies  it may not be amiss to observe in this place that there are about forty ancient greek families residing in constantinople called motsellemin that is remitters they are the descendants of the malcontents who at the fall of the greek empire betrayed their country and their sovereign by joining with the turks who laid siege to the city and putting it into their hands from which circumstance they have derived their name they enjoy to this present time the privilege of wearing yellow slippers and red drawers like the turks and are exempt from the annual tribute paid by other christians subjects of the ottoman empire trifling immunities says hahesci for so great a crime they are however universally detested and are obliged to live secluded from society for if they attempt to mix in company they are immediately reproached with the treachery of their ancestors  the greeks says busching who are the ancient inhabitants of the country live intermixed with the turks and in several places particularly in the islands outnumber them in constantinople alone it is computed there are no less then four hundred thousand they are accustomed to servitude and prefer living under the turkish exactions to the spiritual tyranny of the pope but they must be very cautious of not giving even the least color for suspicion of their holding correspondence with the enemies of the port or of meditating a sedition it is usual for greater security in case of war with the christian powers to disarm them all greeks from the age of fourteen pay annually at the beginning of the turkish feast of bayram a capitation tax which amounts to about a ducat and receive a note of it the ecclesiastics are assessed higher a deacon paying two ducats and an archimandrite four but the bishops archbishops and patriarchs pay large sums generally as much as the arbitrary avarice of the grand vizir and bashaws shall think proper to require the taxes on merchants are estimated according to the value of the commodities they import the turks every where lay hold of all opportunities to extort money from the greeks but especially from the clergy in return for this tribute they enjoy the protection of the ottoman port and are maintained in the quiet possession of their properties insomuch that no turk is to insult them take any thing from them or intrude themselves into their houses against their will and in case of any such injuries they are certain of expeditious justice against the delinquents the greek women are exempt from all taxes as are likewise great numbers of other greeks who serve in the navy or elsewhere it sometimes happens indeed that a greek girl of distinguished beauty is taken away and carried to the seraglio but it is a mistake to suppose that christian women in general are forced away from their parents to be brought up in mahometanism when any thing of this kind is done it must be in provinces remote from constantinople  the armenians another people subject to the turks contribute greatly to the population of the capital their number in the city and its environs is computed at  0000 the major part are merchants and in general they are very rich most of the bankers are armenians they are sectaries following the doctrine of eutyches who denied the existence of two natures in christ the divine and human maintaining that the first only existed under the appearance of the latter they have their patriarch at constantinople a numerous priesthood and several churches a great part of them profess the roman catholic religion these have no churches but resort to the chapels of the foreign ambassadors the armenians in general bear a very good character they are pious faithful honest and polite to every one but the turks will not employ them in any service whatever yet they avail themselves of their opulence by extorting money from them under various pretenses  the jews come next under our consideration their number in and about constantinople is astonishing they reckon  0000 families which on a moderate calculation make  00000 persons they are subject to a kind of aristocratical government among themselves and it seldomor ever happens that they appeal from the sentences of their own judges to the turkish tribunal they possess great riches and live as much at their ease as they can do in a christian country for the turks esteem them much more than they do christians there is not a single branch of art or commerce which they do not carry on every turkish family as well in constantinople as adrianople who are of any note have jews familiar in their family one may judge from this of the number and quality of their protectors  a circumstance which makes them haughty and insolent to the greeks and other christians all the inferior officers in the customs are jews the factor to the aga of the janissaries is a jew and perhaps the most considerable one in the city they are not permitted to purchase lands which is the only privilege refused them their intercourse with the turks of rank gives them a knowledge of their private affairs and of their secrets which they turn to no small account as pimps and spies a foreign ambassador may know more of the state of the turkish cabinet by gratifying the avarice of a jew that being his ruling passion than from any other channel whatever  with respect to the external constitution of the turks they are generally robust and well shaped of a good mien and gracious countenance and patient under hardships this renders them fit for war to which they inure themselves from their youth persons of rank seldom train up their children to any other profession from an idea that no glory is comparable to that acquired in war it seldom happens that any turk is lame or crooked le brun remarks that one may meet with more crippled illshaped people in one town of europe than in all the grand signors empire they almost all arrive to a great age for which this very natural reason may be assigned that they never eat any thing but what is good and wholesome without attending like christians to the delicacy and variety of dishes which is often very prejudicial to the stomach and the more noble parts hence it is that they are seldom indisposed and scarce ever troubled with those disorders so common among us such as the gravel stone gout etc this is owing in part to their baths as well as to the temperance of their diet the women are no less well shaped than the men lady m has remarked that they have naturally the most beautiful complexions in the world  they generally shape their eyebrows with a black tincture and dye their nails of a rose color baron tott says that the drug so much used in asia for this purpose is a black impalpable powder so volatile as to spread itself like a fine down upon a small brass wire fixed in the cork of the bottle which contains it the method of using it is to take out the wire to which the cork serves for a handle without its touching the edges of the bottle which would rub off the powder and apply its extremity to the interior corner of the eye resting upon it the two eyelids and drawing it softly toward the temples in order to leave within the eyelids two black streaks which give to fine eyes a harshness they do not naturally possess and which the turks take for an air of tenderness  what will appear much more extraordinary is that the men themselves and even old men are guilty of this coquetry the use of the surma is almost general it is true they pretend it strengthens the sight but it is more certain that its effect is not very pleasing every thing in this country which can contribute to preserve beauty or supply the want of it is eagerly sought after  the custom of tinging the eyebrows and eyelashes is not so frequent among the common people and seems to belong more peculiarly to opulence and a kind of inactivity necessary for this species of beauty for it is certain that this impalpable powder placed so carefully on the edge of the eyelids would spread itself very disagreeably on any profuse perspiration yet the lower rank of people whose labor impose daily a tax on wealthy idleness have also their peculiar decoration it consists as in most uncultivated nations in covering their arms and legs and sometimes their breasts with figures drawn by punctures and which before they are indented are rubbed over with some color that sinks and is retained the blue color produced by gunpowder is the most common and prejudice furnishes most of the subject matter for this strange ornament the names of jesus and mahomet distinguish the christians and the turks who are fellow laborers and gallantry comes in forks share in the embellishment amorous verses are often to be seen mixed with passages of the koran but the species of gallantry intended is not always so precisely ascertained as that it may not be mistaken  the christians are not more sickle in their manner of decorating their persons than the turks are constant to their peculiar mode of dress they do not so much as know what it is to make any alteration in their fashions that kind of dress which was worn many centuries ago is still in use among them it is grave manly and pleasing to look at and contributes not a little to let off the handsome shape and mien of both sexes  a stranger who arrives at constantinople and sees such a concourse of different people all dressed in the oriental habit must be at a loss to distinguish one from the other there are some distinctions however though their dress to a stranger may appear uniform the greeks wear a kind of turban of black lambs skin narrower on the crown than that of the armenians with black drawers and black slippers the armenians on the contrary wear purple drawers and red slippers the turks wear yellow slippers and sultan mustapha who forbid any christians to wear the same under pain of death ordered likewise that they should wear red slippers but the haughty greeks resolving to be distinguished from the armenians presented a petition to that monarch that they might be allowed to wear black which was granted on consideration of a pretty large sum paid into the emperors private treasury the jews wear drawers and slippers of a sky blue color their turban is entirely different from that of the christians and they have two bunches of hair hanging down by the sides of their ears these people are very fond of appearing what they are lest they should be mistaken for christians but there are some privileged persons both greeks and jews who are allowed to wear yellow slippers and scarlet drawers the same as the turks such as the dragomen or interpreters and the motsellemins those greeks we have already noticed and who are likewise exempted from any annual tribute as the city of constantinople is crowded with inhabitants it is very easy for the greeks and others to disguise themselves in the turkish dress to avoid paying it but if the former are discovered their heads are struck off unless they turn mussulmen but if europeans are found disguised in a turkish habit their effects alone are confiscated unless they will redeem them on the same condition  to show how rigorous they are in enforcing this law the reigning grand signor was walking one day in disguise through the suburbs of fanari attended only by two favorite domestics a black and white eunuch when he met a young man who wore three pelisses one above another and who had likewise a very rich pipe in his mouth and to add to this luxury he had on yellow slippers the sultan imagined he must either be some dragoman or the son of some bey or at least some privileged greek curiosity induced him to order an enquiry to be made and it was found that he was only the son of a greek butcher at fanari upon which be ordered his attendants to put him instantly to death upon the spot such is the strictness with which laws and ordinances are enforced in that empire stern people contend it is the least cruelty never to pardon the infringement of any law which has once been transgressed  but to return to their dress they wear their drawers next to their skin and over the drawers is their shirt next to that the doliman a kind of cassock reaching down to their heels with strait sleeves which they button on the wrist in summer this doliman is made of callico or striped muslin and in winter of satin or some such stuff which is usually quilted they then girt themselves about the waist with a silk scarf or leathern belt which is about three inches broad and fastened by a gold or silver buckle at their belts they generally hang a couple of daggers the handles of which are inlaid with gold and silver and sometimes with precious stones bisani mentions a pacha having one that cost ten thousand guineas over the doliman they wear a ferigee or nightgown which in winter those who are rich enough have lined with valuable furs this ferigee is very much like our loose great coats only longer it reaching to the heels it has also very large and long sleeves and being thrown loosely over the doliman serves instead of a cloak the lower part of the body is not only covered with the drawers and the shirt but the men wear over these a pair of red cloth breeches which come down to their heels like trowsers and at the bottom are fastened to leathern pumps of a yellow color which they call mestes the papouches are of the same color and made very much like our slippers the heel of their papouches is even with the rest of the sole except that it has a semicircle of iron in the form of an horseshoe upon it the mestes correspond with our socks and the papouches with our shoes except that they do not draw up behind their heads are covered with a crimson velvet cap without brims about which they wind a white or red turban made of a scarf of very fine muslin or silk stuff many else long and by the fashion of it the rank and quality of any person is known no one but a turk is allowed to wear a white turban this part of their dress they never take off but when they retire to rest the privilege of wearing a green turban is only granted to those persons who can prove themselves descended from their prophet mahomet these are called scheriffs or emirs which signify nobles and there are great numbers of them because if the daughter of an emir is married to a turk who is not so and has a son he is an emir by his mothers side and enjoys the same privileges as if he was descended from the male line the women who are of this descent are distinguished by a piece of green stuff fastened to their talpock or head dress  the attire of the ladies of constantinople has a singular air of grandeur and magnificence in it far surpassing the dresses of the women of other countries and much more becoming  the first part of the dress is a pair of drawers very full that reach to the shoes and conceal the legs more modestly than petticoats mine says lady m in a description of part of her own turkish dress were of a thin rosecoloured damask brocaded with silver flowers over this hangs a shift of a fine white silk gauze edged with embroidery this shift has wide sleeves hanging half way down the arm and is closed at the neck with a diamond button but the shape and color of the bosom is very well to be distinguished through it the antery is a waistcoat made close to the shape of white and gold damask with very long sleeve sfalling back and fringed with deep gold fringe this generally has a diamond or pearl button the caftan of the same stuff with the drawers is a robe exactly fitted to the shape and reaching to the feet with very long strait falling sleeves over this is the girdle of about four fingers broad which all that can afford it have entirely of diamonds or other precious stones those who will not be at the expense have it of exquisite embroidery on satin but it must be fastened before with a clasp of diamonds the curdee is a loose robe they throw off or put on according to the weather being of a rich brocade mine says lady m is green and gold either lined with ermine or sables the sleeves reach very little below the shoulders the head dress is composed of a cap called a talpock which is in winter of fine velvet embroidered with pearls or diamonds and in summer of a light shining silver stuff this is fixed on one side of the head hanging a little way down with a gold tassel and bound on either with a circle of diamonds as i have seen several or a rich embroidered handkerchief on the other side of the head the hair is laid flat and here the ladies are at liberty to show their fancies some putting flowers others a plume of herons feathers and in short what they please but the most general fashion is a large bouquet of jewels made like natural flowers that is the buds of pearls the roses of different colored rubies the jessamines of diamonds the jonquils of topazes etc so well set and enamelled it is hard to imagine any thing of that kind so beautiful the hair hangs at its full length behind divided into tresses braided with pearl or ribband which is always in great quantity i never saw in my life says lady m so many fine heads of hair in one ladys i have counted a hundred and ten of the tresses all natural but it must be owned that every kind of beauty is more common here than with us  the head dress of the turkish ladies says le brun is so contrived that they can put it on and take it off without undoing it and it will serve them for several days together after which they give it a different fashion according to the several tastes and the fancies of the wearers this head dress is so heavy on account of its largeness that it is a perfect burden to them in summer there are some of the turkish ladies who only wear a fur cap on their heads others again wear a large round platine after the fashion of the jewish women except that it leans on the forehead rises up behind and has on each side a feather fastened to it and large plumes of black feathers hang from the ears which dangle down on their bosoms others again encircle their heads with a cap made up of a great many handkerchiefs of different colors worked in gold and silver to which they fasten all sorts of trinkets composed as lady m has remarked in the shape of nosegays and which are made of wrought gold and set round with precious stones while others wear only natural flowers such as pinks etc  lady craven describes the dress in which the turkish ladies walk about the streets as consisting of a large loose robe of dark green cloth covering them from the neck to the ground over that a large piece of muslin which wraps over the shoulders and the arms and another that goes over the head and eyes such coverings says she confound all shape and air so much as to give them the appearance of walking mummies and men or women princesses or slaves may be equally concealed under them  the dress of one of the sultanas that lady m went to visit apppears to have been so surprizingly rich that the particulars of it we believe will not be uninteresting she wore a vest called dualma which differs from a castan by longer sleeves and folding over at the bottom it was of purple cloth fitted to her shape and thick set on each side down to her feet and likewise round the sleeves with pearls of the very best water of the same size as their buttons commonly are that is about the bigness of a pea and for these buttons there are large loops of diamonds in the form of those gold loops so common on birthday coats this habit was tied at the waist with two large tassels of smaller pearls and embroidered round the arms with diamonds her shift was fastened at the bottom with a great diamond shaped like a lozenge her girdle as broad as the broadest english ribband entirely covered with diamonds round her neck she wore three chains which reached to her knees one of large pearl at the bottom of which hung a fine colored emerald as big as a turkey egg another consisting of two hundred emeralds close joined together of the most lively green perfectly matched every one as large as a halfcrown piece and as thick as three crown pieces and another of small emeralds perfectly round but her earrings eclipsed all the rest they were two diamonds shaped exactly like pears as large as a big hazle nut round her talpock she had four strings of pearls very large the whitest and most perfect in the world at least enough to make four necklaces fastened with two roses consisting of a large ruby for the middle stone and round them twenty drops of clean diamonds to each besides this her head dress was covered with bodkins of emeralds and diamonds she wore large diamond bracelets and had five rings on her fingers except lord camelfords the largest i ever saw in my life it is for jewellers to compute the value of these things but according to the common estimation of jewels her whole dress must have been worth an hundred thousand pounds this i am sure that no european queen has half the quantity and the empress of germanys jewels though very fine would look extremely mean near here is this is the sultana who threw herself at the sultans feet on being ordered by him at his coming to the throne to leave the seraglio and choose herself a husband among the great men of the port and requested him in agonies of sorrow rather to poniard her than treat his brothers widow with that contempt  though the turks are so sumptuous in their dress yet they are not in general so expensive in their diet and if europeans are so absurd as to hurt their constitutions by their luxurious mode of living it is not so with the turks who for the most part are satisfied with a slender bill of fare and carry as it were their kitchen along with them their most usual food which they call pilau is rice boiled up with the broth of a fowl or some other meat this is suffered to boil till all the liquor is evaporated and the rice becomes perfectly dry if they have no meat according to le brun they boil up their rice with butter and water sometimes they put curds into it and add a little saffron in order to color it at other times they put honey into their rice but the most usual method is to season it with a great deal of pepper in order to give it a relish those who can afford it put a fowl in it or a piece of beef or mutton which by this means eats very tender  their table is the ground or else a small table raised about a foot from it round which they all sit crosslegged like so many tailors their tablecloth is a large piece of spanish leather which they call the sofra and instead of a napkin they make use of a long piece of blue linen which goes all round the table when they are seated the usual grace before dinner is bismillah that is in the name of god when they have dined their grace is equally short and similar to the snortest of ours for they only say hamah dilah i e god be praised and immediately wash their hands  if they have any other dish besides their boiled rice which among the common sort of people seldom happens then this is served up last as is the custom at the tables of people of fashion and it is eaten with wooden spoons fowls are served up whole in the pilau and pulled to pieces by one of the company as to beef and mutton whether it is roasted or boiled it is always cut into small pieces before it is served up the turks seldom drink at their meals but when dinner is over a large jug of water is placed on the table of which every one drinks as he likes and then grace is said among people of quality instead of a table they have a kind of large raised dish with a little brim which they call a sime this they put on the sosra and upon this sime those dishes that contain the victuals are placed one after another for the turks never place more than one dish at a time upon the table and when the last dish is taken away the sime is likewise remod and the desert served up of the sofra  they make their bread fresh every day and in order to have it exceedingly light put into it a great quantity of leaven it is generally very coarse and not unlike our seabiscuits in shape and size only a little thicker the common people make it serve for a plate to put their meat on and thus eat both at once  they have a way of roasting their meat which gives it a very delicate taste this is by cutting it into small pieces and putting them upon a thin spit with a slice of onion between each piece for the onions of this country have incomparably a more delicious taste than those that grow in more northern climes the greeks frequently eat them as we do cheese or butter at the conclusion of their meals in all the parts of turkey that i traveled through says le brun i furnished myself with these onions when i could meet with them and found that eating them with a little bread and salt made a very dainty repast this makes me no longer wonder he adds that the egyptians should have laid out such large sums on this vegetable during the building of their pyramids as historians informed us they did  oil is likewise an ingredient which they very frequently use as a sauce to most of their meats without its being in the least offensive for the oil in this country is very clear sweet and pleasant to the palate so that with a little salt it maybe eaten upon bread instead of butter a little juice of lemon or a few drops of vinegar put into some oil and mixed up with a little pepper and salt make an excellent sauce for many kinds of fish and this in time becomes so palatable that a person who is a little used to it can do very well without butter were it ever so good for in short custom is second nature and in general what is agreeable and pleasing in the use of different kinds of food consists only in this those things to which we have been used from our childhood seem natural to us as long as we live and each country has something peculiar to itself which it knows not how to part with merely from the force of habit i have often observed adds le brun who was a dutchman that the greek women in constantinople married to our merchants would never eat any of the cheese and butter sent them from holland though it was generally some of the best of the kind but would prefer eating olives and blanched beans though they were half rotten in the same manner as the italians eat small artichokes with pepper and vinegar the turks likewise roast artichokes upon a gridiron with a little oil pepper and salt put between the leaves which give them a very great relish and take off that flabby taste which they have when boiled a is our manner of dressing them the turks have likewise another method of dressing them and that is by cutting them into quarters and frying them the common people live very much upon raw cucumbers and melons for a great part of the year which they eat without any kind of previous preparation and instead of bread they eat cakes made of meal which they bake upon the hearth and carry along with them when they travel their diet in short like their fashions never alters from one century to another and though no people are more extravagant in their dress there are none more temperate in their food than the turks  the dinner which is served up to the grand signor says le brun is presented by the gentleman sewer in a large dish all at once he sits at table after the turkish fashion and has a rich embroidered napkin put before him to preserve his clothes and another is tied round his arm with which he wipes his hands the dishes and plates are all either china or terrasigillata which is said to be good against poison  there are some who pretend he is served in gold plate but this seems rather improbable as the turks look upon it to be a sin to eat off gold or silver which is the reason they use wooden spoons  when the sultan removes to any of his other palaces he is always served in china and so are the foreign ambassadors when entertained by the grand vizir previous to their public audience  but it is time we should say something of their liquors their most usual drink is water coffee and sherbet their coffee says bisani is made and served up in their coffeehouses in a manner rather different from the custom of other countries water is always kept boiling and if any person calls for coffee some of it is put into a small coffeepot with a certain portion of coffee and boiled up two or three times beating it all the while against the sides of the coffeepot with a small stick or two and instead of letting it settle they pour it out of the coffeepot backwards and forwards a great many times and then bring it without milk or sugar in very small china cups without handles in order to form some judgment of the great consumption of this article of luxury in constantinople there is one particular place where there are no less than  00 persons continually employed in roasting and peeling coffee and it is calculated that in the different coffeehouses there are  000 oques of coffee used every day each oque is    ounces this liquor they hold to be good against the headache and to keep down vapors from rising to the brain it likewise comforts the stomach and helps digestion they even conceit it to be a general panacea and good against all kinds of disorders every person whether rich or poor drinks at least two or three turks dishes every day to infuse any thing in it they imagine makes it less wholesome and takes off from its virtues  the turkish coffeehouses are generally built like their kioshs admitting the air on all sides which makes them exceedingly cool they are the rendezvous of the indolent in every station of life the vizir the captain pacha and the sultan himself frequently go there in disguise to hear what is said of them for the conduct and most minute actions of the people in power are equally the topic of conversation and scrutinized with as much rigor in turkey as in any other countries  their other liquor is sherbet which is their usual drink this is made either of honey and water with the juice of lemon and a little rose water to give it an agreeable perfume or else of lemon water and sugar this liquor is very pleasant and a person may make a kind of paste or cake from the different ingredients to take with him on his journey which requires only a little fresh water poured upon it to make a very agreeable and refreshing liquor  the most important and respectful of the ceremonies in waiting upon a turkish nobleman is the presenting of sherbet which is always followed by an aspersion of rose water and perfumes of aloes this sherbet says baron tott so much talked of in europe and so little known is made of conserved fruits dissolved in water but with so much musk as almost to destroy the taste of the liquor thus the vase once filled suffices for the visits of the week i used it very sparingly says he as i likewise did the conserves brought with the coffee and in the serving of which they never change the spoon the same ceremony was repeated in the antichamber in favor of my lacquey who was far from practicing my abstemiousness on this occasion his appetite less delicate refused nothing he ate whatever they gave him ginger comfits and conserves and swallowed at a single draft all the sherbet  this sobriety of the turks does not suit the genius of the northern nations who love plenty of wine and strong liquors as well as good eating a sack of rice every year with a few jars of butter and some dried fruits are sufficient provision for a very numerous family and it is to this temperance chiefly that the people of the east are indebted for their healthy and robust constitution  the turks are likewise passionately fond of sweetmeats and all kind of perfumes which they have in much greater perfection than in the southern parts of france and italy  we shall conclude this account of their mode of living as to their diet with lady ms dinner at the widowed sultanas whose profusion of jewels we have already noticed she gave me a dinner says lady m of fifty dishes of meat which after their fashion were served up one after the other and was extremely tedious but the magnificence of her table was correspondent to her dress the knives were of gold and the hafts set with diamonds but the piece of luxury which grieved my eyes was the tablecloth and napkins these were all tiffany embroidered with gold in the finest manner in natural flowers it was with the utmost regret i made use of these costly napkins which were as finely wrought as the finest handkerchiefs that ever came out of this country it is needless to mention they were entirely spoiled before dinner was over the sherbet which is the liquor they drink at meals was served in china bowls but the covers and salvers were massive gold after dinner water was brought in gold basins and towels of the same kind with the napkins which i very unwillingly wiped my hands upon and coffee was served in china with gold soucoups or saucers  the first week she adds their cookery pleased me extremely but after that i began to grow weary of their table but i attribute this to custom and am very much inclined to believe that an indian who had never tasted of either would prefer their cookery to ours their sauces are very high all the roasts very much done they use a great deal of very rich spice the soup is served for the last dish and they have at least as great a variety of ragouts as we have the entertainment always concludes with coffee and perfumes at the tables of the sultanas and after this ceremony they command their slaves to dance and play on their guitars  the luxury of the bashaws and great men of the port in regard to the furniture of their houses is excessive baron totts description of the chamber in which he and his lady slept at a country villa belonging to one of the grand signors dragomen where he went for a few days on a visit will serve to give some faint idea of the general magnificence of the apartments of their great men added to what we have already extracted from lady m respecting the palaces of the sultanas in adrianople the time for taking our repose was now come and we were conducted says he into another large room in the middle of which was a kind of bed without bedstead or curtains though the coverlid and pillows exceeded in magnificence the richness of the sopha which likewise ornamented the apartment fifteen mattresses of quilted cotton about three inches thick placed one upon another formed the groundwork and were covered by a sheet of indian linen sewed on the last mattress a coverlet of green satin adorned with gold embroidery in embossed work was in like manner fastened to the sheet the ends of which turned in were sewed down alternately two large pillows of crimson satin overlaid with the like embroidery in which there was no want of gold or spangles rested on two cushions of the sopha brought near to serve for a back and intended to support our heads a small octagonal tower inlaid with ebony and mother of pearl stood by the side of the bed and served for a table upon it was placed a large silver candlestick which held a yellow wax candle two inches thick and three feet high the wick of which nearly as thick as ones finger produced a very disagreeable smoke three china salvers filled with conserves of roses flowers of orange and lemon peel with a little golden spatula the handle of tortoiseshell to serve for a spoon and crystal vessel full of water surrounded this obscure luminary which was intended to burn all night a precaution not to be neglected in a country where there is so much reason to fear the ravages of fire such were our accommodations at the dragomans and i could not but expect to pass a very indifferent night the taking of the pillows entirely away would not have been a bad resource if we had had any bolster and the expedient of turning the other side upwards only served to show they were embroidered on both sides we at last determined to lay our handkerchiefs over them but this did not prevent our being sensible of the embossed ornaments underneath it will readily be supposed we were no sluggards and indeed it was with no small satisfaction we saw the morning appear resolving to procure more commodious pillows the night following  in their customs adds the baron they seem as fond of imitating us the french as the french are of imitating the english i have seen a greek lady at constantinople take olives up with her fingers at dinner and afterward put them on a fork to eat them after the french fashion if the drinking of healths be no longer the mode with the french it is not the less agreeable to find this ancient practice still remaining in other countries our greeks did not omit this ceremony and the men even performed it standing with their heads uncovered and what may appear less refined the same tumbler of wine served the whole circle of guests after dinner in which there was more profusion than elegance the company seated themselves upon a sopha in the same room in which it had been served up pipes succeeded coffee they began a conversation on the fashions which concluded in scandal and in this too i found their imitation of french manners very perfect in the mean time the young girls amused themselves with a swing hung at the other end of the room which some slaves put in motion the women likewise expressed a desire of partaking in this amusement and were placed in the machine and their places when vacant were supplied by our gentlemen with long beards the games of backgammon chess and panguelo a kind of berlan concluded the diversions of the day  this greek as well as all those who are sufficiently opulent to imitate the turks was accustomed to sleep after dinner on his sopha while a woman by driving away the flies with a great fan made of feathers rendered the air he breathed cool and refreshing other slaves on their knees at his feet rubbed them gently with their hands this asiatic luxury would no doubt permit suspicion to go greater lengths with respect to these particulars and his ill usage of the slaves for the most trifling offenses should convince us that where the facility of gratifying our desires is unbounded all sense of delicacy and feeling is lost  the turks have seldom any chimnies in their houses but they have something far better and more agreeable to warm themselves by in winter this is a chafing dish placed under a table covered with a large quilted counterpane those who are desirous of warming themselves put this counterpane upon their knees and by that means a very agreeable warmth is communicated to all parts of the body in the houses of the turkish nobles a small covering of silk or satin brocaded in gold or silver is thrown over the large one worked by some of the ladies of the family  the middle rank of people among the turks have no other chamber to sleep in than that which serves them to live in during the day a slave comes about the time that the family usually retires to rest and spreads a mattress for each person over which he puts a quilt for a covering and a pillow to rest the head upon the turks do not undress themselves as we do but sleep in their drawers and waistcoats in the morning the slave comes again rolls up the mattresses and quilts in a bundle and carries them to the closet from whence he took them  the usual mode of salutation among the turks is a little inclination of the head without taking off the turban and laying the right hand to the breast their usual expression on this occasion is peace be with you to which the reply is nearly similar peace be with you and the mercy of god it appears from scripture this was the ancient manner of salutation and is a very grave one when it is a person of distinction whom they salute they bow so low as to take up the hem of his garment and kiss it  among other things in which the turks differ from us is the place of honor they look upon the left hand to be more honorable than the right because it is the side on which the sword is worn and consequently a person has the command of his arms who walks on the right hand no europeans however as we have observed before wear swords in turkey nor do even the janissaries themselves ever wear their sabres except they are going on actual service another particular in which the turks differ very much from the christians is the shaving of their heads and letting their beards and whiskers grow to a great length and the larger and longer they are the more a man is esteemed they even swear by their beard and look upon it as a great affront to touch any persons beard though it should be in saluting him which is a common custom among them as strange as we may think it to see them with their long beards they think it equally so to see us with our long tails and perukes they have a saying that the devil nestles in a large head of hair and it is for this reason says le brun that they leave on their heads only a small tuft of hair  the turks likewise make great use of hot baths both for the sake of their health and for cleanliness there is scarce a village in turkey which has not its hot bath the frequent use of them says tott opens the pores to such a degree as to render them visible it is equally certain that so violent a dilatation of the fibers by altering the shape brings on decrepitude before old age lady m in her description of the natural hot baths at sophia near adrianople says they are built of stone in the shape of a dome with no windows but in the roof which give light enough there were five of these domes joining together the outermost being less than the rest and serving only as a hall where the portress stood at the door ladies of quality generally give this woman a crown or ten shillings the next room is a very large one paved with marble and all round it are two raised sophas of marble one above another there were four fountains of cold water in this room falling first into marble basins and then running on the floor in little channels made for that purpose which carried the streams into the next room something less than this with the same sort of marble sophas but so hot with steams of sulphur proceeding from the baths joining to it twas impossible to stay there with ones clothes on the two other domes were the hot baths one of which had cocks of cold water turning into it to temper it to what degree of warmth the bathers pleased to have i was in my traveling habit a riding dress and it must certainly appear very extraordinary to them yet there was not one of them showed the least surprise or impertinent curiosity but received me with all the obliging civility possible i know no european court where the ladies would have behaved themselves in so polite a manner to such a stranger i believe upon the whole there were two hundred women and yet none of those disdainful smiles and satirical whispers that never fail in our assemblies when any body appears that is not dressed exactly in the fashion they repeated over and over to me uzelle pek uzelle turkish ladies bathing which is nothing but charming very charming  the first sophas were covered with cushions and rich carpets on which sat the ladies and on the second their slaves behind them but without any distinction of rank by their dress all being in the state of nature that is in plain english stark naked without any beauty or defect concealed yet there was not the least wanton smile or immodest gesture among them they walked and moved with the same majestic grace with which milton describes our general mother to have walked there were many amongst them as finely proportioned as any goddess ever was drawn by guido or by titian  most of their skins delicately white glossed with the water and decorated by their beautiful hair divided into many tresses hanging on their shoulders and braided either with pearl or ribbon perfectly representing the figure of the graces  i was here convinced of the truth of a reflection i have often made  that if it were the fashion to go naked the face would be hardly observed i perceived that the ladies of the most delicate skins and finest shapes had the greatest share of my admiration though their faces were sometimes less beautiful than those of their companions to tell you the truth i had wickedness enough to wish secretly that mr  the painter could have been there invisible it would have very much improved his art to see so many fine women naked in different postures some in conversation some working others drinking coffee or sherbet and many lying negligently on their cushions while their slaves generally young girls of seventeen or eighteen were employed in braiding their hair in several pretty fancies in short it is the womans coffeehouse where the news of the town is told and scandal invented they generally take this diversion once aweek and stay there at least four or five hours  all the men who go into these baths either shave themselves clean from hair or extirpate it by a preparation and go into the water naked except a napkin round their waist after they have been some time in them one of the slaves comes and stretches their legs and arms bending them backwards and forwards several times to make the joints supple he then carries him to another place where are several cocks of hot water with which he washes him all over with soap and water and then rubs him thoroughly dry with a camblet bag or some such coarse stuff these bags are square and serve to cleanse the body from all manner of filth they answer the purpose of flesh brushes used by the ancients which were of metal and every person is at liberty to bring his own rubbing cloth but the turks who are not very scrupulous in drinking after one another out of the same glass and eating off the same plate or even in wearing the clothes of one who died of the plague make no scruple of being rubbed with the same cloth which another has used provided it be only rinced once or twice  the obligation which their religion imposes on them to bathe frequently has occasioned all their nobles and great men to build baths in their own houses and they are so expert in the management of them that the same fire not only heats their baths but serves also to dress their victuals  the mahometans are so extremely particular in their ablutions that left any accidental dirt upon their bodies should pollute them they not only wash themselves thoroughly in the ordinary bath but cleanse every part of their bodies thoroughly  even waste paper is held in great veneration among the mahometans they never putting it to any sordid use nor even do they tread on it lest any part of it should contain those letters with which the name of god is written if they find a piece in the street they take it up kiss it and even put it very respectfully in some hole of a wall this respect that they have for paper proceeds from the veneration they have for the alcoran which when they carry about them they never suffer to descend lower than their girdle  the cleanliness so strongly recommended by the laws of their holy religion has made them erect necessary houses in different parts of the city and especicially round about the mosques which in their language they call dophano or places of shame these houses are kept very neat and clean with either a fountain of clear water running through them or water let into them with a cock and basin  was this custom adopted in the great cities of our christian monarchs it would tend very much to their ornament as well as to their cleanliness  chap viii of their character customs manners and amusement the morality of the turks consists principally in works of charity they extend their practice of this vrtue so far as to build as we have already observed public nns for the convenience of travelers bridges to pass rivers and aqueducts and reservoirs to provide water for public use they likewise erect public schools and sitals for the sick and poor persons of rank  sh to immortalize their names build a mosque at their own expense but their chaty in some  ate and superstitious for  for feeding dogs and  or any beast of burden to the extreme of what they can carry that part of their morals most worthy of imitation is their extreme resignation to the will of god they have no word in the turkish languish to express blasphemy such is their veneration for the deity and they never speak of undertaking any thing without saying if it please god  usury is looked upon as a great sin and never practiced they are guilty however of great extortion upon the franks but then it is generally through the instigation of the jews and christians who envy one another and seek each others ruin  they are ever loyal to their prince whom they highly reverence and to whom they pay implicit obedience are never known to betray him but ready to die for him whenever he commands it and never quarrel or fight among themselves owing to that wise precept of mahomet commanding the turks to abstain from the use of wine  the turks never engrave any thing upon their seals but the name and age of the person who is to wear them their religion forbidding them either to engrave any figure or even to keep any by them the form of their cornelians is different from ours they generally wear the rings on their fingers cut in the shape of a square  if there are many simple and absurd customs and opinions among the turks there exists likewise much generosity and magnificence in their conduct when in an opulent situation no minister of the port has an interview with a foreign ambassador or stranger of any rank without making him some presents which they return according to their opulence or inclination to be noble  the manner of living of a turk sufficiently wealthy to have nothing to do is to go out every day and take his seat in the shop of a dealer of tobacco there under the pretense of trying the different sorts he smoaks several pipes without paying any thing and besides enjoys the prospect of the passengers who on their part admire the indolent gravity of the turk and the respectful demeanor of two or three servants who stand by his side with their hands crossed before them in this position the first liverseller who passes stops and brags of his ability to bring together all the cats in the neighborhood cracks a sew jokes to divert his excellency and obtains permission to begin his operations the passengers gather round by some art of his the cats assemble in a twinkling at the watchword the shoulders of the dealer are covered with them they hang about his clothes and he makes haste to feast his friends for their alacrity the important personage for whose diversion the scene is intended pays the performance and the european who does not understand the language or understands it but ill and does not live among the turks to study their genius and manners believes he has seen an act of charity publishes it as such and only propagates an error says tott who seems to view every action of the turks with an evil eye  as a proof of their excessive indolence lady c mentions having seen a turk lying on cushions striking slowly an iron which he was shaping into a horseshoe his pipe in his mouth all the time nay what is more among the higher order of the turks there is an invention which saves them the trouble of holding the pipe two small wheels are fixed on each side the bowl of the pipe and thus the smoaker has only to puff away or let the pipe rest upon his under lip while he moves his hand as he pleases perhaps it is fortunate for europe that the turks are idle and ignorant the immense power this empire might have were it peopled by the industrious and the ambitious would make it the mistress of the world at present it only serves as a dead wall to intercept the commerce and battles which other powers might create with one another  the quiet and passive turk will sit a whole day by the side of a canal looking at kites flying or childrens boats i saw one says lady c who was enjoying the shade of an immense plantane tree his eyes fixed on a kind of bottle diverted by the noise and motion of it while the stream kept it in motion how the business of the nation under such indolence can go on seems extraordinary the cabinet is composed generally of ignorant mercenaries the vizir was only a watercarrier to the highadmiral the high admiral himself only a servant in algiers  this was in the year      places are obtained at the port by intrigue each placeman each sultaness has her creatures to provide for and their plots to promote them versailles has not more intricate intrigue than the port is it to be then wondered at that the turk is a predestinarian in most things since it is neither birth nor abilities that give him place or power nor is there generally any visible or just reason why heads are struck off  the populace at constantinople are more insolent than in other countries so much so that it is by no means safe for a stranger to walk the streets unaccompanied by a janissary a greek lady says bisani returning home through a great crowd of turks that were assembled together on some occasion one of them said in the hearing of her interpreter oh how i should like to blow out the brains of that infidel at another time a turk having met a poor greek as he was walking out stopped him and said this day i promised to offer up to god and his prophet mahomet the head of an insidel and immediately shot him dead he kept out of the way for a few days but having in the mean time obtained his pardon from the relations of the deceased by means of a sum of money appeared again with more insolence than ever when we were at the dardanelles adds this author one of my friends walking by himself on the seashore was knocked down by a party of turks without the least provocation merely as they said for the sake of buffetting a christian such is the character of the common people who always carry their zeal for religion to great lengths  the fury of the turks however rarely breaks out in hasty violence they never fight duels but they assassinate and it is in this manner all their quarrels terminate for they seldom if ever come to an accommodation the offended party publicly sharpens his knife or prepares his firearms some friends endeavor to appease others to excite and encourage him to the murder but no means are taken to prevent the crime threatened by these preparations its commission however must be preceded by intoxication wine inspires the turk with the courage necessary for the gratification of his revenge having worked himself up to the proper pitch he sallies forth from the tavern and from that time the offender has no hopes of safety but from the unskilfulness of his antagonist if the murder be effected and the guards who never have any other arms but staves pursue the assassin he will then give proofs of real courage and defend himself like a lion guilt seems to have ennobled him and if he be overpowered the threats of his comrades terrify the relations of the deceased into an accommodation which leaves the criminal in full enjoyment of the high esteem he has acquired by this heroic action this is no exaggeration such a one has killed this or that man is never said but by way of panegyric he who has killed ten is the hero of his quarter there is no merrymaking without him his friendship is esteemed a safeguard  it is therefore only some hired assassins among the turks some christians or jews who furnish examples of public punishment as an atonement for the crimes they have committed in this case the culprit is brought to the port and there receives his sentence the execution of which is attended with no solemn parade they may even be seen sometimes pushing through the crowd and talking all the way with him who is to execute them the criminals only have their hands tied and the hangman holds them by their girdle then is the time to negociate with the friends of the deceased and to endeavor to bring about the accommodation there have been bargains of this kind broken off merely through the avarice of the person condemned such assertions seem beyond the bounds of probability but if they be true it is doubtless because under despotic governments riches are of much importance life of but little  nothing is wanting to complete the barbarity of the turks says baron tott but to imitate the late custom of the french in extending the punishment of a crime so as to load with infamy those innocent persons who have the misfortune of being related to the criminal but they on the contrary engrave on his tombstone the name of the deceased and the punishment he suffered i have known continued he a european very ill received by a grecian lady of consequence whose husband had been hanged for some intrigue at court because he thought proper to lament her misfortune and dwelt particularly on the kind of death the deceased had suffered what kind of death would you wish him to have died cried the lady in a rage know sir that no person of my family ever died like a baccal a baccal is a retail grocer they commonly die in their beds it is this low station of life which is usually opposed by the turks to the most distinguished the european was thunderstruck and left her wishing each of her relations a like reputable end  murder is never pursued by the kingsofficers as with us it is the business of the next relations to revenge the dead person and if they like better to compound the matter for money as they generally do there is no more said about it it is natural to suppose that this desect in their government should make such tragedies very frequent on the contrary they are extremely rare and proves that the people are not cruel by nature i do not think says lady m they deserve in general the barbarous character we give them i am well acquainted with a christian woman of quality who made it her choice to live with a turkish husband she was a spaniard and at naples with her family coming from thence in a felucca accompanied by her brother she was attacked by the turkish admiral boarded and taken the same accident happened to her that happened to the fair lucretia so many years before her but she was too good a christian to kill herself as the heathenish roman did the admiral was so much charmed with the beauty and long suffering of the fair captive that as his first compliment he gave immediately liberty to her brother and attendants who made haste to spain and in a few months sent the sum of four thousand pounds as a ransom for his sister the turk took the money which he presented to her and told her she was at her liberty but the lady very discreetly weighed the different treatment she was likely to find in her native country her relations as the kindest thing they could do for her in her present circumstances would certainly confine her to a nunnery for the rest of her days her infidel lover was very handsome very tender very fond of her and lavished at her feet all the turkish magnificence she answered him very resolutely that her liberty was not so precious to her as her honor and as he could no way restore that but by marrying her she requested him to accept the ransom as her portion and let her have the satisfaction of knowing that no man could boast of her favors without being her husband the admiral transported at this liberal proposal sent back the money to her relations saying he was too happy in her possession to need a reward to keep her he consequently married her took no other wife and the lady as she herself declared never had the least reason to repent the choice she had made it may be said that she fell in love with her ravisher it is however more candid to presume that she acted wholly on motives of honor though she might naturally be struck with his generosity  a principle found among the turks of rank  it is a degree of generosity to tell the truth and it is very rare that any turk will assert a solemn falsehood i dont speak of the lower sort for as there is a great deal of ignorance so there is very little virtue among them and false witnesses are much cheaper than in christian countries such wretches not being punished even when they are publicly detected with the rigor they deserved  in order to avoid the effects of debauchery among the common people the taverns are shut up on their solemn festivals the seal of police is affixed to the door of every tavern but a little wicket is contrived underneath which affords an entrance and requires only a little stooping to evade the law and get drunk unmolested  the three days of the bayram occasion some solicitude on the part of government to prevent the disorders which may arise from intoxication the ramazan which precedes the holidays is the lunar month appointed for a fast and the time when it happens annually advances eleven days the time of abstinence which mahomet has copied from the lent of christians consists among the turks as that did in the primitive church in taking no nourishment while the sun is above the horizon it is therefore easy to perceive that the ramazans which fall near the winter solstice are much less difficult to observe than those which happen in the midst of summer from the excessive heat and length of the days which accompany this season of fasting but the class of laboring people seems alone to bear all the rigor of the ramazan deprived during the day of a glass of water to quench their thirst or even refresh their lips the setting of the sun only brings them a frugal repast and short repose to be shortly interrupted by the hour of prayer and quick return of day  this fast wears a quite different appearance among persons of fortune it is only luxury sleeping in the arms of hypocrisy and awaking merely to give itself up to good cheer music and whatever can recompense sensuality for the uneasiness of abstinence  obliged to wait the time prescribed by law and anxious to see it arrive a turk during the ramazan is perpetually counting the hours and minutes surrounded by all the clocks and watches he possesses it is then that geneva receives the greater part of that tribute which its industry imposes on the turks but the most regular watch is not sufficient to determine the moment of the ending of the fast it is announced by the criers of the mosques placed in the galleries the minarets who observe there the disappearance of the sun and he of sancta sophia gives the first signal at that instant the impatience of the turks knows no bounds and they instantly seize on their pipes this being the first of their wants  yet if the turks wait till the sun disappears before they allow themselves any nourishment they take no less care to ascertain the commencement of their new moon when the ramazan begins they have in general but little confidence in astronomical calculations except as the commencement of a festival it is also remarked that the moon dedicated to abstinence has commonly but twentyeight days and the persons appointed to observe this planet always perceive a little of the latest the first ray of light of the ramazan moon but to make amends are far less scrupulous in announcing the appearance of that which begins the bayram and is ushered in by a discharge of artillery from all the different batteries  the season of the bayram is also a season of luxury every individual procures gives or receives new dresses it is likewise the time for parties of pleasure of all kinds which usually produce disorders and oppression on the part of the turks who new clothed and well armed are spread in every village for three or four leagues round constantinople and think they may commit every extravagance with impunity and exact what they please from the unfortunate greeks  there are no theaters no masquerades nor any public amusements at constantinople except the donalma or rejoicings on the birth of the grand signors children fourteen days festivity are allowed when the first child is born whether prince or princess and seven for the rest all the bezars khans and other public buildings are illuminated not excepting the mosques upon whose turrets lamps are placed and kept burning all night the streets are likewise illuminated and the shops kept open to display every rare and splendid commodity not for sale but for ornament no trade being suffered during these public rejoicings the common people are every where in perpetual motion running up and down the streets and entering the houses of persons of rank who sit upon sophas in an outer apartment finely illuminated to receive all kinds of visitors who may freely seat themselves on the sophas of the first officers of state even upon that on which the grand vizir himself is seated who is obliged to offer refreshments at his own expense to all comers in honor of the emperor who may possibly be one of his guests in disguise this circumstance and their knowing if he is not present that he is well informed of every thing that passes makes the turkish nobility and particularly the great officers of state exert their utmost efforts to display the greatest magnificence and hospitality possible on such an occasion for their fortune often depends on the expense they put themselves to in honor of this festival some of them having been promoted on account of their liberality and others turned out of their office and disgraced for their penuriousness  an infinite number of little troops of dancers and singers distribute themselves in all parts of the city and are well paid for contributing to the public joy no person can be taken up for any crime during the donalma and prisoners are set at liberty provided they can find security for returning to their prisons when the rejoicings are over in a word it is a perfect carnival and more splendid than that of venice but the persons who distinguish themselves most on these occasions are the foreign ministers who do it at the expense of their sovereigns and at the same time gain the good will of the grand signor prince repnin ambassador from russia was too great a politician to be sparing of expense during the donalma that happened in his time on the contrary says habesci he far surpassed all his brethren the illuminations at his hotel were so magnificent and costly that they attracted the admiration of all ranks of people the grand signor himself went twice to see them and entering the hotel with other strangers passed through the apartments so well disguised as not to be known  we see practiced again says baron tott at these rejoicings the manners of ancient rome during their saturnalia slaves enjoy a respite from their labors and are permitted to be merry in the presence of their masters and even at their expense new actors come forward on the stage and present the great with a view of their follies while they now on a level with the rabble are obliged to join in the laugh  end of volume xi note the directions given at the
