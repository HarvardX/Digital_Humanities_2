lately rescued from an usurped and foreign control but the perfection of their further claims by removing that corruption which has contaminated every department of the state which has tainted even

religion the law of the land should be the principal study with a free people a knowledge of the one being as essential to their temporal interests as a knowledge of the other is to their eternal happiness wilful ignorance will neither excuse the soul before the tribunal of the creator nor the person before the judgment seat of the constitution to diffuse legal information is the purpose of this essay it is not written to acquire fame  it is written to meet the approbation of the understanding not to amuse the fancy and you will attend to it from respect to the subject on which it treats  it is not in ornaments that the merit of an argument consists in viewing a portrait the figure and features are the principal objects of contemplation nor can the most elegant drapery or beautiful coloring please the minds eye where the artist deviates from nature and truth the intent will excuse in your minds the blemishes of the performance the opinions if not expressed are conceived in the ardor of patriotism in disinterested love for a community where the writer received that life which he thinks can only be well spent in its service  the writer should consider himself pusillanimous and contemptible indeed if in the present contest between the friends of his country and the purchased dependants of the british minister he withheld the little contribution of knowledge that his studies have afforded him this is an era where every honest hand every honest heart and every honest head should unite their exertions and with a long pull a strong pull and a pull all together level to the earth that rotten fabric where despotism holds private counsel with corruption for the treacherous purpose of sapping and overturning the noblest constitution that wisdom ever framed or freedom ever defended  the authority delegated by the people to their representatives in parliament has now reverted to its original possessors this then is the time they should be informed how that trust has been executed that they may know who has deserved their approbation who has merited their censure and resentment  measures militating with the liberty of the subject have been carried into effect by venal majorities every proposition brought forward to diminish undue influence to establish oecomy to secure the revenue to vindicate the law and to ease the people have been negatived by the same correct power oppression has experienced impunity the injured have been denied redress and the authority of law and sound reason has been trampled upon by the aggregate force of numbers this then is the time when constitutional knowledge should be deseminated through the land when the principles of legislation and law should be made known to the people at large  this is the time when men who regard the interests of their country who are not equally insensible to the value of their own honor and the good of posterity following the glorious example of your association should with all their powers promote the spirit of liberty till every heart pervaded by that divine essence which expands the understanding and elates the mind even of the meanest peasant vibrates with ardour and pants to spring forth the guardian of those principles which emanate from the bosom of god  the protector of those laws which are derived from the immutable decrees of the eternal code laid down by providence and delivered to man at the creation  the moment has scarcely passed since the people of ireland demanded and acquired the restitution of their rights with arms in their hands  they have laid down their arms and their rights are again invaded where then are they to find protection they can only insure it by a strict and firm adherence to those resolutions which you have formed for their political creed let the people zealously support the doctrines you have promulged let them not tamely sit down satisfied with the melancholy privilege of complaint let them prove by their spirit in the face of heaven and of the world that by whatever right englishmen possess freedom by the same right irishmen and all mankind may claim it  the greatest and most distinguishing property of mankind is the immortality of his soul and we find the strongest evidence of that immortality in the freedom of his mind which includes the right of declaring all our thoughts in this free will derived from god originated the liberty of the press that sacred medium through which every freeman who possesses the blessing has a right to declare his opinions on public men and on public measures every unnecessary restraint of the press being then a restraint of the free will of man is an act of tyranny by suppressing the exercise of intellectual liberty slavery has been established  by giving it fair scope freedom has been restored the histories of nations are illustrations of this position and recent proofs are to be found in the fears of spain and portugal  in the spirit of america and france  in the revolutions of great baitain and ireland  then let the press exert her powers notwithstanding the restraints lately laid on her natural vigor she still retains sufficient strength to drag before the people those pusillanimous corrupt and abdicating culprits who deserting from the standard of freedom have enlisted with prostituted mercenaries and war against common sense and the law of the land  the press still retains sufficient ability to hunt from their lurking places and scourge into shame and repentance those adulating and degenerate monsters who point out to every alien plunderer the secret springs the honey and the treasures of the land who have entered into conspiracies with strangers against its legal owners and who have stripped the laborious peasant and the industrious manufacturer of their fruits and earnings  this is the moment to bring about political reformation for extirpating venality  and the press is the most effectual means was the constitution subverted and tyranny seated on her throne surrounded by her sycophants her parasites her informers her guards her assassins and her executioners a free press would restore the one and overturn the other  the essay it may be objected that this essay is illtimed as tending to influence the determination of suits now pending but the objection is erroneous the questions are not of law but of fact the determinations lie with juries not with judges the inquiries on the trials will be merely whether the defendant be guilty or not guilty of the injury laid in the declaration and if guilty what damages the plaintiffs have sustained the arguing points of law is at all times legal and the points herein discussed are in every respect irrelevant to the merits of the issues which the juries are to try any man as amicus curiae may inform a judge on a point of law but no man shall give information to a jury on a fact unless he be a witness previously sworn earl mansfield some years ago prohibited the publication of evidence given against prisoners on examinations before jusstices of the peace because the evidence being exparte the publishing of it tended to create an influence against the prisoner which might be injurious to him on trial but no judge ever yet asserted that animadverting on matters of law was illegal and yet in the case of general warrants the press teemed with legal disquisitions  the causes for promulging the law of the land on the discretion of judges in granting fiats and on bail having originated in the suits carried on against magee the printer it will be frequently necessary to advert to them in doing this however it is not intended to stigmatize with invective or severe imputations the prosecutors or plaintiffs the law gives a remedy for every injury and if they suffered or imagined they suffered wrong they had an unquestionable right to seek redress from the laws of their country  magee considered as a private individual is equally an object of indifference this essay neither takes into consideration his guilt nor his innocence that is the province of a jury but the proceedings against him are of the most serious concern to the people every individual of whom are entitled to inquire whether his own rights and liberties have been attacked in the person of his fellow citizen under the sanction of a process issuing from a court of law which by its institution is the guardian and protector of those rights and liberties  the honor of the laws of ireland its judges and its professors is also materially involved in the ultimate decision upon these proceedings the english bar have treated them with contempt and reprobation it is at this day a common observation in westminster hall that ireland will soon repent the loss of writs of error and appeal to the courts of england must not the pride and sensibility of irishmen suffer to the quick from the fallacious slander thus indiscriminately thrown upon all the judges and all the barristers of this kingdom and must not these sufferings be aggravated in the minds of those who know that unsullied purity extensive knowledge and great ability have ever been found at the irish bar that the bench is radiated by sacred worth spirit and independence that the law is promulged by judges of inflexible integrity united with intelligent minds fortified by invincible virtue and dispising with equal contempt those accommodating fears which sometimes give temporary popularity and those mean pliabilities which bow and cringe with implicit obedience to the influence of every administration  under the torture of those sufferings the writer of this essay with sedulous attention searched the records and repositories of the law for precedent or principle upon which he could justify excuse or even palliate those proceedings thus reprobated in england  what was the consequence  he found that the opinions of the english lawyers so far as they respected arrests by fiat in cases of libels were well grounded and to his great satisfaction he is now convinced that the irish bar and every independent member of the irish house of commons maintain the same doctrine and have thereby vindicated the jurisprudence of their country and the ancient practice of their courts from wanton and rash aspersions  these extraordinary proceedings thus universally condemned of course appeared to him as rash and alarming innovations on the indubitable rights of the people they appeared to him as grievances springing from latent motives and tending either to oppress private individuals or to establish precedents for the purpose of coercing the liberty of the press an object that has been repeatedly attempted and too often with success since mr pit has been placed at the head of the british administration though no minister was ever supported by a more licentious abuse of his opponents  the case of magee is this  he has been arrested on fiats or judges warrants and held to special bail in several actions brought against him for publishing libels on private individuals and he has been held to bail in the following sums  four thousand pounds  eight hundred pounds  one thousand pounds  and two thousand pounds making in the whole the sum of seven thousand eight hundred pounds  now as each bondsman must swear himself when justifying his bail worth double the sum for which he becomes bound the bail demanded amounts to thirtyone thousand two hundred pounds and this unfortunate defendant is a private subject  the printer of a newspaper  two questions result from this case  first  were the arrests legal  second  if the arrests were legal  was the special bail demanded of the defendant legal  in answer to these questions it has been asserted   that the right of granting a fiat is within the discretionary power of the judge and  that the quantum of bail demanded is within the same discretionary power  it is therefore the purport of this essay to show that the charges exhibited against the defendant being for libels and the objects of the imputed calumnies private individuals the interference of a judge by fiat in such cases is unprecedented the special bail demanded of the defendant excessive that neither of those acts of the judge are within the rules of legal discretion and that they are both contrary to the law of the land  the granting of fiats in any case being discretionary the first point to be discussed is the nature and legal extent of that power  lord coke defines discretion thus  it is says that learned jurist to discern between right and wrong shadows and substance equity and colorable glosses and not to do according to our will and private affections and such discretion is to be limited and bounded    inst    therefore whoever has power to act at discretion is bound by the rule of reason and law   inst     for justices must remember that it is legal discretion in which in favor of liberty great tenderness is to be used  and though there be a latitude of discretion given to one hob     yet he is circumscribed that what he does be necessary and convenient without which no liberty no claim to jurisdiction can defend it  for these reasons when the law leaves any thing to any person to be done according to his discretion   lit ab     the law intends it must be done with sound discretion and according to law and the court of kings bench has a power to redress things that are otherwise done notwithstanding that they are left to the discretion of those who do them  the superintending power which the constitution thus reposes in the court of kings bench does not however authorize the judges of that court to exercise an uncontrolled discretion over the personal liberty of the subject the restrictive rules of legal discretion are as binding on the chief justice and his brethren whether acting collectively or individually as on any subordinate magistrate they are as strictly binding on judges in courts of law as principles and precedents are binding on the chancellor or the barons of the exchequer in the courts of equity  if discretion was not thus circumscribed the subject says lord coke   inst would feel it a crooked line ruinous to the personal liberties of the people   black     whose liberties or rights have never been abridged by the laws of england mont s without sufficient cause l b    c   and can not ever be abridged at the mere discretion of the magistrate without explicit permission from the laws    black   the reason of this doctrine is obvious civil liberty which is the very end and scope of the english constitution rightly understood consists in the power of doing whatever the laws permit which is only to be effected by a general conformity of all orders and degrees to those equitable rules of action inst       by which the meanest individual is protected from the insults and oppression of the greatest if this was not the case there would be no liberty for as smith in his commonwealth of england observes speaking of a court of equity there is as much difference between the consciences of men or their discretion as between the measure of their feet and as one man may have a longer or shorter foot than another man so may his conscience or discretion be more contracted or extensive  if the personal liberty of the subject was not thus protected by the law if the highest magistrate the king himself was not thus restricted in the exercise of discretion weak or corrupt judges influenced by caprice by resentment by party prejudice or by obstinate ignorance might under pretense of legal authority exercise an arbitrary power the fiat or warrant would attack the person of the destined victim  the demand of enormous bail would send him to prison where his sufferings being unknown to the public or if known being soon forgotten inevitable ruin to himself and family would be the consequence imprisonment is the least public the least striking species of punishment arbitrary power of inflicting it is the most dangerous engine that could be put into the hands of a man inclined to injure the rights of the people therefore the common law has wisely provided against it by the writ of habeas corpus which by a declaratory enacting and penal statute has been made one of the great bulwarks of the peoples liberties  happy is it for the subjects of the british and irish crowns that judicial discretion is thus circumscribed within the bounds of reason and controled by the rules of law men of the most consummate knowledge and unbiassed probity are still men be their judgments ever so acute their hearts ever so incorrupt yet even too exquisite a sensibility of nature may in some cases misguide the one and pervert the other affection and prejudice operate strongly in persons of lively sensations and urge them often to be unjust in those very instances wherein they flatter themselves they are only generous rare are those talents which constitute a great judicial character it requires a ready and clear apprehension a found distinguishing and exact act judgment a comprehensive understanding freedom and liberality of thought sagacity to investigate the great principles of justice and discernment to see where those principles lead  bacon was the wisest chancellor ever sat in a court of equity jefferies was a most excellent lawyer but the one was corrupt and the other was cruel had these men been ignorant would their oppressions have been less  having shown the nature and legal extent of discretionary power in judges the next point is  were the arrests in the several suits against magee for publishing libels legal  the granting of a fiat or judges warrant to hold a defendant to bail is a trust reposed in the judges to be exercised only on extraordinary cases of necessity and in what ever case they are granted the greatest delicacy circumspection and precaution should be attended to  a fiat should never be granted in any case but on positive affidavit stating special circumstances of actual loss of mayhem of battery or that the defendant is going to quit the kingdom   inst     if a person has dangerously wounded another the justice ought to be very cautious how he takes bail till the year and day be past because the defendant is liable to an indictment for murder if the wounded party die within a year and day and the same reason shows the necessity of granting a warrant to apprehend the delinquent besides in cases of actions for mayhem or violent battery the wounds and the blows are possitive proofs of actual injury and a breach of the peace the aggressor is therefore held to bail not only to answer the damages but to prevent his flight from justice  when a fiat is applied for on a positive affidavit that the defendant is going to leave the kingdom and the proof of such fact is accompanied with the further proof of specific damages a fiat is necessary to render such defendant ameanable to justice and the consequences of the suit it is more expeditiously procured than the writ ne exeat regno which may be granted in any case   chanc cas     where there is danger of subterfuge from the justice of the nation though of private concernment  the law or rather the discretionary power which should rule the conduct of the judge in granting a ne exeat regno applies strictly to the exercise of legal discretion in granting a fiat  lord chief justice holt says a ne exeat regno ought not to be granted   chanc cas     but upon great reason and examination otherwise a homine replegiando may lie far     in the application for the writ ne exeat regno which is a prerogative or state writ no general averment though upon oath will be held sufficient  the plaintiff applying for a ne exeat regno skinn     is to make positive oath of his debt and the writ is always marked for the sum sworn in the affidavit chanc c     in words at length and not in figures and the plaintiff swears the defendant is going out of the kingdom   mod   which if he should do the debt may be lost the order is till answer or further order ld ray     and the party is obliged to give security before the court will discharge the writ which security is taken by recognizance before a master and is in the penalty of what is sworn to be actually due and the sheriff takes bail accordingly cas in b r     when he arrests the party thereon s tiles          the sum swom to be due being constantly endorsed on the ne exeat regno as a guide for the sheriff to take bail by  from a comparative view of the writ of ne exeat regno with a judges fiat it appears then that in granting the latter the judge should consider and strictly adhere to the legal rules of discretion which are strictly followed in granting the former  the reasons for granting a fiat should be equally strong the facts stated in the affidavit should be equally specific and the situation of the plaintiff his credibility and his cause of action should equally entitle him to this extraordinary interference and favor of the judge  thus in hilary      in the common pleas of england an application was made to mr justice gould to hold a defendant to bail on a breach of promise of marriage the affidavit stated the cause of action that defendant a lady was going to quit the kingdom and that plaintiff bad suffered five hundred pounds damages the judge held this affidavit insufficient because plaintiff did not specifically state the cause or causes by which the damages accrued but gave him leave to amend he then swore that at the particular request of the defendant he sold his commission for five hundred pounds and spent the money on her she having positively promised him marriage and to purchase him a commission of higher rank and on this affidavit she was held to bail  no man will be so weak or so rash as to assert that the same caution and precission is not necessary in granting a warrant at the discretion of a judge that the law requires in issuing a prerogative writ the latter is a royal trust reposed in the king f n b    which the law does not presume that he will abuse lane    or make use of to the prejudice of his subjects   co    c    the former is a delegated trust from the king to his representative  0 co    the judge who is sworn to execute it according to law and who is responsible to parliament for his conduct  having examined the nature and legal extent of discretionary power the next object is  whether a defendant can be held to bail for publishing a libel against a private individual  magna charta enacts that no man shall be imprisoned but by judgment of his peers or by the law of the land the imprisonment of magee has not been by the judgment of his peers has it been by the law of the land the answer is there is neither law nor practice to support such a proceeding for the discretion exercised is not within the rules of  sound reason law necessity and convenience  the definition of a libel shows that it is not an offense for which a defendant should be held to bail even on a criminal action  a libel is a misdemeanor and is esteemed as such not for being a breach of the peace but for its direct tendency to a breach of the peace by provoking to fight now the law of england never intended that the subject should be held to bail for any misdemeanor that did not amount to an actual breach of the peace   mod     and formerly none could be taken up for a misdemeanor till indictment found regina v tracy   haw   0 therefore mere words of passion as liar knave or rascal do not create a forfeiture of recognizance to keep the peace for they do not challenge a man to break the peace though they tend to it from which the reasonable conclusion is that as slander does not incur a forfeiture of recognizance for keeping the peace neither is it an offense that can justify a judge in holding a defendant to bail  it may be answered that though bail is not demandable in a criminal prosecution for a libel against a private individual yet the plaintiff may demand it in a civil suit  those who thus argue are called upon to show a precedent for holding a defendant to bail on any action for a libel except in cases of scandalum magnatum or slander of title to make a plaintiff assessor of his owm damages conceived perhaps in a moment of heat or resentment would be to establish the grossest mischief damages cannot be ascertained but by verdict of a jury on hearing evidence and in many cases verdicts have been set aside for excess of damages perjury and oppression would be among the consequences it would be deciding by anticipation on the quantum of damages which the jury should give and on the oath of the plaintiff himself it would be contrary to natural justice and the liberty of the subject by enabling an inhuman plaintiff to imprison a poor friendless defendant upon an averment for the space of three terms when upon trial it might appear that he was not guilty of the fact or that what he published was not actionable it would be useless as well as cruel for thus punishing before conviction by fiat when accompanied by excessive bail would be only a severity known in those countries where private informers are encouraged to prosecute men obnoxious to the state and where torture precedes trial  the following causes lately tried at westminster are so many proofs that it is not the practice of the courts there to grant warrants either in criminal or civil sults brought upon libel  these causes were   an information ex officio by the attorney general against lord george gordon for a libel against the queen of france  the king on the prosecution of the prince of wales against walter indictment  the king on the prosecution of the duke of york against walter indictment  the king on the prosecution of the duke of clarence against walter indictment  doctor walcot against walter an action  lord loughborough against walter two actions  right hon william pit against perryman an action  the attorney general against perryman information ex officio  the king on the prosecution of mrs fitzherbert against doctor withers indictment  the attorney general against almon information ex officio  the attorney general against stockdale information by order of the king on address of the house of commons  the libels in all the above causes except the last were of the most atrocious nature among the prosecutors and plaintiffs are seen the most illustrious characters a queen three princes a lord chief justice and a doctor of laws walter and withers were convicted and severely punished lord loughborough and mr pit recovered damages perryman and almon fled and were proceeded against by outlawry yet in none of these prosecutions and suits which all originated within the last two years was a defendant held to bail or a fiat even demanded  the above cases are proofs sufficient to show that on prosecution and actions for libels it is not the practice of the court of kings bench of england to issue such process and it follows that such practice can not be legal here for practice must be consistent with law and the common law of england is by the assent and adoption of the people of ireland the common law of ireland  can it be shown that earl mansfield a prerogative judge who extended the law of libels to its utmost stretch ever granted a fiat in the case of a libel certainly not his lordship well knew it was not within his judicial discretion he well knew there was neither law nor practice to justify the issuing of such a process in such a case to all those therefore who argue in support of the legal authority to hold defendants to bail for publishing libels may be applied earl cambdens requisition to the noble lord above mentioned who in arguing the writ of error brought on the judgment in the kings bench on literary property said  show me a case  but supposing a few cases should be shown in support of practice does it follow that the fiats recently issued against magee are legal practice like custom if contrary to law cannot be sanctified by repetition or continuance general warrants were in practice from the revolution down to the  th of the present king when after being solemnly argued in the court of common pleas and kings bench they were declared illegal  the practice of a particular magistrate cannot control the law communis error is not in this case sufficient to make law this is the duty and therefore doubtless the inclination of the court to stop the mischief as soon as it is complained of  case of general warrants   these were the words of dunning a great constitutional lawyer   burr      and they made a proper impression upon the court for in the same case lord mansfield said a usage to grow into law ought to be a general usage money et al versus leach communiter usitata et approbata and which after a long continuance it would be mischievous to overturn   burr      and mr justice aston added  no degree of antiquity can give sanction to a usage bad in itself  it may also be advanced that if the judges had not authority to hold libellers to bail justice would be evaded and delinquents escape with impunity but is that the case if the defendant flies process of outlawry issues against him and the voluntary transportation of his person by flight is a severer punishment in the eye of the law than any the judicial discretion of the court can inflict restricted as it now is by the benign prohibition of the bill of rights which declares that by the common law of the land which protects the ancient rights and liberties of the people stat   w and m excessive bail ought not to be required c   bollingb abridgm tit liberty nor excessive fines imposed nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted  the refusing of bail where it ought to be granted that is in the language of the old law to withold prisoners repleviable after they have offered sufficient bail   new ab     is an offense at common law and by statute punishable by grievous amercement   inst     hal p c    stat west   and demanding bail where it is not demandable must of course appear an offense of equal magnitude   edw   c    as in each case the liberty of the subject is invaded on this legal doctrine much might be said  but delicacy forbids the argument  the opinion of dunning before stated pa    will probably be followed    burr     it is the duty and therefore doubtless the inclination of the court to stop the mischief  of fiats as soon as it is complained of  magna charta has been mentioned and many other old statutes are equally applicable by the    of edward   stat   c   it is enacted that none shall be taken by petition or suggestion to the king or his counsel unless it be by indictment of lawful people of the neighborhood or by process made by original writ at the common law    ed   c   clear it is that a fiat is not an original writ and it is equally clear    ed   c   that an averment on oath or general affidavit is merely a suggestion to the king or to his judge and representative and of course that to take or imprison a man on such affidavit is illegal these are old statutes but they are living ones the law though it sleeps never dies and acquires respect and reverence from antiquity  bishops case though not strictly in point is not irrelevant to this argument  bishop was held to bail in the sum of two thousand pounds and two sureties of two thousand pounds each but mark the difference between the cases of bishop and magee magee has been held to bail before trial in large sums for publishing libels against obscure individuals   strange   bishop was not held to bail till after conviction on an information for publishing a seditious libel against the state bishop was not held to bail on an averment or suggestion to a judge magee has been held to bail on loose affidavits to answer damages estimated by the plaintiffs themselves bishop was held to bail to suffer the judgment of the court he was committed after conviction of course and being afterward brought up it was moved he should receive the judgment of the court and be admitted to bail being in a very ill state of health the chief justice said the offense is so great that an adequate punishment may endanger his life and to lessen the punishment will be an ill precedent therefore bail him for the present  strange  and we will give judgment when he is better  this was administering justice in mercy  in england it is enacted stat    geo   c    by a statute to prevent frivolous and vexatious suits that in all cases where the cause of action shall amount to the sum of ten pounds affidavit shall be made and filed of the cause of action and the sum or sums specified in such affidavit shall be endorsed on the back of such writ or process for which sum or sums so endorsed the sheriff or other officer to whom such writ or process shall be directed shall take bail and for no more  this statute though not of legal authority in this country yet being founded upon reasons and principles of the common law may be fairly cited in argument as may the cases resulting from it  by these cases and several of anterior date barnes  00  0   0  it is now an established rule of the courts at westminster strange        0            that where the affidavit of the debt does not positively show the cause of action and specify the sum due   wills         the defendant shall be discharged on common bail   burr     where a great number of cases are cited which is no more than filing as sureties the names of those wellknown nonentities messrs john do and richard roe indeed so tenacious was the old law of the personal liberty of the subject   burr      and so cautious was it to discourage litigation that formerly before a plaintiff could obtain a writ to hold a defendant to bail he was obliged to put in two sureties that if he was nonsuit or a verdict given against him he would pay the defendants costs and damages but this precaution has become obsolete and john do and richard roe who represent common bail in all cases are now also become the nominal and fictitious pledges to prosecute  where damages are uncertain common bail is always taken and there are many cases to this point  in reynoldson v blades barnes  0  for covenant broken in the treasury the court said where damages can be reduced to a certainty as in covenant for payment of money or where a tenant covenants with his landlord to pay a certain sum for every acre of land he plows up or the like plaintiff is entitled to bail otherwise not for it is not reasonable that defendant should be held to bail for such damages as plaintiff fancies he has sustained and is pleased to swear to  in the above case it was also held barnes    that the old cases fleetwood v poictier etc are not to be followed  shaw brought an action of debt against hawkins on a bond shaw against hawkins barnes notes    wherein defendant was held to bail on plaintiffs affidavit defendant moved for a common appearance and that plaintiff might produce the bond to the court upon an affidavit that defendant had great reason to believe that the whole sum due was paid by one of his coobligers which would appear by endorsement made on the said bond when produced plaintiff in answer made affidavit that a hundred pounds and upwards remained due to him on the bond after all just allowances that he had seen the bond which was uncancelled and in full force some few months before but had mislaid it and being severely afflicted with the gout could not search among his papers himself so that it could not be procured it was urged by the plaintiff that no declaration being yet delivered defendant is not entitled to oyer of the bond but after a declaration with a profert in cur he was entitled to oyer the court held that as the matter of bail is discretionary and as the measure of the sum for which bail ought to be given is with certainty only to be had from the bond itself the bond ought to be produced and for want of producing it a common appearance was ordered  where the question was whether the condition of a bond not appearing upon record bail ought to be required in a court of error spinks v bird barnes       the court held that matter of bail is properly examinable by affidavit and the bonds being conditioned for performance of covenants bail ought not to be required on a writ of error  plaintiff made an affidavit le w v tolcher that defendant had seized and detained his ship to his damage barnes    and a capias ad respondendum was thereupon endorsed for all without a judges order   com dig  0  rule for common appearance and supersedeas was made absolute   siderfin     the damages in this case are uncertain compto     bail and plaintiff was not entitled to bail without a judges order in debt assumpsit trover covenant by aliam bail is of course in trespass detinue in special action on the case or in covenant at discretion for words no bail unless slander of title  the foregoing cases will all apply as strongly in elucidation of the subsequent part of this essay as they have in supporting the anterior argument  but if there was not a case or statute in point the question on fiats could be decided upon principles  it is a principle that no man shall be imprisoned but by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land  now the law of the land will not hold a man to bail for slanderous words  magna charta and where the law holds a man to bail it must be for a sum specifically sworn to and the law of the land forbids that bail to be excessive but if the proceedings in the suits against magee were net prohibited by any positive law nor adjudged illegal by any precedents yet they might be decided to be so upon principles and the law of england would be a strange science indeed if it were decided upon precedent only precedents serve to illustrate principles and to give them a fixed certainty but the common law which is every mans birthright is exclusive of possitive law enacted by statute and depends upon principles cowper     having shown that in actions for slander neither the law of the land nor the practice of the courts justify judges in holding defendants to bail  the next question is  suppsiong a judge or a court of justice to possess discretionary power to hold a defendant to bail on prosecutions or suits for libels was the bail in which magee was held within the rules of that discretion and authorized by the law of the land or was it what the law terms excessive  dalton and bacon define bail dalt       new ab  0  to be an undertaking of a mans friends before certain persons for that purpose authorized that he shall appear at a certain day and place certain and answer any legal charges exhibited against him  this definition is grounded on that given by bracton lib   tract   ca   mu     bail ballium from the french bailler which comes from the greek  and signifies to deliver into hands is used in our common law for freeing or setting at liberty one arrested or imprisoned upon any action either civil or criminal on surety taken for his appearance at a day and place certain  the reason why it is called bail is impeys practice in b r highmore on bail because by this means in the case of civil actions the party restrained is delivered into the hands of those who bind themselves for his forth coming in order to a safe keeping or protection from prison and the end of bail in a civil action is to satisfy the condemnation and costs or to render the defendant to prison  in all civil actions whereon bail may be taken see the cases already cited there shall be a positive affidavit of the cause of action and no averment of damages is sufficient though on oath to hold a defendant to bail if a judge will however take upon him to exceed his judicial discretion and hold a defendant to bail upon an averment of damages whereby he allows the plaintiff to assess his own satisfaction which is clearly the exclusive right of a jury he should take care that the estimate of the plaintiff be not so high as to imprison the defendant but so low as not to prohibit what the law allows him protection from prison for this would be tant amount to withholding of bail  in criminal cases bail is not only the means of giving liberty to the prisoner but at the same time secures the extent of the law to punish an offender and as it is the undertaking of a mans friends for the purpose of his appearing to take his trial or be dealt with according to law therefore bail demanded at the discretion of the judge should always bear a relation to the defendants situation in life as well as to the offense charged upon him for should the bail be excessive the defendant is precluded from that undertaking of his friends which the law allows to protect him from prison and the judge does not act according to the rules of law and sound reason which are the guides to judicial discretion  the law by which bail is regulated in criminal and civil actions appears clearly to be founded on the same principles and to have the same great object in view the liberty of the subject it never was intended that a man should be imprisoned for damages till those damages were assessed by a jury or for an offense till convicted by his country unless that offense was of such enormity and notoriety that the four walls of a prison only could be considered certain security for his person  what is excessive bail   new ab     dalt      hawk pc       hal p c    may easily be collected from the established law of the land it is said not to be usual for the kings bench to bail a man on a habeas corpus on a commitment for treason or felony without four sureties and the sum in which the sureties are to be bound ought never be less than forty pounds for a capital crime and in all felonies there should be two sureties but it may be higher in discretion on consideration of the ability and quality of the prisoner and the nature of the offense  now it appears from the above authorities that if bail is to be taken at all for a libel which considered as an offense is not a breach of the peace but only a misdemeanor tending to a breach of it that the least bail which the law allows in cases of treason and felony is the greatest that the discretion of the court can legally demand for such a species of misdemeanor particularly where the libel is against a private individual not against a peer or against the state  the bail demanded from magee in the different actions for slander has been stated at the enormous sums of four thousand pounds one thousand pounds eight hundred pounds and two thousand pounds  let us see if such demands be consistent with the common law  let us see if it be prohited by the statute law  these two points may be examined together  the common law lays it down that justices must take care   hawk p c    that under pretense of demanding sufficient surety they do not make so excessive a demand as in effect to amount to a denial of bail and in support of this doctrine a long string of cases might be produed a few however will be sufficient as the great principles of bail are to be found in the petition of rights and the habeas corpus act but it is to be observed that in those cases even where the offenses charged upon the defendant have been enormous as actions for mayhem for violent and cruel batteries barnes notes        for malicious prosecutions etc no bail has been demanded that bears the least proportion to the smallest sum demanded from magee  see the old acts cited in p       stat   wm and mary c   the statute law after recognizing the oppressions of a tyrannical government prohibits the demand of excessive bail as a grievance and it was one of those complained of by the people and provided against by the legislature at the revolution in the ever memorable bill of rights  if it be said the bill of rights only respects criminal prosecutions the answer is it is a statute declaratory of the common law but if it was not acts of parliament shall be taken with latitude and extended to cases within the same reason barnes    and calling for the same remedy the nature of the case raymer v borough and the intent of the legislature are to be considered so in the construction of the english statutes the    and    of w   plowed     lord zouchs case and    geo   c  0 the court of common pleas held both that as statutes were made in favor of the liberty of the subject co litt    b  0 co  0  b beausages case they may stand together now whatever reason can be shown against demanding excessive bail on criminal prosecutions plowd     acquires strength when

justified or wherein no damages whatever may be given brook tit parliament  0 but on the contrary a verdict may be found for the plaintiff to prevent excessive bail is the reason on which the prohibitory statutes were founded wentworths office of executors    civil suits were not specified merely because the grievance now complained of was not then known sir thomas jones    but they are within the principle of the statutes and of course within their prohibition and relief plomer v witchcot   in england the principles of these statutes have been constantly kept alive lord mansfield well knew that the spirited people of that country were more tenacious of the sacred privileges of person than of any other right or liberty the constitution gives them and therefore his lordship always set his face against excessive bail and against excessive damages  when mr laurens the american was brought before the court of kings bench on a charge of high treason his friends made a voluntary tender of one hundred thousand pounds bail lord mansfield refused to receive such bail which he termed enormous and considered unconstitutional and ordered the recognizance to be made out for such a sum as was proportioned to the offense charged upon the prisoner his rank and situation in life  the opinion of mr attorney general of ireland wolf delivered in the house of commons on mr ponsonbys motion coincides with that of lord mansfield in the case of mr laurens that learned gentleman news paper report of the debate then declared that he did not think a mans ability to give large bail was a justification for demanding it   in sir thomas rumbolds case parl reg of eng      by debrett a bill was brought into the house of commons by mr henry dundass then lord advocate of scotland to restrain sir thomas from disposing of his property by holding him to bail in the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds  the english lawyers were rouzed at this unconstitutional requisition of the scotch advocate   the attorney general said it was a hard case to impound a mans whole estate merely that he should not fly from justice see definition of bail ante the demanding of enormous bail he reprobated in the most pointed terms as amounting in reality to absolute imprisonment because no man under such a rule of bail could indemnify others to become security for him  the solicitor general argued on the same points he insisted that the demand was contrary to the practice of the courts below and that to exact excessive bail was a breach of the constitution the law condemned such bail as being cruel by inflicting punishment on the innocent  by imprisoning before conviction men who could procure reasonable bail to enlarge them till the day of trial  mr hastings impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors by the house of commons in the name of the people of great britain was only held to ten thousand pounds bail though there could be no doubt of his capability to procure bail to any amount  from what has been advanced then it is clear  that the judicial discretion of judges is circumscribed and bound by the rules of law and sound reason  that bail can not be demanded on actions for slander except in cases of scandalum magnatum or slander of title  that in all cases where fiats are grantable there must be a positive affidavit of the cause of action and of the specific damages suffered by the defendant  that the bail demanded in the case of magee was excessive and  that in civil as well as in criminal actions a demand of excessive bail is illegal  n b the writer of this essay was not present at the arguments in the court of kings bench in any of the causes against magee nor was he in the house of commons when the question of fiats and bail came before the representatives of the nation of the proceedings in the kings bench he has seen no report of the arguments in the house of commons he has seen only a newspaper account which however though probably taken down with inaccuracy and printed in haste displays great constitutional and legal abilities to avail himself of other gentlemens genius and learning the writer would have considered mean and unfair he has therefore with every possible caution avoided the introduction of any particular observation or expression used in the report he has seen by the advocates of the people though in principles it will be found he thinks with them and the study of these principles of course led him to the cases by which they are illustrated  finis
