determined to lay before the public the ensuing sketches i could not hesitate in choosing whose name i should wish might honor the introduction of them into the world  to whom could a work of this nature with so much propriety be addressed as to him who had not only relinquished for a series of years all the allurements that a polished nation could display to opulence and early age but had exposed himself to numberless perils and the repeated risk of life itself that he might attain higher degrees of that knowledge which these sketches are intended to commemorate in his predecessors and countrymen and as the result of which he has enlarged the stock of natural science beyond all prior example  that liberality sir with which you impart the fruit of your various labors and that distinguished patronage you so amply afford to natural history at large and to botanical science in particular as they demand so have they justly secured to you the grateful acknowledgments of all lovers of that science and of literature and philosophy in general  i have sir on this occasion only to regret that my distant situation has not allowed me in the compilation of these pages those benefits which your most extensive and valuable library would have held forth to me and of which you so generously permit the communication to such as desire to avail themselves of its advantages  permit me then sir to have the honor of inscribing to you the following sketches as to an eminent and no less candid judge of the subject and as a public testimony of that most perfect respect and esteem with which i am  dear sir your much obliged and most obedient humble servant richard pulteney blandford feb       0 preface in the enlightened ages of greece and rome and under the most flourishing state of arabian literature botany as a science had no existence nor was it till some time after the revival of learning that those combinations and distinctions were effectually discovered which in the end by giving rise to system have raised the study of plants to that rank it holds at present in the scale of knowledge  if in the contemplation of flowers mankind at large have in every age placed one of their purest pleasures how greatly must these delights be enhanced to the enamoured votary of botanical knowledge who whilst he surveys that wonderfully varied elegance and beauty which charm the eye of all penetrates still farther and at the same instant discerns also those analogies and discriminations in the number figure situation and proportion of parts on which are laid the foundations of modern botanical science associations and distinctions which are veiled from the untaught eye of common observation howsoever sensible to the general beauties of nature and hence independently of its real and ultimate utility from the accession of knowledge it brings to the materia medica and by its general assistance to the various arts and elegancies of life the study of the vegetable kingdom has proved to numerous speculative and inquisitive minds the source of much intellectual enjoyment  this science is by many considered as of so easy attainment that it is not unusual to assign the name of botanist to any man whose memory enables him to repeat the nomenclature of perhaps a few hundred plants howsoever uninformed he may be of those principles which entitle him to the real name and character with equal justice might any man who knows the names only of the parts of a complex machine assume to himself that fame which is due solely to the inventor of it by this degrading idea men of the first learning and talents in this branch of knowledge have frequently been levelled with the most superficial enquirers and the most ignorant pretenders hence also this science which even in a speculative view holds no mean rank and considered practically is closely connected with medicine and with the arts and elegancies of life has been held forth as a trifling and futile employment in truth he properly is entitled in any degree to the character of the botanist whose acquirements enable him to investigate to describe and systematically arrange any plant which comes under his cognizance but to these abilities in order to complete the character should be united an acquaintance with the philosophy of vegetables and with the history of the science in all its several relations both literary and practical from remote antiquity to his own time seize which require a competent share of general learning and no small degree of painful toil and patient industry both in the fields and in the closet  if this description of the botanist be a true one it manifestly excludes a number of frivolous pretenders the science itself rises in importance and admits of great diversity of employment to the taste the talents and learning of those who direct their attention to it whilst then it is the province of some to investigate new subjects to ascertain those imperfectly known and to record the various improvements and discoveries of the day let it be that of others to do justice to departed merit to recall the scattered remembrances of the lives and hold out the example of those who have labored in the same field before them  in tracing the progress of human knowledge through its several gradations of improvement it is scarcely possible for an inquisitive and liberal mind of congenial taste not to feel an ardent wish of information relating to those persons by whom such improvements have severally been given and hence arises that interesting sympathy which almost inseparably connects biography with the history of each respective branch of knowledge  in this age when successful advancements in the study of plants have so far extended its pleasures as to render botany almost fashionable and at a time when biographical writings find a reception heretofore unknown it became matter of speculation that no one should have delineated the rise and progress of botany in britain in connection with the lives of those who have contributed to amplify and embellish it  among the various enquiries which employ the pens of the learned none perhaps afford more general satisfaction than such as relate to the origin and progress of science and literature but when these lead to objects which we love and cherish they come recommended by a charm that secures a welcome and thus promise a more peculiar entertainment and gratification however disquisitions of this kind are of difficult execution especially when applied to subjects of a scientific nature as requiring the union of various talents in the writer  an appropriate share of learning an extensive literary as well as practical acquaintance with the subject united to all those qualifications requisite in a biographer such as diligence and accuracy in investigating the discoveries of his authors and impartiality in characterizing them and in assigning to each his due degree of merit to these personal requisites must be added the adventitious circumstances of a situation favorable to his researches not only from manuscripts and large libraries but from actual intercourse with the learned  fully sensible in this view of the little claim i have to the character and advantages here spoken of it becomes necessary to avoid the censure of temerity that i should premise some account of the original occasion of this attempt  the attention i had given to english botany in my younger days had prompted me at one time to plan a flora of the plants of this kingdom on an extensive scale including besides the medical and oeconomical history of each a pinax in which it was my design to have distinguished as far as i was able the first discoverer of each species both among foreign writers and those of our own kingdom and to have arranged all their synonyms at large under each plant in chronological order to such a work the following sketches in a somewhat more contracted form were intended as an introduction in the mean time if more important avocations had not the want of necessary assistance from books would probably have stopped the progress of a plan of such extent although this purpose was relinquished yet as the materials were collected and this part of the design was independent of the other i flattered myself that having made some alterations and enlarged the whole under so total a want of any similar work these anecdotes might afford information to young botanists and possibly some amusement to those of more advanced knowledge in the science  although botanical writings are the principal objects of these pages yet as several of these authors were conspicuous for their various seize in different branches of literature their other pursuits and publications where my resources have afforded opportunity have occasionally been recited and i have been more particularly solicitous to collect into one view under each author those various temporary and occasional productions which after the establishment of the royal society were communicated to that body and form a part of the philosophical transactions  in considering the botanical writings especially those of the first eminence i have had recourse with few exceptions to the books themselves but confined to a private collection have yet too frequently had occasion to regret the want of more extensive assistance and although i have not formally quoted my authorities on every occasion they will be sufficiently manifest to all such as are conversant in botanical literature in the historical and biographical parts the most material and authentic facts have likewise been derived from the respective authors in botany and not unfrequently i have availed myself of several of the older periodical publications exclusively of these besides collateral assistance received from separate works and from various collections of smaller bulk i more

britannica and the roantree  saxon botany  manuscripts extant in that language  saxon version of apuleius  primaeval botany the origin of botany considered in the most extensive view must have been coeval with man before the invention of arts the discovery of metals and the use of implements and arms by which animals were more immediately subjected to their power it must be supposed that the human race derived from the vegetable creation the chief part of their sustenance and the primary conveniences of life roots fruits and herbs must then have constituted the food of man trials and experience would teach him all that choice and variety which his different situations allowed the same faithful directors would insensibly inform him of the various qualities and the different effects of them on his body as the sphere of his observations and experience enlarged he would derive the knowledge and distinction of such as were of easy or of difficult digestion he would discover the slatulent kinds and such as corrected slatulency which opened or which constipated the body which was most nutritive and probably by fatal accicidents which were poisonous hence the rudiments of medical science  this various knowledge would be handed down traditionally from one generation to another and with it the names of such as were happily the first discoverers of new aliments or medicinal properties would descend with increasing reverence until involved in obscurity by length of time superstition raised them to the rank of gods thus in the early ages of mankind as now among the still unlettered and uncultivated nations of the earth the administration of simples for the cure of wounds and diseases was almost ever accompanied with superstitious ceremonies and incantations hence too in process of time the character of the priest and the physician was united and the sick resorted to the temples of the gods for relief and although investigation and rational science made slow progress yet in every nation from the most cultivated to the most barbarous the number of simples used for medicinal purposes became by degrees very considerable thus when at length physic assumed a more regular form and was taught in the schools of greece the writings of hippocrates enumerate three hundred vegetables used in physic four centuries afterward they were augmented by dioscorides to near seven hundred and to these the arabians added no inconsiderable number of valuable articles there is room to believe that the ancient gymnosophists of the east pursued the study of plants with a success equal to that of the greeks and the modern nations of the east the japonese the chinese and the brachmans of india incontestibly excel the enlightened nations of greece and rome in their knowledge of botany witness the garden of malabar which comprehends near eight hundred plants all which are described and the virtues recorded with an accuracy and precision unexampled in the ancient authors of greece and rome but to approach nearer home the druids of gaul and of britain cultivated the knowledge of herbs with no inconsiderable diligence whether these ancient magi of the west who were both priests and physicians sprung from those of the east and thus derived their knowledge from a common source a point which has hitherto divided the learned or whether their science was the result of their own investigation i must leave to the critical antiquary to determine  druidical botany in the mean time in tracing the origin and progress of botanical science in britain a survey of its state in the druidical times ought to claim the first attention but in fact the little information transmitted to us from the ancients relating to this extraordinary sect being almost wholly confined to caesar and pliny precludes any enlarged view respecting my particular object it is from pliny we learn that to the misseltoe the vervain the selago and the samolus these ancient fathers of druidism attributed efficacies almost divine and ordained the collection and administration of them with rites and ceremonies not short of religious strictness and such as countenanced the grossest superstition  the misseltoe for instance must be cut only with a golden knife must be gathered when the moon was six days old the priest clothed in white the plant received on a white napkin and lastly two white bulls were to be sacrificed and thus consecrated misseltoe was an antidote to poison and prevented sterility pliny lib xvi c      the misseltoe perhaps is of these plants the only one fully ascertained at this time its parasitical growth the preference which the druids gave to that which grew on the oak assisted by the descriptions the ancients have left of it will sufficiently justify the application to the viscum of the moderns may i not add that probably amidst the manifold virtues anciently ascribed to this plant its power of curing the falling sickness which has accompanied it almost to the present time is the remnant of druidical use and tradition  the vervain after previous libations of honey was to be gathered at the rising of the dog star when neither sun nor moon shone with the left hand only after describing a circle round the plant etc and thus prepared it vanquished fevers and other distempers was an antidote to the bite of serpents and a charm to conciliate friendship ib lib xxv c     with respect to this herb the hierobotane the sacra herba of dioscorides although the modern botanists have now agreed to confine the term to the verbena which pliny has described as having narrower and smaller leaves than the oak it may be remarked that there has been a diversity of opinions among the commentators relating to the plant and it is acknowledged that verbena or verbenacea was also applied as a general term for all plants used about the altar in sacrifices to this day the tuscans apply the word vervena to slips shoots suckers or bundles of plants of any kind  the selago was not to be cut with iron nor touched with the naked hand but with the sagum the druid clothed in white and his feet naked with other magic ceremonies thus collected and consecrated it became a remedy for diseased eyes and a charm against misfortunes ib lib xxiv c      it is nevertheless equally difficult to determine the selago of the druids pliny having only described it as like the savin a description which will accord with a variety of plants of europe most authors nevertheless have agreed from this resemblance to consider it as a species of wolfsclaw moss which is now called lycopodium selago caesalpinus however thinks it was a sedum and guilandinus an erica or heath and probably with more reason  various but equally superstitious were the rites attendant on the samolus which was given to preserve oxen and swine from diseases  this is a plant of which still greater doubts remain pliny having said nothing further of it than that it grew in moist places hence the name is applied to a plant called roundleav d brooklime but as forming a separate genus in modern arrangements it has acquired the name given as above from pliny others have thought it a species of pulsatilla or pasqueflower since one of that kind retains among the bolognese the name of samiglo  the same uncertainty attends all disquisitions relating to the herba britannica of dioscorides and pliny famed for having cured the soldiers of julius caesar on the rhine of the scelotyrbe or the disease supposed to be our sea scurvy the uses of this herb were thought to have been derived from the britons the name suggested this notion but later etymologists have found a different derivation i e brit consolidare tan deus ica s hica ejectio unde britannica dicitur herba quae firmet et consolidat dentes vacillantes ray hist plant i p      the commentators have applied the description given by those two ancients to a variety of simples by some it has been thought to be the polygonum persicaria or spotted arsmart by others the primula auricula or wild auricula by our own first herbalist turner who observed it plentifully in friesland the scene of plinys observations on its effects the polygonum bistorta or bistort at length abraham munting a dutch physician published a treatise in      professedly to prove that the britannica was the hydrolapathum magnum rumex aquaticus or great water dock in this opinion ray and others have acquiesced  i should not have dwelt so long on these circumstances but to show the mortifying uncertainty attending the application of the names of plants from the ancients arising from their vague and indecisive descriptions i add that mr lightfoot thinks there are sufficient traces in the highlands of the high esteem in which the druids held the quickentree or mountain ash sorbus aucuparia it is more frequently than any other tree found planted in the neighborhood of druidical circles of stones so often seen in scotland possibly this fact may be more equivocal than the superstitious uses to which it is still applied it is believed that a small part of this tree carried about them is a charm against witchcraft and enchantment the dairymaid drives the cattle with a switch of the roantree for so it is called in the highlands as a security against the same direful evils and in one part of scotland the sheep and lambs are on the first of may ever made to pass through a hoop of roanwood  short and imperfect as this view of druidical botany may be as delivered to us by pliny yet there can be no doubt that the britons like all other rude nations drew their medicinal sources from the simples growing around them and were therefore well acquainted with common plants and although there are not as far as i know any herbals extant in the ancient british language or in any translation from it by which the degree and extent of their knowledge may be precisely ascertained yet as far as respects the nomenclature merely some reasonable estimate may i apprehend be formed from the list of welsh names of plants preserved by gerard as communicated to him by mr davies of guissaney in flintshire from the irish names as we find them in mr heatons catalogue printed in threlkelds synopsis to which i may add the erse names communicated by the rev mr stuart to the late excellent and muchlamented botanist the rev mr lightfoot these lists might without doubt be greatly amplified by the assiduity of skilful botanists well versed in the respective languages threlkelds list which is the most copious comprehends near four hundred names and the analogy perceivable between these and the erse names sufficiently marks a common origin i am tempted to produce a few instances muiriunagh irish

of health as not to have a knowledge of and some dependence upon the virtues of certain simples there is sufficient evidence that our saxon ancestors did not wholly disregard this study since although rare there are manuscript saxon herbals extant in several public libraries the two following occur in the bodleian      herbarium saxonice      liber medicinalis continens virtutes herbarum saxonice   i am unable to determine whether the above are the same with the two following which dr ducarel notices from the harleian collection  0   entitled herbarium saxonice     tractatus qui ab anglosaxonibus dicebatur liber medicinalis   the last is said to be an anglosaxon version of apuleius whom i shall have occasion to mention hereafter the date of this translation is of the tenth century the saxons having been converted to christianity at the latter end of the sixth century the communication between britain and rome became by degrees very frequent and learning was then first introduced into these realms  the golden age if i may be allowed that expression of the anglosaxon learning was the reign of alfred the great that munificent prince not only himself translated latin authors but as historians inform us encouraged in every way the transfusion of all the knowledge of the times into the common language of the kingdom to this era therefore may reasonably be referred the saxon version of apuleius whose book seems to have preserved popularity through all the middle ages and was found in common use at the era of printing  as no publication of any saxon herbal has ever taken place we are unable to define the extent of the knowledge of that time at present therefore as in the instance of ancient british botany we can only recur to the nomenclature of the indigenous names by which some of them are yet known although many others have given way to greek and latin terms and some to other revolutions occasioned by the gradual progress of reformation throughout the science in general  a list of the anglosaxon names would be recoverable in a great degree by recurring to the old herbals to skinners lexicon and other authorities of that kind it would i am persuaded be more extensive than a superficial view might suggest and would do credit to our saxon ancestors i cannot help remarking that many mistakes have probably arisen from the neglect of our first reformers of botany in england after they had formed scientific names in not preserving also the old and provincial terms and that on the whole this neglect has retarded the progress of knowledge on this subject  chap   general state of botanical knowledge during the dominion of the saracens  corrupt translations of dioscorides  avicenna  aschard or ebn beithar the capital writer in

empires on the decline of those of greece and rome and during that period in which the saxons were establishing themselves in britain medical knowledge passed into the hands of the triumphant saracens bagdat under the eastern caliphs became the seat of learning much of the greek physic and philosophy was corruptly translated by the command of musselmen among whom at length it received due reception and encouragement schools were established in which aristotle galen dioscorides and other writers were studied and their doctrines at length pervaded the whole dominion of the saracens and finally flourished in the universities of spain  dioscorides though in a corrupt and mutilated state formed the basis of knowledge in the botany and materia medica of the arabians the situation of bagdat and its connection with india allowed them scope to introduce into physic feveral useful simples among others we owe to these orientals the milder purges of the present day such as senna cassia fistula manna tamarinds rhubarb and several drugs of other qualities of which some retain a place in the present reformed state of the materia medica avicenna we are told had colored drawings for the instruction of his pupils in botany and prosper alpinus assures us he saw at cairo a volume of paintings of the plants of egypt arabia and ethiopia which had been done for the use of a sultan  it is not easy however to judge with precision of the extent of arabian knowledge on the subject of our work since probably the best book of the arabian school has yet remained unpublished that of ebn beithar it is extant in the parisian the escurial and other libraries this learned arab was particularly attached to the botanical branch of physic he was born in spain and after visiting africa traveled into the levant asia and even as far as the indies to improve his knowledge in his return he was patronised by saladin at cairo and died in       herbelot informs us that from the superiority of his learning in this branch he was styled aschard or the botanist he wrote a general history of simples or of plants ranged in alphabetical order in which he gives the greek arabic and vernacular names with the descriptions of each and particularly in a more detailed manner those not described by dioscorides and pliny  there is notwithstanding but little room to believe that more original knowledge could be derived from the arabian monuments of science in this than in the other departments of physic in their best authors even the greek names of plants are so grossly perverted that they are scarcely to be known  the grecian authors having been inaccurately translated at first and the language neglected afterward physic lost much under the dominion of the arabians it was in the end a corrupt galenic theory with an admixture of astrology and superstition in this state the learned of europe found it in the celebrated moorish universities of spain in the western parts of christendom especially after the lapse of the latin tongue in italy it was scarcely less obscured by the ignorance of the monks by whom almost solely the practice of it was engrossed  even the first university in christendom the renowned school of salernum founded by charlemagne in the beginning of the ninth century received its dictates from the corrupt sources of the arabians whose works are said to have been at length translated into latin by constantine the african the famous precepts de conservanda valetudine issued from that school for the use of robert duke of normandy were without doubt well known in england and probably excited attention to the study of vegetables concerning which numerous rules and cautions occur in that remnant of the learning of those days  during all these ages the original sources in the greek authors were almost wholly forgotten and the productions of that long night of science were equally rare and unimproving  i shall nevertheless enumerate briefly a few of those english authors who were most conspicuous for any attention to the simples used in medicine which alone bounded the botanical knowledge of those times  one of our earliest writers after the conquest was the historian henry archdeacon of huntingdon in the time of king stephen and henry the iid bishop tanner informs us that he left a ms in eight books de herbis de aromatibus et de gemmis bib bodley       of nearly the same age are said to be some manuscripts preserved in bibl regia land under the following titles de natura pecudum arborum et lapidum and one de naturis herbarum bishop tanner mentions an englishman of the name of henry arviel who had traveled much and resided some time at bologna about the year    0 he left a manuscript de botanica sive stirpium varia historia  the same author notices a manuscript in the sloanean collection of john bray who lived in the time of richard the iid he studied botany and physic and received an annual pension from the king for his knowledge and skill in these sciences it is entitled synonyma de nominibus herbarum it contains the names in latin french and english  besides the compendium medicinae of gilbertus legle or gilbertus anglicus who also flourished in the thirteenth century a manuscript is recorded of that author under the title of de re herbaria lib   and others de viribus et medicinis herbarum arborum et specierum et de virtutibus herbarum lib    the famous english surgeon john ardern of newark extolled by dr friend as the reviver of surgery in england who flourished soon after john of gaddesden in the middle of the fourteenth century left a manuscript which is in the sloanean library under the title of de re herbaria physica et chirurgica  henry daniel a dominican friar said to be well skilled in the natural philosophy and physic of his time left a manuscript inscribed aaron danielis he therein treats de re herbaria de arboribus fructicibus etc he flourished about the year       appertaining to my subject i also mention a treatise written as is supposed in the time of edward the iiid by walter de henley entitled de yconomia five housbrandia in which bishop tanner says he has treated his subject well according to the usage of the time  nicolas bollar educated at oxford whom tanner represents as eminent for his knowledge in natural philosophy wrote de arborum plantatione lib   de generatione arborum et modo generandi et plantandi lib   and other tracts now in manuscript  there is a manuscript said to be preserved in baliol college written by johannes de s paulo de virtutibus simplicium

have been written if not prior to the invention of printing at least before the introduction of that art into england  this list perhaps already too long might have been considerably extended but that it would have unnecessarily swelled this article as none of these manuscripts however have been published the exact state and progress of the science cannot be ascertained yet enough is seen to convince us that although its advancemnet was slow and inconsiderable it was not wholly lost in the darkness of that night which for so many ages obscured the sources of knowledge it is highly probable that very few of the manuscripts before enumerated exhibit any considerable portion of original matter but that they are principally extracts and compilations from preceding writers of the lower age such as apuleius aemilius macer s sethus isidore constantinus the pandects of matthew sylvaticus platearius some of the later arabians and other writers of that stamp at the renovation of knowledge just mentioned these appear to have been the primary sources from which our ancestors of that generation derived assistance since we find many mss of the above authors were in being at the origin of printing and were early issued from the press as the manuals of that day in various parts of christendom  it has been observed that the lastmentioned saxon manuscript was a translation of lucius apuleius madaurensis whose work from several other circumstances there is room to believe was at that time more diffused and popular in england than any other this author who lived in the age of the antonines was born at madura in africa at that time a seat of learning he afterward studied at carthage and at athens and for some time applied himself at rome to jurisprudence but at length quitted it and devoted himself wholly to philosophy and physic he is well known as the author of the milesian fables and other works of learning his book de herbis sive de nominibus ac virtutibus herbarum alone comes under our cognizance in this he recites the names of medicinal herbs in the greek latin egyptian punic celtic and dacian and of some in the oriental languages these names form the bulk of the book which consists of one hundred and thirty chapters after each name follows a short description of the plant the place of growth and the properties then the discases to which each simple is applicable the work nevertheless abounds with gross errors in the names of plants and inculcates the most absurd ceremonies and superstitions in the administration of remedies yet it was in much esteem throughout the dark ages of literature  it must not however be concealed that some of the learned have judged that this work at least as it now appears was not written by the author whose name it bears but at a much later period johnson the editor of gerard imagined it to be a translation of a greek writer of the eighth century but his conjecture is not thought probable by fabricius b latin ab ernesto lips      tom   p     the remarks of johnson prove that this work was in common use in the ages i have spoken of and that the copies had been greatly corrupted and mutilated by ignorant hands  i will give one instance from apuleius of that credulity and superstition which sanctioned by antiquity yet prevailed in the administration of remedies and exhibits a melancholy proof of the wretched state of physic which through so many ages had not broke the shackles of druidical magic and imposition as a cure for a disease called by the french noue lequillette you are directed to take seven stalks of the herb lionsfoot separated from the roots these are to be boiled in water in the wane of the moon the patient is to be washed with this water on the approach of night standing before the threshold on the outside of his own house and the person who performs this office for the sick is also not to fail to wash himself this done the sick person is to be fumigated with the smoke of the herb aristolochia and both persons are then to enter into the house together taking strict care not to look behind them while returning after which adds the author the sick will immediately become well  a book under the name of macers herbal seems also to have been in common use in england before the era of printing authors do not allow it to be the production of aemilius macer quoted by ovid but of much later date and by some it is ascribed to odo or odobonus a physician of the later times and probably a frenchman this barbarous poem is in leonine verse and is entitled de naturis qualitatibus and virtutibus herbarum diverse manuscripts of it are extant in the english libraries as at cambridge in the bodleian ashmolean and sloanean collections  it was translated into english as bishop tanner informs us by john lelamar master of hereford school who lived about the year      his manuscript is referred to as in sloanes library even linacre did not disdain to employ himself on this work macers herbal practysyd by doctor linacro translated out of latin into english london   mo ames mentions an edition of it printed in      and palmer one without date printed by wyre this jejune performance which is written wholly on galenic principles treats on the virtues of not more than eightyeight simples  i shall not detain the reader by dwelling on other authors of this class whose names i have before recited it will be sufficient to observe that fettered as were the theories of this time with astrology and a strange mixture of the galenic doctrine of the four elements it extended its influence not to the human body alone but to all the instruments of physic not even a plant of medicinal use but was placed under the dominion of some planet and must neither be gathered nor applied but with observances that savoured of the most absurd superstition  chap   manuscripts of the patres botanici scarce in england  restoration of ancient knowledge by the publications of pliny dioscorides and theophrastus  the era of commentators  rise of true investigation by brunsfelsius tragus cordus and gesner  famous ms of dioscorides with illuminated figures  middle ages at this time manuscripts of theophrastus dioscorides and pliny were not only exceedingly rare throughout europe but those of the two former were unnoticed through ignorance of the greek language otherwise we cannot suppose our ancestors could have neglected them for the crude and barbarous works which have been mentioned it was not till the opening of the fifteenth century that opportunity was given to recur to these repositories of ancient lore the flight of the greeks into italy at the subversion of the eastern empire and the subsequent invention of printing by bringing to light and disseminating the purer remains of greece and rome at length broke the chains of barbarism and superstition which during so many ages had tyrannized over the understandings of mankind  on this happy revolution botany with other sciences revived and presently resumed another appearance the publication of the patres botanici raised at once a spirit of emulation to investigate the subjects of their works  pliny was first printed if not at verona in      as is affirmed by some and doubted by others at least in the succeeding year at venice and the avidity with which it was received is manifested by the numerous impressions of it before the end of that century  dioscorides came forth first at cologn in a latin translation in      and in the original by aldus in      it was afterward published in latin by hermolaus barbarus and ruellius in the year      by vergilius in      and by cornarus in      the learned now prefer the edition with a translation by saracenus printed at lions in       theophrastus was first printed in greek at venice without date and by aldus in      and      he was translated into latin by gaza in      and this version has been preferred by succeeding writers  the restoration of these sages of antiquity immediately raised up a numerous set of commentators every plant was sought for and every plant was discovered in the works of antiquity no drug used in medicine was esteemed true unless found in dioscorides scaliger wrote animadversions on theophrastus in      in which he has corrected the version of gaza in many places robert constantine produced the parallel places in pliny and bodaeus a stapel in      astonished the world by a display of erudition on this author in which he exhausted all farther disquisition by the profusion of his remarks and collations from all preceding writers  the commentaries on dioscorides have been more numerous the corollaria of hermolaus barbarus was published in      to hermolaus succeeded brunsfelsius petrus leydensis lacuna amatus lusitanus robert constantine val cordus and several others and finally matthiolus whose work has superseded the rest it was first printed in      and passed through seventeen editions if we may believe one of the correspondents of this author thirtytwo thousand copies had been sold before the year      matthiol oper omn ed      in epist p   0  the best edition with the accessions of caspar bauhine in      still finds a reputable place in modern libraries  among the illustrators of pliny hermolaus barbarus in      stood foremost his castigationes plinianae were published in      in which he successfully corrected the text and leonicenus in the same year was the first who employed critical knowledge on this author the corruptions of the text afforded great scope afterward to galenius rhenanus pintiani and others the exercitationes plinianae of salmasius are well known those of the laborious and paradoxical harduin are the principal resort of modern times  it is a mortifying reflection in the annals of human knowledge that the bulk of these learned men after their immense labors mistook in numberless instances the road to truth and did but perplex the science they wished to enlighten the descriptions of plants in the ancient authors were at best short vague and insufficient and with this inconvenience the study of nature herself was neglected in the mean time there arose a genuine set of cultivators who discovering this error of the commentators studied plants in the fields where alone the best comments could be made as the foremost of these stands brunsfelsius he was followed by tragus fuchsius val cordus gesner caesalpinus and above all clusius to whom must be added our own countryman turner still even among these genuine restorers of natural knowledge many did not sufficiently recollect that all the plants of dioscorides were not those of europe but principally those of asia whilst instead of traversing the fields of greece cilicia and the east they were straining all the descriptions of this author to accommodate them to the vegetables of europe it is not strange that their endeavors were but little successful even after the labors of rauwolf who traversed syria mesopotomia palestine and egypt in the sixteenth century and those of the enlightened tournefort in the present it does not appear that of the seven hundred plants in the materia medica of dioscorides more than four hundred at the farthest are properly ascertained at this time  we learn from pliny lib    c   that there were paintings of plants in his day but he complains that through the inaccuracy of copiers they were not to be depended on salmasius tells us he inspected a greek ms of dioscorides more than a thousand years old in which the plants were figured with sufficient elegance indeed but with little regard to truth and exact resemblance there are now existing several manuscripts of dioscorides with illuminated figures particularly the famous one in the imperial library at vienna of which lambecius treats largely  it was procured by busbequius the emperors resident at constantinople about    0 and is said to have been copied at the expense of juliana anicia daughter to the emperor flavius anicius olyber about the year     it has been regretted by some of the learned that this ms had not been brought earlier into europe by which means the commentators might have been saved much trouble ancient however and splendid as this is it may justly be doubted whether the publication of it would have much conduced to the restoration of ancient botany and materia medica since if we are allowed to judge of the figures from the specimens copied by dodonaeus nothing can exceed the rudeness of them or more strongly justify the remark of salmasius and as several of these are copied into gerards herbal for the satisfaction of the curious i refer in the note coronopus dod ed      p  0  ger em    0 arction dod     park      hyssopus dod     hippophaes dod     aconitum lycoctonum dod     ger em     staebe dod     ger em     lotus sylvestris dod     lotus aegyptia dod     tithymalus dendroides dod     ger em  0   to some of these figures in both authors  in justice however to these valuable remains it must be observed that from later information we find there is besides this constantinopolitan ms which is in folio another supposed to be more ancient in  to which is distinguished by the name of neapolitan that the figures in both these agree extremely well and as haller informs us are sufficiently exact to enable the botanical traveller with such drawings in his hands to distinguish the plants of dioscorides in the native places of growth it is particularly specified that the periclymenum of these manuscripts evidently appears to be the convolvulus major of the moderns and the telephium the cerinthe minor finally that if those enumerated in the note so ill express the plants designed it must be wholly attributed to the fault of the copier or engraver this intelligence is attended with regret when we further learn that after some of these icons were lately engraved with a view to the publication of the whole the design has been laid aside  i shall be thought perhaps in the foregoing pages to have digressed too much i have to allege that a brief view of the general state and progress of physic with which my subject is inseparably connected during the dominion of the saracens in the east and in the ages of ignorance preceding the fourteenth century in the west seemed necessary in order to throw light on the introduction of it into this island and as england shared the improvement arising from the restoration of ancient knowledge a short notice of the three principal botanic authors was deemed not less proper  at this distance of time perhaps it may require some warmth of imagination to picture to the mind that satisfaction which ingenuous and learned men must have experienced who lived when the veil was removed which for ages had obscured and confined those elegant sources of intellectual enjoyments which the writings of the ancients display when the means of attaining them were by the invention of printing so happily amplified and the progress not only of those arts and sciences which embellish but of those which also dignify human nature by their utility was no longer retarded  chap   account of the earliest botanical publications on the continent  the book of nature  the herbarius  the hortus sanitatis  these works the basis of the  great herbal in      the first botanical publication in england  account of that work  ascham  copland both herbalists of the astrologic sect  first botanical gardens  hortus sanitatis it was not till several years after the era of printing that any original work strictly botanical made its appearance even on the continent and still longer before england produced any publication of importance in that way  previous to the first dawning of this science in england it is almost necessary to mention some of the productions abroad as they were the basis of what was here first published although in fact there was no original work before the herbal of turner  in the opinion of seguier the first book on plants with figures was printed at augsburgh soon after the invention of wooden cuts or tables between the years      and      in the german tongue with the title of  the book of nature it treats of animals and plants of the latter a hundred and seventysix kinds are noticed and many of them figured the work is made up chiefly from pliny isidore and platearius  this book seems to have been soon superseded by the famous herbal of mentz in      styled simply herbarius which gave rise the next year to the wellknown work ortus sanitatis ascribed to cuba a physician of augsburgh and afterward of frankfort who if not the author was at least the editor of an enlarged and improved edition this work under different editors was the basis of all the herbals of europe for many years  its object is the materia medica from all nature but vegetables occupy the greater part the first edition was comprised in four hundred and thirtyfive chapters in one printed at venice in      which is in the black letter they are extended to a thousand and sixtysix of which one half treat on the vegetable kingdom the author professes to have drawn his resources from hippocrates galen pliny avicenna serapion mesues dioscorides platearius vincentius the pandects palladius constantin almanser and others at the head of each chapter stands a cut than which scarcely any thing can be conceived more rude and in some cases nothing is more puerile or ridiculous the pages if printed with numbers would amount to more than seven hundred many copies of this performance are remaining although the herbarius is become very scarce  great herbal these books were undoubtedly the foundation of the first printed botanical work of any consequence or popularity in england and which appeared under the title of the great herbal with cuts printed for peter treveris as ames tells us in      before the impression of this book in england some editions of the herbarius on the continent had been augmented so far as to contain five hundred figures of plants the great herbal seems to have been well received in england since there are subsequent copies which bear the following dates                and in the continuation of ames an edition is mentioned of the great herbal about the year    0 without the cuts there is also an edition of this book so late as the year      which is ten years after the date of turners herbal that of      bears the following title   the great herball which geveth parfyt knowledge and understandyng of all manner of herbs and there gracyous virtues which god has ordained for our prosperous welfare and health for

masters in medycynes as avicenna pandecta constantinus wilhelmus platearius rabbi moses johannes mesue haly albertus bartholomeus and more other etc  there is no authors name to it but there are indubitable traces of its being fabricated from the hortus sanitatis and probably from the french translation of that work printed by caron at paris in      with some alterations and additions  it abounds with the barbarous and misspelt names of the middle ages and is undoubtedly the work which turner refers to in the preface to his herbal where he observes that as yet there was no english herbal but one al full of unlearned cacographees and falsely naming of herbs  the general order is that of the alphabet according to the latin names each subject forming a chapter in the whole five hundred and five of which more than four hundred respect the vegetable productions and of these one hundred and fifty bear the names of plants which are natives of england but the writer remarks no other distinction by which they are known from the exotics the names are given in latin and english but throughout the whole scarcely any descriptions the qualities whether hot or cold dry or moist according to the galenic mode of the time is invariably noticed followed generally by a prolix account of the diseases to which the plant is applicable and the method of using it  to each is prefixed a coarse woodencut figure as in the hortus sanitatis from which on a somewhat smaller scale they are evidently copied consisting generally of outlines only each block is two inches high and nearly as wide many of these figures are fictitious and many misplaced in a variety of instances the same figure is prefixed to different plants and in very few are they sufficiently expressive of the habit to discriminate even a wellknown subject if the name applied did not suggest the idea of it in some these icons are whimsically absurd especially in the animals and minerals being also copies of those in the hortus sanitatis those of the mandrake for example exhibit two perfectly human figures with the plant growing from the head of each though to do the writer justice he acknowledges that no such thing exists in nature at the end is subjoined an explanation of some terms and a tract on urines  ascham anthony ascham a priest and vicar of burnishton in yorkshire to which he was preferred by edward vi after a liberal education which it might have been expected would have secured him from such delusion gave himself up to the study of astrology on which subject he published several tracts

the consequent establishment of professorships gave rise to botanical gardens a new species of luxury in horticulture of singular emolument to science the history of ancient gardens hitherto not sufficiently illustrated merits the investigation of the most learned and able writer of the pen of a rapin a meursius a seguier or a gronovius we learn however that even botanical gardens are of ancient date if it may be credited what is related of attalus the last king of pergamus who from his love of physic has been styled the physician he collected in his garden hellebore henbane aconite and other poisonous herbs to make experiments on criminals with counterpoisons crete from the earliest times renowned for the production of medicinal herbs was the physicgarden of rome the emperors we are told maintained in that island herbarists and gardeners to provide the physicians of rome with simples castor a greek praised both by pliny and galen is said not only to have written many volumes concerning plants but to have had a garden at rome in which pliny relates that castor at upwards of an hundred years of age demonstrated plants and taught him to distinguish several rare and useful species  the utility of these institutions are selfevident by public gardens medicinal plants are at the command of the teacher in every lesson by private ones the eye and the taste of the opulent and scientific owner is perpetually gratified with the succession of curious scarce and exotic luxuries in comparing the doubtful species and examining them through all the stages of growth with those to which they are allied add to which that all these advantages are accumulated in a thousand objects at the same time the first public institution of this kind in more modern times was that of padua by the venetians in the year      lucas ghinus the first public professor of botany in europe was a strenuous promoter of the same designs and by his influence procured the establishment of a garden at bologna in      where turner himself imbibed much of that knowledge which afterward gave him such preeminence in his own country  among the earliest private gardens of the same kind was that of euricius cordus the disciple of the venerable leonicenus and of manardus two of the first commentators who displayed true botanical criticism on the works of the ancients cordus showed himself afterward worthy of such masters in his botanologicon printed in      he mentions his own garden and that of nordecius at cassel about the same time there were several opulent patrons of this science in italy germany and france who followed this example gesner constructed a garden at zurich in    0 the first of the kind in switzerland he not only delineated plants himself but maintained at his own expense a draughtsman and engraver for the same purposes turner appears to have had a garden for rare plants even during his residence at cologn in england he records the garden of the duke of somerset at sion house of which he seems to have had the direction and at a later period as has been before observed mentions also his own at wells  chap   turner  anecdotes of his life  account of his writings preceding the herbal  his herbal the first original book of botany published in england  an account of that work  contemporary botanists mentioned by turner as falconer wooton merdy clement  turners book on baths  turner not sufficiently appreciated by succeeding botanists  turner the history of english botany to this period from its imperfect and even barbarous state may perhaps not unaptly be considered as the fabulous age of the science among us but we are now arrived at the true era of its birth in england i cannot call it the restoration since this nation like italy in the flourishing state of rome had never been enlightened by the writings of greece it was much later before the works of those sages reached this kingdom manuscript copies of the patres botanici as has been before observed were exceedingly rare and the language itself in which they are written had made small progress in england  on this head indeed my sources of information are very narrow as far as they reach i am not able to find that one manuscript of theophrastus existed at this period in any of the public libraries of england of dioscorides there are two mss in the bodleian no      which bear the title of  de herbarum natura et virtutibus cum iconibus elegantibus and in the same collection no   0 an arabic version of the five books cum nominibus a thoma hyde adjectis of pliny there is said to be an entire copy in baliol library no     an imperfect one of eighteen books only in the norfolk collection no      and an epitome in trinitycollege cambridge no      even of the works of hippocrates scarcely any were known except his aphorisms and prognostics and linacre first made the english physicians acquainted with galen but to return the true era of botany in england must commence with dr william turner who was unquestionably the earliest writer among us that discovered learning and critical judgment in the knowledge of plants and whose book of herbs as dr bulleyn observes will always grow green and never wither as long as dioscorides is held in mind by us mortal wights but before i turn my attention to turner i will remark that in an interval of thirtyfour years between the first edition of the great herbal in      and that of turner in    0 i have it not in my power to refer to any publication on my subject in the english tongue that there were translations of several of the writers of the middle ages has been noticed among those on the continent there were several by whose means botany made a rapid progress the principal were brunsfelsius euricius cordus ruellius valerius cordus fuchsius and above all gesner who possessing a genius and industry almost unparalleled in these studies comprehended this rising branch of knowledge with a more expanded view than any of his predecessors and extended its bounds beyond the limits which till that time materia medica alone had prescribed to it but gesners talents though in botany they were original were still more conspicuous in his knowledge of the animal kingdom in which his writings will long be valued and esteemed by those especially who without painful researches would see ancient literature in a concentrated view i speak not of his abilities as a philologist and critic in which characters he held a distinguished place but to proceed  william turner was born at morpeth in northumberland and educated at pembroke college cambridge under the patronage and assistance of sir thomas wentworth i find him a student of that college about the year      where he acquired great reputation for his learning he applied himself to philosophy and physic and early discovered an inclination to the study of plants and a wish to be well acquainted with the materia medica of the ancients  he complains of the little assistance he could receive in these pursuits being yet a student of pembroke hall whereas i could learn never one greek neither latin nor english name even amongst the physicians of any herb or tree such was the ignorance at that time and as yet there was no english herbal but one all full of unlearned cacographies and falsely naming of herbs  at cambridge turner imbibed the principles of the reformers and afterward agreeably to the practice of many others united to the character of the physician that of the divine he became a preacher traveling into many parts of england and propagated with so much zeal the cause of the reformation that he excited persecution from bishop gardener he was thrown into prison and detained a considerable time on his enlargement he submitted to voluntary exile during the remainder of the reign of henry viii  this banishment proved favorable to his advancement in medical and botanical studies he resided at basil at strasburgh at bonn but principally at cologn with many other english refugees he dwelt for some time at wiessenburgh he traveled into italy and took the degree of doctor of physic at ferrara as at this period the learned were applying with great assiduity to the illustration of the ancients it was a fortunate circumstance to dr turner that he had an opportunity of attending the lectures of lucas ghinus at bologna of whom he speaks in his  herbal with great satisfaction and frequently cites his authority against other commentators ghinus was the first who erected a separate professorial chair for botanical science from whence he gave lectures on dioscorides which he continued for twentyeight years with great applause he procured the physicgarden to be founded at bologna to demonstrate the plants he spoke of he was the preceptor of caesalpinus and anguillara who became two of the soundest critics in the knowledge of plants that the age produced turner resided a considerable time at basil from which place he dates the dedication of his book on the baths of england and germany during his residence in switzerland he contracted a friendship with gesner and afterward kept up a correspondence with him  gesner had a high opinion of turner as appears by the following passage in his book de herbis lunariis printed in       ante annos    aut circiter cum anglicus ex italia rediens me salutaret turnerus is suerit vir excellentis tum in re medica tum aliis plerisque disciplinis doctrinae aut alius quispiam vix satis memini etc  at the accession of edward vi he returned to england was incorporated doctor of physic at oxford appointed physician to edward duke of somerset and as a divine was rewarded with a prebend of york a canonry of windsor and the deanery of wells he speaks of himself in the third part of his herbal when treating on the herba britannica which he took to be the bistort as having been physician to the earl of embden lord of east friesland in      he published the first part of his history of plants which he dedicated to the duke his patron his zeal in the cause of the reformation which he had amply testified by several religious tracts induced him to retreat to the continent during the whole reign of mary at her decease queen elizabeth reinstated him in all his church preferments in the dedication of the complete edition of his herbal to the queen in      after complimenting her majesty on account of her skill in the latin language and the fluency with which she conversed in it he acknowledges with gratitude her favors in restoring him to his benefices and in other ways protecting him from troubles having at four several times granted him the great seal for these purposes he seems to have divided his time between his deanery where he had a botanical garden of which frequent mention is made in his herbal and his house in crutched friars london he also speaks of his garden at kew from the repeated notices he takes of the plants in purbeck and about portland i should suppose he must have had some intimate connections in dorsetshire  dr turner died july        a few months after the publication of the last part of his herbal he left several children his son peter was educated to physic traveled and took degrees abroad was incorporated doctor at cambridge and at oxford and died aged    in      but i do not find that he inherited his fathers turn to botany  turners first work on the subject of plants if bumaldus is not mistaken was printed at cologn under the title of  historia de naturis herbarum scholiis et notis vallata colon apud gymnicum       o bumaldus is the only writer in whom i find any mention of this book and i suspect it was not republished in england it was followed by a small volume under the title of names of herbs in greek latin english dutch and french land   o      this nomenclator is i believe become very scarce since it has not yet found its way into the copious and magnificent collection of sir joseph banks  dr turners knowledge in natural history was not confined to botany his earliest publication appears to have been a treatise on birds under the following title   avium praecipuarum quarum apud plinium et aristotelem mentio est brevis et succinct a historia ex optimis quibusque scriptoribus contexta scholio illustrata et aucta adjectis nominibus graecis germanicis et britannicis coloniae       o not having seen this volume i can only say that turner is mentioned by his friend gesner in respectful terms as an ornithologist  avium quidem nomina et naturas ante nos et pauci et breviter attigerunt ex quibus gyb longolius germanus et gulielmus turner anglus viri doctissimi praecipuam merentur laudem gesn praef ad avium hist turner also contributed to enrich gesners museum the first collection of that kind with natural curiosities which he sent from england to which i add that dr merret gives the following testimony to the worth of turner in the preface to his pinax  consului in quibusdam turnerum nostratem inter viros suae aetatis exercitatissimum qui librum de avibus edidit mole parvum at judicio majorem  prefixed to the third volume of the frankfort edition of gesners historia animalium in    0 we find a letter from dr turner relating to the english fishes which sufficiently proves that he had no inconsiderable degree of knowledge in that part of zoology he makes an apology for the imperfections of it as being written from memory and at a distance from all his notes and observations it consists of three pages in which he has briefly described more than fifty species and it seems to be intended principally to give gesner information on the english names which turner has carefully noted and often added the provincial appellations he takes in both sea and river fish and includes also the scallop and the cockle this letter was written from weissenburgh and is dated nov        he undoubtedly pursued this branch of zoology much farther since it appears from his dedication to the queen that he intended to set out a book of the names and natures of the fishes of her majestys realms  but the work which secured his reputation to posterity and entitled him to the character of an original writer on that subject in england is his history of plants printed at different times in three parts in folio with cuts the first at london in      under this title a new herball wherein are contained the names of herbs in greek latin english duch french and in the potecaries and herbaries latin with the properties degrees and natural places of the same gathered for steven mierdman land      the second part at cologn      during his exile in the reign of mary with this was reprinted the first part and his book on the bathes of england and germany  in      these were reprinted with the addition of the third part which bears the following title the third part of wm turners herbal wherein are contained the herbs roots and fruytes whereof is no mention made of dioscorides galene plinye and other old authors imprinted at collen by arnold birckman in the year of our lord      the dedication however to the company of surgeons is dated from wells june          dr turners herbal is printed in the black letter agreeably to the general usage of the times and is embellished with the figures of most of the plants he describes  the arrangement is alphabetical according to the latin names and after the description he frequently specifies the places of growth he is ample in his discrimination of the species as his great object was to ascertain the materia medica of the ancients and of dioscorides in particular throughout the vegetable kingdom to this end he bestows much criticism on the commentaries of fuchsius tragus matthiolus and other of his contemporaries and professes to have corrected many of their mistakes in the application of the names of dioscorides in all this he has shown much judgment and i may add much moderation in avoiding more than usual the license taken by many of the commentators of applying the names of plants described in theophrastus dioscorides and pliny to those of the western parts of europe what he says of the virtues of plants he has drawn from the ancients but has in numberless instances given his opinion of their qualities in opposition to those sages and recorded his own experience of the virtues he no where takes any doubtful plants upon trust but appears to have examined them with all the precision usually exercised at a time when method and principles now established were unthought of every where comparing them with the descriptions of the ancients and moderns he first gave names to many english plants and allowing for the time when specifical distinctions were not established when almost all the small plants were disregarded and the cryptogamia almost wholly overlooked the number he was acquainted with is much beyond what could easily have been imagined in an original writer on his subject  the third part of his herbal dated from wells june         he dedicates to the company of surgeons and apologizes for its imperfections being so much vexed with sickness and occupied with preaching and the study of divinity and exercise of discipline i have had but small leisure to write herballes  in this part he professes to treat on the plants not known to dioscorides and the ancients it consists of near an hundred articles among which we find introduced many of the exotic subjects which had before been but little known such as cassia fistula cubebs guaiacum nutmegs myrobalans nux indica nux vomica anacardium rhubarb sarsaparilla senna and tamarinds for these many new figures were cut which are executed in a style superior to the others the remainder are principally the productions of our own country  the complete edition of turners herbal in      was printed at cologn unquestionably to receive the advantage of the figures probably at that time the property of birkman the printer they are the same with which the octavo edition of fuchsius was first printed in      in all five hundred and twelve of these turner has used upwards of four hundred to which he has added about ninety new making the whole number five hundred and two there are some instances of the wrong application of these figures an error that might readily happen when the author was at such a distance and was common in almost all similar works of that time there are also several figures to which no description of the plants can be found for instance the six figures of the geraniums from fuchsius occur with a slight mention of only two species in the text  turner is the first author who has given a figure of the lucern which i apprehend he first brought into england and named horned clover he treats largely of its cultivation from pliny palladius and columella  in the dedication to the first edition of his herbal in      dr turner speaks in very respectful terms of the botanical knowledge of several of his contemporaries and apologizes for his undertaking so arduous a matter while there were learned englishmen better qualified he enumerates dr clement dr merdy owen wooton and master falconer the lastmentioned is several times introduced in the body of the work i can scarcely doubt that he was john falconer who is recorded as having communicated many english plants to amatus lusitanus who taught physic at ferrara and ancona and made himself known as a commentator on dioscorides in      in treating on the glaux of which turner gives a new figure he says he never saw it in england except in master falconers book and that he brought it from italy from this and other like citations it may reasonably be conjectured that  falconers book was an hortus siccus and if so must have been among the earliest collections of that kind that is noticed in england  in appreciating the merit of dr turner as a botanist due regard must be had to the time in which he lived the little assistance he could derive from his contemporaries of whom brunsfelsius ruellius fuchsius and tragus when he published his first part of the herbal were the chief in which view he will appear to have exhibited uncommon diligence and great erudition and fully to deserve the character of an original writer  our author paid early attention to mineral waters he was probably the first who wrote on the baths of bath in somersetshire he visited several of the mineral springs in germany switzerland and italy and drew up whilst abroad a short account of ten of those waters to which he prefixed a more enlarged history of the waters of bath this was written as it should seem at basil and is dedicated to his wellbeloved neighbors of bath bristow wells winsam and charde march  0      he adjudged the principle of bath water to be brimstone and possibly a little copper from the vicinity of that metal in the neighboring mountains he says he had been insormed that besides brimstone the kings bath held alum and the cross bath saltpetre but that he could find neither he concludes his account of the baths by a set of general rules for all who drink mineral waters many of which do him no discredit when compared with the injunctions of modern physicians  our author also wrote on the nature of wines commonly used in england in vindication of the use of rhenish wines to this was annexed a tract on the nature and virtue of treacle but as i never saw these treatises i can give no account of them  dr turner was the author of many polemical and religious treatises chiefly written in defense of the reformation of these a list is given in the athenae oxonienses and a more accurate and enlarged one in bishop tanners bibliotheca several of his tracts are yet in manuscript in various libraries he collated the translation of the bible with hebrew greek and latin copies and corrected it in many places  he procured to be printed at antwerp a new and corrected edition of the historia gentis nostrae s angliae written by william of newburgh from a manuscript he found in the library of wells but complains that the printer not only omitted to insert certain articles sent by him but left out the preface he sent him substituting one of his own our author also translated several works from the latin particularly the comparison of the old learning and the new written by urbanus regius southwark       o and again      and       i will not conclude this short memoir of dr turner without remarking that the succeeding herbalists gerard johnson and parkinson seem not to have paid due honor to his merit and learning from the silence they observe relating to him in their writings gerard indeed mentions in his preface that excellent work of master dr turner and in another place styles him that excellent painful and diligent physician mr dr turner of late memory in justice to turner they should have noticed all the plants he has recorded particularly the natives of england  ray at the distance of near a century was sensible of his worth having styled him a man of solid erudition and judgment in honor of turner his name has been annexed by plumier the french botanist to a new genus of plants well known at this time in the english gardens it was first discovered by sloane in jamaica and described by him under the title of cistus urticae solio   chap   dr bulleyn  anecdotes of his life  his herbal or book on simples  his defense of the fertility of england  dr thomas penny short anecdotes of  the friend and correspondent of gesner clusius and camerarius  maplet  morning  bulleyn contemporary with turner lived dr william bulleyn although this writer does not come strictly within my plan yet as he lived at a period barren of interesting materials and as we learn from him several curious anecdotes respecting natural history and the state of gardening in england at that period he cannot be passed over in silence  bishop tanner briefly notices dr bulleyn and his writings but his life is amply written in the biographia britannica to which i must principally be indebted for my information  he was born in the isle of ely in the early part of henry the eighths reign and was educated at cambridge though as wood says he afterward resided some time at oxford it appears that he had traveled over several parts of germany that he visited scotland and had taken many tours in his native country in all which he studied the natural productions with a zeal and success not common in that age in an early period of his life he was much conversant about the city os norwich in june    0 he was instituted to the rectory of blaxhall in suffolk where his relations resided this preferment he resigned in      where he took the degree of doctor in physic is not ascertained but from his prior attachment to physic his known opposition to the doctrine of transubstantiation and the resignation of his living in the beginning of marys reign it may be fairly conjectured that he did not take his degrees in that faculty till after that period and probably abroad aster this we find him removed to the city of durham where he practiced physic and became possessed of property in the saltpans near tinmouth castle on the death of his patron sir thomas hilton he removed to london where he became a member of the college of physicians and acquired reputation as a physician and a man of learning this event took place about the year    0 he had the misfortune to lose great part of his library with his manuscript upon healthful medicines by shipwreck and after this disaster met with most unjust and malevolent treatment from a brother of sir thomas hilton by whom he was accused of having murdered his late patron who died in fact of a malignant fever and although his innocence was fully manifested yet his enemy persisting further in his persecution found means to throw him into prison for debt where he wrote a great part of his medical treatises he died jan        he appears to have been much attached to the principles of the reformation bishop tanner says he was a man of acute judgment and true piety  i am not acquainted with any print of dr turner of dr bulleyn there is a profile with a long beard before his government of health and a whole length of him in wood prefixed to the bulwark of defense which book is a collection of most of his works he was an ancestor of the late dr stukely who in      was at the expense of having a small head of him engraved  the part of his works which has the nearest connection with my subject is in his bulwark of defense in fol       it is entitled a book of simples being an herbal in the form of a dialogue at the end of which are the cuts of some plants in wood in this piece he observes that tormentil in pastures prevents the rot in sheep and adds that the fact was confirmed by the shepherds in sundry parts of norfolk in his enumeration of the virtues of simples from other authors he does not fail to record his own experience on the power of several in removing severe diseases of the effects of dittander calamus aromaticus the daisy and others he adduces particular instances it were to be wished that succeeding observations had confirmed his representation his travels and the great attention he had paid to the native productions of his own country had given him a comprehensive view of the natural fertility of the soil and climate of england which from the tenor of his writings seems to have been at that time by some people much depreciated he opposes this idea with patriotic zeal and concern and alleges various examples to prove that we had excellent apples pears plums cherries and hops of our own growth before the importation of these articles into england by the london and kentish gardeners but that the culture of them had been greatly neglected he endeavors to confirm the natural fertility of the land from the memorable instance of the sea pease on the beach near orford and aldborough by an immense crop of which the poor were preserved in a time of dearth in the year      of which see further accounts in johnsons gerard p    0 parkinsons  theater p  0 0 and lobels illustrationes p      to conclude dr bulleyns specific knowledge of botany seems to have been but slender his zeal for the promotion of the useful arts of gardening the general culture of the land and the commercial interests of the kingdom deserved the highest praise and for the information he has left of these affairs in his own time posterity owe him acknowledgments  although the progress of gardening does not enter into my plan yet i am tempted in this place to remark that notwithstanding culinary herbs and roots and many fruits are said to have been imported in the reign of henry the eighth from holland and france and that the true era of improvement in this art cannot be carried at the most remote time beyond the same reign yet it may justly be doubted whether it was then in so low a state as has been usually represented with other arts in its progression westwards that of horticulture must be supposed to have reached the low countries and france before england and a general and prior superiority to our neighbors may be granted and that a fashion and a too great fondness for rarities of foreign growth might influence the london market of which the spirit of commerce would not fail to take advantage must likewise be admitted but to the arguments and proofs alleged by dr bulleyn in defense of the fertility of his native soil and the perfection of our own products and as a proof of the successful cultivation of those times i add that from an inspection of our old herbals and particularly of parkinsons paradisus we find the various species of culinary herbs roots and of fruits multiplied in england to such a variety as implies a preceding course of culture carried on for a series of time inconsistent with that poverty of produce which has been surmised  penny having introduced to the reader the two first respectable writers on botany in england i cannot but regret my want of sufficient information to rescue from an almost total obscurity the name of dr thomas penny an englishman of the same age who although not an author himself was indubitably a man of great seize in the natural history and especially in the botany of his time gerard styles him a second dioscorides for his singular knowledge in plants i cannot ascertain the date of his birth it appears that he was a fellow of the royal college of physicians and that he had traveled into various parts of europe he had resided in switzerland and had visited if not made some stay in the island of majorca that he had diligently searched both the northern and southern parts of england is manifest from the variety of rare plants discovered by him and communicated to lobel and gerard he was personally known to gesner and camerarius and afterward frequently supplied them with rare plants for their respective herbaria and gardens  during his residence in switzerland he collected many plants of that country and from the confines of france he assisted gesner as appears by his observations and animadversions on that authors tables published by schmiedel from the collections of true in      in which the most honorable testimony is given to his abilities i suspect he was in switzerland at the time of gesners death and assisted wolf in arranging the plants and memorials of their deceased friend  there can be no doubt that penny and clusius were also personally acquainted they appear to have had a strict intimacy and the latter was obliged to penny for a variety of curious articles inserted in his rariores and in the exoticae dr penny brought from majorca the hypericum balearicum which clusius named myrtocistus pennaei after him as he did a gentian now the swertia perennis the same of the geranium tuberosum the cornus herbacea that beautiful native of the cheviot hills was first revealed to the curious by this industrious naturalist  dr pennys acquirements in natural history extended beyond the knowledge of plants he is one of the first englishmen whom i have met with who had studied insects there are letters witten by him to camerarius in the year      preserved in trews collections which prove his knowledge in entomology to have been extensive in that day and it is supposed by schmiedel that gesners drawings of papilios passed into the hands of penny this supposition is rendered more probable when it is recollected that the theatrum insectorum of moufet was a work begun by dr edward wooton conraae gesner and dr penny and received only the finishing hand from moufet  dr penny died in      and is said by jungerman to have left his papers to moufet and turner but in this account there is surely a very striking anachronism since turner himself died in the year       maplet john maplet master of arts of cambridge published in the year      a green forest or natural history wherein may be seen the sovereign virtues of all kinds of stones and metals herbs trees beasts fouls and fishes     leaves  o i have not seen maplets book but from the title of another work of his the dial of destiny or influence of the seven planets over all kinds of creatures here below published in      it may fairly be presumed that he was deep in the fancies of the astrologic sect  morning between the publication of turners herbal and that of lyte i find a book of which not having seen it or been able to refer to any account i can only recite the title the treasure of euonymus by peter morning with wooden cuts imprinted by john day  o       chap   lyte  anecdotes of  not an original writer in botany  his herbal a translation from clusiuss version of dodoens  small accession made to english botany by this work  lyte henry lyte esquire of an ancient family at lytescarey in somersetshire was the next after turner who published an english herbal he was born in      and became a student at oxford in the latter end of henry viii about the year      he afterward traveled and at length retired to his patrimony where as wood says by the advantage of a good foundation of literature made in the university and abroad he became a most excellent scholar in several sorts of learning he was the author of various publications of the historical kind which are enumerated in the athenae oxonienses he died at the age of    and was buried at charltonmackerel in the same county he left a son who drew up a genealogy of james i for which the king rewarded him with his picture in gold set with diamonds and the prince afterward charles i gave him also his picture in gold  although mr lyte does not rank among original writers in botany his work nevertheless seems to have been well received even the arrangement alone would instantly give it a great advantage over turners book it is professedly a translation from the french version of the dutch herbal of dodoens written by the author in      and translated by clusius in      being the first of his publications of dodoens it will be necessary to give some account but i shall defer it till i speak of gerard as the improved editions of dodoenss book were the basis of that authors work  the first edition of lytes herbal was published at antwerp it is printed in the black letter and bears the following title  a niewe herball or history of plants wherein is contained the whole discourse and perfect description of all sorts of herbs and plants their diverse and sundry kinds their strange figures fashions and shapes their names natures and operations and virtues and that not only of those which are here growyng in this our country of england but of all others also of forayne realms commonly used in physic first set forth in the doutche or almaigne tongue by that learned d rembert dodoens physician to the emperor and now first translated by  henry lyte esquyer at london by me gerard dewes       the colophon imprinted at antwerpe by me henry lo bookprinter pp      mr lyte dedicates his work to queen elizabeth and has prefixed the preface and appendix in latin from dodoens or dodonaeus the latter of these is a collection from dioscorides and cato but chiefly from pliny relating to the rise and progress of botanical and agricultural knowledge among the romans and in commendation of gardens with rules for laying them out and managing them to advantage  he has followed his original in dividing his subjects into six books and although the general arrangement is confused lyte has the merit of having introduced a particular order in each chapter or genus much superior to that of turner having divided the species description place time names nature and virtues under these several titles into distinct sections this arrangement was adopted by gerard and parkinson  lyte describes one thousand and fifty species of which eight hundred and seventy are figured the blocks are i believe the same with which clusiuss own translation was printed being as far as those extend copies from the octavo edition of fuchsius most of turners figures are found in lyte the remainder are such as had been cut for the subsequent works of dodoens and afterward embellished the pemptades of that author and gerards history the english translator added about thirty new ones among these several are in a style superior to those of clusius and gerard such are particularly the salvia aethiops the stratiotes aloides the rha or centaurea rhaponticum and others  some are original i cite only the erica tetralix of which i find no figure prior to lytes that of gerard or which is the same of clusius applied to it by johnson being certainly intended to represent another species and is accordingly referred to the mediterranea by linnaeus  the first edition of lyte is adorned with a finelycut impression in wood of dodoens in the thirtyfifth year of his age and a large engraving of mr lytes coat of arms  this first edition was undoubtedly printed at antwerp to receive the advantage of the figures the subsequent editions therefore afterward printed in england are without figures it was reprinted as ames informs us in      and in      and according to wood by ninion newton at london in      in quarto also without cuts i find editions mentioned with the dates   00 and      which if genuine and not in the title page only is a proof of its popularity and that it was not superseded by the larger work of gerard in      seguier even quotes one so late as the year       as in the interval between the publication of clusiuss french translation in      and the english version of it by lyte in      the author had at different times completed the several parts of his historiae plantarum it may be presumed that lyte profited by those works from some of the commendatory verses prefixed it should seem that dodoens himself communicated additions to lyte as i have not had an opportunity of comparing the french version of clusius with lyte i cannot notice the nature of his alterations or the extent of his additions the introduction of the english names was a necessary augmentation  in the mean time there seems to be no ground for the criticism of threlkeld who accuses lyte of having omitted the purgantium historia of dodonaeus of which lyte appears unquestionably to have introduced the most material subjects  english botany however received little or no accession from lyte himself it is not in more than about twenty instances that he has even pointed out the local situation of any rare english plants and in these instances there is scarcely one which had not been thus specifically recorded by turner and lobel before him  hence i am not able to give lyte the credit although he lived at so early a period of being the first discoverer of a single species of rare growth yet as it is but justice to suppose him well acquainted with all the common plants so a large number of these which had been unnoticed by turner or are not easily ascertained in his work will be found first announced to the english botanist in lyte i confess however that it is extremely difficult to determine in a variety of instances whether the general places of growth as mentioned in this author are inserted from his own knowledge or whether they stand as translated by him from clusius it is this doubt that has induced me not unfrequently to ascribe to gerard or johnson the first knowledge of many common plants certainly ascertained by them that occur nevertheless in lytes work  this author furnishes very few observations which tend to illustrate the state of the science between the time of turner and his own nor does he mention in more than one or two instances any of his contemporaries under the article verbascum he speaks of the pleasant garden of james champaigne the deer friend and lover of plants but without any information of his character or place of abode and under that of sweet trefoil the garden of master rich  chap   lobel  anecdotes of  of flemish extraction but lived chiefly in england  traveled with lord zouch  entitled botanist to king james  the adversaria written jointly by him and pena  lobel a learned man and well versed in the materia medica  english botany greatly augmented by him  promoters of botany and gardening mentioned by him  newton  his herbal to the bible  only a translation from lemnius  lobel matthias de lobel though not a native of britain contributed so largely to the emolument of english botany that he justly claims attention in the object of this work lobel was of flemish extraction and was born in      at lisle where his father was in the profession of the law  he informs us that at the age of sixteen he was enamoured with the love of plants and had an unconquerable desire to know the names and properties of those used in physic he studied at montpelier under the famous rondeletius during his residence there he traveled over the south of france in search of simples  at narbone he formed a connection with peter pena who was jointly concerned with him in his first work the adversaria on leaving france he extended his researches by traveling over switzerland the county of tyrol some parts of germany and italy and on his return settled as a physician at antwerp and afterward at delft he was then made physician to william prince of orange and to the states of holland on what occasion he removed into england or at what period of his life i cannot ascertain from the circumstance however of the adversaria bearing date at london in    0 it should seem to have been before that time which opinion is somewhat corroborated by his informing us that dr turner had given him long before the seeds of the sea kale  in england he obtained the patronage of lord zouch whom he attended in      in his embassy to the court of denmark this tour furnished him with further means of augmenting his knowledge in botany and through the correspondence he formed there of introducing into england several exotic rarities before that time unknown to this country he had the superintendance of a garden at hackney which he calls a physicgarden cultivated at the expense of his patron he was afterward styled botanist to king james as appears by the imprimatur to the second edition of the adversaria and by his own letter prefixed to gerards herbal whether any emolument was annexed to this title i am unable to decide he had a daughter married to a mr james coel who lived at highgate near london and it is probable from the very frequent mention that lobel makes of that place in his last work the illustrationes that he resided in the latter years of his life with his soninlaw  he died in      aged    there was a print of lobel but it is very scarce i have only seen it in the collection of the late mr gulston  the first of lobels publications and which more eminently agrees with the design of this work as it brought a large accession to english botany was the stirpium adversaria the professed intention of this work was to investigate the botany and materia medica of the ancients and particularly of dioscorides and lobel is judged to have corrected the errors of matthiolus upon that author in many instances  as pena was jointly concerned with lobel in this work it is become impossible at this time to assign to each their separate share the first edition of the adversaria dated at london    0 was dedicated to the queen this dedication was omitted in an edition printed at antwerp in      editions bearing date           are recorded but it may be doubted whether these were more than title page alterations to that of the whole adversaria which bears date london   0  by purfoot also is prefixed lobels animadversiones in rondeletii methodicam pharmaceuticam officinam containing     pages after this the title and a dedication to the professors at montpelier printed by purfoot but the succeeding first part of the adversaria is on a much better paper and in a finer type and evidently printed by plantin as far as to page   0 to which succeeds one leaf added in purfoots type containing the account of the plocamos of portland and of the barnacle the fabulous history of which he relates without wholly denying it then follows the pages being continued the second part of the adversaria now first printed by the london printer to which is annexed lobels tract on the balsams cinnamon cassia and various other matters with a small treatise on the dropsy and the elephantiasis written by his much reverenced master rondeletius  the second edition bears the following title  dilucidae simplicium medicamentorum explicationes et stirpium adversaria perfacilis

accessit matthiae de lobel in rondeletii methodicam pharmaceuticam animadversiones cum myrei paragraphis pp      reprinted at frankfort in       in the execution of this work there is exhibited i believe the first sketch rude as it is of a natural method of arrangement which however extends no farther than throwing the plants into large tribes families or orders according to the external appearance or habit of the whole plant or flower without establishing any definitions or characters the whole forms fortyfour tribes some contain the plants of one or two modern genera others many and some it must be confessed very incongruous to each other on the whole they are much superior to dodoenss divisions and sufficiently testify that the author was sensible of the want of a better arrangement than the mere alphabetic order or that formed from the supposed qualities and uses in medicine  at the head of each tribe or family he prefixes a synoptical view of all the species to be described under it his method then is to give the greek and latin name and wherever he can the name of the genus and species in german dutch french and english then the description of the plant the time of flowering the country in which it grows spontaneously and in england he points out the particular spot where some of the more rare are found mr ray however has remarked that in this respect lobel has been inaccurate or trusted too much to his memory since many have been sought for in vain in the situations he specified frequent reference is made in the margin to the figures in fuchsius matthiolus dodonaeus as far as p  00 after which this assistance is wanting lobels own figures are small and insufficient in many cases to express the habit of the plant the delineation of which was almost the extent of the efforts of those days  lobel having carefully studied the ancients on the materia medica having traveled much and seen plants in various countries was enabled to exercise critical skill and to detect numerous errors in the dispensation of simples which he does not fail to point out his strong attachment to the study interested him powerfully in the investigation of new plants and enabled him to make large accessions to knowledge he traveled over various parts of england and discovered many vegetables before unnoticed he added to the grasses a number of new species and although his style is universally condemned as harsh and incorrect and his descriptions frequently obscure and insufficient the adversaria has on the whole great merit abounding with much curious intelligence and some new discoveries  the second part of the adversaria is but a small part of the whole it presents us with a list of one hundred and thirty species of grasses known to the author this is followed by the figures and descriptions of some new and rare kinds of the same tribe a number of new plants of the liliaceous and bulbousrooted order a copious account with a figure of the yucca lately introduced concluding with a catalogue from clusius of thirtyeight varieties of anemone  a proof of the flourishing state of the florists art in the beginning of the last century at which time it is certain from lobels book that many people were very assiduous in the cultivation of exotics  in      lobel published a book well known and much quoted since by the name of observationes sive stirpium historiae cui annexum est adversariorum volumen in fol cum iconibus  by the assistance of plantin this volume was accompanied with      figures which had been cut for the works of clusius matthiolus and dodonaeus  in      it was translated into dutch together with the adversaria and the figures augmented to the number of      the same year the icons were separately cast off on paper of the oblong form the figures amounting to      some of these impressions were accompanied with an index in seven languages which rendered it a very popular book for many years it preserves some value to this day as being the edition that linnaeus quotes throughout his works  lobel had meditated a very large work which was to have borne the title of illustrationes plantarum but he lived not to finish it some of his papers fell into the hands of parkinson and were incorporated into his theatrum a fragment of the abovementioned work was published by dr how in      which contains the descriptions of many grasses and other plants newly discovered or lately introduced of the grasses many here recorded were first discovered by lobel the preface contains some severe censures on gerard and reflections on the treatment lobel had received from booksellers all written in a style very reprehensible in a man of letters he may be justly accused of uncandid and disingenuous conduct toward gerard whom while living he had treated with the appearance of friendship and esteem and of whose abilities and zeal he had spoken in the highest terms as is manifest in various parts of the adversaria in the attestation to the catalogue of gerards garden and by the recommendatory letter prefixed to his herbal  i regret that i am not able to do more than barely enumerate the following persons who were zealous promoters of gardening and botanical knowledge in the time of lobel and liberal in their communications to him  dr james cargil of aberdeen of whom however some brief mention will be made hereafter  edward saintloo esquire of somersetshire whom he speaks of as much attached to studies of this kind  james coi of highgate soninlaw to lobel  j nasmyth surgeon to james the first  john de franqueville a merchant in london a celebrated florist and a great lover of all rare plants as well as flowers from whose care as parkinson says is sprung the greatest store that is now flourishing in this kingdom  hugh morgan apothecary to queen elizabeth of whose garden very frequent mention occurs in both parts of the adversaria and also in gerards history afterward who styles him a curious conservator of simples  william coys of stubbers in the parish of north okington in essex possessed a garden which both lobel the name of lobel was perpetuated by plumier who gave it to a plant which is a native of both the indies since denominated scaevola but the swede has preserved the name to a numerous set of plants of the syngenesious class among which rank the cardinal flowers and two english species  plumier also commemorated pena by giving his name to one of his new american plants which as it proved to be a species of polygala was transferred by the author of the sexual system to an ethiopian plant of the tetrandrous class though allied in habit to the ericae and passerinae   and gerard inform us was richly stored with exotics under his care the yucca first flowered in england in the year   0   to these must be added the wellknown names of gerard and parkinson  newton there is an herbal to the bible said to be written by thomas newton and printed in       o this author after having practiced physic became a divine and schoolmaster at ilford in essex where he died in   0  his book i believe is only a translation of levini lemnii explicatia similitudinum quae in bibliis ex herbis et arboribus sumuntur lemnius who was a physician in the province of zealand briefly describes the plants of the holy scriptures and produces a number of curious philological observations respecting the uses of plants in ceremonial and sacred rites he also wrote a memorable work de miraculis occultis naturae the singular property of madder in coloring red the bones of animals that are fed with it appears to have been known to lemnius but whether he learnt it from mizaldus or the latter from him i know not his book was among the earliest productions in its way and seems to have been well received as may be judged by its passing through twelve or thirteen editions from its first publication in      to       i conceive this thomas newton to have been the writer of those commendatory lines prefixed to lytes herbal in which after complimenting the author for his judicious selection of useful knowledge from former writers he has versified in less than two pages the names of more than two hundred worthies in medical science from the earliest antiquity to his own times  chap   account of dodoens and his pemptades as introductory to the herbal of gerard  circumstances of the times favorable to gerard  account of gerard  the catalogue of his garden  account of his herbal a popular work for more than a century  contemporary botanists hesketh  garet the correspondent of clusius  let and others  gerard lobels writings howsoever esteemed by the learned having never been translated into english could not become popular and at the conclusion of the sixteenth century turners book was probably no less obsolete than lytes was imperfect these circumstances conspiring with the growing taste of the times for gardening it may be presumed incited gerard to undertake his herbal a work which maintained its credit and esteem for more than a century and pleasing as it is to reflect on the rapid progress and improvement of botany within the last half century yet there are many now living who can recollect that when they were young in science there was no better source of botanical intelligence in the english tongue than the herbals of gerard and parkinson  it has been observed that the early edition of dodoenss book as translated by clusius had been the basis of lytes herbal and as the last edition of the same author became the foundation of gerards this circumstance renders it not unsuitable here to take some notice of an author although a foreigner to whom he owed so much of that credit which has preserved his memory to the present times  rembert dodoens or dodonaeus was born in      near mechlin in flanders he became conspicuous for his various erudition when young was physician for some time to the emperor maximilian and his son rodolph ii the importunity of his friends procured his dismission from the emperors service and he settled at antwerp was afterward professor at leyden and died in      he wrote on astronomy geography and physic but is remembered now principally by his botanical works his attachment to this study and the opportunities he enjoyed of gratifying it enabled him to turn it to the most advantageous purposes he began to publish in      and continued his accessions and improvements to the year      when he collected all his writings on this subject into one volume under the following title stirpium historiae pemptades sex sive libri xxx ant ex officin plant in folio cum icon      pp     each pemptade is divided into five books  the  st comprehends a number of dissimilar plants in alphabetic order    flowergarden plants and the umbelliferous tribe    medicinal roots purgative plants climbing and poisonous plants ferns mosses and fungi    grain pulse grasses water and marsh plants    edible plants gourd plants esculent roots oleraceous thistles and spinose plants    shrubs and trees  it was reprinted in      and      with some small additions and being translated also into dutch with great enlargement became a popular book in that language  the judicious selection of all that was useful relating to the supposed plants of the materia medica of dioscorides and of the arabians the introduction of all the new species from clusius and other discoveries of the time added to the instruction and embellishment derived from the figures which exceeded in number those of any preceding author rendered dodoenss book useful to the medical profession throughout the world it still preserves some value as being referred to by linnaeus for the illustration of the european plants  as gerard could not attempt an entire new work there was then extant no other to which he could give the preference as a basis to his design for as such only it must be considered since the interval of time between the publication of dodonaeuss work in      and the printing of his own herbal had given him opportunities to intersperse large additions both in exotic and indigenous botany in this interval the science had been augmented and not less enriched by the writings of caesalpinus in      by the epitome of camerarius in      by the historia lugdunensis of dalechamp in      by the sylva harcynia of thalius and especially by the historia and icones of tabernaemontanus in      and    0  to these may be added a number of collateral resources which the growing commerce and spirit of the times rendered favorable to his purposes i will briefly mention the following the materia medica had for a series of years been perpetually augmenting by a variety of new drugs which were eagerly sought after the origin of which notwithstanding was in many instances obscure and in others as yet unknown at length the publication of garcias ab horto on the simples of the east indies of monardes on those of the west and afterward of christopher a costas book satisfied for a time the impatience of the public  these authors were translated into english james frampton a merchant of london who had resided long at seville from whence he returned in      translated monardes into english the next year under the title of joyful news out of the new found world from the spanish of monardus in  o clusius put garcias ab horto into latin in      and james garet had also translated from the spanish the work of a costa these books were incentives to curiosity and the thousand novelties which were brought into england by our circumnavigators raleigh and cavendish in    0 and      excited a degree of attention which at this day cannot without the aid of considerable recollection be easily conceived raleigh himself appears to have possessed a larger share of taste for the curious productions of nature than was common to the seafaring adventurers of that period and posterity will rank these voyagers among the greatest benefactors to this kingdom in having been the means if tradition may be credited of introducing the most useful root that providence has held forth for the service of man a voyage round the globe howsoever familiarized in ours was in that age a most interesting and fruitful occasion of enquiry  the return of raleigh and the fame of his manifold discoveries and collections brought over from the continent the celebrated clusius then in the   th year of his age he who added more to the stock of botany in his day than all his contemporaries united visited england for the third time to partake at this critical juncture in the general gratification  at this eventful period gerard was in the vigor of life and without doubt felt the influence and reaped the advantage of all the circumstances i have enumerated  john gerard was born at nantwich in cheshire in the year      and was educated a surgeon he removed to london where he obtained the patronage of the great lord burleigh who was himself a lover of plants and had the best collection in his garden of any nobleman in the kingdom gerard had the superintendance of this fine garden and retained his employment as he tells us himself for twenty years he lived in holborn where also he had a large physic garden of his own which was probably the first of the kind in england for the number and variety of its productions it should seem that in his younger days he had taken a voyage into the baltic since he mentions having seen the wild pines growing about narva  gerard appears also to have been favored by the college of physicians and is highly extolled by dr bulleyn both lobel and dr brown physician to the queen wrote in latin commendatory letters to him on the publication of his herbal he attained to such eminence in his profession as to be chosen master of the company he died about the year   0   there is a half sheet print of gerard prefixed to his own edition of the herbal done in the   d year of his age and a small oval one at the bottom of a full half sheet frontispiece before johnsons edition  the earliest publication of gerard was the list of his own garden in holborn under the following title  catalogus arborum fruticum ac plantarum tam indigenarum quam exoticarum in horto johannis gerardi civis ac chirurgi londinensis nascentium impensis j norton       o and again in       the first edition was dedicated to lord burleigh but that nobleman dying before the publication of the second it was inscribed to his patron sir walter raleigh  this little piece from the nature of the publication is become very scarce i believe there is only a manuscript copy of it in the collection of sir joseph banks  we are informed in the life of dr bulleyn that gerards garden contained near eleven hundred sorts of plants of foreign and domestic growth from whence says mr oldys it may appear that our ground would produce other fruits besides hips and haws acorns and pignuts for at this time kitchengarden wares were imported from holland and fruits from france there are one thousand and thirtythree species in this catalogue and the following attestation written by lobel is annexed   herbas stirpes frutices suffrutices et arbusculas hoc catalogo recensitas quamplurimas ac fere omnes me vidisse londini in horto johanni gerardi chirurgi et botanici peroptimi non enim omnes eodem sed variis temporibus anni pullulascunt enascuntur et florent attestor matthias de lobell ipsis calendis junii       in      came out his herbal or general history of plants printed by john norton in folio and some authors mention another impression in       that the foundation of this work was a translation of dodoenss herbal a comparison of the two ascertains beyond a doubt lobel both in his animadversions on rondeletius and in his stirpium illustrationes informs us that dr priest at the expense of mr norton had been engaged to make a translation of dodonaeuss pemptades and dying soon after he had finished it the manuscript came into gerards hands who has been censured for having endeavored to conceal his possessing these papers and for assuming to himself the merit of the translation when it is generally agreed that his knowledge of the latin language was not equal to such an undertaking lobel indeed judged the same of dr priest and points out instances of his insufficiency it must however be allowed that gerard is not backward in confessing his want of skill in the learned languages lobel farther informs us that when the work was in the press and that part of the first book printed relating to grasses his friend james garet a person eminently skilled in flowers and exotics admonished norton of some gross errors on which the printer engaged lobel to superintend the work that he actually did correct it in a thousand places and that there were many other mistakes which gerard would not allow him to alter alleging that it was sufficiently correct and that lobel had forgotten the english language  in order further to conceal his plagiarism lobel adds that he has inverted the distribution of the chapters in dodoenss book and adopted that of the adversaria this may be considered as a futile objection and even turned into an approbation of lobels method but he charges him also with largely plundering the adversaria without any acknowledgment  gerard comprises the whole vegetable kingdom in three books the first contains the grasses grain rushes reeds flags and bulbousrooted plants the second all herbs used in diet physic or for ornament and pleasure the third trees shrubs fruitbearing plants rosins gums roses heaths mosses mushrooms and sea plants the whole divided into upwards of eight hundred chapters which in the arrangement of that time may if the expression is allowable be considered as so many genera  in each chapter the several species are described then follow the place time of flowering names and virtues  the figures mr norton procured from frankfort being the same blocks which had been used for the dutch herbal of tabernaemontanus in      in this manner gerard with dodoens for his foundation by taking in also many plants from clusius and from lobel by the addition of some from his own stock published a volume which from its being well timed from its comprehending almost the whole of the subjects then known by being written in english and ornamented with a more numerous set of figures than had ever accompanied any work of the kind in this kingdom obtained great repute to this we must add the fortunate circumstance of its acquiring afterward so learned an editor as johnson which established the character of it and gave it precedence as a popular book for more than a century and notwithstanding his manifest inferiority to lobel in point of learning it must yet be owned that gerard contributed greatly to bring forward the knowledge of plants in england his connection with the great and his situation in london favored an extensive correspondence both with foreigners and his own countrymen and his success in procuring new exotics as well as scarce indigenous plants was equal to his diligence and assiduity in fact we owe to gerard and his friends the discovery of many new english plants and his name will be remembered by botanists with esteem when the utility of his herbal is superseded that he was considered as possessing a very extensive share of this science we are justified in believing on the testimony of mr george baker chief surgeon to the queen who assures us that he saw him tried with one of the best strangers that ever came into england and was accounted in paris the only man being recommended to me says baker by that famous man ambrose parey and he being here was desirous to go abroad with some of our herbarists for the which i was the mean to bring them together and one whole day we spent therein searching the rarest simples but when it came to the trial my frenchman did not know one to his four plumier gave the name gerardia to a plant of the didynamous class discovered in thetropical regions of america to which linnaeus has since added five species   among the many who promoted gerards work by their communications i must not omit the names of thomas hesketh of lancashire thomas edwards apothecary at exeter both skilled in the knowledge of english plants  james garet of london apothecary a curious searcher of simples he was the correspondent of clusius to whom he communicated a great number of natural curiosities particularly of exotic growth and is mentioned with great respect by that learned foreigner in numerous places of his libri exoticorum he seems to have been one of the principal cultivators of tulips which he propagated by seeds and bulbs for twenty years every season bringing forth as gerard observes new plants of sundry colors not before seen all which to describe particularly were to roll sisiphuss stone or number the sands  i find three persons of the same name james garet the father and james the son and peter as i suppose the brother of james the elder parkinson speaking probably of the last informs us that he was originally a druggist in limestreet he was i believe the translator of a costa as has been before noted  mr bredwell practitioner in physic a learned and diligent searcher of simples in the west of england  mr nicholas let a merchant of london greatly in love with rare and fair flowers for which he does carefully send into syria having a servant there at aleppo and in many other countries for which myself and the whole land are much bound unto him  dr john mershe of cambridge  mr james cole a merchant of london a lover of plants and very skilful in the knowledge of them  among those of eminent station who patronised the science gerard does due honor to sir walter raleigh lord edward zouch the patron of lobel who brought plants and seeds with him from constantinople and to lord hunsdon lord high chamberlain of england who he says is worthy of triple honor for his care in getting as also for his curious keeping such rare and strange things from the farthest parts of the world  chap  0 johnson the improver of gerards book  anecdotes of  his iter in agrum cantianum the first english local catalogue  enters into the kings army and is killed at the siege of basing  his edition of gerard  mercurius botanicus  version of pareys works  contemporary assistants  goodyer  bowls  tunstal  glyn  morgan  johnson thomas johnson was born at selby in yorkshire and bred an apothecary in london he afterward kept a shop on snowhill where by his unwearied pains advanced with good natural parts says mr wood he attained to be the best herbalist of his age in england  he was first announced to the public by a small piece under the title of iter in agrum cantianum      et ericetum hamstedianum      which were the first local catalogues published in england he soon after acquired great credit by his new edition and emendation of gerards herbal  in the civil wars his zeal for the royal cause led him into the army in which he greatly distinguished himself and the university of oxford in consideration of his merit and learning added to that of his loyalty conferred upon him the degree of doctor of physic may         in the army he had the rank of lieutenant colonel to sir marmaduke rawdon governor of basinghouse mr granger informs us that he set fire to the grange near that fortress which consisted of twenty houses and killed and burnt about three hundred of sir william wallers men wounded five hundred more and took arms ammunition and provisions from the enemy wood adds that going with a party on the   th of september      to succor certain of the forces belonging to that house which went to the town of basing to fetch provisions thence but beaten back by the enemy headed by that notorious rebel colonel richard norton he received a shot in the shoulder of which he died in a fortnight after at which time his worth did justly challenge funeral tears being then no less eminent in the garrison for his valor and conduct as a soldier than famous through the kingdom for his excellency as an herbalist and physician  i have mentioned johnsons iter cantianum and ericetum hamstedianum but not having seen either i can give no account of them  in      he published his improved edition of gerard under the title of the herbal or general history of plants gathered by john gerard of london very much enlarged and amended by thomas johnson citizen and apothecary of london for islip and norton      fol and again      pp    0  an interval of thirtysix years from the date of gerards work had effected a great change in the state of botanical knowledge many new plants had been introduced and many valuable works published on the continent particularly the hortus eystettensis in      and the prodromus of bauhine in    0 no publications had appeared at home except such as were adapted to the florist and gardener gaspar bauhines invaluable pinax had facilitated and shortened the labor of consulting preceding authors all these circumstances were favorable to johnson and his acknowledged superiority to gerard in the learned languages might justly raise the expectation of the public insomuch that it becomes a matter of speculation why johnson acquiesced in the character of an editor only it may indeed be converted into a strong presumption of the value set by the public on gerard which probably prevented the risk of a new title  the general expectation was not disappointed the advantages above noted enabled johnson to amplify and improve his author to such a degree that his book eminently deserves the encomium that haller has bestowed upon it when he calls it  dignum opus et totius rei herbariae eo aevo notae compendium  after what has been said of the plan as it stands in gerard it remains only to show briefly what johnson has done in about twelve pages he has prefixed a concise candid and judicious account of the most material writers on the subject from the earliest ages to the time in which he wrote concluding with a particular account of his own work from its origin in dr priests translation after this follows a table pointing out with great precision all his additions by which we learn that he enriched the work with more than eight hundred plants not in gerard and upwards of seven hundred figures besides innumerable corrections by procuring the same cuts that gerard used to which collection a considerable accession had been made and by having some new blocks cut his work contained a greater number of figures than any herbal extant the whole amounting to      he informs us in an apology he makes for not inserting his additional matter in the edition of      that he intended to travel throughout the kingdom in search of the more rare plants and afterward to comprise all his discoveries in an appendix  in      he published mercurius botanicus sive plantarum gratia suscepti itineris anno      descriptio cum earum nominibus latinis et anglicis land  vo pp     it is dedicated to sir theodore mayerne and others of the college in his own and the names of his associates in the excursion who were all of the company of the apothecaries it was the result of a journey through oxford to bath and bristol and back by southampton the isle of wight and guildford made with the professed design to investigate rare plants he has described in not inelegant latin their rout which took up only twelve days and the agreeable reception they met with among their medical acquaintance we meet with a list of exotics amounting to     cultivated by mr george gibbs a surgeon at bath who had made a voyage to virginia from whence he brought many new plants which as it exhibits the advanced state of gardening in this country at that time is now a matter of curiosity  the plants of spontaneous growth enumerated in this short tour varieties being excluded exceed six hundred which at a time when the cryptogamiae were scarcely noticed and in the season when neither the very early nor late plants could be seen is no inconsiderable number in this catalogue are several not discovered in england before with this tour johnson gave his small tract  de thermis bathonicis sive earum descriptio vires utendi tempus modus etc land      pp    there are three small plans of the baths and one of the city which seem to be copied from speeds map these are now pleasing curiosities to the lovers of antiquity and to all who contemplate the astonishing increase of the city since that time  this was followed by pars altera sive plantarum gratia suscepti itineris in cambriam seu walliam descriptio land       o  johnson if not the first was among the earliest botanists who visited wales and snowdon with the sole intention of discovering the rarities of that country in the vegetable kingdom the journey seems to have answered his purpose and afforded him a rich harvest in this expedition he first found the yellow poppy papaver cambricum mountain sawwort serratula alpina roseroot rhodiola rosea and several other plants  i cannot ascertain the age of johnson at his death but there is reason to think he could not be far advanced in life if indeed he was arrived at the meridian of it i ground my opinion on the circumstance of lobels total silence relating to him in his adversaria printed in   0  engaged as johnson was in the exercise of a profession which independent of the calls of duty demands much sacrifice of time to the forms and civilities of life his herbal is an ample testimony of zeal and industry i do not find that he was the author of any other publications than those of which i have given some account but he translated the works of ambrose parey which he published at london in      they were reprinted if i mistake not for the last time in      this excellent man who in the character of surgeon successively served four sovereigns of france was attached to the protestant cause and for his extraordinary merit and his having cured charles ix of a tendon wounded in bleeding was saved from the massacre of st bartholomew he survived this event    years and died in    0 his works were collected by himself in      in folio and ran through nine or ten editions on the continent pareys improvements in his profession had been singularly important there can be no doubt therefore that our author performed a very acceptable service to his countrymen by putting his writings into an english dress miller consecrated the name of johnson by assigning it to a berrybearing shrub of carolina belonging to the tetrandrous class first figured by plukenet tab     f   and since by catesby vol   tab    the english botanists who must consider johnson as entitled to so honorable a distinction among their worthies will regret that his name should not be retained in the linnaean system in preference to callicarpa by which term this shrub is now well known in the english gardens   before johnson is dismissed it would be unjust not to notice some of those to whom the author was especially indebted for assistance and for the communication of english plants among these the first place is due to mr john goodyer of maple durham in hampshire whose name occurs repeatedly in gerards herbal and very frequently in parkinsons in which he is styled a great lover and curious searcher of plants who besides this speaking of the geranium saxatile has found in our country many other plants not imagined to grow in our land he seems not only to have been what may be called a practical botanist but learned and critically versed in the history of the science this may be fairly inferred from his curious communication relating to the manuscripts under the name of apuleius madaurensis and from his observations on the saxifrage of the ancients inserted at p  0  the great number of rare english plants which mr goodyer first brought to light entitles him to the most reputable rank among those who have advanced the botanical knowledge of this kingdom  mr george bowls of chisselhurst in kent also distinguished himself by his successful investigation of many new plants he spent some time in wales where his discoveries were very ample and he is mentioned with particular attention in numerous instances by our author  the names of johnsons associates in his kentish and other simpling excursions occur in the preface and in the body of the work we meet also with the following  john tradescant the elder who became famous afterward for his fine garden and museum of natural curiosities  sir john tunstal gentleman usher to the queen is recorded as possessing a garden at edgcome in surrey stored with plants which are said to have belonged to the queen  mr thomas glyn who first found that elegant plant the gnaphalium marinum on the coast of wales  mr hugh morgan apothecary to the queen before mentioned under the article of lobel  mr robert abbot of hatfield near st albans a learned preacher and an excellent and diligent herbarist  boelius or boel of whom further notice more properly comes under the article of parkinson  mr john redman a skilful herbarist an inhabitant of the northern part of england  frequent and respectable notice is also taken of mr john parkinson the subject of the succeeding article his paradisus terrestris is much commended and his garden referred to as abounding in choice plants  chap    parkinson  brief account of his life  his paradisus the best view of the state of the flower garden in that age  theatrum botanicum a more original and labored performance than gerards herbal  its merit not sufficiently acknowledged by his successors  boel and other contemporaries of parkinson  parkinson john parkinson was born in      i regret that i am not enabled to supply a more ample account of this laborious man whose learning and abilities appear to me not to have been justly appreciated he was bred an apothecary and lived in london he was contemporary with gerard and lobel during the latter part of their lives and survived johnson several years lobel in the second part of his adversaria and johnson in his gerardus emaculatus speak of him as a man of eminence in his profession and as possessed of a garden well stored with rarities in fact he rose to such a degree of reputation as to be appointed apothecary to king james and at the publication of his theater of plants he obtained as we learn by sir theodore mayernes commendatory letter prefixed to it the title from charles the first of botanicus regius primarius the time of his death i cannot ascertain but as his herbal was published in    0 and he appears to be living at that time he must have attained his   d year there is a print of him prefixed to his paradisus in the   d year of his age and a small oval one in the title of his herbal or theater of plants  his first publication was the paradisi in sole paradisus terrestris or a garden of all sorts of pleasant flowers which our english air will permit to be nursed up with a kitchen garden of all manner of herbs roots and fruits for meat or sause used with us and an orchard of all sort of fruitbearing trees and shrubbes fit for our land together with the right ordering planting and preserving of them and their uses and virtues collected by john parkinson apothecary of london      folio pp      there was a second edition published after the authors death corrected and enlarged in       as the subject of this book interests the florist and gardener merely it comes less within the scope of this work than his herbal it is dedicated to queen elizabeth and agreeably to the panegyrical custom of the times is set off with recommendatory verses among which we meet with some in latin from thomas johnson doubtless the editor of gerard and a latin letter in a high strain of eulogy from sir theodore mayerne  the plants are arranged without any other order than that expressed in the title page garden flowers are divided into     chapters according to the generical names of the time kitchen plants into    chapters fruit trees and shrubs into    chapters and a corollary of    species nearly one thousand plants are separately described of which seven hundred and eighty are figured on one hundred and nine tables which appear to have been cut on purpose for this work many are copied from clusius and lobel the figures are less commendable for the design than the execution and are much inferior on the whole to those of gerards herbal in the latin names the author has made use principally of casper bauhine some are taken from lobel the mode of arrangement in each chapter is similar to that of gerard after the description of all the species follow the place time of flowering synonyms and virtues less is spoken of the culture than seems to be requisite  several englishmen had written on gardening and agriculture in the sixteenth century of whom the first on husbandry as far as i can find was antony fitzherbert a famous lawyer and justice of the kings bench whose book of husbandry was printed first in      one of the earliest if not the first on gardening is thomas hill his profitable art of gardening printed in      the next was the new orchard and garden by william lawson in      in   00 sir hugh platt the author of many other useful tracts put forth his garden of eden a book of great merit in its time all these passed through numerous editions and the last preserved credit to the end of the century  parkinson however as i apprehend was the first author who separately described and figured the subjects of the flower garden the paradisus terrestris is therefore at this time a valuable curiosity as exhibiting the most complete view of the extent of the english garden at the beginning of the last century intertropical productions had been but sparingly imported the real stove plants are very rare throughout the book there are some american species and particularly from virginia as being a part of that continent with which england had the most frequent intercourse but the principal productions of the english gardens were exotic european and grecian plants some asiatic and a few from the northern coasts of africa  a modern florist wholly unacquainted with the state of the art at the time parkinson wrote would perhaps be surprised to find that his predecessors could enumerate besides sixteen described as distinct species one hundred and twenty varieties of the tulip sixty anemonies more than ninety of the narcissus tribe fifty hyacinths fifty carnations twenty pinks thirty crocuses and above forty of the iris genus in the orchard we find above sixty kinds of plums as many apples and pears thirty cherries and more than twenty peaches  in    0 parkinson published his theatrum botanicum or theater of plants or an herbal of a large extent containing therein a more ample and exact history and declaration of the physical herbs and plants that are in other authors increased by the access of many hundreds of new rare and strange plants from all the parts of the world with sundry gummes and other physical materials than has been hitherto published by any before and a most large demonstration of their nature and virtues showing withal the many errors differences and oversights of sundry authors that have formerly written of them and a certain confidence or most probable conjecture of the true and genuine herbs and plants distributed into sundry classes or tribes for the more easy knowledge of the many herbs of one nature and property with the chief notes of dr lobel dr bonham and others inserted therein london folio pp      seguier mentions and edition in      which i never saw and suspect it was not a new impression  this work was the labor of parkinsons life and was not published until he was arrived at a very advanced period he tells us in the preface that owing to the disastrous times and other impediments the printing of it was long retarded originally it was intended to have contained only the medicinal herbs under the title of a physical garden of simples but he enlarged his plan and endeavored to comprehend all the botany of his time it is manifest even from a cursory view of it that it is a work of much more originality than that of gerard and it contains abundantly more matter than the last edition of that author with all johnsons augmentations in the general disposition of the subject the order is chiefly founded on the known or supposed qualities and virtues of the plants being divided into seventeen tribes as follow   plantae odoratoe sweet smelling plants   catharticae purging plants   venenatae narcoticae nocivae et alexipharmicae venomous sleepy and hurtful plants and their counterpoisons   saxifragae saxifrages or breakstone plants   vulnerariae wound herbs   resrigerantes et intubaceae cooling and succorylike herbs   calidae et acres hot and sharpbiting plants   umbelliferae umbelliferous   cardui et spinosae thistles and thorny plants  0 filices et herbae capillares ferns and capillary herbs    legumina pulses    cerealia corn    gramina junci arundines grasses rushes and reeds    paludosae aquaticae marinae musci et fungi marsh water and sea plants mosses and mushrooms    miscellaneae the unordered tribe    arbores et frutices trees and shrubbes    exoticae et peregrinae outlandish plants    appendix   this heterogeneous classification which seems to be founded on that of dodoens sometimes on the medicinal qualities sometimes on the habit and on the place of growth shows the small advances that had been made toward any truly scientific distribution on the contrary both gerard johnson and parkinson had rather gone back by not sufficiently pursuing the example of lobel  in the particular disposition of the subjects under each chapter or genus parkinson follows the rules of gerard and johnson by giving after the latin and english name the descriptions at large then the place of growth and time of flowering the synonyms and lastly the virtues and uses  nice discrimination of species from each other or from varieties must not be expected in this work more than in gerard or his emaculator almost every botanist was then a florist too clusius himself who had enlarged the science by his own discoveries beyond any other man continued to raise tulips from seed for more than    years parkinsons  paradisus proves his attachment to the flower garden in the early part of his life and this bias influenced him throughout the theater of plants as yet no line had been drawn with sufficient accuracy between species and variety between nature and the effect of culture or of soil and situation nor was this brought about till the essential parts of vegetables the flower and the fruit became objects of classification instead of the vague distinctions hitherto observed of which it may be sufficient to adduce one example out of hundreds equally futile the sea cabbage brassica orientalis a siliquose plant is ranked by gerard and johnson as well as by parkinson even contrary to the examples of clusius and dodonaeus under the same generical name with the through wax bupleurum an umbelliferous plant merely because the leaf is of the persoliate kind  these are defects common to the age and parkinson must not be appreciated by modern improvement but by comparison with his contemporaries in this view if i am not mistaken he will appear more of an original author than gerard or johnson independent of the advantages he might derive from being posterior to them his  theater was carried on through a long series of years and he profited by the works of some late authors which though equally in johnsons power he had neglected to use parkinsons descriptions in many instances appear to be new he is more particular in pointing out the places of growth in the enumeration of the synonyms he has not only given nearly the whole of bauhines  pinax but very frequently has himself consulted the original authors and enters minutely into a discussion of their doubts in the account of the virtues and uses parkinson is diffuse it was his professed design to make his work a materia medica and if in him we meet with the qualities of plants estimated on galenical principles by the degrees of hot and cold moist and dry etc it was the theory os the day from which authors of higher eminence were not emancipated he not only gives the opinions of the greek and roman physicians but of the arabians and has translated from the moderns and his contemporaries whatever could illustrate his subject and render it as perfect as the intelligence of the times would allow to this end he has extracted largely from clusiuss exotics from dacosta monardes and garcias ab horto on the drugs and simples of the east and west indies of which at that time many were newly introduced and imperfectly known  parkinsons work is much more extensive than johnsons in the number of subjects described he having taken as before observed advantages which the emaculator of gerard neglected many of the plants of egypt from prosper alpinus many of the north american or canadian plants from cornutus and some from columnas work are introduced he neglected no opportunities of procuring new plants from abroad the nature of his profession did not allow him to make distant or frequent excursions in england but by the assistance of his correspondents and some of lobels posthumous writings which he purchased he was enabled to enlarge not only the catalogue of british plants but to introduce many exotics before unknown  johnson had described about    0 plants parkinson has near   00 these accumulations rendered the theatrum botanicum the most copious book on the subject in the english language and it may be presumed that it gained equally the approbation of medical people and of all those who were curious and inquisitive in this kind of knowledge both this work and gerards afterward acquired consequence by the references of mr ray who may be said in the language of the catalogus oxoniensis to have raised them to classical eminence in english botany and preserved them from oblivion as long as his own works remain without any design of depriving johnson of his due praise yet it is obvious from the recollection of certain circumstances that parkinson labored under disadvantages and impediments which probably tended to depress his work at the time although it had undoubtedly been carrying on through a longer series of years than johnsons and was more copious in its design  johnson had the opportunity that gerard himself obtained of procuring all the cuts from abroad parkinsons on the other hand though copied from the same figures appear to have been cut anew purposely for his work the delay occasioned by this circumstance besides the great expense was probably among the obstacles the author complains of which so long retarded the publication of his work add to this that the figures were after all inferior to the old tables both in number and execution johnsons exceed those of parkinson by more than an hundred both these works may be considered as digests of the botany of the age in the english tongue but it is to be feared the same censure lies against them which caspar bauhine lodged against dalechamps history published in      in which he demonstrated that more than  00 plants were twice described  nor is it wonderful that the attempt to comprehend and discriminate the whole vegetable kingdom was a plan too extensive for one man especially in the augmented state in which parkinson found it the magnitude of the design necessarily involved a multitude of errors and exposed both gerard and parkinson to the censures of malignant critics had the candor of lobel been equal to his learning and knowledge he had spared much of his acrimony against these industrious writers whose laudable endeavors rather merited his applause  among those contemporaries whose collateral assistance is acknowledged by parkinson mr or as he is styled in some parts of the work dr william boel claims particular notice he was a native of the low countries and had traveled into various parts of germany and spain had been in barbary resided at tunis and at the publication of the herbal lived at lisbon from all these countries he sent seeds of many plants before unknown in england he was the correspondent of clusius and seems to have been very zealous for the improvement of natural knowledge  mr john gordier a great lover and curious searcher of plants who besides this speaking of the geranium lucidum has found in our country other plants not imagined to grow in our land  in parkinsons works we also find the name of mrs thomazin tunstal a lady whom he celebrates not only for her taste in cultivating a garden which was well stored with exotics but for her knowledge of english botany and her discoveries of several curious vegetables found about ingleborough hill in lancashire which were not known before to grow in england whether she was allied to sir john tunstal noticed in the account of johnson i cannot ascertain  besides the names of bowls goodyer tradescant and others mentioned by johnson we meet with the following as having contributed to

english stoves and called in jamaica the jerusalem thorn   chap    history of wooden cuts of plants  plantins accumulation of these figures  fate of gesners excellent engravings  of those to the herbals of turner gerard and parkinson  parkinsons the last of importance except salmons which were exhibited in england  first copperplates of plants  wooden cuts as we are now arrived at the period when wooden cuts were about to be superseded by engravings on metal parkinsons herbal being the last of any importance in which they were used in england it may not be incongruous to our plan to notice the origin and progress of that art which contributed not a little to facilitate the knowledge of plants rude as these representations were compared with the elegance of modern times yet in an age when specific distinctions were not fixed and the diagnostic of the plant depended so much on habit they spoke to the eye and often discriminated the subject when the labored description failed  it has been before observed that seguier is of opinion the first herbal with wooden cuts was the  buch der nature the book of nature printed at augsburgh in      if not three years earlier these are thought to have passed into the herbarius printed at mentz in      from which book was compiled the ortus sanitatis printed at the same place in      with improvements in the work in general and better figures by cuba of this work some notice has before been taken as the foundation of the english great herbal first printed here in       the hortus sanitatis was translated into various languages and in some newmodelled without concealing its origin according to the fancy of different editors and printers and passed through innumerable editions on the continent having been the popular book on the subject as the  great herbal was in england for fisty or sixty years  it does not appear that cuba was publicly known as the author of the hortus sanitatis until egenolf a bookseller of frankfort gave an improved edition with an entirely new set of figures under the care of eucharius rhodion or roeslin a physician of the same city in      egenolfs book passed through various editions until a better work was composed by dorsten under the title of  botanicon in    0 at frankfort in which the same figures were employed they were used also in the  encyclopaedia medica of j dryander in      and in the succeeding year in an edition of dioscorides by hermann ryff printed by egenolf finally adam lonicer the soninlaw of egenolf having totally reformed the work of cuba employed them in his herbal printed in      in succeeding editions he introduced new figures took others from tragus to the number in the whole of   0 and composed a work which passed through a great number of editions and was not superseded in the present century as appears by an edition printed so lately as in      and even in       we are informed by tragus that egenolf spared no expense in the encouragement of artists to procure these icons rude and imperfect as they appear to us he secured to himself by this means the monopoly of printing herbals for a succession of years and acquired both fame and riches  at length these were all superseded by those of brunsfelsius to his herbal printed in      which were drawn from nature and appear to have been the first that were worthy of notice these were however greatly excelled by fuchsius in      whose figures although only outlines are uncommonly beautiful and not less just they consist of five hundred figures in folio of the most common and useful plants and were copied in a smaller scale by many succeeding authors tragus took most of them into his history of german plants to which he added many new ones to the amount in all of     those of tragus are little more than outlines and allowing for the time they sufficiently well express the habit of most of the subjects  egenolf having set the example printers after this time themselves bore the expense of cutting the blocks by which means certain printers monopolised the printing of herbals and a kind of commerce between them and authors took place and mutual exchanges were made for the use of each others books among these no one possessed at length a greater collection than the famous plantin of antwerp who recommended himself so highly by the excellency of his types and mode of executing his works hence he became the common printer to several of the celebrated botanic writers of the sixteenth century when clusius published his french translation of dodoens with lo at antwerp he gave figures copied from fuchsius all which plantin bought he afterward acquired the figures cut for clusiuss own works and those of lobel dodonaeus besides some new blocks had the use of all the above in the  pemptades in      which work contains   00 figures tabernaemontanus obtained the use of this collection namely those of fuchsius clusius lobel and dodonaeus to which he added those of matthiolus insomuch that his herbal printed at frankfort in      comprehends more than two thousand figures dalechamp in his general history of plants printed about the same time augmented them to near two thousand seven hundred  the fate of gesners excellent figures i can but briefly mention it forms a mortifying but curious anecdote in the literary history of the science of the fifteen hundred figures left by gesner prepared for his history of plants at his death in      a large share passed into the  epitome matthioli published by camerarius in      which contained in the whole  00  figures and in the same year as also into a second edition in    0 they embellished an abridged translation of matthiolus printed under the name of the german herbal in   0  the same blocks were used by uffenbach for the herbal of castor durantes printed at frankfort this publication however comprehends only     of these icons nearly another hundred being introduced of very inferior merit after this period camerarius the younger being dead these blocks were purchased by goerlin a bookseller of ulm and next served for the  parnassus medicinalis illustratus of becher printed at that city in      the second part of which work contains all those of the  epitome except six figures in      they were taken into a german herbal made up from matthiolus by bernard verzascha printed at basil and such was the excellency of the materials and workmanship of these blocks that they were exhibited a sixth time in the  theatrum botanicum or krauterbuch of zwinger being an amended edition of verzascha printed also at basil in      with the addition of more than one hundred new blocks copied from c bauhine and tabernaemontanus and finally into a new edition of the same work so late as the year       thus did the genius and labors of gesner add dignity and ornament to the works of other men and even of some whose enmity he had experienced during his lifetime  besides the above mentioned gesner left five volumes consisting entirely of figures which after various vicissitudes became the property of true of norimberg sensible that whether we view the extent of gesners knowledge and learning or his singular industry such must be the veneration for his character that any of his remains must claim the attention of the curious the possessor gratified the public by the pen of dr schmiedel with an ample specimen published in       thus far for foreigners the rude icons of the great herbal it has been observed were evidently copied from those in the hortus sanitatis for that they were not the same tables appears from the diminished size of the figures in turners history which amount to upwards of  00 the greater part are those of fuchsiuss octavo set and the remainder nearly  00 were new lyte printed his translation of dodoens with lo at antwerp for the convenience of his figures which are also borrowed from fuchsius to which lyte added about thirty new ones  gerard in      and johnson his  emaculator afterward in      and      procured all the blocks from frankfort with which the herbal of tabernaemontanus had been illustrated johnson by this means accumulated upwards of   00 cuts  the blocks for parkinsons  theatrum and his  paradisus were i apprehend cut in england and those for the first seem to be copies from gerard though much inferior in execution the last of the kind used in england were a new set cut for salmons herbal in    0 except i believe those for a very indifferent performance under the name of an herbal published since that time in quarto  the earliest copper plates of plants on the continent are said to be those of columna in his  phytobasanos in      in england except some single figures and the few plates

procured the establishment of gardens paris in    0 leyden in      leipsic in    0 montpelier in      jena in      and oxford in the year      this last was owing to the munificence of henry earl of

bobart a german from brunswick who lived as wood tells us in the gardenhouse and died there on february        a list of the plants was published under the title of catalogus plantarum horti medici

species by which must be understood both exotic and indigenous including varieties of each the plants are barely enumerated without any synonyms or references to any author the number of english species recited extends to  00 or nearly the copiousness of this catalogue sets the zeal and diligence of bobart in a favorable light under his care and that of his son the garden of oxford continued to flourish for many years  the catalogus oxoniensis was republished in the year      in a much improved state by the joint assistance of dr stephens mr william brown and the two bobarts father and son under the following title catalogus horti botanici oxoniensis alphabetice digestus duas praeterpropter plantarum chiliadas complectens priore duplo auctior idemque elimatior nec non etymologiis

london after the restoration  merret without any notice of dr stephens expressly calls mr brown the author of this catalogue and wood says that he had the chief hand in it william brown was a native of oxsord became bachelor of divinity and senior fellow of magdalen college he died in march      aged about  0 and was buried in the outer chapel of his college  in this enlarged edition the authors have in every instance where it was possible not only adopted the specifical appellations given by gerard and parkinson to each plant but quoted the page of their works this is the first book as far as i know on the subject printed in england in which the latter of these circumstances takes place it is remarkable that so obvious an assistance after having been introduced by caspar bauhine in his  phytopinax should be wanting in the  pinax itself had gerard and parkinson retained throughout their works the exact synonyms of the authors from whom they transferred their plants and quoted the pages they would unquestionably have rendered their writings much more useful to posterity and have preserved them from disuse and oblivion for a much longer period the same may be observed of mr ray who has totally neglected this valuable improvement so novel was the practice that the authors of the hortus oxoniensis thought it necessary to apologize for it and shield themselves under the authority of the  hortus eystettensis  there are many dubious and illascertained plants in this catalogue and those marked as new are almost wholly varieties english botany seems to have received little or no accession by it and i am not aware of one indigenous plant first mentioned in this list  the second part or alphabetical list of english names is intended only to lead to the latin generical term in the first part  how until this period no attempts had been made in england to separate the indigenous from exotic botany it is true dr johnson as before mentioned had published local catalogues of the plants of certain districts but no one had essayed a general list or description of the english plants alone in the way of what is now called a flora a term which as far as i can find was first adopted by simon pauli for a catalogue of the plants of denmark published in      it is to dr how that we owe the first sketch of a work of this kind and though he does not entitle his book flora he yet mentions that term in his preface  william how was born in london in the year      and educated at merchant tailors school he became a commoner of st johns college oxford at eighteen he took his bachelors degree in      and that of master of arts in      and entered on the physical line it does not appear that he ever took his doctors degree though he was commonly called dr how with many other scholars of that time he entered into the kings army and for his loyalty was promoted to the rank of captain in a troop of horse upon the decline of the royal cause he prosecuted his studies in physic and practiced in that faculty he lived first in st lawrence lane and afterward in milk street he died about the beginning of september      and was buried by the grave of his mother in st margarets church westminster leaving behind him as mr wood says a choice library of books of his faculty and the character of a noted herbalist  dr how is principal publication and for which he is here recorded bears the following title  phytologia britannica natales exhibens indigenarum stirpium sponte emergentium land    0   o pp      the plants are arranged in the alphabetical order of the latin names with one or two synonyms taken as best pleased the author from various writers on the continent as well as from gerard parkinson and lobel the place of growth to each plant is noticed and the particular spots where the rare ones grow are specified the list contains    0 plants which as few mosses and fungi are enumerated is a copious catalogue for that time even admitting the varieties which the present state of botany would reject  the author of this little volume was unquestionably a man of very considerable learning and had a strong passion for the knowledge of plants but his situation in life does not seem to have allowed him the opportunity of traveling into the various parts of england to gratify his taste in english botany with which he was not critically and extensively acquainted mr ray in the preface to his  catalogus plantarum angliae has given a list of more than thirty species in the  phytologia which have no title to a place as indigenous plants of england some of these being inhabitants of southern europe others evidently the accidental outcasts of gardens and some as certainly mistaken for other plants as appeared from the impossibility of finding them in the spots which how had pointed out  the rare plants were almost wholly communicated by his friends mr stonehouse dr bowls mr heaton mr loggins mr goodyer and others he drew some from a manuscript of dr johnson the editor of gerard i wish it were in my power to commemorate these persons in a more ample manner who at an early period contributed to extend and illustrate english botany mr stonehouse in particular has deserved highly of the lovers of this science he appears to have traveled much in england from his recording the plants discovered by him in many counties in yorkshire he was particularly conversant and i conjecture he lived at a place called darfield near barnsley in that county  dr bowls and mr goodyer are i believe the same persons mentioned under the article of johnson of mr heaton i shall take further notice in the sequel of these anecdotes  it has been observed that some of lobels papers fell into the hands of parkinson and some into dr how is possession these were the fragment of lobels great work which how published in      under the subsequent title   matthiae de lobel md botanographi regii eximii stirpium illustrationes plurimas

0  this work has been noticed under the article of lobel it is sufficient to observe here that the notes which the editor has affixed would almost persuade the reader that he had published the work with a view to take an invidious retrospect of parkinsons theater in the preface to the  phytologia and in that of this work both written in a flowery and bombast style as well as throughout the notes he speaks of parkinson in very contemptuous language and represents him as having made lobels observations his own without acknowledgment whatever may have been the case in particular instances the attack on the whole was uncandid since parkinson in the very title of his  theater professes to have made use of and inserted dr lobels notes together with those of dr bonham and others in fact there is a petulance and an acrimony in the style both of the author and of the editor of this work which howsoever exampled in the last age is happily much less frequently the language of literature in the

tradescant although it does not appear that the tradescants contributed materially to amplify what is more especially meant by english botany or the discovery and illustration of the plants spontaneously growing in england yet in a work devoted to the commemoration of botanists their name stands too high not to demand an honorable notice since they contributed at an early period by their garden and museum to raise a curiosity that was eminently useful to the progress and improvement of natural history in general  john tradescant was by birth a dutch man as we are informed by a wood on what occasion and at what period he came into england is not precisely ascertained he is said to have been for a considerable time in the service of lord treasurer salisbury and lord wooton he traveled several years and into various parts of europe as far eastward as into russia he was in a fleet that was sent against the algerines in    0 and mention is made of his collecting plants in barbary and in the isles of the mediterranean he is said to have brought the trifolium stellatum lin from the isle of fermentera and his name frequently occurs in the second edition of gerard by johnson in parkinsons theater of plants and in his garden of flowers printed in      but i conjecture that tradescant was not resident in england in the time of gerard himself or known to him  he appears however to have been established in england and his garden founded at lambeth about the year      he obtained the title of gardener to charles i tradescant was a man of extraordinary curiosity and the first in this country who made any considerable collection of the subjects of natural history he had a son of the same name who took a voyage to virginia from whence he returned with many new plants they were the means of introducing a variety of curious species into this kingdom several of which bore their name tradescants spiderwort tradescants aster are well known to this day and linnaeus has immortalized them among the botanists by making a new genus under their name of the spiderwort which had before been called ephemeron his museum called tradescants ark attracted the curiosity of the age and was much frequented by the great by whose means it was also much enlarged as appears by the list of his benefactors printed at the end of his museum tradescantianum among whom after the names of the king and queen are found those of many of the first nobility  this small volume the author entitled museum tradescantianum or a collection of rarities preserved at south lambeth near london by john tradescant        o it contains lists of his birds quadrupeds fish shells insects minerals fruits artificial and miscellaneous curiosities war instruments habits utensils coins and medals these are followed by a catalogue in english and latin of the plants of his garden and a list of his benefactors the reader may see a curious account of the remains of this garden drawn up in the year      by the late sir william watson and printed in the   th volume of the philosophical transactions prefixed to this volume were the prints of both father and son which from the circumstance of being engraved by hollar has rendered the book well known to the collectors of prints by whom most of the copies have been plundered of the impressions  in what year the elder tradescant died is not certain but his print abovementioned represents him as a man advanced in age  the son inherited the museum and bequeathed it by a deed of gift to mr ashmole who lodged in tradescants house it afterward became part of the ashmolean museum and the name of tradescant was unjustly sunk in that of ashmole john the son died in      his widow erected a curious monument in memory of the family in lambeth church yard of which a large account and engravings from a drawing of it in the pepysian library at cambridge are given by the late learned dr ducarrel in the   d volume of the philosophical transactions the name tradescantia was first applied by ruppius a german in his flora jenensis to a plant introduced into the english gardens by tradescant himself and sufficiently known by the appellation of tradescants spiderwort to which genus linnaeus has since reduced six other species   r turner culpepper and lovell the influence of astrology in physic and botany was far from being worn out in the middle of this age by the credulity and superstition of some and the dishonesty of others it still maintained its ground several physicians and other men of learning showed some bias toward it many practitioners of an inferior class and numerous empirics were still advocates for astrological influence in the preparation and application of simples  there is an herbal written by robert turner who calls himself botanologiae studiosus under the title of botanologia the british physician or the nature and virtues of english plants exactly describing such as grow naturally in the

disgraced a better pen  yet there is one author of this order whose respectability might exempt him from total oblivion robert lovells complete herbal although said to be written by him whilst a young man is of so singular a complexion as to merit notice in a work of this kind were it only to regret the misapplication of talents which demonstrate an extensive knowledge of books a wonderful industry

subjoined the place of growth the time of flowering then the name in greek and the latin officinal term there are no descriptions of the plants but the qualities and uses of each are collected from a profusion of authors and applied to all the species under each generical term the form in which the medicine should be given the authority for each carefully cited and the officinal compounds into which they enter assiduously noticed the author includes simples both of exotic and of indigenous growth  he professes to have cited near two hundred and fifty authors of which he gives the list at p

to have made a secret and considered it as a corrector of the peruvian bark  in the same year was published philobotanologia s historia vegetabilium sacra or a scriptural herbal by william westmacott  o      not having seen this volume i can give no further account of it  salmon if my readers will excuse the anachronism i am here tempted to anticipate the name of an author the complexion of whose writings renders it not improper to notice him after culpepper and lovell although in the time he lived the influence of astrology had lost still more of its power to the fastidious critic in botany it might need some apology that i introduce into these anecdotes the name of salmon well known as a multifarious writer and author of numerous publications in physic all of the empirical cast i confess however i could not pass over in total silence a writer to whom although no praise can be due as a botanist yet the commendation of industry ought not to be withheld from a man who could bestow twenty years labor in the compilation of an herbal of      pages in folio i will recite the title which will sufficiently show the nature of his work  the english herbal or history of plants

  the order of salmons book is alphabetical and as it is a work of mere compilation he professes to have consulted all the botanical authors of repute and enumerates the names of such his design was to treat on medicinal herbs principally as a botanical work it is beneath all criticism the errors in this way being enormous both in multitude and degree in detailing the powers of simples he follows the galenic terms of expression ufed by the writers of the preceding century and distributes with a lavish hand extraordinary and numerous powers to almost every herb he describes exclusive of his industry some merit is due to salmon for the regular arrangement of his subjects subordinate to his method qualities which under the direction of more skill in botany and a sounder judgment in discriminating the properties of simples might have enabled him to have executed more effectually what seems to have been his purpose that of superseding the herbals of gerard and parkinson in which he totally failed his tables i have noticed heretofore in speaking on wooden cuts but from these authors i return to writers of dignity and importance and with peculiar satisfaction to the view especially of a character from whose penetrating genius and persevering industry not botany alone but zoology may date a new era on this occasion i singularly lament that i am not furnished with any new materials to illustrate the life of ray of whom it may with truth be maintained that in these branches of natural history he became without the patronage of an alexander the aristotle of england and the linnaeus of the time  chap    retrospective view of botanical science in the period immediately antecedent to ray  a detailed account of the life and writings of ray  his catalogus cantabrigiensis  rays three first botanical tours  appendixes to the cambridge catalogue  foreign travels  fourth tour in england  elected fellow of the royal society  ray if we here take a retrospective view of the progress of botany during the first period of the seventeenth century we find that however particular individuals both in england and on the continent might have labored in its advancement it was not on the whole in a flourishing state either here or in any other part of europe from the time of the bauhines even to that of ray its progress as a science was slow the remains of john bauhine his  historia plantarum universalis printed in    0 in three large folio volumes at the expense of  0000 florins defrayed by f l a graffenreid was the principal performance on the continent and that indeed was invaluable it is a monument of learning and industry of which few examples can be expected in any one age that which gesner performed for zoology john bauhine effected in botany it is in reality a repository of all that was valuable in the ancients in his immediate predecessors and in the discoveries of his own time relating to the history of vegetables and is executed with that accuracy and critical judgment which can only be exhibited by superior talents  the obstacles to the improvement of botany were various europe had been involved in war the perpetual enemy to free intercourse among the learned and to commerce which is ever friendly to natural science simples were neglected in physic for medicines drawn from chemistry even alchymy yet employed the industry of many in every nation of europe botanical gardens although several both public and private had been established did not however flourish the indies had not yet poured in their treasures with that liberal hand which was soon after experienced even the passion of the florist for varieties assisted in depressing the genuine spirit of the botanist but the time was now approaching when botany was about to receive a capital advantage and embellishment by the introduction and establishment of system of the rise and progress of which it will not be incongruous to my plan to give a short account since this great revolution formed a new era in the history of the science as the revival of it however did not take place till the time of mr ray and dr morison i will postpone what i have to say on this subject till i have given some account of the writings of those justly celebrated naturalists by whose labors system itself was restored and improved  the earliest anecdotes of mr ray to which i can refer are some brief outlines of his life in the complete history of europe for the year   0  a more connected account of this learned and excellent man may be seen in the general dictionary and the biographia britannica but the most detailed relation is that of dr scott published in    0 from materials collected by dr derham this is well abridged in the biographical dictionary it is much to be regretted that our curiosity has not been more amply gratified than by these short and imperfect memoirs  a more circumstantial narrative of the life of mr ray would even at this distance of time be a valuable accession to biography and highly grateful to those who are sensible of the great improvements which he gave to the science of natural history in general nor could sufficient justice be done to his manifold talents discoveries and writings but by a pen of the first eminence in biographical literature  the limits of my plan will not allow of more than a general detail of the principal events of his life as connected in chronological order with his writings  john wray or as he always spelt his name after the year      ray was born at black notley near braintree in essex nov         his father though in so humble a situation as that of a blacksmith sent his son to the grammar school at braintree and in      entered him at catherine hall in cambridge from whence he removed in less than two years to trinity college where the politer sciences were more cultivated dr barrow was his fellow pupil and intimate friend and on account of their early proficiencies both were the favorites of their learned tutor dr duport he was chosen minorfellow of trinity in      in      was made greek lecturer of the college in      mathematical lecturer and in      humanity reader these appointments were sufficient testimonies of his talents and abilities at this early period he afterward passed through the offices of the college and became tutor to many gentlemen of honorable birth and seize who gave him due praise and acknowledgments for his watchful care of them he also distinguished himself while in college as a sensible and rational preacher and a sound divine as his favorite study was the works of god he laid at this time in his college lectures the foundation of his wisdom of god in the creation and of his three physicotheological discourses which were afterward so well received by the public  at the period when mr ray turned his attention to the study of nature the knowledge of plants was not highly superior to the state in which turner had found it in the same place more than a century before in this study ray could find no master i am not able to say that a single publication of a scientific nature on the subject of plants had ever appeared at cambridge for maplets green forest will scarcely be thought worthy of that appellation oxford had indeed not only experienced the benefit of private encouragement but of public munificence in the establishment of a garden but at the sister university mr ray stood alone himself indeed an host selftaught as he was and full of ardour he so forcibly displayed the utility of botanical knowledge and its intimate connection with the arts and conveniences of life independent even of those charms which the views of nature ever afford to contemplative minds that he soon made it an object of attention and numbered among his associates in these studies mr nid a senior fellow of his own college mr francis willughby and mr peter courthope the first of these gentlemen became his inseparable companion but he had the misfortune to deplore his death a little time before the publication of his first work which came out under the title of catalogus plantarum circa cantabrigiam nascentium cantab    0 pp     cum indicibus etc pp  0    o  this little volume contains all the plants which the author had observed spontaneously growing in the neighborhood of cambridge amounting to     all varieties and dubious plants excluded the number is small when compared with many modern catalogues but not so when it is recollected that at that period a very few of the cryptogamia class and not many of the graminaceous tribe had been investigated  the plants are disposed in the alphabetical order of the latin names and the synonyms of the four principal authors then in use given at length these are gerard and parkinson and the two bauhines nor are others wanting when characteristic of the plant prefixed is a list of the authors so accurately and instructively drawn up as not to have lost its utility to this day mr ray has interspersed many select observations on the medicinal and oeconomical uses of the plants on the structure of the flower on varieties and has not only described some new plants discovered by himself but given accurate distinctions of many before imperfectly known subjoined the reader finds an index of the english names preceding the latin an index specifying the particular places of the more rare plants then a copious etymology of the names and an explanation of the terms used in the science in fine he has done every thing to facilitate the labor of the student in this part as in the former to instruct and entertain the more erudite reader  i have been the more diffuse on this small volume as the author has observed nearly the same plan in his subsequent catalogues and synopsis moles parva vis magna when the time in which this publication was made and the meagre structure of preceding catalogues is considered i may safely appeal to modern judges whether this was not an extraordinary production few local catalogues had been published at home and i believe not one abroad that displayed any thing like a comparable share of science and erudition so aptly united  among the variety of notes in this catalogue there is one possibly not of public notoriety mr ray informs us that the people of norwich had long excelled in the culture and production of fine flowers and that in those days the florists held their annual feasts and crowned the best flower with a premium as at present  there can be no doubt that this volume met with the most favorable reception from the learned in this way that it promoted the study of plants and by raising the reputation of its author encouraged him to prosecute his studies with vigor  these occupations however did not divert mr ray from his object of entering into the ministry he was in dec    0 ordained both deacon and priest by dr sanderson bishop of lincoln and continued fellow of trinity college till the bartholomew act which as he did not subscribe necessarily superseded him this event took place sept          the desire mr ray had to extend his knowledge of english botany had induced him in the autumn of      to take a journey which he performed alone through the midland counties of england and the northern part of wales in search of plants this tour held him from august   to september    of this and of two other tours mr ray preserved some short memorandums in which he has noticed his daily progress some remarkable facts that occurred some observations on the antiquities that he met with and some of the rare plants dr scott has published these itineraries with his life  in his subsequent journies he was commonly accompanied by some friends of a congenial taste thus in his second tour in the autumn of      mr willughby and some other gentlemen traveled with mr ray into scotland through the counties of durham and northumberland to edinburgh glasgow and back through cumberland and westmorland this journey held six weeks from july    to august  0 in      mr ray accompanied by mr willughby took his third and most extensive english tour through the middle counties of england into cheshire thence into north wales and through the middle welsh counties into pembrokeshire coasting the southern part to bath and bristol thence to the lands end through somerset and devon returning through dorsetshire wiltshire and hampshire they were absent in this excursion from may   to july    and mr ray gathered a plentiful harvest which afterward enabled him to enrich his general catalogue of english plants then in meditation nor did he omit to avail himself of every opportunity particularly at tenby in wales and in cornwall of describing such birds and fishes as were less frequent in other parts preparatory to his intended publications in the zoological way  in      he published an appendix to the cambridge catalogue containing emendations and the addition of fortytwo plants and in      came out another appendix with the addition of sixty more not noticed before which were principally communicated by mr dent of cambridge these little tracts are become very scarce those who are curious to see what these additional plants were may find them distinguished from the others in professor martyns  plantae cantabrigienses  being now at liberty from the constraints and business of a college life he was led to accompany mr willughby mr skippon and mr nathaniel bacon two of them his pupils to the continent mr ray was absent from april         to march       during which time they visited france holland germany switzerland italy and extended their journey to sicily and to malta the fruit of this expedition will afterward appear  on his return from the continent he spent the summer of      between his friends in essex and sussex and in reading the publications which had appeared in england during the three years of his absence the winter passed in reviewing and arranging the museum of his friend and pupil mr willughby rich in animal and fossil productions in arranging his own catalogues for his general list of english vegetables and in framing the tables for dr wilkinss real or universal character  in the summer of      mr ray accompanied by his muchhonoured friend mr willughby made his fourth excursion into the distant counties they left middleton park on june    and took their route to the lands end through the counties of worcester gloucester and somerset and returned through hants to london on september    in this journey besides the pointed objects of their pursuit they took notes on the mines and smelting and on the method of making salt and mr ray did not omit to make as he had done before ample additions for his collections of proverbs and of local english words  on nov   of this year he was chosen fellow of the royal society and was prevailed on by bishop wilkins to translate his real character into latin this he performed though it was never published and the manuscript is extant in the library of the royal society the latter end of the year and the beginning of      he spent with gentlemen who had all been his pupils at trinity mr burrel and mr courthope at danny in sussex sir robert barnham at bocton in kent and with mr willughby in warwickshire in the autumn of this year he took his fifth journey alone into yorkshire and westmorland returning in september to middleton hall and spent the winter with mr willughby then lately married  chap    account of ray continued  makes experiments on the motion of the sap  catalogus plantarum angliae  sixth tour in england  decease of his friend mr willughby  and of bp wilkins  nomenclator classicus  his marriage  his observations topographical and moral etc made in his foreign travels with the catalogus stirpium exoticarum annexed  ray about this time dr tongue dr beal and some other philosophical gentlemen in england were busied in experiments relating to the motion of the sap in trees among these also in the spring of      mr ray and mr willughby entered upon a set of the like experiments and induced mr afterward dr lister to prosecute the same these experiments were made on the birch the sycamore or greater maple the alder the ash the hasel chestnut walnut and willow of which the two first were found to be the best adapted to the purpose from their bleeding most freely  the experiments of mr ray and mr willughby which were printed in the fourth volume of the philosophical transactions proved the ascent and descent as well as the lateral course of the sap but these gentlemen declined giving any decisive opinion as to a real circulation upwards by the vessels of the wood and downwards by those between the wood and the bark which was the doctrine maintained soon after this time by grew and malphigi and indeed afterward adopted by mr ray himself  this doctrine of the circulation of the sap i need scarcely remark gave way to the experiments of dr hales and others which teaches that the sap rises and falls in the same system of vessels as it is affected by the joint operations of air and warmth yet there have not been wanting ingenious men of late years also who conceiving the analogy between animals and vegetables to be greater than is usually imagined and even that plants not only live but feel have advanced it as still probable that there is a real circulation of the juices the succus communis rising from the roots and the succus proprius descending toward them whether these physiologies will yield to the prolepsis plantarum of the linnaean school time must evince  when mr ray was at chester in      he availed himself of an opportunity of viewing a young porpess and of attending the dissection of it of the anatomical structure of this animal he communicated a circumstantial account to the r s in      and it was printed in the philosophical transactions no    and     in      mr ray wrote a paper printed in the philosophical transactions no    on the subject of spontaneous generation a point of philosophy which had been much discussed and to which some among the learned were yet attached it appears from this paper that he very early rejected this doctrine and was confirmed in his opinion by the experiments of redi  we are now to reap the fruit of mr rays repeated journies into the various parts of england taken with a professed view to ascertain the loci natales of all the native plants more accurately than had yet been done to investigate the more rare and perchance to discover new ones in each of these departments he had proved successful and in this year drew up his catalogue and dedicated it to his friend and maecenas mr willughby under the following title catalogus plantarum angliae et insularum adjacentium tum indigenas tum in agris passim cultas complectens land    0 pp      o  this work is modelled after the cambridge catalogue in general as to the order of the subject except that the author has been much more sparing of the synonyms from all authors but the four classial writers gerard parkinson and the two bauhines several new plants are described in this volume and many doubtful ones discriminated with that critical accuracy which so singularly marked his pen and which had not before been seen in any english writer  hitherto the cryptogamous and graminaceous tribe had engaged but little attention and in this volume these classes do not far exceed the number registered in the cambridge catalogue the whole number of plants in this list amount to about  0 0 only this small number had been owing to the extreme caution of mr ray not to admit any varieties to hold the place of species and to exclude all others on doubtful authority how in his  phytologia has upwards of   00 and merrett in his  pinax upwards of   00 certain proofs that the authors had not sufficiently studied the nicer distinctions which guided the judgment of mr ray and as a proof it may be observed that many of their plants are to this day undiscovered sensible as mr ray was of the errors of merretts  pinax he purposely omitted quoting it as he writes to dr lister that he might avoid that censure of it which could not properly have been withheld had he given his impartial opinion of that performance  in this year he informs dr lister that he had what he thought a most liberal offer of one hundred pounds a year and all his expenses defrayed to accompany three young gentlemen abroad but he declined it although he much wished to have taken a review of the alpine plants indisposition had some share in this refusal and we find that in the next spring      he suffered much from a jaundice he was so far recovered however before july as to be able to set off on his sixth journey in which he took with him thomas willisel an unlettered man but one whose love for plants and his zeal and assiduity in collecting them merits commemoration they traveled through derbyshire yorkshire and all the northern counties as far as to berwick and back through the bishopric of durham  in the same year died to the unspeakable loss and grief of mr ray his most valuable friend francis willughby esquire on july  d in the   th year of his age the strictest intimacy had subsisted between them from the time of their being fellow collegians and it was cemented by a congeniality of taste which not unfrequently forms a stronger bond of union than the ties of blood mr willughby had imbibed very early a strong taste for the study of the animal kingdom and had made extraordinary collections for completing the history of birds and fishes in which he had ever been assisted by his friend mr ray who experienced his high attachment and confidence in being left one of his executors and charged with the education of his two sons the eldest of whom was not four years of age to this care he liberally annexed an annuity of sixty pounds per annum for life which was ever regularly paid  immediately after this melancholy event he desisted from journeying again into the western counties as he had intended and refused an invitation from dr lister to live with him at york in order to give himself up to the faithful discharge of his trust  for the use of these young gentlemen mr ray drew up in      his nomenclator classicus induced thereto by observing the multitude of errors in the names of plants and animals in the manuals of daily use this compilation had authority enough to recommend itself to subsequent writers of dictionaries and lexicons and has been reprinted several times  on november   th      he sustained in the death of bishop wilkins the loss of another of his best friends for this candid ingenious and learned man he had a sincere esteem and veneration  in the lot of human life such chasms are not easily filled up after the age of fortyfive it is however not unreasonable to conjecture that these privations added strength to his motives for domestic retirement and accelerated at least that connection he made the next year when he married margaret the daughter of mr john oakely of launton in oxfordshire they were married in the church of middleton on june the  th       in the same year mr ray gave to the public the fruit of his foreign travels under the title of observations topographical moral and physiological made in a journey through part of the low countries germany italy and france london       o pp      the great object of accompanying his three associates in this tour was the enlargement of his knowledge in natural history and particularly in the vegetable kingdom and the great number of plants observed and collected by him exceeded as he informs us his expectation not that any opportunities escaped him of describing the birds and fishes of the several countries they passed through in aid of mr willughbys plans his notes concerning those of germany were unfortunately lost the volume before us however is by no means confined to natural history mr ray treats on the manners of the people and expatiates often on the excellencies and defects of the several governments particularly of the cities on the continent and on the state of the academies and universities he does not omit to notice the antiquities that occurred and of those at rome he gives a very methodical account besides many miscellaneous remarks on various other parts of natural history he has taken occasion to make a digression which at that time must have been of a very interesting nature on the most remarkable places where petrified shells and figured fossils are found both in england and elsewhere and on the various opinions of authors relating to the origin of these bodies he freely declares his sentiments that they are the remains of onceorganized bodies in opposition to those who imagined them to be the product of what they called a plastic power he afterward confirms his positions by additional arguments recited in a letter to dr robinson see letters p      in the course of their journey he every where notices those plants that are not natives of england and gives copious catalogues of them they spent in the whole six months at geneva which gave mr ray an opportunity of informing himself largely relating to the plants of switzerland particularly those of mount saleve the dole and of mount jura he even discovered some that were unknown to the preceding botanists although these were the regions of gesner and the bauhines  the celebrated haller even ranks him among those who made large accessions to the botany of that country and gives the strongest testimony of his skill fidelity and judgment in discriminating describing and extricating the plants of that fruitful region  to the end of these observations is affixed an alphabetical list of the plants mentioned in the body of the book under the title of catalogus stirpium in exteris regionibus a nobis observatarum quae vel omnino vel parce admodum in anglia sponte proveniunt pp      in the arrangement he cites the same authors for synonyms as in his preceding catalogues and occasionally introduces observations on the qualities and uses  chap    account of mr ray continued  his various erudition  collection of english proverbs  collection of english words

of the english language had engaged much of his attention of his pursuits in this way he has left memorials which have extended his reputation beyond the sphere of natural history and made him known to the learned world in general  i refer to his collection of english proverbs and to his collection of english words the foundation of these publications was laid in his various tours through the different parts of england his proverbs were finished for the press in      but not published till      and a second edition much enlarged in      under the following title a collection of english proverbs digested into a convenient method for the speedy finding one upon occasion with short annotations whereunto are added local proverbs with their explications old proverbial rhythmes less known or exotic proverbial sentences and scottish proverbs enlarged by the addition of many hundred english and an appendix of hebrew proverbs with annotations and parallels cambridge  o pp      it has been reprinted many times and i think so lately as in the year       to collect these sententious maxims of knowledge both of a moral prudential and even a jocular nature has not been deemed unworthy employment by men of eminent learning and intelligence the adagies of erasmus furnish a sufficient example of the estimation he gave them they were an oral and traditionary kind of didactics which bore a greater value before the diffusion of knowledge by the use of printing and in oriental countries are still a favorite and usual mode of instruction  of such as have been handed down in britain from father to son through numerous generations mr rays collection contains an ample store it is i believe the principal in its way and the author has interspersed many notes which illustrate the origin and sense of these aphoristic lessons and throw no small light on the manners and customs of various people  in      was published his collection of english words not generally used with their significations and original in two alphabetical catalogues one of the northern and the other of the southern counties to which is added an account of the preparing and refining such metals and minerals as are gotten in england london   o  this little volume is dedicated to his friend mr courthope at whose suggestion he tells us it was undertaken and who contributed largely to augment it in the first edition was a catalogue of the english birds and fishes but this was omitted in a subsequent improved and enlarged edition in      mr ray having then projected his  synopsis animalium  this is one of those philological collections which tends to amuse and gratify general curiosity is of use not only to strangers and those who travel but to those who stay much at home while it contributes to enlarge the extent and illustrate the construction of the english tongue mr thoresby of leeds sent to mr ray a large addition to this list in the year   0  which was printed in his philosophical letters by dr derham  in      he communicated to the royal society some experiments made i believe by mr willughby accompanied with his own observations tending to ascertain the true use of the airbladder in fishes they are such as the present physiology of fishes have confirmed and were printed in the philosophical transactions no      in the year      his catalogue of english plants being out of print he gave another edition augmented with new observations and the addition of  0 species of the more perfect plants and    funguses several of these were new discoveries he here also gives the figures of the pentaphylloides fruticosa potentilla fruticosa lin and the fungus phalloides phallus impudicus lin  mr ray continued after his marriage to reside at middleton hall where his engagements at this period of his life were such as called forth all the talents of his literary abilities and demanded all his care as a faithful guardian he was employed in a double duty that of his trust to the sons of his late estimable friend and of editor to the remains of their father on the history of birds and fishes the ornithology was first published to which as it consisted of loose papers written in latin and in an undigested state mr ray gave method and supplied from his own observations a large share of valuable materials it was published under the following title ornithologiae libri tres in quibus aves omnes hactenus cognitae in methodum naturis suis convenientem redactae accurate describuntur iconibus elegantissimis et vivarum avium simillimis aeri incisis illustrantur totum opus recognovit digessit supplevit johannes raius land      fol pp  0  t    f      mr ray translated this work into english and published it with large additions in      with figures engraved at the expense of mrs willughby the execution of the figures was wholly inadequate to the merit of the work these occupations however did not prevent him from renewing a correspondence with mr oldenburgh secretary of the royal society a learned german who after having resided some time at oxford had been chosen into that office at the first establishment of the society mr ray in the year      was induced to engage at the request of the society with other distant members to furnish observations on the subjects of natural history to be read at their meetings the society notwithstanding the extreme diligence of the secretary and some few others being at this juncture rather in a languishing state  on this occasion he wrote several papers of which some were afterward printed in the philosophical transactions among those which were not published as we find by his letters were the following on the acid of ants on a fossil of the figured kind found in malta and known by the name of st pauls bastoons letters p   0 on the trochites on mushrooms on the darting of spiders on the seeds of plants and on the specific differences of plants  on the death of the mother of his friend the dowager lady willughby and the removal of his sons from under mr rays tuition he retired some time in the year      to sutton cofield about four miles distant from middleton hall where he remained till michaelmas      he then made a second removal to falkborne hall near black notley at which last place he built a house and finally settled june          mr willughbys icthyology remaining yet unpublished mr ray in      arranged the materials which had been left in a very imperfect and indigested state perhaps no one but mr ray could have fulfilled this posthumous office certainly no man so effectually since mr ray had not only himself entirely furnished mr willughby with many but even the remainder had chiefly been collected during their almost daily intercourse and whilst traveling together  he wrote the two first books himself revised methodised and enlarged the whole and sent it to the royal society the members of which contributed to furnish

death resumed with great vigor his wonted study of plants and having already acquired a reputation that justified any expectation his friends might have formed he in compliance with their wishes attached himself seriously to write a general history of plants  preparatory to this great work which he intended to arrange systematically he put forth in      his methodus plantarum enlarged and improved from the synoptical tables which he had printed in bishop wilkinss real character in      it bears the following title  methodus plantarum nova brevitatis et perspicuitatis causa synoptice in

know not mentions an edition of this work with the date of      totally separate from that of      but as that is earlier than bishop wilkinss table it is probably a mistake  the first principle of mr ray in this work is to preserve all plants together as far as possible in the natural characters arising from conformity in the fructification and in the general habit hence arose with him in common as with others too great a neglect of the flower and too much attention to the leaves he adheres to the ancient division of the vegetable kingdom into trees shrubs and herbaceous plants ranking however with the latter such as had been called suffrutices or shrubby trees he divides into nine classes accounting the last anomalous shrubs into six and herbs into fortyseven  in the progress of his improvements afterward he reduced these classes to thirtythree his method which is indeed extremely elaborate will best be seen by a view of the classes it will however be but justice to refer the account to the last edition that it may appear in the greatest perfection which he gave it  to this book mr ray has subjoined a clear concise view and a synoptical table of the system of caesalpine and gives his reasons for not adopting it although he heartily confesses his obligations to the author whom he acknowledges to be the parent of system  in      and      mr ray and dr tancred robinson exchanged several letters while the latter was on a foreign tour relating to various undetermined facts in natural history among which it had been difficult to settle the exact species of the macruse a bird allowed by the roman catholics to be eaten in lent their observations relating to this particular were published in the phil trans for      in no     it proved to be the scoter or anas nigra linnaei  we are now come to that performance which linnaeus and haller so justly style opus immensi laboris and which considered as the work of one man has perhaps been exceeded by none unless indeed by that of john bauhine who however did not live to put the finishing hand to his labor  mr ray informs us that it was at the persuasion of his friend mr willughby that he began to collect materials with a view to a general history of plants but that after the loss of his friend in      he relaxed and on hearing that dr morison was employed on a similar design from which considerable expectations were formed at length gave up his purpose on the decease of dr morison in      who left the much greater part of his work unfinished by the persuasion of his friends and particularly of mr hotton to whom it was dedicated he resumed his design and prosecuted the work with vigor we cannot sufficiently admire the wonderful assiduity and address of this great man which enabled him in four years to collect such a stock of matter as to furnish two folio volumes of near one thousand pages each it even does not appear that he had the assistance of an amanuensis in this labor which he effected however with a skill and judgment that gained him the applause of all succeeding masters in the science  this important undertaking was intended by the author to comprehend the whole botany of the age by describing separately and reducing to his own system all the plants of the bauhines and of those who had enlarged the stock by subsequent discoveries these at the publication of rays first volume were the plants of mexico from hernandez those of brasil from piso and marcgraave and of the east indies from bontius the rare plants of italy from zanoni the new plants of morison breynius and mentzel the sicilian plants of boccone but above all the vast treasure of the six first volumes of the hortus malabaricus with many from works of lesser note  after prefixing an instructive list of the writings of near an hundred botanical authors quoted by him in the body of the book and giving an explanation of terms there follows a very comprehensive account of the philosophy of vegetables in which the anatomy and physiology of plants from malphigi from grew and from his own experiments the differences of the parts of vegetables from jungius and others are explained and illustrated with that judgment and knowledge of the subject and with that conciseness and methodical accuracy which i believe had rarely if ever been equalled by preceding writers this has rendered the introduction to his history a choice compendium of all that was valuable in the science of his day nor is the information it conveys so far superseded by any subsequent discoveries as to render it even now an uninteresting tract it is not easy to refer the modern student to a more perfect view of the state of this science near the close of the last century than will here be found while the work itself exhibits the great improvement it had received since the beginning of the same period and to which the author had himself contributed in an eminent degree  the first volume was published in the year      under the following title historia plantarum generalis species hactenus editas aliasque insuper multas noviter inventas et descriptas complectens in qua agitur primo de plantis in genere earumque partibus accidentibus et differentiis deinde genera omnia tum summa tum subalterna ad species usque infimas notis suis certis et characteristicis definita methodo naturae vestigiis insistente

the subject according to his own system he has in various instances improved the classes at the head of each book or class is prefixed a synoptical table of all the chapters or genera  in the particular disposition after prefixing to each chapter the etymology of the generical name he gives the character of the genus and in the enumeration of the species quotes at length the synonyms of caspar bauhine from his  pinax and those of john bauhine gerard and parkinson from their respective histories seldom introducing others where the plant was known to any of these writers  his descriptions of the old plants are taken from the abovementioned authors they are commonly abridged however and in numberless instances amended from his own knowledge of the plants he fails not to notice from whom they are taken and has every where distinguished the british plants from the exotics he has carefully marked all such as he had not had an opportunity of inspecting himself he adds the places of growth and times of flowering and subjoins select observations from the most respectable authorities relating to the qualities and various uses of them  in the history of trees the nobler and more capital parts of the vegetable kingdom as being dignified by the variety of their uses in human economy he has extended his researches and collected with much assiduity a greater variety of interesting particulars mr ray has purposely avoided entering into nice and critical disquisitions relating to the species for besides that this would have swelled his work to an enormous bulk it was become less necessary after the descriptions given by john bauhine clusius and others so much superior to those of their predecessors and the more curious and critical examiner might be referred to these authors for ample scope to his curiosity  mr ray has described in these volumes about   00 plants including however in this number many which modern botanists have since considered as varieties  the addenda to the second volume contain several interesting catalogues such are those of zanonis history consisting of new italian swiss and milanese plants those of breynius a catalogue of the plants of virginia observed by mr banister and a compend of those of mexico from hernandez who at the expense of sixty thousand ducats had procured the paintings of   00 species which perished in a fire of the escurial  in the preface to the first volume mr ray acknowledges his obligations for assistance received from many of his friends among those who had more essentially contributed to enrich his work were sir edward hulse dr tancred robinson dr sloane and his near neighbor mr dale to these he adds in the second volume the names of william courtine esquire of the middle temple dr plukenet mr doody and mr petiver  there are copies of rays history with the date of      but i believe the title page only to be new the remaining copies of the impression by faithorne falling into the hands of smith and walford about that time foreign writers mention an edition so late as      but this i suspect to be a mistake or owing to another transfer of the copies  after the first edition of the  catalogus plantarum angliae was out of print mr ray had been exhorted by his friend dr ralph johnson to arrange the second according to system but not having sufficiently elaborated his method at that time he declined it and it came out in      in the alphabetical order  a third edition being wanted however after the publication of the history of plants he meditated throwing it into the systematic sorm and in the mean time put forth in      fasciculus stirpium britannicarum posl editum plantarum angliae catalogum observatarum land  o by this little volume a considerable accession was made to english botany several very rare mountainous or alpine plants from wales some scarce ones from cornwall sea plants new fungi mosses and grasses make their first appearance in this little catalogue  the synopsis although finished for the press soon after this  fasciculus was not published owing to the delay of the printer till    0 when it appeared under

so he now shows the same respect to thomas the only surviving son of his muchhonoured patron whom he exhorts to pursue the example of his excellent father and for whom he pours forth in the most energetic language all those ardent wishes which gratitude and respect for the memory of the father and love for the pupil could alone inspire  in the preface mr ray acknowledges the assistance he received from mr bobart superintendant of the garden at oxford mr dale his neighbor a learned and ingenious apothecary at braintree mr matthew dodsworth mr samuel doody an apothecary in london

by the same new and rare species with critical observations from dr plukenet musci and rare plants by mr doody emendations and additions by dr tancred robinson and a catalogue of thirtyfour species common both to england and jamaica communicated by dr sloane in this work mr ray has thrown the observations on the qualities and uses into the index  from this time the synopsis became the pocket companion of every english botanist it contributed not a little both to facilitate and improve the science it diffused the knowledge of system and by obliging those who wished for improvement to attend more minutely to generical characters led to a nicer discrimination of both genera and species  chap    account of rays works continued  wisdom of god manifested in the works of the creation

variis plantarum methodis  epistola ad rivinum  his persuasive to a holy life  ray to this period mr ray had appeared to the public principally as a naturalist but he now united to this character that of the theologist it is needless to say that he succeeded in this department perhaps beyond most of those who had before written on the same subject his first publication of this kind we are told was originally and in its outlines college exercises only or common places these he now wrought up and enlarged into a convenient volume and trusted it to the care of his friend dr tancred robinson who procured five hundred copies to be printed under the following title the wisdom of god manifested in the works of the creation  o      it was reprinted the next year the eleventh edition was published in      and a twelfth in      and i believe several times since and it has been translated into foreign languages these are sufficient testimonies of the esteem with which it was received by the public  it is not immediately within my plan to enlarge on this work or to determine whether the arguments a priori or a posteriori are best calculated to obtain the object of it demonstration of the being of a god  qui historiam naturae naturae etiam creatorem colit i may be allowed to observe that mr ray from that comprehensive view of nature which his mind embraced was singularly well qualified to display the manifold wonders of the creation and the wisdom of its omnipotent author and thus while his penetrating views enabled him to unfold the various economy and evolutions of nature to the greatest advantage his piety and humility give a force to his reasonings and deductions that carries with it a conviction of that great truth he so sincerely wished to inculcate  the favorable acceptance the public gave to the demonstration encouraged mr ray to publish the next year his three physicotheological discourses concerning the primitive chaos and creation of the world the general deluge its causes and effects the dissolution of the world and future conflagration  o      and           pp               it is embellished with a plate of the apamaean medal and three tables of figured fossils and is dedicated to archbishop tillotson  this work is a convincing proof of the extensive reading the various erudition and multifarious knowledge of this great and good man independent of all the theories it contains this volume exhibits such an assemblage of facts relating to the structure of this globe to the changes it has undergone and to the history of figured fossils that it may be read to advantage even in this age of advanced curiosity and knowledge in the professed object of this book even the fastidious critic who is versed in all the more modern theories down to the epochas of nature and those of m de luc and de soulavie will allow that this volume when respect is had to the time of its publication must have conveyed a large share of intelligence to those who were capable of gratification from disquisitions of this nature and that with a deference to the opinions of the day there is yet a freedom of enquiry that distinguishes the author as a friend to true philosophy and as a modest and candid enquirer after truth in those points of natural history which still continue and probably long will to be involved in great obscurity  in this year mr ray wrote some observations on the planting of maize instead of pease occasioned by a proposal of sir richard bulkley in which he says that he had found the greatest yield of pease to be twenty barrels reaped for one sown whereas from one grain of indian wheat he had calculated the produce would be upwards of  000 grains for one these observations were printed in the phil trans no  0  mr ray was not sanguine in his expectations from the culture of that grain neither have subsequent trials proved the utility of it in this climate  the botanical labors of this eminent man were now remitted at least for some time and we find that after the publication of his  history and the  synopsis his exertions were turned into another channel in which he also stood unrivalled in his day it was not botany alone that he raised from a drooping state to zoology considered as a science he might be said to have given birth in these kingdoms since except what himself and mr willughby had performed nothing of importance on the history of animals existed  topsells abridgment of gesner moffats book on insects and the short and imperfect essays of charleton in his  onomasticon and of merret in his  pinax were almost the only english writers to be consulted to assert that better helps were wanted is not to injure or to degrade those authors mr ray had been urged by his friends and particularly by dr robinson to undertake an entire fauna anglica and a history of fossils also but age and infirmities began now to oppress him and he thought himself inadequate to the attempt he lived however to perform more than his fears or his humility permitted him to hope  in      he published his synopsis methodica animalium quadrupedum et serpentini generis vulgarium notas characteristicas rariorum descriptiones integras exhibens cum historiis et observationibus anatomicis perquam curiosis praemittuntur nonnulla de animalium in genere sensu generatione divisione etc land  o pp      in this volume we see the first truly systematic arrangement of animals since the days of aristotle an arrangement which his successors in the same line have equally applauded and availed themselves of it is professedly the basis of that method by which the present eminent zoologist of this nation has chosen to convey his learned publications and by which he has not less happily diffused a taste for this science than he has successfully improved its store  in treating on animals in general introductory to his work he discusses some important questions which had not then ceased to agitate the philosophical world he controverts with extreme force of reasoning the ideas of equivocal or spontaneous generation the lewenhoekian hypothesis and that of all animals being created from eternity and only latent in an involved state i know not where the reader can see these questions discussed with equal conciseness and judgment united  mr rays distribution of animals is not wholly founded as to the grand divisions on the aristotelian distinctions though he admits many of them it is not within my plan to enter on this subject it is sufficient to observe that quadrupeds here form two great divisions as they are boofed or digitated the former as they are whole or cloven the latter as they are divided into more or fewer claws admitting also of subdivisions or genera from the number of the claws and in some from the consideration of the teeth  at the time when mr ray lived few people had acquired a taste for this kind of knowledge and commerce had not lent her friendly aid as in later times what animals came under his own inspection he has described with his accustomed accuracy from gesner and aldrovand he borrows his descriptions of others and many later discovered subjects he drew from piso and marcgraave from clusius hernandez laet and nieremberg  in the course of this work he has in various instances given the anatomical structure from dr tyson from the  parisian dissections and other works throughout the whole he has shown how intimately he was acquainted with the learning of the ancients and particularly with aristotle whom as the parent of zoological knowledge he failed not to consult on all occasions but by no means implicitly to follow in his subtleties and obscurities  on finishing the synopsis of quadrupeds mr ray immediately drew up that of the birds and fishes this was an easier task at this time since they are to be considered as compends of his preceding labors with his friend mr willughby although there were many things new in both and that of the fishes was very greatly improved as to the arrangement and method he informs us that the additions were the mexican birds from hernandez some descriptions of new species out of nieuhoff martins birds and fishes of greenland sibbalds whales sloanes jamaica birds and fishes and some from the leyden catalogue by dr robinson  in these branches of nature mr ray again appears as the parent of method the accurate brisson regards ray and willughby as the first true systematic writers on birds these works were finished in the year      or      as we learn from mr rays letters and from the testimony of his friend and neighbor mr dale yet excellent as they were so scanty was the taste for natural history at this period that the manuscripts lay unpublished in the booksellers hands till they were purchased by mr innys and prepared for the press by dr derham who added the figures and inserted mr buckleys birds from madrass and mr jagos cornish fishes they were published in      under the titles of synopsis methodica avium  o pp     t   and synopsis methodica piscium  o pp     t    in the same year      mr ray became the editor of a translation of dr rauwolfs travels this physician who was the next after belon whom the love of natural history alone led to travel into the east spent the years        in traversing syria mesopotamia palestine and egypt induced as he tells us by his desire to behold in the native places the plants of the greek and arabian physicians  his travels having been published in      in the german language had hitherto been locked up from the english reader sir hans sloane having however read them was induced in concert with capt hatton to procure a translation of them which was done by nicholas staphorst this version was put into mr rays hands to revise and correct he did more he made a choice selection from other authors who had made the same tour belon alpinus sir george wheler etc and he drew up a catalogue of the more rare plants of those countries through which rauwolf traveled and added lists of those of egypt and crete from this circumstance the book has gone by the name of rays collection of travels and it was reprinted with his own observations in      rauwolf made an  herbarium while in the east which with his european plants constituted four large volumes these became the property of queen christina and afterward by her means probably of isaac vossius who informed capt hatton that  00 l sterling had been offered for them they were purchased of his heirs by the university of leyden and the late dr frederick gronovius constructed from them an elegant and learned  flora orientalis of which he much enhanced the value by prefixing to it melchier adamss life of rauwolf with large additions of his own  the catalogus stirpium in exteris regionibus observatarum being out of print mr ray was induced to give a new edition of it with such large augmentations as to make it a new work he added from clusius from the bauhines and other authors a number of plants growing in those regions through which he passed in his tour and so many catalogues from other authors as to render it a tolerably complete list of all the european plants not natives of england as it does not immediately respect english botany it will be sufficient to recite the title page from which its scope may be understood  stirpium europaearum extra britannias nascentium sylloge quas partim observavit ipse partim a c clusii historia c bauhini prodromo et catalogo basiliensi f columnae

hispanicarum grisleii graecarum et orientalium creticarum aegyptiacarum aliique ab eodem land       o pp      in the preface to this work mr ray for the first time entered into controversy having taken occasion to throw out some strictures on the method of botany published by rivinus in    0 it is not enough interesting at this day to dwell on the nature of it it is sufficient to observe that our veteran in science was dissatisfied with the german for throwing the trees promiscuously into the classes with other plants and for breaking into the natural orders for the sake of agreement in the flower alone in fact rivinuss method being founded wholly on the flower to which part ray had paid but small regard the sources of controversy were endless since the fundamental principles of each were totally irreconcilable  about this time mr ray communicated the provincial catalogues of plants printed at the end of each county in the edition of cambdens britannia published in      by mr gibson his repeated travels throughout most parts of england for the sole purpose of investigating the subjects of nature had enabled him to accomplish more than had been done by any man before his time and his unquestionable skill and accuracy added an authenticity to these lists which could not easily have been derived from any other hand  to the county of cornwall mr ray added many other particulars which however were not printed probably because the corresponding circumstances could not be procured from other counties these were catalogues of the sea fish and sea fowl with the synonyms some account of two or three sorts of stone dug there of sea sand as manure an account of the hurlers and other stones and notices respecting the manners and language of the inhabitants  such as are conversant with that science which was the favorite object of mr ray must be sensible that nothing could have happened more conducive to the revival and improvement of it at this juncture than the circumstance of its having been taken up by a man of such patient industry capable at the same time of giving it all the embellishments and advantages that learning could afford they will readily grant that his writings and example alone added more vigor and brought more disciples to this school of natural science in england than all the exertions of foregoing writers  i cannot confirm and illustrate the truth of this position more effectually than by calling to the attention of the curious in this kind of knowledge the vast augmentation it acquired in the interval between the publication of mr rays  catalogus plantarum angliae and that of the  synopsis and more especially between the time of the first and second edition of the latter work during which exclusive of the discovery of many subjects among what were called the more perfect plants a new and very extensive field had been opened by exciting attention to the less perfect as they were then accounted and minuter kinds of vegetables the fungi fuci musci and algae known now by the name of cryptogamiae during the first of these periods   0 species had been added to the english flora and the accession in the last exceeded that number  in no part of europe had the same progress been made in the investigation of these hitherto muchneglected subjects as in england during the period above mentioned this is sufficiently evinced by comparing the second edition of the synopsis with the contemporary writings of foreign botanists  this second edition of the synopsis was printed in       o pp     mr ray himself had but a small share in the augmentations that were made to this edition his advancing years and infirmities prevented him from making excursions his principal auxiliaries are mentioned in the preface in which additional to the names in the former synopsis we meet with those of mr edward llhwyd walter moyle esquire and mr william vernon fellow of st peters college cambridge  to those who are sensible of the obligations which the science owes to mr ray it cannot but be grateful to read with what satisfaction the good man records in this preface the progress he had lived to see his favorite study make in his own country and with what delight he augurs and contemplates its future improvement in the space of little more than twenty years and under his own pen he had seen the english flora acquire an accession of upwards of  00 new subjects the catalogus plantarum angliae of    0 containing about  0 0 and the second edition of the synopsis in      full   00 species and notwithstanding these have not all stood the test of the discriminating character of the present age yet in justice to this great man and his associates it must be acknowledged that the retrenchments are comparatively few  with this edition of the synopsis was published the dissertatio de variis plantarum methodis brevis in which mr ray shows that the separation of plants into classes and genera from the fructification alone must be a very gradual and progressive affair that it was not easy to exclude the habit from having a share in this distribution since there were many plants that were seldom or never seen in flower by the early botanists he also observes that numberless plants which agree in the structure of the flower differ materially in habit and others vice versa and although his own method is principally founded on the fruit yet he freely acknowledges its imperfections but thinks the same objections hold against the flower which he illustrates by showing in tourneforts system the uncertainty of the bounds between the flores infundibuliformes hypocrateriformes and the caryophyllei if mr ray paid less regard to the flower than its importance seemed to demand it seems rather to have arisen from the principles of his method than from his want of opportunities of examination owing to his distance from botanical gardens as was alleged by his opponents a circumstance however which he very feelingly laments in the preface to his methodus and elsewhere  to this is annexed epistola de methodo plantarum viri clarissimi d a q rivini ad raium cum ejusdem responsoria in qua d jos pitton tournefortii m d elementa botanica tanguntur  on the method of rivinus mr ray as was before noticed had thrown out some strictures in the preface to his  sylloge which drew from that author the answer here published and mr rays reply in which our author takes occasion also to defend his method from the objections of tournefort who had been unbecomingly severe in some animadversions made in the  elements of botany published in      tournefort however afterward did ample justice to the merits of our author  the modern botanist sees that all these controversies are become too little interesting to dwell upon at this time the principles of the corollistae and the fructistae as linnaeus styles them can never be assimilated and all attempts to reduce the whole vegetable kingdom into natural classes have hitherto failed  in      he wrote some observations on the poisonous effects of a root eaten instead of parsneps supposed to have been that of the hemlock but of which mr ray had some doubt alleging that it was more probably the cicutaria vulgaris chaerophyllum sylvestre lin see phil trans no     in no     he communicated remarks on the poisonous effects of the oenanthe crocata too fatally confirmed by later mistakes of the same kind  in the year   00 mr ray published a persuasive to a holy life from the happiness which attends it both in this world and in the world to come land  o reprinted in      pp     he tells us it was drawn up at the request of his friend mr edmund elys and that it is composed on the model of bishop wilkinss treatise on natural religion it is wholly of a moral and practical nature written in a plain but forcible and argumentative style and is entirely destitute of any of those enthusiastic or mystical opinions which so highly tinctured the writings of many divines of the last century on the contrary mr ray ever consistent and rational although he deduces his principal motives to the practice of virtue as conducive to happiness even in this life from the precepts of christianity yet does not disdain particularly in treating on pleasure on riches and the advantages of temperance to enforce his arguments by opinions and apophthegms from the writings of the philosophers and moralists of ancient greece and rome  chap  0 account of ray continued  improved edition of the methodus plantarum  outlines of rays system  third volume of the historia plantarum  methodus insectorum  his death and character  ray the peaceable mind of mr ray could not delight in the contentious field of controversy on the contrary he regretted the occasions that drew him into it yet were they not without use since they unquestionably stimulated him to purify and correct his own methodus this he effected in the year school although at this time much declined in his health being afflicted with ulcers of the lower extremities the pain of which rendered his nights frequently sleepless and wholly prevented him from making excursions to london as he much desired to examine the gardens and herbaria of the curious  so small however was the demand for books in this science at the entrance of this century that the london booksellers were unwilling to risk the printing of it and it was finally sent to holland and printed at amsterdam under the care of dr hotton the botanical professor at leyden who supervised the press and procured   00 copies to be thrown off under the title of methodus plantarum emendata et aucta accedit methodus graminum juncorum et cyperorum specialis  o pp  0    0  dr hotton gave a further sanction to the system of his friend he taught it in his lectures to the pupils of that university and informed mr ray of the good acceptance it met with on the continent particularly in italy this volume was reprinted at amsterdam in    0 and at tubingen in       in the preface he recapitulates his own progress in the formation of his system and dates it from the tables drawn up in      for the use of bishop wilkins he very justly reprehends dr morison for affecting to have formed his method entirely from his own observations without acknowledging the smallest aid from former writers briefly recites his objections to the methods of rivinus tournefort and herman and defends his own he establishes some axioms to be observed in framing a system of botany in fact mr rays method though he assumes the fruit as the foundation is an elaborate attempt for that time to fix natural classes he establishes it as a rule that no plant is to be separated from its tribe for a single note of difference but that all are to be assimilated as far as habit will allow the characters of the genera are however highly incongruous they are taken from vague principles such as the shape of the leaf color of the flower taste smell and sometimes from the size of the plant and other as unstable distinctions  in this amended edition mr ray still adheres to the ancient division into trees and herbaceous plants having dropped the distinction of shrubs preserved in the first edition here all herbaceous and shrubbystalked plants are divided into twentyfive genera or classes as follow   submarinae   fungi in the first methodus these two classes were formed into one class or synoptical table   musci   capillares   apetalae before in two tables   planipetalae lactescentes   discoideae

at this time the consideration of mr rays method is a matter of mere curiosity yet in justice to this great man it must be remarked that his system though less artificial than that of caesalpine is much more highly elaborated than that of morison and though mr ray must have taken infinite pains with it yet is it difficult in practice since the bases of the classes are not uniform of the thirtythree however twelve are nearly composed of natural orders such are the following fungi musci capillares planipetalae umbelliferae stellatae asperifoliae verticillatae pomiferae siliquosae leguminosae culmiferae   the remaining classes are combined of subjects less connected by habit and structure and are therefore subject to more arbitrary rules drawn from the consideration of some one or more parts in the fructifition  in the methodus graminum juncorum et cyperorum specialis annexed to this book mr rays distribution rests principally on what may be called the habit of the fructification all those genera which in the linnaean system are known by the names of phalaris alopecurus dactylis agrostis aia poa briza etc being called gramen simply with the epithets of the old authors annexed expressive of the mode of bearing the parts of the fructification whether in spikes or panicles as gramen triticeum gramen loliaceum typhinum gramen paniculatum miliaceum etc in this conspectus however all the species are introduced to the amount of two hundred  sixteen years had now elapsed since the publication of his history of plants in which interval botany had assumed a new face and experienced a much greater revolution and accession than had ever taken place before system had been studied and in some measure established both at home and abroad an incredible number of new plants had been introduced from all parts of the world and cultivated with extreme care in the gardens of europe in the mean time these circumstances had given rise to a great number of valuable publications the remaining six volumes of that inestimable work the hortus malabaricus had appeared breynius herman tournefort plumier plukenet boccone commeline bobart cupani volkamer and rivinus had enriched botany with valuable performances these large augmentations to the science induced mr ray notwithstanding his advanced years and ill health to attempt a collection of these scattered materials in order to form a supplemental volume to his history and his industry enabled him to effect his purpose additional to the assistances derived from all these printed works he had access by the favor of sir hans sloane to the ms of his history of jamaica plants of which the  prodromus had been published in      with liberty to select what he thought proper to his design  from the same gentleman he enjoyed the benefit of an herbarium of several hundred new and undescribed plants collected in maryland by mr vernon and mr kreig who had made a voyage thither for the sole purpose of gratifying their taste in botany mr petiver freely communicated his stores at that time very ample though afterward abundantly more so and dr sherard engaged besides supplying more than a thousand species himself to take the trouble of inspecting the whole work before it went to the press and of making such corrections and additions as he judged proper  it was the last of his works published in his lifetime and came out in   0  with the following title  historiae plantarum tomus tertius qui est supplementum duorum praecedentium species omnes vel omissas vel post volumina illa evulgata editas praeter innumeras fere novas et indictas ab amicis communicatas complectens cum synonymis necessariis et usibus in cibo medicina et mechanicis land folio pp     and the  dendrologia pp     app pp      the distribution is the same as that of the two former volumes in a compilation of this kind collected from so numerous a set of authors and in many instances from dried and imperfect specimens there must necessarily arise a multitude of repetitions the author was sufficiently aware of this but it was unavoidable in this volume there are upwards of    00 plants enumerated  the appendix contains several catalogues which must have been interesting to the curious at that time father camel a learned jesuit of manila who had not only described but delineated a great number of the plants of luzone transmitted his work to mr ray and it forms an extensive part of this appendix it must have been much regretted that the rev father had not been furnished with books to have enabled him to adapt the synonyms since there are few instances in which any other names occur than the spanish and the indigenous appellations of the natives and malays  mr ray then gives a list of tourneforts oriental discoveries from the  corollarium those of dampier from new holland and elsewhere and of martenss greenland plants of commelines rare exotics a copious catalogue of chinese madrass and african plants communicated by mr petiver of which those from madrass had been collected by mr brown a surgeon at that settlement and lastly a list of the new or hitherto very imperfectly described species contained in mr petivers hortus siccus amounting to upwards of  00  an advertisement had been printed at the end of the first volume of mr rays history in      inviting to a subscription for a set of figures to the work and it was proposed that those belonging to each tribe or class should be published in regular succession but it did not succeed the scheme was again revived while the supplement was printing and among other of mr rays friends dr compton bishop of london had given his patronage and strongly recommended it conferences were held with dr sherard sir hans sloane dr robinson and mr petiver relating to it but it was relinquished as impracticable  mr rays infirmities were very pressing upon him during the later years of his life in a letter written in the spring of   0  he informs mr derham that he had not been half a mile from his own house for four years yet under these circumstances he wrote his supplemental volume to his history of plants which he says had engrossed almost his whole time for two years  we have now brought mr rays botanical works to a conclusion but his labors did not cease here his active and indefatigable mind prompted him at the age of seventyfive to begin a work on insects to which he had been encouraged by dr derham and for which he had been accumulating materials during many years this was intended to comprehend only the english species although at the same time his friends were wishing to engage him to describe the exotics of the london musea which were then beginning to abound in these subjects  he had paid some attention to the history of spiders indeed many years before when intimately connected with dr lister but the greater part of his work was drawn up from his own actual descriptions and partly from mr willughbys papers and the contributions of friends mr petiver mr dandridge dr sloane mr morton and mr stonefleet  he tells us that in the later years of his life he had discovered  00 kinds of papilios diurnal and nocturnal and knew there were many more the beetles he observes were as numerous and the flies not less so i mention these circumstances to prove the extensive knowledge of nature which this extraordinary man possessed at an era when he stood so nearly alone in these branches of science he did not live to finish this work it was published by dr derham in    0 in  o pp      i believe mr ray was the first who gave to these minuter animals a real and scientific distribution he had drawn up a short methodus insectorum which was published the year after his death of the history itself it is sufficient to say that it bears all the characters of that accurate discriminating and systematic genius which guided him in all his researches in the field of nature and that it is every where quoted by the eminent swede with the highest commendations for the faithful descriptions it contains  mr rays infirmities and afflictions painful and grievous as they were did not we are told prevent him from prosecuting his studies till within about three months before his death which event took place on jan      0    he died at black notley and was buried as dr derham says according to his own desire in the church of that parish the writers of the general dictionary in the mean time inform us that although the rector of the parish offered him a place of interment in the chancel of the church yet he modestly refused it choosing rather to be buried in the churchyard with his ancestors where a monument was erected to him as dr derham relates at the charge of some of his friends with a latin inscription which may be seen in the general dictionary and in mr scotts remains and of which i insert a copy below the inscription on mr rays monument eruditissimi viri johannis raii ma

to the epitaph is added on the table of the east side what follows hoc cenotaphium olim in coemeterio sub dio positum inclementis coeli injuriis obliteratum et tantum non collapsum refecit et sub tectum transposuit j leg md xvi kal aprilis ad        on the west side j ray not    nov      ob    jan   0        as mr ray did not inherit any paternal estate and had often refused preferment his circumstances could never have been affluent and the legacy of mr willughby is said to have been the greatest part of what he enjoyed his own estate whatever that might be he settled on his wife he had four daughters three of whom survived him he left a small legacy to the poor of his own parish and five pounds to trinity college in cambridge to purchase books for the library there all his collections of natural curiosities he bestowed on his friend and neighbor mr samuel dale author of the pharmacologia to whom they were delivered about a week before his death  mr rays posthumous papers were entrusted by his widow to the care of dr derham who after publishing the historia insectorum selected a number of his letters and printed them in      under the title of philosophical letters between the learned mr ray and several of his correspondents natives and foreigners  o pp      this collection contains     letters of which sixtyeight were written by mr ray himself among his correspondents the most frequent were dr lister sir philip skippon dr tancred robinson sir hans sloane mr llwyd mr jessop mr johnson and mr oldenburgh the first of mr rays letters bears date in      the last in   0   the correspondence of learned and scientific men seldom fails to be a welcome present to those of similar literature and pursuits for besides the personal interest we take in their concerns they commonly delineate in the most faithful colors the characters of the writers frequently ascertain discoveries and enable their successors to trace the progress of knowledge in a more interesting manner than by historical detail  as the general subject of these letters is natural history so botany bears a prevailing portion besides numberless critical observations that occur on particular species we meet with a long catalogue of the rare plants of the north of england by mr lawson dr plukenets observations on the first edition of the  synopsis those of dr preston on various british plants a paper of thomas willisels specifying the different kinds of trees on which in his travels he had seen the misseltoe growing and a list of such exotics as were thought rare at that time in the chelsea garden and at fulham  there is moreover among these letters an interesting paper written by mr ray himself in answer to the question what number of plants there are in the world in which he discusses the difficulty or impossibility of gaining satisfaction on this point arising from the want of sufficient bounds between species and variety he communicated to the royal society some remarks on this head which were printed by dr birch in the third volume of the history of the royal society  dr derham meditated writing the life of mr ray but he appears not to have fully executed his plan his papers however were published by mr scott in    0 under the title of select remains of the learned john ray  o pp     to these are annexed three of the itineraries which constitute the greater part of the book they are evidently short notes only never intended for the public eye some of mr rays devotional pieces accompany this collection and three letters to dr derham with a latin letter of advice and instructions to his pupils the mr willughbys  there is said to be still extant a manuscript of mr rays under the title of  catalogus plantarum domesticarum quae aluntur catabrigiae in hortis academicorum et oppidanorum in this he chiefly makes use of the synonyma of the two bauhines and of gerard and parkinson  mr ray had the singular happiness of devoting fifty years of his life to the cultivation of the sciences he loved incited by the most ardent genius which overcame innumerable difficulties and discouragements his labors were in the end crowned with a success before almost unequalled he totally reformed the studies of botany and zoology he raised them to the dignity of a science and placed them in an advantageous point of view and by his own investigations added more real improvement to them in england than any of his predecessors  he invented and defined many terms expressive of ideas before unknown to the naturalists of england and introduced many others from writers of the best note as he wrote latin in great purity and with great facility he gave his subjects all the embellishments that learning could bestow and his extensive erudition and knowledge of philosophy at large enabled him to add many collateral ornaments and useful observations with an aptitude and judgment that has been much applauded  the extent of his improvements in science procured him the admiration of his contemporaries and have justly transmitted his name to posterity among those who have done honor to their age and country even learned foreigners have been eloquent in his praise french writers have styled him the  english tournefort an eulogy that sufficiently evinced the high opinion they had of his merit and the late eminent haller not only attributes to ray the merit of improving and elevating botanical knowledge but from his life dates a new era in the records of the science  but mr rays enquiries were not limited to natural knowledge his foreign travels and his itineraries prove that antiquities polity government and legislation attracted a share of his regard as his philological books are evidences of his attention to language and of his desire to improve and illustrate his native tongue  to all these endowments he joined an unremitting industry and perseverance in the prosecution of his studies and what marks a fortitude of mind as uncommon as it is enviable his assiduity seemed to strengthen with his age and to bid a defiance to the encroachments of infirmity and the prospect of dissolution i call to witness the magnitude of the attempt and successful issue of his exertions in writing the supplemental volume to his history of plants and in beginning the  historia insectorum at so late a period of his life  his singular modesty affability and communicative disposition secured to him the esteem of all who knew him and his eminent talents as a naturalist and a philosopher procured him many patrons and friends and preserved him from that obscurity which would otherwise probably have been his lot for notwithstanding his learning and probity as his principles did not accord with those of the times they were adverse to his fortune and he gained no emoluments in the church he had relinquished his fellowship at the commencement of the bartholomew act not as some imagined from his having taken the solemn league and covenant for that he never did and often declared that he ever thought it an unlawful oath but because he could not declare agreeably to the terms of the act that the oath was not binding on those who had taken it hence too his constant refusal of preferment afterward occasioned him to be ranked by many among the nonconformists although he lived and died in the communion of the church of england he had seen with deep regret the disorders of the commonwealth and the usurpation and afterward not less the threatening aspect of the reign of james ii  his strong attachment to the principles of civil and religious liberty is manifested by his animated style in the preface to his  synopsis where he expresses in glowing terms his joy and gratitude for having lived to see those blessings established by the revolution  the character of mr ray cannot be contemplated by those who have a true relish for the studies of nature without a high sentiment of respect and gratitude nor by those who consider the exemplariness of his life as a man and his qualifications as a divine without veneration  there are two engraved portraits of mr ray prefixed to his works both from a painting by faithorne one by w elder before his sylloge in      which seems to have been copied for the methodus emendata in   0  and the other by virtue in      prefixed to the physicotheological discourses in both these he is represented as mr ames describes it in an oval frame with hair whiskers band and canonical habit these engravings represent mr ray in the latter stage of his life in dedicating plants to the worthies of botanical science the name of ray challenged a dignified place and the liberalminded foreigner whose name has before occurred on these occasions forgot not so just a tribute plumier called a new plant of the dioecious class which bears the habit of bryony and is nearly allied to the yams which he first discovered in the isle of domingo by the name of janraja in honor of our illustrious countryman linnaeus who had comparatively few opportunities of correcting plumier established the genus but more aptly changed it to rajania and enumerates three species he could not adopt the still more analogous term of raia since it had long been preoccupied in the animal kingdom and it had been justly constituted an axiom by the fundamenta botanica no   0 not to form in the vegetable kingdom any generical terms synonymous to such as were employed in zoology or mineralogy   chap    poetical botanists  cowley  account of his poems on plants  not deeply versed in the botany of his time  intimate knowledge of natural history necessary to accomplish the poet of nature  cowley in all times from virgil and aemilius macer of the augustan age from the spurious macer and strabus the monk of st gall in the twelfth century to modern times the beauties of flowers and the virtues of plants have been celebrated in verse marcus naevianus first a physician and then a priest of flanders sung the qualities of plants in his  poemation of      and thuanus the great historian amused himself with praising the violet and the lily in meter in our own country in      george knowles described  00 plants of the materia medica in latin verse and didactically applied them to their uses in medicine  but to proceed that england and france in the same age might not want their botanical laureats cowley in the one and rapin in the other arose to celebrate this theme  cowley after having found reasons for studying physic considering botany as we are told by his late eminent biographer as necessary to a physician retired into kent to gather plants  here he wrote before the restoration his two first books on plants although they were not published till the year      the remaining four were added in the edition of      and the whole were republished with other poems in       o pp      in the first book he celebrates the powers of various medicinal herbs more especially of those which gave ampler scope to his muse from ancient renown of their virtue and were yet in frequent use and high esteem such were betony wormwood water lily misseltoe and various others  in the second he invokes the goddesses luna lucina jana and mena and sings the praises of simples appropriated to the diseases of the sex in which both ancient superstition and modern belief supplied his muse with exuberant sources of gratification  in the third flora calls forth all his powers in the narcissus the anemone the violet and the tulip with a variety of other ornaments of the parterre from the coronary tribe  in the fourth a more numerous set of the subordinate embellishments of the garden are recorded in various measure among which the attributes of the moly the lily poppy sunflower saffron and amaranth attract his muse with more than ordinary attention  in the fifth he celebrates in heroic measure the gifts of pomona from the native products of england to the date of the east and the tuna of the west terminating his poem with near two hundred lines on columbus on the spaniards on the new continent and in expressing his hopes that to the devastations of conquest will soon succeed peace religion arts and science  in the last he displays the sylvan scene from the oak of boscobel to the lowly juniper and having constituted his druidical monarch the sovereign of the forest he makes him the oracle for a train of reflections on the usurpation the exile of charles the second his restoration and the dutch war  his poems are accompanied by notes illustrating the etymology the names synonyms descriptions faculties and uses of the plants confirmed by authorities drawn from classical botanical and medical writers of these he professes in his preface that pliny among the ancients and fernelius among the moderns have been his chief resources of botanical authors gerard and parkinson are sparingly mentioned and they are the principal of that class  great eminence in science is seldom attainable unless its foundation be laid in a devotedness of mind to its object in the early scene of life cowley did not enter on the study of physic till the middle age of man and then as is probable not with interested views toward practice hence it may fairly be presumed that he satisfied himself with moderate acquisition what was true of the whole may by fair analogy be applicable to a particular branch of it he had doubtless that portion of knowledge in the materia medica of plants which may be considered as adequate to the usual demand  but that cowley in his retirement should obtain an extensive and critical knowledge of botany as it stood as a science even in his day could not be expected his fervid genius could scarcely stoop to that patient investigation of nature by which alone it could be acquired neither do the text nor the notes manifest sufficient proof of his intimate acquaintance with those authors of true same among the moderns through whose assistance the want of that information might in some measure have been supplied  nevertheless as in the language of dr johnson botany in the mind of cowley turned into poetry to those who are alike enamoured with the charms of both the poems of cowley must yield delight since his fertile imagination has adorned his subject with all the beautiful allusions that ancient poets and mythologists could supply and even the fancies of the modern signatores of baptista porta crollius and their disciples who saw the virtues of plants in the physiognomy or agreement in color or external forms with the parts of the human body assisted to embellish his verse nor did he fail by these elegant productions to honor his subject his name and his country  i close these observations by remarking that poetry as it ever has so it ever must derive from nature some of its most pleasing scenes of entertainment in the vegetable world the most expanded imagination of poetic genius will even without the aid of fiction so emphatically styled the soul of poetry find a field sufficiently ample for the display of the brightest talents thomson witnesses this truth while in him we lament the want of that botanical knowledge without which the poet must ever be deprived of numberless sources of the most beautiful imagery and such as would add peculiar grace and the most instructive power to his muse  and although the talent of the poet has not often been united to that of the really scientific botanist there are not wanting instances of this union i might mention since the discovery of the sexes of plants the ode dedicated to camerarius and printed in his  epistola de sexu plantarum of which a translation by dr martyn when a young man may be seen in blairs botanick essays professor van royen in      published an elegant poem  de plantarum amoribus et connubiis and cuno an ingenious merchant of amsterdam in a volume of     pages described in    0 the plants of his own garden in verse for which he received the laurel from linnaeus by a new genus inscribed to his name  whilst i am now writing i have the pleasure of congratulating all those whose love of poetry is aided by a taste for botanical science on a most elegant production in our own country the beautiful display of the principles of the linnaean system in the botanic garden under the delicate analogy of the loves of the plants in which the didactic design of the author is so happily embellished by ovidian imagery as to have given that energy and ornament to the subject which has been hitherto wanting to all similar productions in the english language  chap    merret brief anecdotes of  his pinax rerum naturalium intended to supply the deficiencies of how is phytologia  assisted by willisel goodyers manuscripts  merrets other writings  his papers in the philosophical transactions  merret  christopher the son of christopher merret was born at winchcombe in gloucestershire feb         he became a student in gloucester hall in the beginning of the year      two years after which time he translated himself to oriel college and took the degree of ba in      afterward retiring again to gloucester hall he applied to the study of physic and was created doctor in that faculty in      about this time he settled in london and came into considerable practice was a fellow of the college of physicians and of the royal society he died at his house near the chapel in hatton garden in holborne near london aug         and was buried twelve feet deep in the church of st andrews holborne thus far mr wood  the publication which entitles dr merret to a place in these anecdotes is his pinax rerum naturalium britannicarum continens vegetabilia animalia et fossilia in hac insula reperta  o      pp      this is not noticed in the title as a second edition although there is one recorded by authors with the date of      however i suspect it to be a mistake as no such edition is quoted by ray he dates his book from the college of physicians and is mentioned by morison under the title of  musei herbiani custos  dr merret informs us that he undertook this work at the request of a bookseller to supply the deficiencies of how is  phytologia after that work was out of print and that it was intended to have been done jointly with dr dale whose death soon after the design was formed threw the whole into his own hands he says he had purchased  00 figures which johnson had caused to be engraved with which the work was to have been embellished why they did not appear no cause is assigned nor do i find any further notices of them dr merret though unquestionably a man of learning taste and considerable information in natural history seems to have engaged in it too late in life to admit of his making that proficiency which the design required add to this that being fixed in london and closely engaged in the practice of his profession he was rendered incapable of investigating plants in the distant parts of the kingdom he however engaged thomas willisel to travel for him and he tells us that willisel was employed by him for five successive summers his son christopher merret also made excursions for the same purpose and mr yauldon goodyer furnished him with the manuscripts of his grandfather by these assistances dr merret procured a large number of english plants and a knowledge of the loci natales nevertheless he was not possessed of that critical and intimate acquaintance with the subject which might have enabled him to distinguish with sufficient accuracy the species from varieties he ranges the plants alphabetically according to the latin names and has given few synonyms except those of gerard and parkinson to which after the example of the writers of the  hortus oxoniensis he has very commendably annexed the page he gives the general places of growth and specifies the particular spots where the rare plants are found  at the end of the catalogue is subjoined a rude disposition of vegetables into classes somewhat like that of john bauhine this he hoped to have improved against the time of a second edition which probably mr rays publications superseded then follows a brief synopsis etymologica and a useful list of the plants as they flower in each month pointing out the duration of the time dr merret has in this pinax introduced many plants as new which on subsequent examination proved to be only varieties a number of exotics evidently the accidental offspring of gardens and many that could never be met with by succeeding botanists in the places specified by him he enumerates upwards of   00 species of english plants whilst the accurate mr ray only three years afterward confines the number to  0 0 nevertheless several british plants make their first appearance in this pinax and dr merret would probably have secured his title to some others if he had not totally omitted to give descriptions of those which he introduces as new  the zoological part of this pinax is exextremely superficial consisting merely of the latin and english name with a reference to aldrovandus gesner johnston and mouffett the mineralogy is not less brief and imperfect  before the publication of this work dr merret had printed a collection of acts of parliament charters trials at law and judges opinions concerning those grants to the college of physicians  o    0 this became the basis as mr wood says of dr goodalls book printed in       in      he wrote a short view of the frauds and abuses committed by apothecaries in relation to patients and physicians  o this treatise engaged him in a controversy with the famous henry stubbe it may be presumed that all discussions of this kind howsoever well meant can have but little effect in reforming the abuses hinted at while the customary and legal constitution and polity of physic remain in the present state in great britain  in      he translated into english the art of glass how to color glass enamels lakes etc  o written by ant neri accompanied with an account of the glass dross and in      the same work was published in latin with dr merrets observations and notes equal in extent to the work itself amst   o  mr wood informs us that he also printed in one sheet  o the character of a complete physician or naturalist  dr merret was among the earliest members of the royal society after its incorporation and contributed several papers which were printed in the  philosophical transactions  he made experiments on vegetation in the year      by which he found that square sections of the bark from ash and maple whether separated on three sides only or wholly would firmly unite if tightly secured by plaster and packthread  experiments on the loss of weight which a plant of the aloe americana with eleven leaves suffered by hanging up in the kitchen for five years in the first year it lost near two ounces and an half the second upwards of three ounces decreasing afterward nearly in the same proportion it lost two of the larger leaves every year and put forth two new ones every spring from which circumstance the doctor inferred a circulation of the juice  experiments on cherrytrees that having withered fruit occasioned by the sun being admitted too suddenly upon them in march recovered by daily watering the roots  observations on the london granaries these four papers were all printed in no    in the second volume of the  transactions  in no     an account of the tinmines in cornwall mundic spar and cornish crystals  in no     an account of the art of refining in the several methods by parting by the test the almond furnace and by mercury  in no     some curious observations on the fens of lincolnshire on the animal and vegetable produce a description of boston church the encroachments of the sea and other particulars which must have rendered this paper a very interesting morsel of natural history he gives a list of several of the more rare plants growing in the fens  in no     a table of the washes called fosdyke and crosskeys in lincolnshire specifying the times of high water and safe passage over the sands  chap    morison  account of his life  his hortus blesensis in which are contained the rudiments of his system and the animadversions on the bauhines  publishes boccones plantae siculae  his distributio plantarum umbelliferarum  his great work the historia plantarum oxoniensis  outlines of his method  jacob bobart the continuator of morisons history  brief anecdotes of  morison robert morison was born at aberdeen in    0 was educated in the same university and in      took the degree of doctor in philosophy equivalent to that of ma he first applied to mathematics and was designed by his parents for the theological line but his taste for botany and physic superseded their intentions his attachment to the royal cause led him into the army and he received a dangerous wound in the head in the battle at brigg near aberdeen upon his recovery he went to paris the asylum of his countrymen here he was first employed as a tutor to the son of a counselor bizet and in the mean time assiduously applied to the study of anatomy botany and zoology in      he took the doctors degree in physic at angers he became so much distinguished by his skill in botany that at the recommendation of m robins the kings botanist he was taken into the patronage of the duke of orleans uncle to lewis xiv and appointed intendant of his fine garden at blois with a handsome salary this establishment took place in    0 and he held it until the death of the duke in    0 here we are told morison laid open to the duke his method of botany and was liberally encouraged by him to prosecute it the duke also sent him into various provinces of france to search for new plants he traveled into burgundy the lyonnois and languedoc and into britanny the coasts and isles of which he carefully investigated and by these journies enriched the garden with many rare and some new plants  it was in this situation that he became known to charles ii who in    0 on the death of his uncle the duke invited morison into england and although solicited by the treasurer fouquet on the most honorable and ample conditions to remain in france the love of his country overcame all temptations and he returned to england charles ii gave him the title of kings physician and royal professor of botany with an appointment of  00 l a year and a house as superintendant of the royal gardens he was elected fellow of the royal college of physicians and acquired much fame for his knowledge of botany in this situation he remained till the year      when having made an acquaintance with mr obadiah walker of university college with the dean of christ church and other leading men of the university he was by their interest elected botanic professor at oxford dec         and incorporated doctor of physic the day following he read his first lecture in the physic school in september    0 and then removed to the physic garden where he lectured three times a week to a considerable audience in this occupation and in conducting his great work the  historia plantarum oxoniensis he labored to the time of his death which was thought to have been occasioned by a bruise received by the pole of a coach in crossing the street nov        he died at his house in greenstreet leicester fields the next day and was buried in the church of st martins in the fields westminster  seguier seems to have placed improperly among morisons works the first edition of the  hortus blesensis which he gives as published in the year      when morison must have been only fifteen years of age this may have been a typographical error but the book in fact was the work of abel bruyner physician to the duke of orleans and was not published till      morisons first publication was a second edition of this catalogue under the following title hortus regius blesensis auctus accessit index plantarum in horto contentarum nemini scriptarum et observationes generaliores seu praeludiorum pars prior land        o  the hortus blesensis raised the authors character and contributed as the writer of his life observes to recommend him to the station he afterward held at oxford it contains the rudiments of his method of classification he professes to give a list of   0 new plants but many of them proved to be only varieties and others such as were well known before there were nevertheless some new and rare plants of exotic as well as indigenous origin the latter such as he had himself first discovered in france  in this work is also given his hallucinationes in caspari bauhini pinacem tam in digerendis quam denominandis plantis et his animadversiones in tres tomos historiae plantarum johannis bauhini a work which haller calls  invidiosum opus and which while it proves both the accuracy and diligence of the author must be confessed to be unbecomingly severe on these two illustrious writers who as they did not profess to write a system are here too rigidly tried by rules not invented when they wrote and of consequence the validity of which they could not have acknowledged  in a dialogue at the end of the  hortus blesensis morison teaches that the genera of plants should be established on characters drawn from the fruit and not on any sensible qualities or supposed medicinal virtue he also learnedly defends the doctrine that all vegetables arise from seed a proposition not universally allowed the doctrine of equivocal or spontaneous generation having at that time many advocates among the learned  dr morison during his residence in france in his occasional journies to paris about the year      became familiar in the family of lord hatton then resident at st germains and whose second son charles was much attached to natural history and became a voluntary and zealous disciple of our author sixteen years afterward mr charles hatton sent over at the authors request a treatise with the plates already engraved written by paul boccone on plants discovered by him in the southern parts of europe principally in sicily of which some were rare and some new boccone was originally of savona in the genoese district and was born in      he became a cistertian monk of palermo and was a man of singular and various erudition in natural history he visited corsica and malta traveled into england holland and germany and was for some time botanist to the duke of tuscany he was the author of several very curious works and died in   0  he wrote on fossils but his botanical writings have greater originality and were of high value morison after having caused the seven last plates to be reengraved published the work alluded to above under the following title  icones et descriptiones rariorum plantarum melitae galliae et italiae auctore paulo boccone panormitano siculo serenissimi magni etruriae ducis olim botanico oxon       o pp    t    fig      morison prefixed to this work a dedication to mr hatton in which he defends not only the doctrine in general that all plants spring from seed but particularly against dioscorides and some of the restorers of science among whom were caesalpinus that all the ferns are furnished with flowers and seed  the plants described and figured in this book are most of them such as had not been noticed by foregoing authors a few of these are common to britain the figures are small and neither well delineated nor well engraven but the work had its use as containing some plants of southern europe not to be met with in any other author and on this account derives some value to those who are curious in pursuing the history of plants in the sexual system as being quoted by linnaeus  as a specimen of his great work meditated under the name of  historia plantarum universalis oxoniensis morison next published plantarum umbelliferarum distributio nova per tabulas cognationis et affinitatis ex libro naturae observata et detecta oxon      fol pp    t    the umbelliferous tribe is here divided into nine orders the genera of which are distinguished by the figure of the seed assisted in some of the subdivisions by the form of the leaf they are illustrated by figures of   0 different seeds  the author has subjoined what he names umbelliferous plants improperly so called such are valeriana thalictrum filipendula valeriana graeca pimpinella sanguisorba all which are very different both in character and habit except the valerian from the natural class of which he treats  this specimen excited the attention of the learned augmented morisons patronage both abroad and at home and encouraged him to prosecute with vigor his great work of which the first volume came out under the following title plantarum historiae universalis oxoniensis pars secunda seu herbarum distributio nova per tabulas cognationis et affinitatis ex libro naturae observata et detecta fol    0 pp     the first part of the history on trees and shrubs was never printed some have doubted whether it was ever written but schelhammer in additamentis ad conringium tells us that he saw the whole work perfect in the hands of the author morison himself assigns as a reason for publishing the herbaceous division first the greater magnitude of the undertaking arising from the vast number and consequent difficulty of finding proper distinctions and characters and because he was unwilling to leave the most difficult and abstruse part of his work behind him unfinished as happened to delechamp and john bauhine unhappily however morisons untimely death subjected his work to the same lot and did not allow him to finish more than nine out of the fifteen classes of his own system  he divides all herbaceous plants into fifteen classes under the following titles   scandentes   leguminosae   siliquosae   tricapsulares hexapetalae   tricapsulares aliae   corymbiferae   papposae lactescentes   culmiferae   umbelliferae  0 tricoccae purgatrices    galeatae et verticillatae    multisiliquae et multicapsulares    bacciferae    capillares    anomalae   from an inspection of this table it appears that his method is not uniformly founded on the fruit in fact much less so than that of caesalpinus but on the fruit and the habit conjointly since the corymbiferae umbelliferae and galeatae with the verticillatae arise from the disposition of the flower the scandentes culmiferae and capillares from the habit the seventh class from the qualities partly and partly from the seed hence we see that only half the classes are founded on the fruit the fifteenth being truly an heteroclite assemblage his method would have approached much nearer to perfection on his own principles had he enlarged the number of his classes since in several instances they embrace natural orders much too distinct to be ranged together the orders or subdivisions of the classes are in some instances grounded on differences in the seedvessel in others on the root habit and frequently on less scientific discriminations in the conduct of the work itself morison makes a separate chapter for each genus he begins by referring to the ancients under each plant frequently subjoining the etymology the generical characters if indeed they can be so called are very vague and though taken from the parts of fructification are too often assisted by distinctions from the root leaves and mode of growth after the generical note follows a synoptical table of the species referring to the plates the descriptions are sometimes borrowed from john bauhine and others to most of the plants he affixes new specific characters and subjoins the synonyma of several authors he introduces at the end of the chapters the animadversions on the bauhines and an account of the virtues and uses of the plants  the five first classes only were published by the author who left the four succeeding ones finished these with the remaining classes were finished and published after an interval of nineteen years by jacob bobart morison had the advantage of powerful patronage he was liberally encouraged by the university and enabled to embellish his work with a numerous set of tables on which are engraven about      plants the figures are chiefly copied from other authors the new figures occur principally in the latter part of this work and are therefore to be attributed to the care of bobart the six tables of mosses fuci corallines and corals at the end are except the few wooden cuts of gerard the first of the kind graved in england and have great merit as the productions of that time all those of columna and cornutus are copied in this work those engraved by burghers excel the rest and the figures of the grasses and mosses are incomparably beyond any other that are to be met with on the same scale the habit being admirably well expressed the republication of these tables with references to linnaeuss writings would even at this period be a benefit to the science  the third part or more properly the second volume of the oxford history of plants was published by jacob bobart in fol      pp     a life of morison is prefixed to this volume and an engraving of him done by white with dr pitcairns tetrastic underneath in the preface which is signed jacob bobart the reader is presented with a general view of the writers on botany from theophrastus to the time of morison enumerating throughout the several nations of europe in a chronological order the most learned authors on the subject the writer then informs us of the patronage and encouragement which morison received from the university to undertake this work and after lamenting the untimely death of the author and expressing his grateful sense of the honor he received in being appointed to continue the undertaking he lays before the reader the assistances he received in the prosecution of it an interval of near twenty years had given bobart an opportunity of inserting a great number of plants unknown to morison from the works of ray herman plukenet the  hortus malabaricus and other works with respect to english botany great communications had been made by sloane petiver doody sherard and others by these means this volume contains nearly double the number of the former but the latter part of it proves too evidently that it did not receive the finishing hand of the original author since it appears in a very abridged form compared with what morison the name of morison is perpetuated by plumier in the application of it to a west indian tree of the monadelphous class hitherto described only by himself and jacquin himself had done  bobart jacob bobart the continuator of morisons history was the son of jacob the first superintendant of the garden upon its foundation in      both the father and son filled their station with great credit to themselves and no less emolument to the garden the elder is said to have been the author of the first edition of the  hortus oxoniensis      and his name is joined in the second edition      as an associate in the work with dr stephens and mr brown mr granger relates a humorous circumstance in his manners that on rejoicing days he used to have his beard tagged with silver he died in      at the age of eightyone and left besides jacob another son named tillemant who was also employed in the physic garden  i cannot ascertain the time of bobarts death but from the story related of him by dr gray in his edition of hudibras part i canto ii l      he must have been living in   0  he had transformed a dead rat into the feigned figure of a dragon which imposed upon the learned so far that several fine copies of verses were wrote on so rare a subject bobart afterward owned the cheat but it was preserved for some years as a masterpiece of art there is a print of the elder bobart with a distich dated      by burghers which confirms his german origin but it is very scarce the name of bobartia was given by linnaeus to a plant of the graminaceous tribe which he first discovered in hermans collection of the plants of zeylon   chap    a short history of the rise and progress of system method or classification of plants from its origin to its revival in england  general state of arrangements before gesner and caesalpine  ray and morison both labored in the revival of method at the same time  advantages of system  various methods of classification enumerated  method agreeably to my purpose i now proceed to give a concise account of the rise and progress of what is understood by method system or classification of plants arising from agreement in the parts of fructification independent of any association from the sacies externa or habit of the plant to this i shall add as brief an history of another important discovery that of the sexes of plants in consequence of which system itself has been carried to a much higher degree of perfection  there are no traces of what the moderns call system in the writings of the ancients by whom are preeminently signified theophrastus dioscorides and pliny their knowledge of vegetables was confined to a few that were used in medicine and in the arts and conveniences of life and in treating on them their subjects are placed in great and inordinate divisions without the smallest approach to what is now meant by classisication  theophrastus treats his subject in general philosophically in his book  de causis plantarum he considers the propagation culture qualities and uses of plants in general but describes very few in his  historia plantarum in which are described or enumerated about  00 species he begins with the organization the generation and propagation of vegetables he then treats largely in his third and fourth books on trees in the fifth on timber and the choice of the best in the sixth on shrubs thorny plants roses and other ornaments of gardens in the seventh on oleraceous plants and wild plants in the eighth copiously on grain of all kinds and in the last on gums exudations and the methods of obtaining them  the object of dioscorides being solely the materia medica he discusses each subject specifically and in a separate chapter dividing the whole into five books in which as far as any order takes place they arrange into aromatic alimentary and medicinal plants his descriptions are taken chiefly from color size mode of growing comparison of the leaves and roots with other plants well known and therefore left undescribed in general they are short and frequently insufficient to determine the species hence arose the endless and irreconcilable contentions among the commentators in this manner he has described near  00 plants to which he subjoins the virtues and uses to dioscorides all posterity have appealed as decisive on the subject  pliny who treats of plants from the twelfth to the twentyseventh book inclusive of his history has drawn his resources principally from grecian authors he is the historian of ancient botany and recites the names of several hundreds not mentioned by foregoing writers but many of these are unknown there is no scientific order in the disposition of his subject and the great value of plinys work consists in having preserved to us the remains of ancient knowledge on the subject and in particular the application of it to the arts of life in those remote times  after the revival of learning in the fifteenth century the first cultivators of botany studied plants more in the writings of these fathers than in the book of nature and were solely anxious about extricating the plants of the materia medica scarcely adverting to those striking discriminations in the general port mein or habit the mode of growing and other obvious relations which mark the great natural families in the vegetable kingdom but were content to arrange them some according to the alphabetical nomenclature others from the structure of the root the time of flowering the places of growth the supposed qualities and uses in medicine or from other as unstable distinctions with them as with the ancients there were nearly as many genera as species and if they gave the same common appellation to two or more plants they were led to it by some rude external resemblance such as size form of the root agreement in the color of the flower and in the description of the species were frequently satisfied with comparing it to another plant well known to themselves and therefore left undescribed in their writings  this mode of arrangement though in a somewhat improved state is exemplified above in the order observed by dodonaeus and is seen in our old english herbalists gerard and parkinson  lobel in his adversaria    0 seems to have been the first who attempted to distribute plants into large families or classes from the general consent of habit or external form and mode of growing this he has done in an imperfect synoptical way and several of his families contain natural orders or classes nearly entire but frequently interrupted by great anomalies his arrangement was not sufficiently attended to at the time it was then excellent and was gradually improved until we see it in its last and best form as exhibited by caspar bauhine in his pinax      and especially by john bauhine in his historia plantarum universalis    0  as natural characters arose from similarity in the general port or habit of the plant and from an obvious agreement in the disposition of the stalk leaves stems and from that of the flower fruit and seed so they at length forced themselves to observation thus the general habit of all grasses the plants with a papilionaceous flower such as pease and vetches the siliquose plants such as mustard cresses turnips etc the verticillated as mint baum hyssop germander etc the umbellated tribe parsley carrots hemlock angelica the conebearing trees and several other tribes were too striking not to be seen even by a superficial observer but as these constitute only a part of the whole so no characters were formed for those plants which the eye could not immediately refer to some of these classes still less had any generical agreement arising from uniformity in the fructification been detected had all the species of plants arranged themselves under natural classes a natural method would easily have followed but the intermediate links notwithstanding the efforts of the most skilful are yet unknown hence arose the necessity of artificial systems which are now become but too numerous some have imagined that the more pure any artificial system preserves the natural classes the greater is its excellence but experience does not confirm this idea those arrangements are found to lead more immediately to the plant sought for the classes and subdivisions of which are simple and drawn each uniformly from the same parts of the fructification  conrad gesner the linnaeus of the age in which he lived is universally agreed to have been the first who suggested this true principle of classical distinction and generical character as is manifest from various passages in the epistles of that great man epist medicinal a wolphio ed p     et passim  he instances the agreement of the staphisagria with the consolida the scorzonera with the tragopogon the molucca with the lamium the dulcamara with the solanum the calceolus with the orchides and he expressly says that the character should be formed from the flower and the seed rather than from the leaves this was in the year      other passages occur by which it appears he had the same ideas so early as      but perhaps there is no proof of the importance he gave to these parts more indubitable than his having been the first who delineated them separately with the figures of his plants of which numerous instances may be seen in the tables published by schmiedel  but gesner did not live to improve the hints he thus drew from nature and what is wonderful they were neglected by those great luminaries of the science clusius and the bauhines it was reserved for caesalpinus a man in whom was united an exquisite knowledge of plants with a truly philosophical genius he had been the disciple of ghinus and was afterward physician to pope clement viii he described with exquisite skill the plants of his own country and left an herbarium of     species he extended gesners idea and commenced the period of systematic arrangement in his  libri xvi de plantis published      he has arranged upwards of  00 plants into classes founded after the general division of the trees from herbs on characters drawn from the fruit particularly from the number of the capsules and cells the number shape and disposition of the seeds and from the situation of the corculum radicle or eye of the seed which he raised to great estimation the orders or subdivisions are formed on still more various relations  fabius columna improved this doctrine of classification in      by extending it to the formation of genera which caesalpinus had not effected all his species being separately described columna indeed did not exhibit a system but he showed the way to complete it by the union of species under one common name from similarity in the flower and fruit and he invented several of the terms now in use to denominate those parts this noble invention nevertheless lay dormant for near a century and the glory of reviving and improving it was reserved for britain  ray and morison both labored in it at the same time and with them must commence the era of systematic botany in england it was an object thought worth contending for and each of these writers had their partisans who respectively bestowed the laurel as they were led by their various motives or attachments i shall not enter into the merits of their claims further than to observe that both seem to have turned their attention to the subject nearly about the same time and that mr ray had certainly priority in point of publication if it may be allowed that the tables which he drew up for bishop wilkinss real or universal character which was published in      contain the outlines of a system and certainly these rudiments though hastily done as mr ray confesses sufficiently prove that he had bestowed no small attention on the subject that foreign writers have more commonly attributed to morison the revival of method may have arisen from their being less acquainted with bishop wilkinss work which was extant only in the english tongue mr ray informs us in the second edition of his catalogus plantarum angliae that dr wilkins meditated a translation of his universal character into latin with figures for the use of foreigners and mr ray himself performed it but the death of this good prelate in      prevented the completion of the design he adds that his method in a more elaborate state had been delivered into the bishops hands for the abovementioned work  dr morison exhibited the outlines of his scheme in the  hortus blesensis the year after the publication of the bishops book and exemplified it in his history of plants in    0 mr ray did not detail his till the year      in the  methodus in which he freely acknowledges the assistance he received from caesalpinus columna jungius and even from morisons work on the contrary dr morison assumes to himself the merit of having drawn all his resources in the fabrication of his system wholly from nature and his own observations preserving every where the utmost silence respecting any assistance derived from former writers assumptions which could with difficulty be acceded to and which drew upon him the censures of tournefort and other masters of the science who were well acquainted with the fountains of knowledge that were then open to him and the assistances he must have drawn from gesner caesalpinus and others  at this distance of time and under the present enlightened state of science the systems of ray and of morison must not be scrupulously examined caesalpinus laid a foundationstone on which if our british architects raised a gothic structure their successors have improved it to a style of greater symmetry and elegance  the introduction of system was fortunate for science as it brought with it by degrees the establishment of generical characters on a like assemblage of essential parts in several species as new plants were daily discovered in the old continent and were pouring in from the new the nomenclature of botany was in danger of being again overwhelmed with that chaos in which caspar bauhine found it when he reduced it into some order by his laborious and incomparable pinax  system enabled botanists to refer new species to genera already formed and restrained that license before taken of giving a new generical appellation to each new plant for although in the multitude of methods which followed this discovery plants of the same genus in one system were frequently referable to a different genus in another yet with this inconvenience annexed they were more readily investigated than under the vague distinctions of the older writers  the restoration of system was in the words of linnaeus the beginning of the golden age of botany and the revival of it having taken place in england presently raised up several learned men among us who gave new life and vigor to the whole science the names of sloane plukenet sherard and petiver will ever remain illustrious in the annals of botanic knowledge  it also turned the attention of the learned on the continent to the subject rival systems were soon constructed some on the fruit as the basis of the classes in conformity to the systems of caesalpinus ray and morison and others on the flower thus christopher knaut in      and herman in    0 fixed on the fruit whose systems were improved by boerhaave in    0  rivinus in    0 chose the flower alone considering the number and regularity of the petals as the base of his classical characters and was followed by ruppius in      and ludwig in      tournefort who elaborated his method beyond his predecessors in      chose the figure of the corolla as the principle of classification and magnol in    0 took the calyx alone  if it should be enquired on this occasion in what the methods of caesalpinus ray and morison differ from the arrangements used before their time by dodonaeus lobel and john bauhine since those also are established on the habit and in which many of the natural classes are tolerably well preserved it may be answered in a summary way that habit even in bauhines order the most perfect of them is the prevailing principle without regard to agreement in the parts of fructification except in those classes where nature has joined both together this is a difference much more essential than may at first be apprehended and what is still less accurate than a regard to habit alone some of their classes if they are worthy of that appellation no definitions of them being prefixed take their name merely from the mode of growing as scandentes from the structure of the leaf nervifoliae rotundifoliae crassifoliae place of growth aquaticae and what is still less eligible the aspect and supposed agreement in the qualities such are malignae mollientes papavera under all of which are promiscuously collected plants as dissimilar as possible in the structure of the flower and fruit  chap    history of the discovery of the sexes of plants  the doctrine of the ancients on this head  their knowledge very limited  the universality of this process  the discovery of millington and grew  subsequent writers who have confirmed or opposed the doctrine  present idea of it exhibited  sex of plants to the revival and establishment of method succeeded a discovery of the highest importance to botanical science i mean what is with great justice called analogically the doctrine of the sexes of plants or the knowledge that throughout the vegetable kingdom the influence of the dust of the antherae upon the stigma was necessary in order to produce fertile seed by the establishment of this fact not only the physiology of vegetables was greatly advanced but in the end practical botany equally improved since on this foundation has been built that system of the great swede which is now so universally followed of the rise and progress of this investigation i proceed to give a concise account before i pursue the sketch of british authors  a vague and indecisive opinion concerning the sexes of plants prevailed among the ancient philosophers of greece we are informed by aristotle that empedocles particularly taught that the sexes were united in plants this opinion was a natural consequence of the doctrine which this philosopher in common with anaxagoras democritus and plato taught that plants were sentient and animated beings this idea has met with ingenious advocates among the moderns who have been induced to favor it not only from the general analogy existing between animals and vegetables and the difficulty of fixing the limits between them but from the more striking instances of apparent irritability and obedience to the action of certain stimuli such are the general affection plants have for light the rotatory motion of many toward the sun the faculty of others in closing the leaves at night called not unaptly the sleep of plants and the opening and shutting of many flowers at stated times with equal propriety denominated vigiliae florum the rising of the flower of aquatic plants out of the water every morning during the state of florescence as instanced in the nymphaea and still more signally in the vallisneria to these may be added the more remarkable examples in the mimosa and oxalis sensitiva in the dionaea muscipula the drosera and the hedysarum gyrans and finally in the exquisite irritability of the stamina and antherae in various species empedocles nevertherless though he maintained the doctrine of the sexes does not attempt to confirm it by any facts or reasonings deduced from the knowledge of the uses of the separate parts in flowers but from analogical deduction founded merely on his general doctrine  aristotle or rather the author of the books on plants which bear his name combats the opinions of empedocles and his followers respecting the sentient and animated principle in vegetables yet it is evident he had himself no decisive ideas or specific knowledge drawn from nature relating to the sex of plants he placed it in some instances in the different habit alone or in other discriminations foreign to the consideration of the flower and though he shows an inaccurate knowledge of the particular circumstances of the palm and the fig tree yet he denies in another place that either of them produce flowers  this imperfect idea of the sex of flowers in the date and even in the fig tree is of high antiquity being recorded by herodotus theophrastus and pliny the necessity which the ancient cultivators of the datetree were under of promoting the action of the maleflowers on the female which operation held also in some measure in the fig tree the pistachia and the mastic would almost necessarily suggest the application of this analogy with the animal kingdom nevertheless although the fact was thus obtruded on their senses inattentive to the structure of flowers and ignorant of the offices of the several parts they remained unacquainted with the true operations of nature in this phenomenon though daily present to their observation  the ancient fathers of botany and particularly dioscorides it is true applied the distinction of male and female to many other plants but it was entirely without regard to true analogy or discrimination of functions in the flower it was frequently applied to such as carry all the parts of the flower within the same calyx or on the same stalk on account of stature greater degree of fertility or other marks unconnected with the fructification in the diaecious or such as have the stamina and pistils on separate plants of the same species the real male plant was in some cases denominated the female of which the mercurialis may be mentioned as one instance among several others  exclusive of a numerous set of plants in which the stamina and pistils are separately placed either on different parts of the same individual or on different plants of the same species constituting the monaecious and dioecious classes of linnaeus the following genera from other tribes as recited below arundo anagallis aristolochia cistus filix mandragora paeonia polygonum tithymalus verbascum etc etc to which have been added by others abrotanum abies amaranthus balsamina caltha cornus crista galli ferula nicotiana orchis pulegium quercus symphytum tilia veronica etc etc     contain species to which dioscorides has applied the distinction of male and female from circumstances having no analogy with those of the datetree  this doctrine of the sexual analogy between plants and animals made but little progress with the literati in botany upon the revival of science since the first of those who mention it is caesalpinus this critical and learned author notices male and female plants in the oxycedrus taxus mercurialis urtica and cannabis of which he says the barren plants are males and the fertile females adding that the latter as is observed in the datetree becomes more fruitful by being planted near the males from thence receiving a genial effluvium which excites a stronger fertility from this observation it may almost be inferred that he had instituted experiments on some of these kinds but we do not find that he carried the idea beyond the abovementioned species to vegetables in general  adam zaluziansky a polish writer in      is said by some to have distinguished the sexes of plants i have not seen his book but from what is found relating to his opinion in other writers i conjecture that his observations if not wholly taken from caesalpinus do not exhibit any original matter on this subject in fact no further progress was made for near an hundred years after this time and the honor of the discovery that this sexual process was universal in the vegetable kingdom and that the dust of the antherae was endowed with an impregnating power is due to england  whether the true idea of this process originated with sir thomas millington to whom it has been ascribed may justly admit of a doubt since sir thomas has left no written testimony on the subject and dr grews mention of him does not imply that he actually received the idea from him add to this that mr ray in the summary view of all grews discoveries which he has prefixed to his history of plants does not once mention sir thomas millingtons name interested as we must suppose mr ray to have been in every discovery relating to vegetables and candid as he was in his general conduct to the learned it is not likely that he should have failed in this instance to render praise where it was so justly due when we further recollect that dr grew had been some years engaged in those microscopical experiments on the anatomy of plants which have rendered his name estimable with all posterity that whilst he was thus employed in studying so intimately the organization of vegetables and had observed that in whatsoever parts the flower might be deficient the attire or stamina and apices is ever present it is not strange that the true idea of its use should have been suggested to him  dr grew laid his opinion before the royal society in a lecture on the anatomy of flowers read nov        in which he maintained that the primary and chief use of the dust of the apices is such as has respect to the plant itself and so appears to be very great and necessary because even those plants which have no flower or foliature are yet some way or other attired so that it seems to perform its service to the seed as the foliature to the fruit in discourse hereof with our learned savilian professor sir thomas millington he told me that he conceived that the attire does serve as the male for the generation of the seed i immediately replied that i was of the same opinion gave him some reasons for it and answered some objections that might oppose them he then explains himself farther and advances that this foecundating power was not effected by the actual admission of the farina into the seedvessel but by means of subtle and vivific effluvia  mr ray admitted the opinion of dr grew but at first with all that caution which becomes a philosopher as appears in his  historia plantarum vol i p    nos ut verisimilem tantum admittimus he assents to it with less reserve in his  synopsis stirpium britannicarum edit      0 p    and in the preface to his  sylloge stirpium europaearum published in      we find him producing his reasons for the truth of it and yielding his full approbation to it  in      rudolph jacob camerarius professor of botany and physic at tubingen in his  epistola de sexu plantarum appears among the early advocates for this analogy and being convinced by the arguments of grew and ray seems to have been the first who gave stability to the whole by experiments these he made on maize the mulberry the ricinus and the mercurialis the three first of which he deprived of the staminiferous flowers and the last he separated far from the female and found in all that the fruit did not ripen camerarius however very fairly produces also some objections against the doctrine founded on experiments which at this day have little weight since they were made on plants of the cryptogamous or dioecious classes in the last of which it is now known that sometimes a flower or two of a different sex may be found intermixed with others  in   0  mr samuel morland desirous as it should seem of extending the lewenhoekian system of generation into the vegetable kingdom produced a paper before the royal society in which he advances  that the farina is a congeries of seminal plants one of which must be conveyed through the style into every ovum or seed before it can become prolific mr morlands hypothesis tended to confirm the general doctrine by exciting curiosity on the subject at a time when lewenhoeks theory was popular but was not admissible in itself since few styles are hollow or if perceptibly tubular not pervious enough to admit particles of the usual magnitude of the farina  after this time several of the learned on the continent entered into researches on this subject m geoffroy in      in a paper read before the royal academy of sciences after having formed a theory by conciliating grews and morlands into one concludes by asserting  that the germ is never to be seen in the seed till the farina is shed and that if the plant is deprived of the stamina before this dust is fallen the seed will either not ripen or will not prove fertile  it is matter of surprise that the illustrious tournefort should wholly reject the doctrine of the sexes of plants so far even from acknowledging this function of the farina that he held it to be excrementitious see isagoge in rem herbariam p  0  julius pontedera a strenuous follower of tournefort a noble italian of pisa illustrious for his knowledge of the ancient languages and antiquities of italy and not less celebrated for botanical knowledge and literature combats also the notion of this analogy and uses of the stamina through the whole second book of his  anthologia in the end he rejects the sexual analogy and considers it as entirely chimerical but finding all flowers furnished with a style or tube he advances that it serves to convey the air to the fruit by which an intestine and fertilizing motion is excited in the seed or ovary  in      mons vaillant published  sermo de structura florum horum differentia usuque partium which had been read the year before at the opening of the royal garden in this discourse he describes the bursting of the antherae in a style too florid for philosophical narration he relates several of his own discoveries on the nature of the farina and the exploding power of the antherae and concludes with assenting entirely to dr grews sentiment though without naming him that impregnation is performed by means of a subtle aura and not by the transmission of the dust through the style alleging against it those reasons i have mentioned in speaking of morlands opinion  in england about the same time dr patrick blair by his botanick essays contributed greatly to extend the knowledge and confirm the truth of this subject bradley fairchild miller and others assisted in the same design and since that period i believe it has met with few opposers one of the most formidable was the late learned dr alston professor of botany at edinburgh from whose labored disquisition the adversaries to this opinion of the sex of flowers may furnish themselves with the most cogent arguments that an intimate knowledge of the subject has enabled a very diligent and learned writer to produce  the more recent experiments made by the abbe spalanzani with a direct view to impugn this doctrine do not appear to have been conducted with that degree of skill and accuracy which is sufficient to outweigh the numerous train that may be thrown into the opposite scale even some of the abbes own experiments seem rather to strengthen the opinion he means to overthrow  having traced the history of this important process in the economy of vegetables to the time of linnaeus i judge it will be unnecessary to accompany the reader through a particular detail of authors below this period in      linnaeus founded his system on this doctrine and the additional arguments and experiments produced by himself his pupils and followers have established the truth of it to the complete satisfaction of impartial enquirers those however who wish to peruse the most perfect summary of all the arguments and experiments in favor of this analogy are referred to the  sponsalia plantarum written in the year      and printed in the first volume of the  amoenitates academicae and to the dissertation on the sexes of plants written by linnaeus in    0 which obtained the premium of the academy of petersburgh and has lately been translated into english by the ingenious and learned possessor of the linnaean collection to which may be added the writings of koelruter in the succeeding year which have not a little tended to confirm the subject in question  it would be unjust to the memory of dr grew to conclude this history without remarking that the result of the latest and best experiments have confirmed his idea that the farina itself is not carried to the rudiment of the seed but that foecundation is effected by the effluvia this will appear by citing the summary view of the doctrine as exhibited by linnaeus himself in the dissertation above mentioned  while plants are in flower the pollen falls from the antherae and is dispersed abroad at the same time that the pollen is scattered the stigma is then in its highest vigor and for a portion of the day at least is moistened with a fine dew the pollen easily finds access to the stigma where it not only adheres by means of the dew of the part but the moisture occasions its bursting by which means its contents are discharged what issued from it being mixed with the fluid of the stigma is conveyed to the rudiments of the seed  i remark before i conclude that how just soever it may have been in a philosophical view to consider the stamina and pistils as answering to the respective functions of sex in the animal kingdom it should not have been forgotten that in animals this process is voluntary but that in vegetables notwithstanding all that the ingenuity of the ancients and moderns have urged in defense of the sentient principle we are not yet justified in referring this process to any other than what we are accustomed to call a mechanical cause  the principle of this it will not be expected that i should explain it may be conjectured that after a perfect elaboration of the juices in the antherae and stigmata some species of attraction takes place between them perhaps of the electrical kind somewhat like this having been manifested in the flashings observable in some flowers in the evenings the reader will easily perceive that i refer to the appearance first seen in the indian cresses tropaeolum majus by elizabeth christina the daughter of linnaeus as related in the swedish acts in      and since confirmed in the garden marigold calendela officinalis the orange or bulbiserous lily lilium bulbiferum and the african marigold tagetes patula et erecta by the observations of m haggren and as in the universe at large the phenomenon of electricity are sensibly manifested to us by particular modifications of the principle occasionally excited although unquestionably ever active so possibly the same principle may prevail through the whole vegetable creation in the process above mentioned though unobserved hitherto except in these instances be this as it may that general decorum which is due to philosophical subjects ought to have restrained that reprehensible language used by vaillant and some other writers on this subject and even by linnaeus himself which has justly disgusted many readers and prejudiced the instruction they meant to convey  chap    willisel  collects plants for merret morison ray and sherard  his notices on the misseltoe  plott  anecdotes of  his

kind is well known to those who are conversant with the writings of merret ray and morison and i feel regret at not being able to commemorate the name of thomas willisel with some of the circumstances of his life since i am uninformed of the time and place both of his birth and of his death this industrious man seems to have devoted much of his life to the investigation of english plants and as he lived at a time when british botany was yet imperfect he added largely to the stock of new discoveries he was employed by dr morison soon after his establishment at oxford to collect rare english plants and dr merret informs us as has been noticed that he traveled five summers at his expense into the different parts of england to make collections for his  pinax which appears to have been greatly enriched with many of the most rare species by the labors of willisel i believe he was once sent into ireland by dr sherard mr ray was benefited by his researches and if i do not mistake he accompanied that celebrated naturalist in one of his tours the emolument arising from these employments was probably among the principal means of his subsistence  his knowledge was not confined to the vegetable kingdom since mr ray informs us that he was employed by the royal society in the search of natural rarities both animals plants and minerals for which purposes he was the fittest man in england both for his skill and industry  in the letters of mr ray there occurs an observation made by willisel of the various trees on which he had found the misseltoe growing i enumerate them below

volume on provincial natural history in which it is but justice to add that with due allowance for the time when he wrote he has not been excelled by any subsequent writer it were to be wished that more examples of the like kind might be adduced but there are few exactly of the same scope after bishop gibson in his edition of camden printed in      had inserted the provincial lists of plants drawn up by mr ray several writers of county histories have either from their own knowledge of the subject or by the aid of friends inserted catalogues of the more rare plants in their respective

indifferent figure in tab    f   under the article sundew drosera there is a curious and interesting observation made by dr borlace in which he asserts that the wellknown pernicious quality of that

took any degree went on his travels he spent near two years in france and italy and in      traveled into greece and asia minor from whence he returned in november      he was knighted before he took his master of arts degree which was conferred upon him in      in consideration of his learning and in return for a present of antiquities collected in his travels he afterward took some valuable preferments in the church was created doctor of divinity in   0  and died feb          in      was published a journey into greece by george wheler esquire in company of dr spon of lions in six books with four tables of coins and many other sculptures fol pp      these gentlemen traveled with pausanias in their hands by whose means they corrected and explained several of the antiquities and traditions of greece the primary objects of these learned travelers were to copy the inscriptions and describe the antiquities and coins of greece and asia minor and particularly of athens where they sojourned a month these travels are highly valued for their authenticity and are replete with sound and instructive erudition to the medallist and antiquary  mr wheler appears on all occasions to have been attentive to the natural history of greece and particularly to the plants of which he enumerates several hundreds in this volume and giv the engravings of some these catalogues sufficiently evince his knowledge of the botany of his time he brought from the east several which had not been cultivated in britain before among these the hypericum olympicum st johns wort of olympus is a wellknown plant introduced by this learned traveller ray morison and plukenet all acknowledge their obligations for curious plants received from him  after sir george wheler entered into the church he published an account of the churches and places of assembly of the primitive christians from the churches of tire jerusalem and constantinople described by eusebius and ocular observations of several very ancient edifices yet extant in those parts with a seasonable application land       the rev granville wheler of otterden place kent and rector of leak in nottinghamshire who died in    0 was the third son of sir george wheler and became his heir he distinguished himself as a gentleman of science and a polite scholar he was the friend and patron of mr stephen gray who jointly with him contributed to revive the study of electricity in england let me be allowed to add that i wish to mention the name of this gentleman with gratitude from the recollection of that encouragement which i personally received from him in my pursuits of natural history at a very early period of life and which was of such a nature as seldom fails to animate the minds of the young to exertion and improvement  end of the first volume
