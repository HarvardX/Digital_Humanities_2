the dunciad p and r arthur  denniss works  cibbers plays   dublin printed london reprinted for a dodd    the dunciad an heroic poem  in three books  dublin printed london reprinted for a dodd       the publisher to the reader it will be found a true observation though somewhat surprising that when any scandal is vented against a man of the highest distinction and character either in the state or in literature the public in general afford it a most quiet reception and the larger part accept it as favorably as if it were some kindness done to themselves whereas if a known scoundrel or blockhead chance to be but touched upon a whole legion is up in arms and it becomes the common cause of all scriblers booksellers and printers whatsoever  not to search too deeply into the reason hereof i will only observe as a fact that every week for these two months past the town has been persecuted with pamphlets advertisements letters and weekly essays not only against the wit and writings but against the character and person of mr pope and that of all those men who have received pleasure from his writings which by modest computation may be about a hundred thousand in these kingdoms of england and ireland not to mention jerscy guernsey the orcades those in the new world and foreigners who have translated him into their languages of all this number not a man has stood up to say one word in his defense  the only exception is the author of the following poem who doubtless had either a better insight into the grounds of this clamor or a better opinion of mr popes integrity joined with a greater personal love for him than any other of his numerous friends and admirers  further that he was in his peculiar intimacy appears from the knowledge he manifests of the most private authors of all the anonymous pieces against him and from his having in this poem attacked no man living who had not before printed and published against this particular gentleman  how i became possessed of it is of no concern to the reader but it would have been a wrong to him had i detained this publication since those names which are its chief ornaments die off daily so fast as must render it too soon unintelligible if it provoke the author to give us a more perfect edition i have my end  who he is i cannot say and which is great pity there is certainly nothing in his style and manner of writing which can distinguish or discover him for if it bears any resemblance to that of mr p it is not improbable but it might be done on purpose with a view to have it pass for his but by the frequency of his allusions to virgil and a labored not to say affected shortness in imitation of him i should think him more an admirer of the roman poet than of the grecian and in that not of the same taste with his friend  i have been well informed that this work was the labor of full six years of his life and that he retired himself entirely from all the avocations and pleasures of the world to attend diligently to its correction and perfection and six years more he intended to bestow upon it as it should seem by this verse of statius which was cited at the head of his manuscript oh mihi bissenos multum vigilata per annos duncia    hence also we learn the true title of the poem which with the same certainty as we call that of homer the iliad of virgil the aeneid of camoens the lusiad of voltaire the henriad we may pronounce could have been and can be no other than the dunciad  it is styled heroic as being doubly so not only with respect to its nature which according to the best rules of the ancients and strictest ideas of the moderns is critically such but also with regard to the heroical disposition and high courage of the writer who dared to stir up such a formidable irritable and implacable race of mortals  the time and date of the action is evidently in the last reign when the office of city poet expired upon the death of elkanah settle and he has fixed it to the mayoralty of sir geo thold but there may arise some obscurity in chronology from the names in the poem by the inevitable removal of some authors and insertion of others in their niches for whoever will consider the unity of the whole design will be sensible that the poem was not made for these authors but these authors for the poem and i should judge they were clapped in as they rose fresh and fresh and changed from day to day in like manner as when the old boughs wither we thrust new ones into a chimney  i would not have the reader too much troubled or anxious if he cannot decypher them since when he shall have found them out he will probably know no more of the persons than before  yet we judged it better to preserve them as they are than to change them for fictitious names by which the satyr would only be multiplied and applied to many instead of one had the hero for instance been called codrus how many would have affirmed him to be mr w mr d sir r b etc but now all that unjust scandal is saved by calling him theobald which by good luck happens to be the name of a real person  i am indeed aware that this name may to some appear too mean for the hero of an epic poem but it is hoped they will alter that opinion when they find that an author no less eminent than la bruyere has thought him worthy a place in his characters voudriez vous theobalde que je crusse que vous etes
