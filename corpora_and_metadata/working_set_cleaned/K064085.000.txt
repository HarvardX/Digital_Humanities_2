the life and adventures of ambrose gwinett well known to the public as the lame beggarman who for many years swept the way between the meusegate and springgardens charing cross taken almost literally from his own mouth giving an account of his parentage and being put out to an attorney at canterbury with whom he lived four years when he obtained his masters consent to visit his sister who was married and lived near deal but not being used to traveling he was greatly fatigued and got a lodging within three miles of his sisters by mentioning her name the landlady prevailed on her uncle to let him have half his bed which he paid for that night and departed early in the morning and arrived at his sisters with whom and his brotherinlaw he breakfasted and in an hour or two after came the landlord of the house where he had lodged charging him with the murder of his bedfellow for which he was committed and at the assizes at maidstone condemned and ordered to be hung in chains which was accordingly executed and a boy going to fetch his cows see his jaw move and went and acquainted his master who with assistants cut down the gibbet and disengaging him from his irons put him into a warm bed by which he recovered and was sent abroad where he met with the very man for whose supposed murder he had been executed and who gave a surprising relation of the many accidents that had befell him their mutual agreement to return to england together etc  printed in stonecutterstreet price  d  the life etc i was born of reputable parents in the city of canterbury where my father living at the sign of the blue anchor dealt in slops he had but two children a daughter and myself and having given me a good school education at the age of sixteen he bound me apprentice to mr george roberts an attorney in our town with whom i stayed four years and thee quarters to his great content and my own satisfaction so that had we been together till my time was up i have great reason to believe he would have taken me into partnership but gods will be done my unfortunate stars decreed otherwise  my sister being come to womans estate had now been married something more than a twelvemonth to one sawyer a seafaring man who having got considerable prizes my father also giving him  00l with my sister quitted his profession and set up a public house within three miles of the place of his nativity which was deal in the county of kent  i had frequent invitations to go and pass a short time with them and in the autumn of the year   0  having obtained my masters consent for that purpose i left the city of canterbury on foot the   th day of september  through some unavoidable delays on the road the evening was considerable advanced before i reached deal and so tired was i being unused to that way of traveling that had my life depended on it i could not get as far as my sisters that night she living as i have already said three mile beyond the place at this time there were many of her majesty queen annes ships lying in the harbor for the english were then at war with the french and spaniards besides which i found this was the day for holding the yearly fair so that the town was filled to that degree that a bed was not to be got for love or money i went seeking a lodging from house to house to no purpose till being quite spent i returned to the public house where i had first made enquiry desiring leave to sit by their kitchen fire and rest myself till morning  the publican and his wife happened to be acquainted with my brother and sister and finding by my discourse that i was a relation of theirs and going to visit them the landlady presently said she would endeavor to get a bed and going out of the kitchen she quickly after called me into a parlour that led from it here i saw sitting by the fireside a middle aged man in a night gown and cap who was rekoning money at a table uncle said the woman as soon as i entered this is a brother of our friend mrs sawyer he cannot get a bed any where and is tired after a long journey you are the only one that lies in this house alone will you give him part of yours to this the man answered that she knew he had been out of order that he was blooded that day and consequently a bedfellow could not be very agreeable however said he rather then the young man shall set up he is welcome to sleep with me after this we set a while together when having put his money in a canvas bag into the pocket of his night gown he took the candle and i followed him up to bed  how long i slept i cannot exactly determine but i conjecture it was about three oclock i the morning when i awakened with a violent cholic i found my chum awake as well as myself he asked me what was the matter i informed him and at the same time begged he would direct me to the necessary he told me when i was down stairs i must turn on my right hand and go strait into the garden at the end of which it was just over the sea but adds he you may possibly find some difficulty in opening the door the string being broke which pulls up the latch i will give you a penknife which you may open it with through a chink in the boards so saying he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket which lay on him on the bed and gave me a middling sized penknife  i hurried on a few of my clothes and went down stairs but i must observe to you that unclasping the penknife to open the door of the necessary according to his direction a piece of money which stuck between the blade and the groove in the handle fell into my hand i did not examine what it was nor indeed could i well see there being but a very faint moon light so i put them together carelessly in my pocket  i apprehend i staid in the garden pretty near a quarter of an hour when i returned to the chamber i was surprised to find my bedfellow gone i called several times but receiving no answer i went to bed and again fell asleep  about six oclock i arose nobody yet being up in the house the gentleman was not yet returned to bed or if he was had again left it i dressed myself with what haste i could being impatient to see my sister and the reckoning being paid over night i let myself out at the street door  i will not trouble you with a relation of the kindness with which my sister and her husband received me we breakfasted together and i believe it might be about eleven oclock in the forenoon when standing at the door my brother in law being by my side we saw three horsemen galloping toward us as soon as they came up to the house they stopped and one of them lighting suddenly seized me by the collar crying you are kings prisoner i desired to know my crime he said i should know that as soon as i came to deal where i must immediately go with them one of them then told my brother that the night before i had committed a murder and robbery  resistance would have proved as vain as my tears and protestations of my innocence in a word a warrant was produced and i was carried back to deal attended by the three men my brother with another friend accompanying us who knew not what to say for nor how to comfort me  being arrived in town i was immediately hurried to the house where i had slept the proceeding night the master of which was one of the three men that came to apprehend me though in my first hurry i did not recollect him we were met at the door by a crowd of people every one crying which is he which is he as soon as i entered i was accested by the publicans wife in tears o cursed wretch what have thou done thou have murdered and robbed my poor dear uncle and all through me who put thee to lie with him but where have thou hid his money and what have thou done with his body thou shall be hanged on a gallows as high as a may pole my brother begged her to be pacified and i was taken into a private room they then began to question me as the woman had done about where i had put the money and how i had disposed of the body i asked them what money and whose body they meant they then said i had killed the person i had lain with the proceeding night for the sake of a large sum i had seen with him i fell down of upon my knees calling god to witness i knew nothing of what they accused me then somebody cried carry him up stairs and i was brought into the chamber where i had slept here the man of the house went to the bed and turning down the clothes showed the sheets pillow and bolster dyed in blood he asked me did i know any thing of that i declared to god i did not says a person in the room young man something very odd must have past here last night for lying in the next chamber i heard groanings and going up and down stairs more than once or twice i then told them the circumstance of my illness and that i had been up and down myself with all that passed between my bedfellow and me somebody proposed to search me several began to turn my pockets inside out and from my waistcoat tumbled the penknife and the piece of money i have already mentioned and i had entirely forgot upon seeing these the woman immediately screamed out o god there is my uncles penknife then taking up the money and calling the people about her here said she is what puts the villains guilt beyond a doubt i can swear to this william and marys guinea my uncle has long had it by way of pocket piece and engraved the first letters of his name upon it she then began to cry afresh while i could do nothing but continue to call heaven to witness that i was as innocent as the child unborn the constable who had heard me mention the having gone down into the garden told the people i must have thrown the body down the necessary and going thither here said he after having cut the throat he has let the body down into the sea this every body immediately assented to then said the master of the house it is in vain to look for the body any further for there was a spring tide last night which has carried it off  the consequence of these proceedings was an immediate examination before a justice of peace after which i suffered a long and rigorous imprisonment in the county town of maidstone for some time my father my master and my relations were inclined to think me innocent because i declared i was so as well i might and in compliance with my earnest request an advertisement was published in the london gazette representing my deplorable circumstances and offering a reward to any person who could give tidings of mr richard collings the man i was supposed to have murdered either alive or dead no information however of any kind came to hand at the assizes therefore i was brought up to my trial and circumstances appearing strong against me i received sentence to be carried in a cart the wednesday fortnight following to the town of deal and there to be hanged before the innkeepers door where i had committed the murder after which i was to be hung in chains within a stones throw of my brothers house  nothing could have supported me under this dreadful condemnation but a consciousness of my not being guilty of the crime for which i was to suffer my friends now began to consider my declarations of my innocence as persisting in falsehood to the perition of my soul many of them discontinued their enquiries after me and those few who still came to visit me only came to urge me to confession but i was resolved i would never die with a lie of that kind in my mouth  the monday was now arrived before the fatal day when an end was to be put to my miseries i was called down into the court of the prison but i own i was not a little shocked when i found it was to be taken measure of for my irons in which i was to be hung after execution a fellow prisoner appeared before me in the same woeful plight he had robbed the mail and the smith was measuring him when i came down while tha jailer with as much calmness as if he had been ordering a pair of stays for his daughter was giving directions in what manner the irons should be made so as to support the man who was remarkably heavy and corpulent  between this and the day of execution i spent my time alone in prayer and meditation  at length wednesday morning came and about three oclock i was put in a cart but sure such a day of wind rain and thunder never blew out of the heavens and when we arrived at deal it became so violent that the sheriff and his officers could scarce sit their horses for my own part i was insensible to every object about me i therefore heard the sheriff whisper the executioner to make what dispatch he could without the least emotion and suffered him to tuck me up like a log of wood unconscious of what he was doing  i can give no account of what i felt when hanging only remember after being turned off something appeared about me like a blaze of fire nor do i know how long i hung no doubt the violence of the weather favored me greatly in that circumstance what i am now going to tell you i learned from my brother which was that having hung half an hour the sheriffs officers all went off and i was cut down by the executioner but when he came to put the irons upon me it was found that the irons of the other man which were too large for me had been sent instead of mine this they remedied by stuffing rags between my body and the hoops after which i was taken to the place appointed and hung on a gibbet which was ready prepared  the cloth over my face being slightly tied was soon detached by the wind and probably its blowing on my face expedited my recovery certain it is that in this situation i came to myself  the gibbet was placed at one corner of a field where my sisters cows ran and about this time a lad came to drive them home for evening milking the creatures which were feeding almost under me brought him near the gibbet and in the very moment he looked up saw me open my eyes and move my under jaw he immediately ran home to inform the people at his masters at first they made some difficulty to believe his story at length my brother come out and by the time he got to the field i was so much alive that my groans were very audible  in their confusion the first thing they thought of was a ladder one of my brothers men mounted and putting his hand to my stomach felt my heart beating strongly but it was found impossible to detach me from the gibbet without cutting it down a saw was got for that purpose and in less than half an hour having freed me from my irons they got me blooded and put in a warm bed  it is amazing that though above eight persons was entrusted with this transaction and i remained three days in the place after it happened not one betrayed the secret early next morning it was known the gibbet was cut down and it occurred to every body that it was done by my relations to put a veil over their shame by burying the body but when my brother was summoned to the mayors house in order to be questioned and he denied knowing any thing of the matter little more stir was made about it beeause he was respected by all the neighboring gentlemen and in some measure because i persisted in being innocent of the fact for which i suffered  thus was i delivered from an ignominious death but how was i to dispose of my life now i had regained it to stay in england was impossible without exposing myself to the terrors of the law in this dilemna a fortunate circumstance occurred there had lain at my brothers house some of the principal officers of a privateer that was preparing for a cruize and just then ready to sail the captain offered to take me aboard with him and proper necessaries being provided for me my sister giving me ten guineas in my pocket recommended me to the protection of god and the worthy commander who received me in the light of his clerk and a sort of underassistant to his purser  we had been six months out upon our cruize having had but indifferent success when being on the coast of florida then in the hands of the spaniards we fell in with a squadron of their men of war and being consequently taken without striking a stroke were all brought prisoners into the harbor of st helens i was really tired of my life and should have been glad to have ended it in the dungeon where with forty others of my countrymen the enemy had put me but after three years confinement we were let out in order to be put on board transports to be conveyed to pennsylvania and from thence to england this was a disagreeable sentence to me taking it for granted that a return home would be a return to the gallows being therefore a tolerable master of the spanish language i solicited to be left behind which favor i obtained by means of the master of the prison and he not only took me into his house as soon as my countrymen were gone but in a short time procured me a small salary from the governor for being his deputy  indeed at this particular time the office was by no means agreeable the coast had been long infested with pirates the most desperate gang of villains that can be imagined and scarce a month passed but one or other of their vessels fell into the governors hands and the crew as constantly was put under my care once i very narrowly escaped being knocked on the head by one of the ruffians and having the keys took from me another time i was shot at it is true in both cases the persons suffered for their attempt and in the last i thought a little too cruelly for the person that let off the carabine was not only put to the torture to confess his accomplices but afrwards broke on the wheel where he was left to expire the most shocking spectacle i ever beheld  i had been in my office about three months when a ship arrived from port royal another spanish settlement on the coast and nine english prisoners on board i was standing in the street as they were coming up from the port to the governors house i thought something struck me in the face of one of the prisoners that i had before been acquainted with i could not then stop them for us to speak together but in about an hour after they were all brought to the prison there to be lodged till the governor signified his further pleasure  as soon as the poor creatures found i was an englishman they were extremely happy even in their distressed situation though indeed they were treated with lenity enough and only sent to the prison till a lodging could be provided for them they having been in the course of the war made prisoners as well as myself and then on their return home i now had an opportunity of taking notice of the man whose face i thought i knew and i was more and more confirmed that i was not mistaken and i verily thought that this was the man for whose supposed murder i suffered so much in england and the thought being strong in my head i could not sleep all night  the morning after their arrival i told them that if any of them had a mind to go about the town i would procure them permission and go with them this man said he would go and it was as i wished three other prisoners that went along with us walked a little in advance i then took the opportunity and looking in his face sir said i was you ever at deal i believe he at that instant had some recollection of me for putting his hand on my shoulder tears burst into his eyes sir said i if you are the man i take you for you here see before you one of the most unfortunate of human kind sir is your name richard collins he replied yes then cried i i was hanged and gibbeted upon your account in england  after our first salutation and mutual surprise in meeting being over he made me give him a circumstantial detail of every thing that happened to me in england from the moment we parted i never see any man express such concern as he did while i was pursuing my melancholy adventures but when i came to the circumstance of my being hanged and afterward hung in chains i could hardly prevail upon him to believe my relation till backed by the most solemn asseverations pronounced in the most serious manner when i had done well said he young man for i was then but in my   th year mr collins might be about three and forty if you have sustained misfortunes on my account do not imagine though i cannot lay them at your door that i have been without my sufferings god knows my heart i am most exceedingly sorry for the injustice that has been done you but the ways of providence are unsearchable he then informed me by what accident all my troubles had been brought about  when you left me in bed said he having at first waked with an oppression i could not account for i found myself exceedingly sick and weak i groaned and sighed and thought myself going to die when accidentally putting my hand to my left arm in which i had been blooded the morning before i found my shirt wet and in short that the bandage having slipped the orifice was again opened and a great flux of blood ensued this immediately accounted for the condition i found myself in i thought however i would not disturb the family which had gone to bed very late i therefore mustered all my strength and got up with my nightgown loose about me in order to go to a neighboring barber who had bled me and have him to tie up my arm he lived directly opposite to our house but when i got in the street and crossed the way in order to knock at his door a band of men armed with cutlasses and hangers came and siezed me and hurried me to the beach i begged and prayed but they soon silenced my cries by clapping a gag in my mouth at first i took them for a press gang though i soon found they were a gang of ruffians belonging to a privateer aboard which they immediately brought me but before i got thither loss of blood occasioned me to faint away the surgeon of the ship i suppose tied up my arm for when my senses returned i found myself in a hammock and somebody feeling my pulse the vessel being then under way i asked where i was they said i was safe enough i immediately called for my night gown it was brought me but of a considerable sum of money that was in the pocket of it i could get no account i complained to the captain of the violence that had been done me and of the robbery his men had committed but he laughed at me and said i should soon have prize money enough to make me amends so i was obliged to submit and for three months they forced me to work before the mast at last we met the same fate that you did and by adventures parallel to your own you see me here on my return to our native country and if you will accompany me i shall think myself happy  there was nothing to prevent my going to england and the ship being to sail in ten days in it mr collins and i determined to embark i told my master my resolution he did not disuade me from it because it gave him the opportunity of getting the office i held to a kinsman of his to whom that very day i delivered up my trust and here providence was no less remarkable to me than in other particulars of my life for that night the pirates siezed on the young man while locking up the wards took the keys from him and left him for dead and before the alarm could be given five of them made their escape by means of piratical boats that kept hovering about the coast  on the   th of november      having made all my little preparations i sent my trunk aboard the nostra senora michael deronza master the vessel was to sail that evening and about seven oclock being sitting with signor gaspar my master a lad came up and said the boat had been waiting for me and that mr collins was on board i ran into the house for a small bundle and taking leave of the family made what haste i could to the quay but found the boat had put off and left word i should overtake them at a little bay i ran along the shore and imagined i had a sight of the boat and hallooed as loud as i could they answered and put about to take me in but we had scarce got fifty yards from land when on looking for mr collins i missed him and then i found that instead of getting aboard my own boat which i could see a considerable way ahead i had got into a boat belonging to the pirates i attempted to leap overboard but was prevented by one of the crew who gave me a stroke on the head which laid me senseless and i found afterward they mistook me for one of their men who had been sent to purchase something in the town  with these pirates i continued some years till they upon a dispute threw me overboard i was saved by a boat belonging to a spanish ship after various misfortunes our ship was taken by an algerine roer the greatest part of the crew was killed and the rest taken prisoners among which i was one having lost one of my legs in the action  after this i passed a long and painful slavery in algiers till with other english captives i was released by agreement between the dy of algiers and his brittanick majesty in the year    0 i returned to england the first thing i did was to enquire after my relations but all those nearest to me were dead and i found mr collins had never returned home so i suppose he died in his passage though not an old man i was so enfeebled by hardships that i was unable to work and being without any manner of support i could think of no way of getting my living but by begging  finis
