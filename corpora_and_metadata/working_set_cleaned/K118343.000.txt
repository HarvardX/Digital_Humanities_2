a comparative statement of the two bills for the better government of the british possessions in india brought into parliament by mr fox and mr pit with explanatory observations  by r b sheridan esquire  dublin printed by p byrne no  0  graftonstreet mdcclxxxviii  to j m esquire   staffordshire dear sir you request from me with infinitely more importunity than the thing is worth a copy of the short comparison between mr foxs india bill and mr pitts which i read in my place in the house of commons in the last days debate upon the declaratory act i now send it to you with a number of notes or observations which i have been induced to add to it from a desire of complying more fully with what i conceive to be your object in asking for the paper i have been led into more length than i intended on the subject and this must be my apology for not having obeyed your commands sooner  you will perceive however that i have not in these remarks paid your judgment so ill a compliment as to have endeavored to engage your attention by labored arguments still less by any attempt at ornament i have endeavored merely to be intelligible and to confine the illustrations i adopt to facts if upon the whole you should be of opinion that these papers contain a fair statement of the true meaning of the two bills and some just comments upon that meaning they are at your disposal to be put into any persons hands you please or to be given to the public if it is thought worth while to do so  the comparison itself i wrote in the house of commons during the debate from feeling it i confess a teazing circumstance to hear gentlemen of the most respectable abilities day after day arguing upon and drawing parallels between the provisions of the two bills upon which it was perfectly obvious they had not condescended to bestow any very minute degree of attention and conceiving it to be no very difficult task to reduce the discussion to a plain and concise statement of fact with regard to mr foxs bill i do venture peremptorily to assert that there never was a legislative measure so little examined so generally misunderstood and so confidently misrepresented  you acknowledge yourself to be one of those who have been in some degree of error on the subject and you confess that you now begin to see the measure itself as well as the conduct of those who opposed it in a new point of view and that you meet with many who confess the same nay some even of those who were formerly most violent on this topic have in your hearing acknowledged you say and you seem to expect me to triumph in the intelligence that mr pitts bill is very like if not quite as bad as mr foxs  you will forgive my saying however that this is a compromise which we never shall accept even as the overture of returning confidence from those whose good opinion we most regretted to lose in fact there is no resemblance between the two bills in any circumstance excepting only the little ceremony with which they both treated the charter of the company nor could any person who supported mr foxs bill and still approves the measure give his countenance to mr pitts with the smallest degree of consistency  but examine the subject fairly yourself upon the plain ground of fact  i will not attempt to bias your opinion by any previous argument  you will receive with this a copy of the other bill brought in by mr fox which you say you never saw entitled a bill for the better government of the territorial possessions and dependencies in india this bill accompanied what is usually called  mr foxs india bill but is seldom mentioned although it formed a very essential part of the plan and the consideration of it is extremely necessary to the understanding the principle and main object of the system  i send you also a copy of mr pitts bill as it came out of the committee when it was reprinted with its alterations and amendments in looking it over i do not desire you to take notice of the ludicrous manner in which it is pieced and patched and corrected and altered almost from the beginning to the end merely to convince you of the sad slovenly style in which the act was framed but in order that you may compare the spirit and obvious purpose of some of these alterations with the text as it first stood by doing which you will be much better enabled to judge of the true meaning of the original act than by any thing you can learn from the declaratory law  as to the declaratory law itself and the plea which was made for it  we seem to be perfectly agreed upon that subject the papers laid before the house of commons certainly contain as you observe a complete refutation of all the pretenses upon which the sending out the four regiments to india was defended as a measure of necessity and still more strongly do i agree with you in your remarks upon declaratory acts in general and upon the nature of this declaratory act in particular it is indeed an alarming and an unfortunate event in the history of parliament  for it is one that shakes the foundation of that security which all men hope from law and of that respect which all men owe to it  to see the representatives of the people persuaded to intercept the ordinary course of justice to assume themselves a judicial character and upon the suggestion of the kings ministers to determine a question of property in favor of the servants of the crown against the claims of the subject  nor can our apprehensions of the consequences of this precedent be diminished by reflecting upon the manner in which the measure was carried through the house of lords by reflecting that the supreme court of judicature in this country should have been induced by any influence or by any eloquence or upon any plea of necessity pretended or real to decide  with unparalleled precipitation  upon a construction of law  in the absence of the judges of the land and without granting a hearing to the parties interested in their decision  yet possibly you will be surprised when i add that it is because i perfectly and cordially agree with you in your observations upon these proceedings that i do not so readily adopt the conclusion you have drawn with regard to the advantage which the exparty i use your own phrase is supposed to have obtained in consequence of the weak conduct of the administration in this business  if this party  whose general principles fidelity of attachment and openness of conduct you own you respect  but own it with the splenetic reluctance of one who has been in vain endeavoring to look for system uninion or plain dealing elsewhere  if this party had no other object but to retort popular invectives to detect the sinister views of political adversaries to lessen the confidence of parliament in their measures or to shake the opinion of their consequence in another quarter there undoubtedly was cause for considerable triumph in the late events  and of still fairer triumph perhaps in the opportunity afforded of vindicating their own characters under circumstances of great advantage and upon grounds the most embarrassing to their opponents but understanding as i trust i do the terms and conditions upon which alone that party will ever seek to obtain or consent to hold ministerial situations in this country i never shall admit that their cause can be essentially advanced by any legislative measure which tends to lower the house of commons in the public estimation and to deprive parliament of the respect and confidence of the country  upon such occasions whatever advantage this or that set of men may gain in debate or in public opinion  theirs only is the triumph who love not the popular part of our constitution whose credit and whose principles prosper in the abasement of all popular character and who would at any time be content to participate in the reproach of an odious measure provided it reflected superior disgrace on parliament as the instrument of effecting it  but i am getting upon ground which may lead us from the subject i wish to press to your more immediate attention  i shall therefore only add that i am  with great truth and regard your sincere and obedient servant richard brinsley sheridan brutonstreet march   th      copy of a paper read by mr sheridan in the house of commons on friday the   th day of march      the professed object of the two bills for the better government of the british possessions in india brought into parliament the one by mr fox in      and the other by mr pit in      was to relieve the natives of that country from the many evils which they had experienced under the dominion of or in consequence of their connection with the government of the company of the united merchants trading to the east indies it was assumed by the framers of both bills that this relief was not to be expected from the government of the company constituted as it then was and it was admitted by both that the patronage and influence of the company ought not to be transferred to the crown  a mr foxs bill  discontinued the powers and authorities of the company for the term of four years and transferred those powers and no more or others for the said term to seven directors named by parliament to be by them exercised in trust for and for the benefit of the said company  b mr foxs bill did not affect to separate the right of nominating and appointing the persons to be entrusted and employed in executing the measures of government in india from the right of originating and directing the measures themselves  c mr foxs bill did not pretend at once to divide the commercial from the political interests or the trade from the revenues of the company and did therefore provide that nine assistant directors nominated by parliament from among the proprietors of east india stock should form a board for the sole purpose of ordering and managing the commerce of the said united company under and subject to the orders and directions of the said superior board  d mr foxs bill did not pretend to be founded in any respect upon the consent of the company nor to produce a system of reform agreeable to or concerted with those whose abuse of power it professed to remedy  e mr foxs bill established no fourth estate nor gave any one power to the directors therein named which did not before exist in the company but on the contrary did limit and restrain the said directors so appointed by parliament in various particulars in which the companys directors were not before restrained  f mr foxs bill so far from placing the directors named by parliament above the executive government of the country and out of the reach of its inspection and control did expressly and distinctly place them under the same obligation to communicate their transactions to his majestys ministers for the time being and did expressly and distinctly make them subordinate and amenable to his majestys pleasure and to the directions of his ministers in the same manner and upon the same footing and under the same limitations and restrictions as the regulating act of      and the act of      and various other acts had placed the court of directors chosen and appointed by the company  g earl fitzwilliam and the other directors under mr foxs bill could neither have had transactions with any of the country powers in the east indies nor have directed hostilities against nor have concluded treaties with any state or power but subject to the orders of his majesty and his royal will and pleasure signified to them by the secretary of state they were bound by law to obey  h mr foxs bill placed the whole of the powers taken from the company in the new government established at home in order that they might be executed under the inspection and control of the legislature and of the public  i mr foxs bill established no system of mystery and concealment in the management of affairs of any sort but on the contrary did expressly provide that the conduct of the board established by that bill should be clear and open that their opinions should be given in no covert manner and that their motives of conduct as well as their measures should stand recorded on their journals signed with the name of each director thereby making them responsible to parliament and to their country by the best pledge and security for responsibility  an explicit avowal of their purposes at the time they resolved on their measures  k mr foxs bill avowed its object clearly and distinctly and was worded with such plainness and precision as to leave no room for misconstruction nor need of explanation in the minds of any but of those who would not take the trouble to examine it or who chose to misunderstand it or who were incapable of understanding any thing  l mr foxs bill was a measure of experiment the term of duration limited to four years and during that period the affairs of the company were placed so immediately and intelligibly under the eye of parliament that a permanent and well digested system for the future government of those valuable possessions might reasonably have been expected from the wisdom of the legislature before that term should have been expired a system that might have restored to the company all rights and peges which consistenty with the ends of good government they could possese and have provided  and effectual securities to the constitution wherever the judgment of parliament should have found it necessary to add to the power and influence of the crown  a mr pitts bill continues the form of the companys government and professes to leave the patronage under certain conditions and the commerce without condition in the bands of the company but places all matters relating to the civil and military government and revenues in the hands of six commissioners to be nominated and appointed by his majesty under the title of  commissioners for the affairs of india which board of commissioners is invested with the superintendance and control over all the british territorial possessions in the east indies and over the affairs of the united company of merchants trading thereto  b mr pitts bill denies to his commissioners any right of nominating or appointing to any office civil or military but it reserves to them the power of annulling every appointment of the company in a right of recalling every person civil or military in the companys service as well as an exclusive right to censure or approve suspend or reward according to their judgment and discretion  c mr pitts bill professes to divide the polical and commercial interests of the company between the board of control and the directors but denies to the directors the right to manage order or direct their commercial concerns in india unless their dispatches shall have received the sanction of the signatures of the members of the board of control and in case the said board should directly interfere in the commerce of the company the remedy provided for the directors is an appeal to the king in council against the decision of his majestys ministers and his majestys decision in council is final and conclusive it also gives to the board of control while it professes to leave the trade of the company independent an absolute power over the territorial revenues of the company in india the clear profits arising from which after defraying the charges and expenses attending the same form the principal if not the sole fund upon which their trade with india is now carried on  d mr pitts bill was avowedly communicated to the directors of the company and to the proprietors its several provisions discussed by them and many material alterations were made in the plan after it had been brought into parliament declaredly for the purpose of according to the suggestions and granting the explanations required by the company upon this ground the bill passed and since that time there is scarce any one right or power which the company conceived to have been secured to them which in the opinion of the court of directors has not been broken in upon by the board of control  the commissioners supporting their own construction of the law against the fruitless expostulations and remonstrances of the directors  e mr pitts bill has established a fourth or new estate or department of government with powers infinitely exceeding those possessed by the court of directors or court of proprietors at the time when the said board of control was established  f mr pitts bill has expressly repealed all the provisions in the said acts which gave to his majesty any right power or authority to interfere in any matter or concern of the british government in india and has made the board of control wholly independent in the exercise of their offices of the general executive government of the country they being neither bound to abide by his majestys will and pleasure or even to communicate with his majesty upon any one measure or matter relating to india of any sort whatever  g mr dundas with any two more commissioners may transact matters of any sort with the country powers may treat with or ally with or declare war against or make peace with all or any of the powers or princes of india may levy armies there to any extent and command the whole revenues of all our possessions for their support without taking his majestys pleasure upon any of the subjects in any shape and without acting in his name or under his authority and these things he may do against the will of the directors and without the knowledge of parliament so that in truth the present board of control ave under mr pitts bill separated and usurped those very imperial prerogatives from the crown which were falsely said to have been given to the new board of directors under mr foxs bill  h mr pitts bill assisted by the explanatory act of  beside the new and  powers given to the board of control at home has given to the governors and presidents abroad the most and extravagant authorities  unlike any thing that could have been supposed to originate in a free state and utterly irreconcilable to the spirit of the british constitution by virtue of which despotic authority among other enormities which under the name of government may be committed the governor or president of the council may upon his single pleasure seize and secure any british subjectin india of whatever rank or situation and upon the accusation only of any one person cause him to be thrown on shipboard or imprisoned until there shall be a convenient opportunity of sending him to england where by the same bill  a new tribunal and proceeding  equally unheard of in the constitution  are provided for his trial  i mr pitts bill has provided a secret committee in the court of directors who are bound by a solemn oath from which the board of control alone can release them and through the secret committee who are bound to obey all orders of that board as the servants in india are bound to obey all orders of the secret committee all the enormous powers and prerogatives before mentioned may be exercised without a possibility should the commissioners so please either that the king the company or parliament shall ever hear even of such orders until they shall have been carried into full effect  k mr pitts bill in the preamble to all its clauses professes objects directly contrary to its enactments and is worded either with such crafty ambiguity or such contemptuous negligence that neither those whose interests were to be most affected by it nor those who have argued most in support of it have ever been able to agree upon its meaning and the present declaratory law is the fourth subsidiary statute which in the space of four years has in vain endeavored to explain the original act  l mr pitts bill and all its explanatory and supplemental acts are perpetual laws and profess to be a final arrangement for the government of india by which means the company is wholly at the mercy of the board of control not only with respect to the renewal of their charter of exclusive trade but with respect to their claim of property in the territorial revenues in india as well as in their corporate capacity as merchants entitled to a free trade in common with the rest of the kings subjects although their monopoly should not be renewed and in this situation they are placed in direct violation of the says of the legislature engaged to them for a valuable consideration upon a solemn compact  while neither against the board of control acting on purposes of exclusive power and ambition nor against the crown acting in collusion with the board of control and covertly directing its measures and its influence is there any provision made for the danger which may arise to the constitution  observations a patronage  patronage in the hands of the company   the purposes to which the board of control may apply their power and the connection of that power with patrouage is strongly exemplified in their dispute with the directors relative to the settlement of the nabob of arcots debts to individuals amounting to nearly four millions sterling the directors in pursuance of the positive injunctions of mr pitts bill conceiving themselves indispensably bound to direct an inquiry to be instituted into the justice and origin of these debts draw up their orders to the presidency of madras accordingly they soon learn however that they have another master stronger than the law for the board of control compel them to admit the whole of these debts without any such investigation as the law directed the directors remonstrate in vain contrary to what they declare to be their sense of the trust reposed in them contrary to what they conceive to be their duty under the law they are compelled to execute the orders of the board of control as if they had been grounded on their own judgts and conviction  the commissioners further adding  that if any creditor shall be found refractory or be disposed to  the arrangement we have suggested he shall be dismissed the service and sent home to england  signed henry dundas mulgrave walsingham w w grenville  th octob        nominating or appointing   it has been urged that mr pitts bill had the merit of expressly directing a reduction of the establishments in india and of restricting both the directors and the board of control from sending out new servants not even a cadet beyond what was actually necessary to keep up the proper complement of officers upon the reduced establishment was to be permitted to sail from england  no such restriction undoubtedly was imposed upon the directors to be appointed under mr foxs bill parliament conceived that they had a better security and the event has shown that they could not have taken a worse this cannot be placed in a stronger light than by supposing that lord fitzwilliam and his associates in the new arrangement had called aloud for checks to be imposed upon them had solicited to be restrained from the power of dissipating the companys revenue and creating a military patronage at their expense had taken credit for tying up their own hands in their own bill and  within a short time after while the company had six hundred officers reduced by the peace establishment in india had created an opportunity for sending out eighty six new officers appointed by themselves at an expense to the company of  0000l per annum in peace and   000l per annum in war without a single plea or pretense which would not have been better answered by sending out the man without the officers  a right of recalling every person in october      the directors inform the board of control that they have appointed john holland esquire an old servant of the company to succeed to the government of fort st george upon the death removal or resignation of lord macartney  the board of control  the directors right of appointment but remonstrate against the nomination upon certain grounds giving mr holland however due praise they add that it is their wish to enforce to the directors the propriety in every appointment not only of avoiding blameable appointments but such as may be open to plausible misrepresentation  the directors maintain their right and observe that the board are interfering in matters to which their control professedly does not extend the board of control withdraw their opposition with saying if the reasons which we have assigned do not satisfy the court of directors we have certainly no right to control their opinion mr holland however is peremptorily informed that if he sails for india under the directors appointment he will be recalled the instant he arrives there  the dispute ends and sir archibald campbell the friend of mr dundas by a due exertion of the avowed weight of influence is appointed in his place  censure and applause in july      the directors reprimanded colonel ross for what they maintained to be an outrageous contempt of their authority the board of control alter the dispatch and refuse to let the reprimand stand the directors remonstrate and declare that the present occasion appears to them so momentous and a submission on their part so destructive of all order and subordination in india that they must take the liberty of informing the right honorable board that no dispatch can be sent to india which does not contain their the directors final decision on lieutenant colonel ross  the matter is compromised  with a declaration on the part of the board of control in these words   we trust however that by this acquiescence it will not be understood that we mean to recognize any power in you to transmit to india either censure or approbation of the conduct of any servant civil or military exclusive of the control of this board  signed henry dundas walsingham w w grenville mulgrave    suspending and rewarding in july      the court of directors disapprove of certain allowances or gratuities made to sir john dalling by the government of fort st george and tell their president that upon a full examination of the matter they think he has acted improperly the board of control new model the dispatch and oblige the directors to say that upon mature consideration they are perfectly satisfied assuring them that if they will peruse their own papers again they the board of control are persuaded you will be disposed to alter your opinion even more than we have altered your dispatch  the court of directors alarmed as they express themselves in a case of a similar nature respecting colonel geilss allowances at the boards exercising a power over their purse not conceiving it to have been the intention of the act to give the board such a power remonstrate respectfully upon the occasion and declare that they have endeavored to adhere to a system of economy which the condition of their finances require and the legislature has thought fit to command and should be happy to meet the approbation and support of the right honorable board therein the act of parliament they add we conceive meant to vest in your right honorable board a controuling power respecting the great objects of the government of the companys affairs and to leave the liquidation of accounts for services performed and all such details in the court of directors  the board of control inform them  that they continue to be of their former opinion  they are at a loss to understand the grounds of objection to their right of control in this business as the claims of sir john dalling though he is now out of your service are founded upon his right when he was in your service and are to be paid out of the revenues of india and of course your opinions upon them must be subject to our revision the directors finding themselves without a remedy answer  we feel ourselves under the necessity of acquiescing in the determination of your right honorable board but we trust upon further consideration your right honorable board will not make such allowances a perpetual charge upon the company  with these instances thus briefly stated selected from a number of similar cases and relating to the powers exercised by the board of control with respect to civil appointments censure and applause reward and punishment military promotion and the purse of the company will it be credited that any many should have been stout enough to assert in the house of commons that the whole business of patronage was left exclusively in the hands of the company and that the board of control would not even take it if it were offered to them  in truth the question whether or not the present board of control possess the whole or any share of the patronage in india has lately been placed in a plainer light by the unguarded confessions of those who supported the declaratory bill than by any thing that could be said by those who opposed it some gentlemen defined the authority of the board on this head to be a power of circuitous nomination others appointment by the weight of influence others the right of authoritative recommendation but by whatever name it is called or however the exercise of it may be disclaimed these facts are plain  st that all the unbounded means of patronage and protection which the governor general and the presidents of the different councils possess belong to those to whom in reality they owe their appointments and to whom only in fact they owe obedience  dly that the board of control are obviously seizing the whole of the military patronage into their own hands the intention of extinguishing the companys service being plainly avowed  dly that no person can look for protection to any quarter but to the board or think of accepting any appointment against their will in the civil line  one distinction however is constantly taken upon this subject namely that mr pitts commissioners do not meddle with the patronage at home which it is affirmed would have been at the disposal of lord fitzwilliams board under mr foxs bill this patronage whatever it is is always magnified and never explained as far as it means the nomination of clerks and other officers at the india house it is not an object very much worth dispute but as far as it relates to contracts and money laid out in shipping and trade at home it should not be forgotten that the management of these matters was not placed in lord fitzwilliams board by mr foxs bill but in a board of assistant directors appointed by parliament from among the then existing directors or proprietors of india stock for that special purpose these assistant directors however being bound to obey the orders of the superior board lord fitzwilliam might have commanded their patronage and perverted their commercial dealings to his own political purposes  granted  there was certainly no security against so flagrant an abuse of trust but in the character of the person trusted and what reason is there to think that the present board of control have no weight of influence with respect to this very patronage if they chose to act as they suppose lord fitzwilliam would have done or who is there that does not see that the court of directors are becoming every day mere instruments in the hands of this board and that there can be nothing of exclusive patronage belonging to them more than would have belonged to the assistant directors under mr foxs bill in plain sense the whole and only difference in point of patronage between the two boards is that by mr foxs bill it was given directly and must have been exercised openly by mr pitts bill it is given circuitously and may be exercised secretly  c  appeal to the king   the application to the king in council which mr pitts bill declares it shall be lawful for the court of directors to make whenever they conceive the orders of the board not to relate to points connected with the civil or military government and revenues in india is a strange mockery when gravely held out to the company as a security against encroachment or interference in commercial matters on the part of the board of control it proves however how perfectly distinct in theory at least the framers of this bill considered the board of control from the general executive government of the country  the limits of the authority of the directors are circumscribed within certain bounds and if they transgress them or refuse obedience where the law has commanded them to pay it redress is provided in the common course of law the law also prescribes limits to the authority and control of the commissioners but it provides no redress should they transgress them the most flagrant abuse of their trust under their own bill would be in any instance to assume the management of the companys commerce yet if they can craftily effect this they may do it with impunity and whenever they are opposed if they can procure the sanction of the council on their side that is fairly speaking of themselves in a different character  they have the law on their side also  but there is nothing more curious than to observe the preposterous and degrading office which these zealous advocates for the dignity and prerogatives of the crown have provided for the monarch were ever such an appeal to be made  his majesty in council shall decide whether the dispatch or order referred to his royal judgment be or be not connected with the civil or military government and revenues of the territories and possessions in india and this decision is to be made upon such statements and information as the parties shall condescend to favor him with upon subjects wholly removed from the ordinary contemplation of his majestys government mr dundas asserts that the measure proposed belongs to his department exclusively  being a measure relating to war or peace or negotiation or revenue and that therefore his will and pleasure ought to have been implicitly obeyed the directors humbly contend without presuming to question the sovereignity of the board of control that the measure is of a commercial nature merely  his majesty sits the unprincely umpire between his contending subjects deciding upon the extent of imperial prerogatives in the exercise of which he has neither will nor voice  but if any thing further were wanting to show the falacy of this pretended security to the rights of the company we find it amply made out in the notable device of compelling the directors to establish a secret committee to be solely under the orders of the board of control the secret committee was accordingly soon employed contrary to the professed purpose of its institution and it was as soon predicted that the whole affair of an appeal to the king in council might at once be evaded by the board of control directing through their secret agents as matter connected with revenue or negotiation whatever commercial arrangement they pleased  but it occurred to no man that the board would be so unwary at least till the system should be more fully established as to endeavor to adopt a precedent for a right of direct control and management over commercial matters without cover or pretense by means of or in collusion with the secret committee yet has this already been the case the secret committee to whom however no intentional illconduct is meant to be imputed on the first of june      assume in concert with the board of control powers from which both by law and the nature of their trust they were equally excluded they take upon themselves to direct a purchase of cotton to be made at bombay for exportation to china and order five ships to receive the cargo and direct the remittance of a considerable sum from home to answer the expense all without the authority or knowledge of the directors the board of control approve the measure and the dispatch in the following terms unguardedly called in the house of commons   blindly lending their name in the usual form  whitehall  d june      approved by the board with an omission of the words within brackets  beginning at considering the and ending at controul in the fourth paragraph of this draft  w pit henry dundas w w grenville mulgrave    the measure itself also was so far from being universally approved of by the court of directors when made known to them as was also unguardedly insinuated that a very strong protest against the whole proceeding was entered upon the records of the company in which it was declared to be a transaction  contrary to the original constitution of the company and to every subsequent act of parliament which has passed relative to its affairs and that if the like power shall be extended to other objects and to other presidencies which it may be under the same pretext on which it has been assumed and exercised on the present occasion the collective authority of the court of directors will be annihilated the legal mode of conducting the companys business set aside and another system introduced illegal in itself and dangerous in its consequences  signed joseph sparks richard hall john roberts francis baring george cuming charles mills  east india house   nd august       it is plain that no proceeding could be more unwarrantable in all its parts the board of control gave an illegal sanction to an illegal transaction and both parties seem to have been surprised into a small neglect of the spirit of their oath of office the members of the secret committee take an oath that they will according to the best of their skill and judgment faithfully execute the several trusts and powers reposed in them as members of the secret committee appointed by the directors of the united company of merchants trading to the east indies  they also swear secrecy to the board of control but the trust required by their oath to the directors is clearly to confine themselves to the purposes of their appointment and those purposes are accurately defined by the act that authorizes their institution to be the executing of the secret orders and instructions of the board of control concerning the levying of war or making of peace or treating or negotiating with any of the native princes or states of india the board of control also swear to execute faithfully the several powers and trusts reposed in them by the spirit of which oath they are unquestionably precluded from circumventing the court of directors in the management of their commerce whether the transaction itself was likely to be profitable or otherwise to the company is nothing to the purpose the consequences to which the principles and the precedent lead must be obvious to every one   power over the territorial revenues the court of directors in the last statement of their affairs laid before parliament directed the attention of the house of commons to the two funds from which their resources are to arise and from which they are to derive the means of extricating themselves from their difficulties these are the profits of their trade with india and china and the surplus of their territorial revenues the formet they state upon a very sanguine calculation of their probable amount as sufficient besides providing for the china investment to pay the debts then engaged to be discharged at home and the debts proposed to be brought home from india to which purpose their faith is engaged the latter the surplus of their territorial revenue as the fund upon which their india investment is to depend and over this fund the board of control claim an absolute power  d expostulation and remonstrances of the directors the differences which have subsisted between the court of directors and the board of control have not been upon measures or upon matters of opinion or upon trivial points but all of them upon questions of right of law and upon the nature and limits of their respective powers such differences however will probably no more be heard of  the last ineffectual struggle of the company appears to have been made in one dispute they tried in vain to obtain the ministers countenance to apply to the representatives of the people to arbitrate between them and the board of control in another they requested to be permitted to apply to the king  this was also refused in the last they looked for redress in an appeal to the courts of justice in this they were frustrated by the legislature being induced to think it proper to decide the point and declare the law against them thus circumstanced shut out from law parliament and the throne it is but reasonable to believe that the court of directors will no more be heard of but as an instrument to serve the ambition or to skreen the misconduct of their masters  e fourth estate  new estate or department   the purposes and characters of men have been often misrepresented and misunderstood through the efforts and prejudices of party but it is a most singular circumstance that nearly a whole nation should have been persuaded to understand a bill passed in the house of commons and given to the public in print in a manner directly contrary to its plain meaning and express provisions and that even sober and rational men should have joined in the outcry against it without giving themselves the trouble to examine whether it really was the measure which it was represented to be  whatever other faults were found with mr foxs bill nothing certainly operated more in the clamor that was raised against it than a confused notion that it some way or other attacked the prerogatives of the crown and aimed to take from the king certain powers and authorities which of right belonged to him this idea whether urged by the mob as an attempt to take the crown from the kings head or in the politer jargon of a fourth estate and imperium in imperio was certainly a main ingredient in the delusion which pervaded the country at the last general election yet is it utterly impossible for any man of common sense to read the bill attentively without being puzzled to guess at the ground upon which such a deception could so long have been maintained  mr foxs bill enacted in fact nothing new of any sort with respect to the royal authority nor did it contain any one thing in derogation of any one prerogative of the crown if the existence of directors for the management of the affairs of the east india company constituted a fourth estate that fourth estate existed before and this very phrase is to be found in pamphlets written against this very company twenty years since if a parliamentary nomination of persons to be concerned in the government of india was an attack upon the constitution the constitution had sustained and survived a similar attack in the regulating act of      and in the subsequent bills which repeated those parliamentary appointments if the employing the patronage of the company without the kings authority was an invasion of his prerogative it was of a prerogative never heard of for the crown had never had the grant of a single office civil or military belonging to the service of the east india company in fact so far as the crown was concerned at all it acquired in the right of nominating to the vacant offices in the new commission a power the king had never possessed before whether the new directors for the affairs of india were likely to make a better government than the old is not the question the extraordinary circumstance is that this bill which left the crown in the full possession of its prerogatives of war peace and negotiation in india should have been represented as depriving it of its just rights and raising a parliamentary commussion above its authority and that mr pitts bill which actually strips the throne of those main ensigns of imperial authority should have been universally admitted at least to have the merit of a due deference to the rights and person of the sovereign  however when people are pressed to explain what their meaning is  they are compelled to own that when they speak of a fourth estate and an overthrowing of the constitution and an attack upon the prerogative they do not mean that all this was done or attempted by the bill but  that these things might have come to pass in consequence of it  because say they a great political party having got possession of the patronage of india for four years they would instantly have become so strong that the king could not easily have dismissed them and so the prerogative would have been invaded this party would also in time by means of this patronage have been able to obtain a predominant party in parliament and so the constitution would have been destroyed now to make any sense of the first objection it is necessary to assert as all violent people did that although the king she should have thought proper to have dismissed the duke of portlands administration and had been equally desirous of changing the indian administration yet that lord fitzwilliam and his board could have held complete and independent possession of the government of india for four years in spite of his royal wishes and have applied all the patronage and influence of their situation to the support of the exministers this is literally what every man meant who meant any thing or who had any sincere alarm on the subject that the mere vulgar or very ignorant people should have adopted this notion is not very strange considering the pains which were taken to circulate it but that a person of lord camdens character accustomed to consider laws with temper and deliberation should now again have gravely detailed all this sort of argument in the house of lords have warned them against this fourth estate this imperium in imperio asserting as is reported that had his majesty thought proper by virtue of his undoubted prerogative to have dismissed mr fox and his party from his service we might have seen the king of great britain and the king of bengal contending in parliament for superiority is a matter altogether surprising  it is surprising because the whole of the  if seriously urged must arise from a perfect misapprehension of the bill and be founded upon the false and perverse notion before stated that the board appointed by it was placed out of the reach and above the control of the kings ministers for the time being two gentlemen of the house of commons of great ability and character mr scott and mr harding  confessed very heartily that they had been in a mistake with respect to this part of the bill they still however persisted to argue upon conclusions founded upon acknowledged error  what is the real case  mr foxs bill enacts that the said directors hereby appointed or any three of them shall have use possess exercise all and singular the powers and authorities which have been at any time heretofore vested in or lawfully exercised by the said directors hereby discontinued or proprietors or by the general court of proprietors of the said united company and all such farther and other powers and authorities and under such directions and subject to such limitations and restrictions as in this act or in any other act the provisions where of are not hereby altered or repealed are contained for the government and management of the said territorial possessions revenues and commerce of the said united company or in any wise relative thereto and further that in all cases whatsoever where any act matter or thing is directed to be done or consented to or any accounts or writings to be signed by the directors hereby discontinued such act matter or thing shall from and after the commercement of this act be done or consented to and such accounts or writings shall be signed by three of the directors hereby appointed  now in order to understand what the real situation of the new directors would have been and what the extent of their powers it should seem that the natural thing was to examine what were the directions limitations and restrictions not expressly repealed under which they were left in this case it would have appeared  that lord fitzwilliam and his board were bound to communicate to his majestys ministers for the time being an exact copy of all dispatches and letters received from india or proposed to be sent thither which should  any way relate to the revenues or to the civil and military affairs and government of the said united company  that lord fitzwilliam and his board were bound to pay due obedience to and to be governed and bound by such instructions as they should receive from his majesty by one of his majestys principal secretaries of state in all their conduct and transactions and in those of their governors presidents and councils respectively with the country powers in the east indies and also in regard to the levying war and making peace  that lord fitzwilliam and his board had no means of using the credit of the east india company for the relief of the companys pressing distresses without the consent and order first had and obtained of the commissioners of his majestys treasury for the time being  that lord fitzwilliam and his board in making provision for the defense of the possessions in the east indies were bound to act on the requisition and under the inspection of the commissioners of his majestys navy and office of ordnance  upon the whole it would have appeared that their board was placed in every important matter under so strong a control of the ministers for the time being and so wholly without the power of acting upon their own judgment or discretion in all the more important objects of their institution that no set of men who were not content from the meanest motives to hold the appearance of power upon the most abject conditions could have remained in their offices a week with an administration desirous to get rid of them let these plain facts be once understood let the state of subordination of the new directors to the kings government be fairly examined and it will be apparent at once  that without having recourse to a parliamentary address  the duke of portlands administration once dismissed the resignation of lord fitzwilliams board must have followed instantly that is if it was the object of the advisers of the crown to change the indian government  if otherwise undoubtedly lord fitzwilliam and his associates were at liberty to continue in a laborious duty without pay or emolument and incapacitated from accepting any place of profit from the crown and to sacrifice their ease and their time under ministers with whom they had no bond of union nor habits of regard from a desire to do good and to effect the great puposes of their appointment  the reform of the abuses in india and the reestablishment of the british character to execute this trust faithfully a rigid scrutiny into past misconduct a severe economy in future arrangements a just disinterested and impartial management of patronage would have been among the first duties expected from them while they so acted if it was the kings pleasure his ministers whoever they were might certainly have abstained from the exercise of the decisive control they possessed over them but then wherein would have consisted the attack on the prerogative or the danger of the constitution but supposing a different conduct to have been pursued by the board  that forgetting what they owed to their own characters as well as to the duties of their station they had perverted the powers of their trust and had endeavored to employ them solely to answer party purposes at home  the remedy was at hand and the first application of it must have been effectual  this being the fact an objection of a different nature may no doubt be instantly made namely that as the king was to nominate to vacancies upon resignation the bill might have been used not to destroy but to increase the power of the crown  the truth is that it were much to be wished that this objection could be as easily answered as the other mr grenville was the only person connected with the present administration who argued the bill upon this ground at the time of its passing through the house of commons the fair answer however is that there was every security taken against this worst of mischiefs which the nature of the measure itself and the urgent necessity which called for it admitted of the public had a pledge in the characters of the persons who framed that bill in the whole tenor of their political life and in their recent and honest exertions to reduce the influence of the crown that it was not their intention at least to deceive or delude them upon this subject  if these ministers were displaced there was the same security in the character of the indian board and in the very principle upon which it had been formed if they too were obliged to abandon their situation these securities certainly vanished and the crown might for whatever term remained of the four years have placed the powers given to the parliamentary trustees in the hands of its own creatures but this could not have been done secretly or silently  not without serious discussion  not without the attention of the public being immediately and forcibly drawn to the subject and to the characters and principles of the new board no new arrangement could pretend to claim the confidence of a parliamentary nomination parliament must therefore have had the matter before them in a new point of view and have become accessory to the surrender if they were to be surrendered of those powers and that patronage to the crown  which all parties professed so much to dread to see lodged there  against such a conduct in parliament there is certainly no remedy nor ever will be  the only thing like an objection on this head remaining is that upon a supposition that his majesty had been pleased to continue the duke of portlands administration for the term of four years for which the india board was appointed the supposed good understanding between the ministers and the new india government would have given them an opportunity of using the companys influence and patronage to make friends and to create an interest which might have been of use to them at the end of that term this undoubtedly might have been the case but not without an abuse of their trust and against this the public had certainly no security but in the character of the board in a comparison however of the two bills it is obvious to ask  what security have the public against the same thing now the means of patronage and influence to all important purposes were before proved to be equal and if mr pit and mr dundas have for their object the attaching a powerful indian interest both at home and abroad to themselves who that observes and understands the measures daily pursued both with regard to the directors the proprietors the army and the governments and councils abroad can be so duped as not to own that a very few years more must make them as formidable as indian influence and attachment so concentred and headed can make any party  g  mr dundas with any two more commissioners   in the committee upon mr pitts bill it was moved that of the three members of the board of control who were empowered to sign dispatches relating to war peace etc one should be the secretary of state or the chancellor of the exchequer for the time being this was negatived upon a division  ayes   noes    such was the confidence the house thought this board entitled to independently of its connection with the ostensible ministers  h in speaking of mr foxs plan it is a circumstance generally overlooked that it consisted of two bills brought into the house of commons together though the bill appointing the new directors only reached the house of lords the other  the bill for the better government of the territorial possessions contained many excellent regulations for the relief and protection of the natives of india and many real guards against the abuse of power and the means of corrupt patronage in the hands of our governors  it also contained an undoubted testimony that it was not the intention of that administration to make parliament a ready asylum for those who might be accused of delinquencies abroad or to use the influence of their situation to create an indian interest for their support  i secret committee the secret committee created by mr pitts bill in the court of directors is an instrument of government unlike any thing existing in any other country or any thing to be found in the history of all past governments a body of men in authority the court of directors acting under a delegated trust from their constituents the east india company take an oath on their election to support the interests and rights of the company  these directors are then bound by law to choose a secret committee from among themselves which secret committee are to take an oath to be true to the trust reposed in them by the directors but to obey only such orders and directions as they shall receive from the board of control which orders and directions they swear also never to communicate to the directors who appoint them without the consent of the said board of control  this secret committee have no power of originating or direcing any thing to be done of their own authority still less by suggestion or instruction from the directors all the governments and presidencies however in india are bound to pay a faithful obedience to their orders and dispatches and to answer the same upon the same terms of secrecy as if such orders and directions had been issued and transmitted by the court of directors of the said united company  if it were worth reasoning or arguing upon it would be no difficult matter to prove that this crooked system of involved mystery and contradictory duties could never have been meant for any fair purpose of good government facts however make reasoning on the subject unnecessary the institution had scarcely taken place with the addition of the  added in the explanatory act passed in    before this committee appointed for the purpose of issuing the secret instructions of the board of control relating to matters of war and peace are directed to manage as a matter of seecy the settlement of an old debt due from the nabob of arcot to the company  nothing could be more clearly out of the spirit and meaning of the act of      than this measure the board of control had already assumed an arbitrary power of settling the debts due from the nabob to individuals as matter connected with revenue the directors conceived they might at least have been permitted to settle their own debt which was their property and stated as part of their effects to parliament but this was discovered to be  matter connected with negotiation the board of control had no power to issue their orders through the secret committee with respect to matters of revenue but with respect to treaties with native princes they had accordingly the settling a sufficient security for an old and public debt to the company due from a dependent on their government was converted into a negotiation of state deemed a matter of secresy and withdrawn even from the knowledge of those who alone had any title to the debt the directors apply to their counsel and they are truly informed by mr rous that the whole effect of the last regulating bill in constituting the two boards of directors and of commissioners the one proposing measures and the other after representation finally deciding will be lost as far as concerns the government of madras if the intercourse with the nabob shall be confined to the secret department because this intercourse involves directly the arrangements respecting the military force and indirectly every interest of that settlement  the dispute comes before the court of proprietors who resolve on the  0th of june       that the construction of the act of the   th of his present majesty under which the right honorable board of commissioners for the affairs of india have claimed to exercise the powers in instances before the court is subversive of the authority of the court of directors and the chartered rights of the company recognized and confirmed by the said act and tends to establish a secret system of government highly dangerous to the interests of the public and the company  it was farther resolved unanimously that this general court do return thanks to the court of directors for the firmness with which they have maintained the rights of the company against the claims of the right honorable board of commisioners for the affairs of india and that the spirited protest of mr samuel smith merits the approbation of his constituents  upon this the court of directors resolve that it is expedient to apply to the legislature for a further explanation and more correct limitation of the powers of the board of control at the same time however with a very natural caution they think it prudent to ask mr pitts permission to do so first accordingly the chairman and deputy chairman are directed to wait on the chancellor of the exchequer and propose the following question if the court of directors with the authority of the general court of proprietors shall think proper to apply to parliament to explain the powers of the board of control with regard to the secret correspondence relative to the country powers of india will you assist them in their application  here seems to have been a reasonable case made for a declaratory law if according to mr scott a material difference of opinion between the company and the board of control is a sufficient ground for one  the chancellor of the exchequer however after due deliberation answers that he cannot agree in the sentiments expressed in the resolution concerning the conduct of the right honorable board of commissioners for the affairs of india and does not see any ground for an application to parliament on the subject  in a court of proprietors these proceedings being reported it was moved that a committee be appointed to take into consideration the state of this company under the operation and effect of the last act of the   th and   th of george iii upon this a ballot was demanded in which the refractory conduct of the court of directors and proprietors having created a considerable alarm a proper weight of influence was exerted and the question passed in the negative  mr samuel smiths testimony on this occasion as he has been a zealous friend to the present administration in parliament must be admitted to be at least free from party prejudice he says in the protest above alluded to containing the reasons of his resignation  it will be in vain to contend that the patronage is secured to the company by the act of parliament if the government is secret it will be absurd to suppose that the patronage will be open or that those who have no voice in the measure will have much concern if any in the appointments if they have not to what evils so often foreboded as dangerous to this constitution will not this mysterious government of india expose us and if this is to be contended as a necessary mode of managing and controuling the affairs of india it will in my opinion give rise to a question whether under such circumstances of danger to the constitution our indian possessions are worth retaining  a public situation reduced to the mere mechanism of official obedience can afford but little credit even by the most rigid discharge of its functions circumscribed as the power of the court now is and by the interpretation given to the clause to which i allude incapable of acting either with energy or effect it must ere long yield an easy surrender of its remaining rights to the encroachments and vigilance of a more active control thus circumstanced the office of a director may be the object of obloquy and though liable to a serious responsibility in the case of misconduct in others is too subordinate to continue the post either of independence or honor  it is therefore my intention to resign my trust to the proprietors conscious that while i held it i endeavored to discharge it to the best of my abilities and with an integrity unimpeached  signed samuel smith junr indiahouse june   th       in fact this transaction established the power of the board of control to act through the secret committee upon all matters and in any manner they may think proper without a possibility of check and with scarce a probability of detection  k agree upon its meaning the declaratory law was defended by many upon the ground of its declaring no more power to be in the board of control than it was fit and reasonable to give them and that to suppose that the original act had given them less was to admit that parliament had enacted an absurd and inconsistent law this argument although a popular one and sanctioned  although a popular one  by lord hawkesbury is an intolerably bad argument when applied to parliament acting in a great measure in their judicial capacity it is to set up their pride against their justice and to pique them to commit an act of violence rather than confess an act of folly other members however in both houses of parliament professed that they supported the declaratory law as a true construction of mr pitts bill from a recollection of their own meaning at the time they voted for it yet few of these members agreed with each other as to the powers they conceived they had given to the board of control lord camden having been out of the kingdom when the act of      passed professed to have nothing to say to the intentions of the legislature in passing the act but to have formed his opinion upon the plain and obvious meaning of the clauses taken collectively the learned lord was obliged however to admit that there were many words omitted which were necessary to make out his instruction and many others inserted which directly contradicted it but this he presumed to have happened through inadvertency and therefore a whole clause coming under the latter description  nil operatur a new and most extraordinary mode the most unlearned man may venture to assert of interpreting laws affecting the rights and property of the subject  but the pleasantest ground was taken by the duke of richmond the noble duke declared he had voted against mr pitts bill because he differed at the time from those who had introduced it with respect to its meaning he thinking that it did actually give those powers to the board of control which they asserted were not meant to be given it now therefore appearing that they had come over to his opinion consistency demanded from him to give vigor and efficacy to a law  which justice and policy had convinced him ought never to have existed  it would certainly be a difficult task to argue on the intentions of different members at the time the act of      passed and a very unfair way of arguing with respect to any but those who publicly gave their enterpretation of the bill during its progress mr bastards quotations from the ministers former speeches seem to have been generally admitted to have contained a true exposition of the ministers former meaning but there is one decisive test easily recurred to which was very ably argued upon by mr powis namely to compare the bill in the state in which it was first brought into the house by mr pit with that to which he altered it after a discussion with the directors in the committee here it will decisively appear that many of these very powers which are now contended to be given to the board of control by construction and implication were directly and plainly given in the bill as it stood on its first reading and were afterward withdrawn or modified upon conference and explanation with these who objected to them as intrenching on right which they had not consented to yield  this evidence is conclusive   explain the original act   there is no instance perhaps wherein the extraordinary spirit in which mr pitts bill is worded appears more plainly than in its bold and irregular manner of repealing matters supposed to be inconsistent with the new enactments  in all the former acts we find a regard to perspicuity and fair dealing expressed as in the act of   st of the present king and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that all and every the rights interests powers privileges and authorities which are now vested in the said united company of merchants of england trading to the east indies and which are not hereby expressly taken away altered or varied shall remain to and continue in the said company in as full and ample a manner to all intents and purposes whatsoever as if this act had never been made  this is the language of laws that mean to be intelligible and to do justice  mr pitts bill settles the point in a different manner  and be it further enacted that all such powers and authorities given to or vested in the proprietors and directors of the said united company or in any general or special court thereof respectively in and by any act of parliament or charter as are contrary or repugnant to this act or any thing herein contained shall be and the same are hereby repealed any thing contained in any act or charter or any custom or usage to the contrary notwithstanding whether under this loose and arrogant mandate so unlike the temperate precision of a british law upon such a subject there is any one right power or property of any sort left to the company may reasonably be doubted indeed since the construction given to this act by the declaratory law it is difficult to imagine any power ever exercised by them which might not be proved in a court of justice to be repugnant to something contained in mr pitts bill  l  mr pitts bill a perpetual law   it was proposed both in the house of lords and in the house of commons to limit the duration of the powers of the board of control to the term for which the company held their charter of exclusive trade it is scarcely to be conceived that if this question were to be fairly argued upon its own ground when ministers should be graciously disposed to allow a little time for its discussion that either mr pit or lord hawkesbury could easily prevail on either house of parliament to reject it because such a conduct would be in fact to induce the legislature deliberately to violate a solemn compact made between parliament and a body of merchants not with respect to their charter of power and monopoly which being a trust as all power is might be resumed upon abuse but with respect to estates rights and property which no mismanagement could forfeit and for which a valuable consideration had been paid to the public  by the act of the   st of his present majesty the companys charter of exclusive trade will expire in      upon previous notice from parliament  the  th and  th clauses of this act repeat the reservation in favor of the rights and privileges of the company independently of their right to the exclusive trade and stating the consideration paid for the service of the crown of england entitling them to these advantages conclude in these words  provided always and it is hereby further enacted that nothing in the above proviso or in any proviso in the said act of the ninth year of the reign of his said late majesty king william the third or in the said charter of the fifth day of september in the tenth year of his said late majestys reign or in any other act or charter contained shall extend or be construed to extend to determine the corporation of the said united company of merchants of england trading to the east indies or to hinder prevent or exclude the said united company from carrying on at all times after such determination of the right to the sole whole and exclusive trade as aforesaid a free trade in to and from the east indies and parts aforesaid with all or any part of their own joint stock in trade goods merchandises estate and effects in common with other the subjects of his majesty his heirs and successors trading in to or from those parts  after this to enact a law to place them in their corporate capacity as merchants united to trade upon their own joint stock and estate without any exclusive right or protection from government whatever under the perpetual control of certain commissioners named by the crown to whom they are bound to communicate all their transactions and without whose signature they can issue no one commercial order is surely a most flagrant and wanton violation of private property as well as public faith and indeed of every right that law or charter can be supposed to secure to any one  with respect to the companys claim on the territorial revenues the breach of faith is the same  the company paid the public a certain sum upon the last settlement on this subject and it was enacted that all the territorial acquisitions and revenues lately obtained in the east indies shall remain in the possession of the united company of merchants of england trading to the east indies for and during the term of the exclusive trade granted to the said united company it was stipulated however that beside the sum paid a further proportion of the surplus profits of these revenues should be set apart and applied for the use of the public with this reserve so long as the company shall be entitled to the sole and exclusive trade    st george iii  upon these terms the question of right between the public and the company was suspended until the expiration of the charter of monopoly and the saving clause which had been inserted in all former acts relating to this point was repeated clause    provided always and be it enacted that nothing herein contained shall extend or be construed to extend to prejudice or affect the rights or the claims of the public or the said united company respecting the said territorial acquisitions and revenues  the right of the company under this compact is  not to the property of the revenues certainly but to a decision upon the subject on the expiration of their charter of exclusive trade or to be placed in the same situation with respect to their claim in which they stood when they made their bargain in lieu of this a new claimant is created by parliament being neither the public nor the company to whom the law gives the perpetual disposal of these revenues so claimed by the public on one part and the company on the other for it is to be remembered granting the board of control to be acting for the crown that the king is not the representative of the public with respect to their property and purse but that on the contrary the constitution regards with jealousy and places no trust in the crown upon that head so that the public would be defrauded although the revenues were to come under the disposal of the king but even that is not the case for the board of control can appropriate them without the direction of the crown as well as without the direction of the company or of parliament parliament therefore breaks its faith to the company without doing justice to the public and the title and claims of both are extinguished not in favor of the crown but in favor of a fourth estate which acquires the strange and anomalous right either of disposing of the property of individuals against their consent or of applying the property of the state without the sanction of parliament
