you were fifty miles off  come maam begin   mar i say then beatrice my cousin don ferdinand no doubt imagines that marriage is a dispensation from the trifling duties exacted by complaisance since he already begins to fail in those marks of tenderness and regard i expected to find from him  he forgets that love is nourished by attention and that the slightest negligence kills it   d fer ah dear marcella did you know how uneasy you make me by this kind of discourse    mar and why uneasy  what i spoke was said to beatrice  and you need take no notice of it as you need not be supposed to
