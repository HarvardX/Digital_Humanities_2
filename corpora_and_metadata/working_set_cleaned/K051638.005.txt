clarissa or the history of a young lady comprehending the most important concerns of private life and particularly showing the distresses that may attend the misconduct both of parents and children in relation to marriage  published by the editor of pamela  vol v  london printed for s richardson and sold by john osborn in paternoster row by andrew millar over against catharinestreet in the strand by j and j rivington in st pauls churchyard and by j leake at bath  mdccxlviii  the history of miss clarissa harlowe letter i mr lovelace to john belford esquire upperflask hamstead friday june   morn   oclock i am now here and here have been this hour and half what an industrious spirit have i nobody can say that i eat the bread of idleness i take true pains for all the pleasure i enjoy i cannot choose but to admire myself strangely for certainly with this active soul i should have made a very great figure in whatever station i had filled but had i been a prince  to be sure i should have made a most noble prince i should have led up a military dance equal to that of the great macedonian i should have added kingdom to kingdom and robbed all my neighboursovereigns in order to have obtained the name of robert the great and i would have gone to war with the great turk and the persian and the mogholl for their seraglios for not one of those eastern monarchs should have had a pretty woman to bless himself with till i had done with her  and now i have so much leisure upon my hands that after having informed myself of all necessary particulars i am set to my shorthand writing in order to keep up with time as well as i can for the subject is now become worthy of me and it is yet too soon i doubt to pay my compliments to my charmer after all her fatigues for two or three days past and moreover i have abundance of matters preparative to my future proceedings to recount in order to connect and render all intelligible  i parted with the captain at the foot of the hill trebly instructed that is to say as to the fact to the probable and to the possible if my beloved and i can meet and make up without the mediation of this worthy gentleman it will be so much the better as little foreign aid as possible in my amorous conflicts has always been a rule with me though here i have been obliged to call in so much and who knows but it may be the better for her the less she makes necessary i cannot bear that she should sit so indifferent to me as to be in earnest to part with me for ever upon so slight or even upon any occasion if i find she is  but no more threatenings till she is in my power  thou know what i have vowed  all wills account from the ladys flight to his finding her again all the accounts of the people of the house the coachmans information to will and so forth collected together stand thus  the hamstead coach when the lady came to it had but two passengers in it but she made the fellow go off directly paying for the vacant places  the two passengers directing the coachman to set them down at the upperflask she bid him set her down there also  they took leave of her very respectfully no doubt and she went into the house and asked if she could not have a dish of tea and a room to herself for half an hour  they showed her up to the very room where i now am she sat at the very table i now write upon and i believe the chair i sit in was hers o belford if thou know what love is thou will be able to account for these minutiae  she seemed spiritless and fatigued the gentlewoman herself chose to attend so genteel and lovely a guest she asked her if she would have bread and butter to her tea no she could not eat they had very good biscakes as she pleased the gentlewoman stepped out for some and returning on a sudden she observed the sweet fugitive endeavoring to restrain a violent burst of grief which she had given way to in that little interval  however when the tea came she made her sit down with her and asked her abundance of questions about the villages and roads in that neighborhood  the gentlewoman took notice to her that she seemed to be troubled in mind  tender spirits she replied could not part with dear friends without concern she meant me no doubt  she made no inquiry about a lodging though by the sequel thou wilt observe that she seemed to intend to go no farther that night than hamstead but after she had drank two dishes and put a biscake in her pocket  sweet soul to serve for her supper perhaps   she laid down halfacrown and refusing change sighing took leave saying she would proceed toward hendon the distance to which had been one of her questions they offered to send to know if a hamstead coach were not to go to hendon that evening no matter she said  perhaps she might meet the chariot another of her feints i suppose for how or with whom could any thing of this sort have been concerted since yesterday morning  she had as the people took notice to one another something so uncommonly noble in her air and in her person and behavior that they were sure she was of quality and having no servant with her of either sex her eyes her fine eyes the gentlewoman called them stranger as she was and a woman being swelled and red they were sure there was an elopement in the case either from parents or guardians for they supposed her too young and too maidenly to be a married lady and were she married no husband would let such a fine young creature be unattended and alone nor give her cause for so much grief as seemed to be settled in her countenance then at times she seemed to be so bewildred they said that they were afraid she had it in her head to make away with herself  all these things put together excited their curiosity and they engaged a peery servant as they called a footman who was drinking with kit the hostler at the taphouse to watch all her motions this fellow reported the following particulars as they were rereported to me  she indeed went toward hendon passing by the sign of the castle on the heath then stopping looked about her and down into the valley before her then turning her face toward london she seemed by the motion of her handkerchief to her eyes to weep repenting who knows the rash step she had taken and wishing herself back again   better for her if she do jack once more i say  woe be to the girl who could think of marrying me yet be able to run away from me and renounce me for ever  then continuing on a few paces she stopped again and as if disliking her road again seeming to weep directed her course back toward hamstead i am glad she wept so much because no heart bursts be the occasion for the sorrow what it will which has that kindly relief hence i hardly ever am moved at the sight of these pellucid fugitives in a fine woman how often in the past twelve hours have i wished that i could cry most confoundedly  she then saw a coach and four driving toward her empty she crossed the path she was in as if to meet it and seemed to intend to speak to the coachman had he stopped or spoke first he as earnestly looked at her every one did so who passed her so the man who dogged her was the less suspected  happy rogue of a coachman had thou known whose notice thou did engage and whom thou might have obliged  it was the divine clarissa harlowe at whom thou gazedst  my own clarissa harlowe  but it was well for me that thou were as undistinguishing as the beasts thou drovest otherwise what a wildgoose chase had i been led  the lady as well as the coachman in short seemed to want resolution the horses kept on the fellows head and eyes no doubt turned behind him and the distance soon lengthened beyond recall with a wistful eye she looked after him sighed and wept again as the servant who then slily passed her observed  by this time she had reached the houses she looked up at every one as she passed nowandthen breathing upon her bared hand and applying it to her swelled eyes to abate the redness and dry the tears at last seeing a bill up for letting lodgings she walked backwards and forwards half a dozen times as if unable to determine what to do and then went farther into the town and there the fellow being spoken to by one of his familiars he lost her for a few minutes but soon saw her come out of a linendrapery shop attended with a servantmaid having as he believed bought some little matters and as it proved got that maidservant to go with her to the house she is now at see vol iv p       the fellow after waiting about an hour and not seeing her come out returned concluding that she had taken lodgings there  and here supposing my narrative of the dramatic kind ends act the first and now begins  act ii scene hamstead heath continued enter my rascal will having got at all these particulars by exchanging others as frankly against them which i had formerly prepared him with both verbally and in writing i found the people already of my party and full of good wishes for my success repeating to me all they told him  but he had first acquainted me with the accounts he had given them of his lady and me it is necessary that i give thee the particulars of his tale  and i have a little time upon my hands for the maid of the house who had been out of an errand tells us that she saw mrs moore with whom must be my first business go into the house of a young gentleman within a few doors of her who has a maiden sister miss rawlins by name so notifyd for prudence that none of her acquaintance undertake any thing of consequence without consulting her  mean while my honest coachman is walking about miss rawlinss door in order to bring me notice of mrs moores return to her own house i hope her gossipstale will be as soon told as mine which take as follows  will told them before i came that his lady was but lately married to one of the finest gentlemen in the world but that he being very gay and lively she was mortal jealous of him and in a fit of that sort had eloped from him for although she loved him dearly and he doated upon her as well he might since as they had seen she was the finest creature that ever the sun shone upon yet she was apt to be very wilful and sullen if he might take the liberty to say so  but truth was truth  and if she could not have her own way in every thing would be for leaving him that she had three or four times played his master such tricks but with all the virtue and innocence in the world running away to an intimate friend of hers who though a young lady of honor was but too indulgent to her in this her only failing for which reason his master had brought her to london lodgings their usual residence being in the country and that on his refusing to satisfy her about a lady he had been seen with in the park she had for the first time since she came to town served his master thus whom he had left halfdistracted on that account  and truly well he might poor gentleman cried the honest folks pitying me be ore they saw me  he told them how he came by his intelligence of her and made himself such an interest with them that they helped him to a change of clothes for himself and the landlord at his request privately inquired if the lady actually remained at mrs moores and for how long she had taken the lodgings which he found only to be for a week certain but she had said that she believed she should hardly stay so long and then it was that he wrote his letter and sent it by honest peter partrick as thou have heard  when i came my person and dress having answered wills description the people were ready to worship me i nowandthen sighed nowandthen put on a lighter air which however i designed should show more of vexation illdisguised than of real cheerfulness and they told will it was a thousand pities so fine a lady should have such skittish tricks adding that she might expose herself to great dangers by them for that there were rakes everywhere  lovelaces in every corner jack and many about that town who would leave nothing unattempted to get into her company and although they might not prevail upon her yet might they nevertheless hurt her reputation and in time estrange the affections of so fine a gentleman from her  good sensible people these  hay jack  here landlord one word with you my servant i find has acquainted you with the reason of my coming this way an unhappy affair landlord a very unhappy affair but never was there a more virtuous woman  so sir she seems to be a thousand pities her ladyship has such ways  and to so goodhumoured a gentleman as you seem to be sir  motherspoilt landlord  motherspoilt that is the thing  but sighing i must make the best of it what i want you to do for me is to lend me a great coat i care not what it is if my spouse should see me at a distance she would make it very difficult for me to get at her speech a great coat with a cape if you have one i must come upon her before she is aware  i am afraid sir i have none fit for such a gentleman as you  o any thing will do  the worse the better  exit landlord reenter with two great coats ay landlord this will be best for i can button the cape over the lower part of my face dont i look devilishly down and concerned landlord  i never saw a gentleman with a betternatured look it is pity you should have such trials sir  i must be very unhappy no doubt of it landlord and yet i am a little pleased you must needs think that i have found her out before any great inconvenience has arisen to her however if i cannot break her of these freaks she will break my heart for i do love her with all her failings  the good woman who was within hearing of all this pitied me much  pray your honor said she if i may be so bold was madam ever a mamma  no  and i sighed  we have been but a little while married and as i may say to you it is her own fault that she is not in that way not a word of a lie in this jack but to tell you truth madam she may be compared to the dog in the manger   i understand you sir simpering  she is but young sir i have heard of one or two such skittish young ladies in my time sir  but when madam is in that way i dare say as she loves you and it would be strange if she did not all this will be over and she may make the best of wives  that is all my hope  she is as fine a lady as i ever beheld i hope sir you will not be too severe she will get over all these freaks if once she be a mamma i warrant  i cannot be severe to her she knows that the moment i see her all resentment is over with me if she give me but one kind look  all this time i was adjusting my horsemans coat and will was putting in the ties of my wig and buttoning the cape over my chin  i asked the gentlewoman for a little powder she brought me a powderbox and i lightly shook the puff over my hat and flapt one side of it though the lace looked a little too gay for my covering and slouching it over my eyes shall i be known think you madam  your honor is so expert sir  i wish if i may be so bold your lady has not some cause to be jealous but it will be impossible if you keep your laced clothes covered that anybody should know you in that dress to be the same gentleman  except they find you out by your clocked stockens  well observed  cannot you landlord lend or sell me a pair of stockens that will draw over these i can cut off the feet if they will not go into my shoes  he could let me have a pair of coarse but clean stirrupstockens if i pleased  the best in the world for the purpose  he fetched them will drew them on and my legs then made a good gouty appearance  the good woman smiling wished me success and so did the landlord and as thou know that i am not a bad mimic i took a cane which i borrowed of the landlord and stooped in the shoulders to a quarter of a foot of less height and stumpd away cross to the bowlinggreen to practice a little the hobbling gaite of a gouty man the landlady whispered her husband as will tells me he is a good one i warrant him  i dare say the fault lies not all of one side while mine host replied that i was so lively and so goodnatured a gentleman that he did not know who could be angry with me do what i would a sensible fellow  i wish my charmer were of the same opinion  and now i am going to try if i cannot agree with goody moore for lodgings and other conveniences for my sick wife  wife lovelace methinks thou interrogatest  yes wife for who knows what cautions the dear fugitive may have given in apprehension of me  but has goody moore any other lodgings to let  yes yes i have taken care of that and find that she has just such conveniences as i want and i know that my wife will like them for although married i can do every thing i please and that is a bold word you know but had she only a garret to let i would have liked it and been a poor author afraid of arrests and made that my place of refuge yet would have made shift to pay beforehand for what i had i can suit myself to any condition that is my comfort  the widow moore returned say you  down down flutterer  this impertinent heart is more troublesome to me than my conscience i think  i shall be obliged to hoarsen my voice and roughen my character to keep up with its puppily dancings  but let me see  shall i be angry or pleased when i am admitted to my beloveds presence  angry to be sure  has she not broken her word with me  at a time too when i was meditating to do her grateful justice  and is not breach of word a dreadful crime in good folks i have ever been for forming my judgment of the nature of things and actions not so much from what they are in themselves as from the character of the actors thus it would be as odd a thing in such as we to keep our words with a lady as it would be wicked in her to break hers to us  see thou not that this unseasonable gravity is admitted to quell the palpitations of this unmanageable heart but still it will go on with its boundings i will try as i ride in my chariot to tranquillize  ride bob so little a way  yes ride jack for am i not lame and will it not look well to have a lodger who keeps his chariot what widow what servant asks questions of a man with an equipage  my coachman as well as my other servant is under wills tuition  never was there such a hideous rascal as he has made himself the devil only and his other master can know him they both have set their marks upon him as to my honors mark it will never be out of his damned wide mothe as he calls it for the dog will be hanged before he can lose the rest of his teeth by age  i am gone  letter ii mr lovelace to john belford esquire hamstead friday night june   now belford for the narrative of narratives i will continue it as i have opportunity and that so dexterously that if i break off twenty times thou shall not discern where i piece my thread  although grievously afflicted with the gout i alighted out of my chariot leaning very hard on my cane with one hand and on my new servants shoulder with the other the same instant almost that he had knocked at the door that i might be sure of admission into the house  i took care to button my great coat about me and to cover with it even the pommel of my sword it being a little too gay for my years i knew not what occasion i might have for my sword i stooped forward blinkd with my eyes to conceal their luster no vanity in saying that jack my chin wrapped up for the toothache my slouchd laced hat and so much of my wig as was visible giving me all together the appearance of an antiquated beau  my wife i resolved beforehand should have a complication of disorders  the maid came to the door i asked for her mistress she showed me into one of the parlours and i sat down with a gouty oh   enter goody moore your servant madam  but you must excuse me i cannot well stand  i find by the bill at the door that you have lodgings to let mumbling my words as if like my man will i had lost some of my foreteeth be pleased to inform me what they are for i like your situation  and i will tell you my family  i have a wife a good old woman  older than myself by the way a pretty deal she is in a bad state of health and is advised into the hamstead air she will have two maidservants and a footman the coach or chariot i shall not have them up both together we can put up anywhere and the coachman will be with his horses  when sir shall you want to come in  i will take them from this very day and if convenient will bring my wife in the afternoon  perhaps sir you would board as well as lodge  that as you please it will save me the trouble of bringing my cook if we do and i suppose you have servants who know how to dress a couple of dishes my wife must eat plain food and i dont love kickshaws  we have a single lady who will be gone in two or three days she has one of the best apartments that will then be at liberty  you have one or two good ones mean time i presume madam just to receive my wife for we have lost time  these damned physicians  excuse me madam i am not used to curse but it is owing to the love i have for my wife  they have kept her in hand till they are ashamed to take more fees and now advise her to the air i wish we had sent her hither at first but we must now make the best of it  excuse me madam for she looked hard at me that i am muffled up thus in this warm weather i am but too sensible that i have left my chamber sooner than i ought and perhaps shall have a return of my gout for it i came out thus muffled up with a dreadful pain in my jaws an ague in them i believe but my poor dear will not be satisfied with any bodys care but mine and as i told you we have lost time  you shall see what accommodations i have if you please sir but i doubt you are too lame to walk up stairs  i can make shift to hobble up now i have rested a little i will just look upon the apartment my wife is to have any thing may do for the servants and as you seem to be a good sort of gentlewoman i shall not stand for a price and will pay well besides for the trouble i shall give  she led the way and i leaning upon the banisters made shift to get up with less fatigue than i expected from ancles so weak but oh jack what was sixtus the vths artful depression of his natural powers to mine when as the halfdead montalto he gaped for the pretendedly unsought pontificate and the moment he was chosen leapt upon the prancing beast which it was thought by the amazed conclave he was not able to mount without help of chairs and men never was there a more joyous heart and lighter heels than mine joined together yet both denied their functions the one fluttering in secret ready to burst its bars for reliefful expression the others obliged to an hobbling motion when unrestrained they would in their masters imagination have mounted him to the lunar world without the help of a ladder  there were three rooms on a floor two of them handsome and the third she said still handsomer but the lady was in it  i saw  i saw she was for as i hobbled up crying out upon my weak ancles in the hoarse mumbling voice i had assumed i beheld a little piece of her just casting an eye with the door ajar as they call it to observe who was coming up and seeing such an old clumsy fellow greatcoated in weather so warm slouched and muffled up she withdrew shutting the door without any emotion but it was not so with me for thou can not imagine how my heart danced to my mouth at the very glimpse of her so that i was afraid the thump thump thumping villain which had so lately thumped as much to no purpose would have choked me  i liked the lodgings well and the more as she said the third room was still handsomer i must sit down madam and chose the darkest part of the room will not you take a seat yourself no price shall part us but i will leave the terms to you and my wife if you please and also whether for board or not only please to take this for earnest putting a guinea into her hand  and one thing i will say my poor wife loves money but is not an illnatured woman she was a great fortune to me but as the real estate goes away at her death i would fain preserve her for that reason as well as for the love i bear her as an honest man but if she makes too close a bargain with you tell me and unknown to her i will make it up this is my constant way she loves to have her penworths and i would not have her vexed or made uneasy on any account  she said i was a very considerate gentleman and upon the condition i had mentioned she was content to leave the terms to my lady  but madam cannot abody just peep into the other apartment that i may be more particular to my wise in the furniture of it  the lady desires to be private sir  but  and was going to ask her leave  i caught hold of her hand  however stay stay madam it may not be proper if the lady loves to be private dont let me intrude upon the lady   no intrusion sir i dare say the lady is goodhumoured she will be so kind as to step down into the parlour i dare say as she stays so little a while i am sure she will not wish to stand in my way  no madam that is true if she be goodhumoured as you say  has she been with you long madam  but yesterday sir   i believe i just now saw the glimpse of her she seems to be an elderly lady  no sir youre mistaken she is a young lady and one of the handsomest i ever saw  cot so i beg her pardon not but that i should have liked her the better were she to stay longer if she had been elderly i have a strange taste madam you will say but i really for my wifes sake love every elderly woman indeed i ever thought age was to be reverenced which made me taking the fortune into the scale too that i own make my addresses to my present dear  very good of you sir to respect age we all hope to live to be old  right madam but you say the lady is beautiful now you must know that though i choose to converse with the elderly yet i love to see a beautiful young woman just as i love to see fine flowers in a garden there is no casting an eye upon her is there without her notice for in this dress and thus muffled up about my jaws i should not care to be seen any more than she let her love privacy as much as she will  i will go ask if i may show a gentleman the apartment sir and as you are a married gentleman and not overyoung she will perhaps make the less scruple  then like me she loves elderly folks best perhaps but it may be she has suffered by young ones  i fancy she has sir or is afraid she shall she desired to be very private and if by description inquired after to be denied  thou art true woman goody moore thought i  good lack  good lack  what may be her story then i pray  she is pretty reserved in her story but to tell you my thoughts i believe love is in the case she is always in tears and does not much care for company  nay madam it becomes not me to dive into ladies secrets i want not to pry into other peoples affairs but pray how does she employ herself  yet she came but yesterday so you cannot tell  writing continually sir  these women jack when you ask them questions by way of information dont care to be ignorant of any thing  nay excuse me madam i am very far from being an inquisitive man but if her case be difficult and not merely love as she is a friend of yours i would give her my advice  then you are a lawyer sir   why indeed madam i was some time at the bar but i have long left practice yet am much consulted by my friends in difficult points in a pauper case i frequently give money but never take any from the richest  you are a very good gentleman then sir  ay madam we cannot live always here and we ought to do what good we can  but i hate to appear officious if the lady stays any time and thinks fit upon better acquaintance to let me in to her case it may be a happy day for her if i find it a just one for you must know that when i was at the bar i never was such a sad fellow as to undertake for the sake of a paltry fee to make white black and black white for what would that have been but to endeavor to establish iniquity by quirks while i robbed the innocent  you are an excellent gentleman sir i wish and then she sighed i had had the happiness to know there was such a lawyer in the world and to have been acquainted with him  come come mrs moore i think your name is it may not be too late  when you and i are better acquainted i may help you perhaps  but mention nothing of this to the lady for as i said i hate to appear officious  this prohibition i knew if goody moore answered the specimen she had given of her womanhood would make her take the first opportunity to tell were it to be necessary to my purpose that she should  i appeared upon the whole so indifferent about seeing the room or the lady that the good woman was the more eager i should see both and the rather as i to stimulate her declared that there was more required in my eye to merit the character of a handsome woman than most people thought necessary and that i had never seen six truly lovely ladies in my life  to be brief she went in and after a little while came out again the lady sir is retired to her closet so you may go in and look at the room  then how my heart began again to play its pugs tricks  i hobbled in and stumpd about and liked it very much and was sure my wife would i begged excuse for sitting down and asked who was the minister of the place if he were a good preacher who preached at the chapel and if he were a good preacher and good liver too madam  i must inquire after that for i love i must needs say that the clergy should practice what they preach  very right sir but that is not so often the case as were to be wished  mores the pity madam but i have a great veneration for the clergy in general it is more a satire upon human nature than upon the cloth if we suppose those who have the best opportunities to be good less perfect than other people for my part i dont love professional any more than national reflections  but i keep the lady in her closet my gout makes me rude  then up from my seat stumped i  what do you call these windowcurtains madam  stuffdamask sir  it looks mighty well truly i like it better than silk it is warmer to be sure and much fitter for lodgings in the country especially for people in years the bed is in a pretty taste  it is neat and clean sir that is all we pretend to  ay mighty well  very well  a silk camlet i think  very well truly  i am sure my wife will like it but we would not turn the lady out of her lodging for the world the other two apartments will do for us at the present  then stumping toward the closet over the door of which hung a picture  what picture is that  oh i see a st caecilia  a common print sir   pretty well pretty well it is after an italian master  i would not for the world turn the lady out of her apartment we can make shift with the other two repeated i louder still but yet mumblingly hoarse for i had as great regard to uniformity in accent as to my words  o belford to be so near my angel think what a painful constraint i was under   i was resolved to fetch her out if possible and pretending to be going  you cannot agree as to any time mrs moore when we can have this third room can you  not that whispered i loud enough to be heard in the next room not that i would incommode the lady but i would tell my wife whenabouts  and women you know mrs moore love to have every thing before them of this nature  mrs moore says my charmer and never did her voice sound so harmonious to me oh how my heart bounded again it even talked to me in a manner for i thought i heard as well as felt its unruly flutters and every vein about me seemed a pulse mrs moore you may acquaint the gentleman that i shall stay here only for two or three days at most till i receive an answer to a letter i have written into the country and rather than be your hindrance i will take up with any apartment a pair of stairs higher  not for the world not for the world young lady cried i  my wife well as i love her should lie in a garret rather than put such a considerate lady as you seem to be to the least inconveniency  she opened not the door yet and i said but since you have so much goodness madam if i could but just look into the closet as i stand i could tell my wife whether it is large enough to hold a cabinet she much values and will have with her wherever she goes  then my charmer opened the door and blazed upon me as it were in a flood of light like what one might imagine would strike a man who born blind had by some propitious power been blessed with his sight all at once in a meridian sun  upon my soul i never was so strangely affected before i had much ado to forbear discovering myself that instant but hesitatingly and in great disorder i said looking into the closet and around it there is room i see for my wifes cabinet and it has many jewels in it of high price but upon my soul for i could not forbear swearing like a puppy  habit is a cursed thing jack  nothing so valuable as the lady i see can be brought into it   she started and looked at me with terror the truth of the compliment as far as i know had taken dissimulation from my accent  i saw it was impossible to conceal myself longer from her any more than from the violent impulses of my passion to forbear manifesting myself i unbuttoned therefore my cape i pulled off my flapt slouched hat i threw open my great coat and like the devil in milton an odd comparison though i started up in my own form divine touched by the beam of her celestial eye more potent than ithuriels spear    now belford for a similitude  now for a likeness to illustrate the surprising scene and the effect it had upon my charmer and the gentlewoman  but nothing was like it or equal to it the plain fact can only describe it and set it off thus then take it  she no sooner saw who it was than she gave three violent screams and before i could catch her in my arms as i was about to do the moment i discovered myself down she sunk at my feet in a fit which made me curse my indiscretion for so suddenly and with so much emotion revealing myself  the gentlewoman seeing so strange an alteration in my person and features and voice and dress cried out murder help murder help by turns for half a dozen times running this alarmed the house and up ran two servant maids and my servant after them i cried out for water and hartshorn and every one flew a different way one of the maids as fast down as she came up while the gentlewoman ran out of one room into another and by turns up and down the apartment we were in without meaning or end wringing her foolish hands and not knowing what she did  up then came running a gentleman and his sister fetched and brought in by the maid who had run down and who having let in a cursed crabbed old wretch hobbling with his gout and mumbling with his hoarse brokentoothed voice was metamorphosed all at once into a lively gay young fellow with a clear accent and all his teeth and she would have it that i was neither more nor less than the devil and could not keep her eye from my foot expecting no doubt every minute to see it discover itself to be cloven  for my part i was so intent upon restoring my angel that i regarded nobody else and at last she slowly recovering motion with bitter sighs and sobs only the whites of her eyes however appearing for some moments i called upon her in the tenderest accent as i kneeled by her my arm supporting her head my angel my charmer my clarissa look upon me my dearest life  i am not angry with you  i will forgive you my best beloved   the gentleman and his sister knew not what to make of all this and the less when my fair one recovering her sight snatched another look at me and then again groaned and fainted away  i threw up the closetsash for air and then left her to the care of the young gentlewoman the same notable miss rawlins whom i had heard of at the flask and to that of mrs moore who by this time had recovered herself and then retiring to one corner of the room i made my servant pull off my gouty stockens brush my hat and loop it up into the usual smart cock  i then stepped to the closet to mr rawlins whom in the general confusion i had not much minded before  sir said i you have an uncommon scene before you the lady is my wife and no gentlemans presence is necessary here but my own  i beg pardon sir if the lady is your wife i have no business here but sir by her concern at seeing you   pray sir none of your ifs and buts i beseech you nor your concern about the ladys concern you are a very unqualified judge in this cause and i beg of you sir to oblige me with your absence the ladies only are proper to be present on this occasion added i and i think myself obliged to them for their care and kind assistance  it is well he made not another word for i found my choler begin to rise i could not bear that the finest neck and arms and foot in the world should be exposed to the eyes of any man living but mine  i withdrew once more from the closet finding her beginning to recover lest the sight of me too soon should throw her back again  the first words she said looking round her with great emotion were o hide me hide me is he gone  o hide me is he gone  sir said miss rawlins coming to me with an air somewhat peremptory and assured this is some surprising case the lady cannot bear the sight of you what you have done is best known to yourself but another such fit will probably be her last it would be but kind therefore for you to retire  it behooved me to have so notable a person of my party and the rather as i had disobliged her impertinent brother  the dear creature said i may well be concerned to see me if you madam had a husband who loved you as i love her you would not i am confident fly from him and expose yourself to hazards as she does whenever she has not all her way  and yet with a mind not capable of intentional evil  but motherspoilt this is her fault and all her fault and the more inexcusable it is as i am the man of her choice and have reason to think she loves me above all the men in the world  here jack was a story to support to the lady face to face too and here belford lest thou through inattention should be surprised at my assurance let me remind thee and that thus by way of marginal observation that i may not break in upon my narrative that this my intrepidity was but a consequence of the measures i had previously concerted as i have from time to time acquainted thee in apprehension of such an event as has fallen out for had not the dear creature already passed for my wife before no less than four worthy gentleman of family and fortune vol iii p      and before mrs sinclair and her household and miss partington  and had she not agreed to her uncles expedient that she should pass for such from the time of mr hickmans application to that uncle vol iv p      and that the worthy captain tomlinson should be allowed to propagate that belief as he had actually reported it to two families they possibly to more purposely that it might come to the ears of james harlwe and serve for a foundation for uncle john to build his reconciliationscheme upon vol iv p      and can thou think that nothing was meant by all this contrivance and that i am not still further prepared to support my story  indeed i little thought at the time that i formed these precautionary schemes that she would ever have been able if willing to get out of my hands all that i hoped i should have occasion to have recourse to them for was only that in case i should have the courage to make the grand attempt and should succeed in it to bring the dear creature and this out of tenderness to her for what attention did i ever yet pay to the grief the execiations the tears of a woman i had triumphed over to bear me in her sight to expostulate with me to be pacified by my pleas and by her own future hopes founded upon the reconciliatoryproject upon my reiterated vows and upon the captains assurances  since in that case to forgive me to have gone on with me for a week would have been to forgive me to have gone on with me for ever and then had my eligible life of honor taken place her trials would all have been then ever and she would have known nothing but gratitude love and joy to the end of one of our lives for never would i never could i have abandoned such an admirable creature as this thou know i never was a sordid villain to any of her inferiors  her inferiors i may say  for who is not her inferior     you speak like a gentleman you look like a gentleman said miss rawlins  but sir this is a strange case the lady seems to dread the sight of you  no wonder madam taking her a little on one side nearer to mrs moore i have three times already forgiven the dear creature  but this jealousy  there is a spice of that in it  and of phrensy too whispered i that it might have the face of a secret and of consequence the more engage their attention  but our story is too long   i then made a motion to go to the lady but they desired that i would walk into the next room and they would endeavor to prevail upon her to lie down  i begged that they would not suffer her to talk for that she was accustomed to fits and would when in this way talk of any thing that came uppermost and the more she was suffered to run on the worse she was and if not kept quiet would fall into raveings which might possibly hold her a week  they promised to keep her quiet and i withdrew into the next room ordering every one down but mrs moore and miss rawlins  she was full of exclamations unhappy creature miserable ruined and undone she called herself wrung her hands and begged they would assist her to escape from the terrible evils she should otherwise be made to suffer  they preached patience and quietness to her and would have had her to lie down but she refused sinking however into an easy chair for she trembled so she could not stand  by this time i hoped that she was enough recovered to bear a presence that it behoved me to make her bear and fearing she would throw out something in her exclamations that would still more disconcert me i went into the room again  o there he is said she and threw her apron over her face  i cannot see him  i cannot look upon him  begone begone touch me not   for i took her struggling hand beseeching her to be pacified and assuring her that i would make all up with her upon her own terms and wishes  base man said the violent lady i have no wishes but never to behold you more why must i be thus pursued and haunted have you not made me miserable enough already despoiled of all succor and help and of every friend i am contented to be poor low and miserable so i may be free from your persecutions   miss rawlins stared at me a confident slut this miss rawlins thought i so did mrs moore  i told you so whisperingly said i turning to the women shaking my head with a face of great concern and pity and then to my charmer my dear creature how you rave  you will not easily recover from the effects of this violence have patience my love be pacified and we will coolly talk this matter over for you expose yourself as well as me these ladies will certainly think you have fallen among robbers and that i am the chief of them  so you are so you are stamping her face still covered she thought of wednesday night no doubt and sighing as if her heart were breaking she put her hand to her forehead  i shall be quite distracted  i will not my dearest love uncover your face you shall not look upon me since i am so odious to you but this is a violence i never thought you capable of   and i would have pressed her hand as i held it with my lips but she drew it from me with indignation  unhand me sir said she i will not be touched by you leave me to my fate what right what title have you to persecute me thus  what right what title my dear  but this is not a time  i have a letter from captain tomlinson  here it is  offering it to her   i will receive nothing from your hands  tell me not of captain tomlinson  tell me not of anybody  you have no right to invade me thus  once more leave me to my fate  have you not made me miserable enough   i touched a delicate string on purpose to set her in such a passion before the women as might confirm the intimation i had given of a phrensical disorder  what a turn is here  lately so happy  nothing wanting but a reconciliation between you and your friends  that reconciliation in such a happy train  shall so slight so accidental an occasion be suffered to overturn all our happiness  she started up with a trembling impatience her apron falling from her indignant face  now said she that thou dare to call the occasion slight and accidental and that i am happily out of thy vile hands and out of a house i have reason to believe as vile traitor and wretch that thou art i will venture to cast an eye upon thee  and o that it were in my power in mercy to my sex to look thee first into shame and remorse and then into death  this violent tragedyspeech and the high manner in which she uttered it had its desired effect i looked upon the women and upon her by turns with a pitying eye and they shook their wise heads and besought me to retire and her to lie down to compose herself  this hurricane like other hurricanes was presently allayed by a shower she threw herself once more into her armed chair  and begged pardon of the women for her passionate excess but not of me yet i was in hopes that when compliments were stirring i should have come in for a share  indeed ladies said i with assurance enough thou wilt say this violence is not natural to my beloveds temper  misapprehension   misapprehension wretch  and want i excuses from thee  what a scorn was every lovely feature agitated by  then turning her face from me i have not patience o thou guileful betrayer to look upon thee  begone begone with a face so unblushing how dare thou my presence  i thought then that the character of a husband obliged me to be angry  you may one day madam repent this treatment  by my soul you may  you know i have not deserved it of you  you know i have not  do i know you have not  wretch do i know   you do madam  and never did man of my figure and consideration i thought it was proper to throw that in meet with such treatment she lifted up her hands indignation kept her silent  but all is of a piece with the charge you bring against me of despoiling you of all succor and help of making you poor and low and with other unprecedented language i will only say before these two gentlewomen that since it must be so and since your former esteem for me is turned into so riveted an aversion i will soon very soon make you entirely easy i will be gone  i will leave you to your own fate as you call it and may that be happy  only that i may not appear to be a spoiler a robber indeed let me know whither i shall send your apparel and every thing that belongs to you and i will send it  send it to this place and assure me that you will never molest me more never more come near me and that is all i ask of you  i will do so madam said i with a dejected air but did i ever think i should be so indifferent to you  however you must permit me to insist on your reading this letter and on your seeing captain tomlinson and hearing what he has to say from your uncle he will be here byandby  dont trifle with me said she in an imperious tone  do as you offer i will not receive any letter from your hands if i see captain tomlinson it shall be on his own account not on yours you tell me you will send me my apparel if you would have me believe any thing you say let this be the test of your sincerity  leave me now and send my things  the women stared they did nothing but stare and appeared to be more and more at a loss what to make of the matter between us  i pretended to be going from her in a pet but when i had got to the door i turned back and as if i had recollected myself one word more my dearest creature  charming even in your anger  o my fond soul said i turning half round and pulling out my handkerchief  i believe jack my eyes did glisten a little  i have no doubt but they did  the women pitied me honest souls  they showed that they had each of them a handkerchief as well as i so have thou not observed to give a familiar illustration every man in a company of a dozen or more obligingly pull out his watch when some one has asked what is oclock  one word only madam repeated i as soon as my voice had recovered its tone  i have represented to captain tomlinson in the most favorable light the cause of our present misunderstanding you know what your uncle insists upon and which you have acquiesced with the letter in my hand and again i offered it to her will acquaint you with what you have to apprehend from your brothers active malice  she was going to speak in a high accent putting the letter from her with an open palm  nay hear me out madam  the captain you know has reported our marriage to two different persons it is come to your brothers ears my own relations have also heard of it letters were brought me from town this morning from lady betty lawrance and miss montague here they are i pulled them out of my pocket and offered them to her with that of the captain but she held back her still open palm that she might not receive them reflect madam i beseech you reflect upon the fatal consequences which this your high resentment may be attended with  ever since i knew you said she i have been in a wilderness of doubt and error i bless god that i am out of your hands i will transact for myself what relates to myself i dismiss all your solicitude for me am i not my own mistress  am i not   the women stared the devil stare ye thought i can ye do nothing but stare it was high time to stop her here i raised my voice to drown hers  you used my dearest creature to have a tender and apprehensive heart  you never had so much reason for such a one as now  let me judge for myself upon what i shall see not upon what i shall hear  do you think i shall ever   i dreaded her going on  i must be heard madam raising my voice still higher you must let me read one paragraph or two of this letter to you if you will not read it yourself   begone from me man  begone from me with thy letters what pretense have thou for tormenting me thus   dearest creature what questions you ask questions that you can as well answer yourself   i can i will  and thus i answer them   still louder raised i my voice she was overborne sweet soul it would be hard thought i and yet i was very angry with her if such a spirit as thine cannot be brought to yield to such a one as mine  i lowered my voice on her silence all gentle all intreative my accent my head bowed one hand held out the other on my honest heart  for heavens sake my dearest creature resolve to see captain tomlinson with temper he would have come along with me but i was willing to try to soften your mind first on this fatal misapprehension and this for the sake of your own wishes for what is it otherwise to me whether your friends are or are not reconciled to us do i want any favor from them  for your own minds sake therefore frustrate not captain tomlinsons negotiation that worthy gentleman will be here in the afternoon  lady betty will be in town with my cousin montague in a day or two they will be your visiters i beseech you do not carry this misunderstanding so far as that lord m and lady betty and lady sarah may know it  how considerable this made me look to the women lady betty will not let you rest till you consent to accompany her to her own seat  and to that lady may you safely entrust your cause  again upon my pausing a moment she was going to break out i liked not the turn of her countenance nor the tone of her voice  and think thou base wretch were the words she did utter i again raised my voice and drowned hers  base wretch madam  you know that i have not deserved the violent names you have called me words so opprobrious from a mind so gentle  but this treatment is from you madam  from you whom i love more than my own soul  by that soul i swear that i do  the women looked upon each other they seemed pleased with my ardor women whether wives maids or widows love ardors even miss how thou know speaks up for ardors vol iii p   0       nevertheless i must say that you have carried matters too far for the occasion i see you hate me   she was just going to speak  if we are to separate for ever in a strong and solemn voice proceeded i this island shall not long be troubled with me  mean time only be pleased to give these letters a perusal and consider what is to be said to your uncles friend and what he is to say to your uncle  any thing will i come into renounce me if you will that shall make for your peace and for the reconciliation your heart was so lately set upon but i humbly conceive that it is necessary that you should come into better temper with me were it but to give a favorable appearance to what has passed and weight to any future application to your friends in whatever way you shall think proper to make it  i then put the letters into her lap and retired into the next apartment with a low bow and a very solemn air  i was soon followed by the two women mrs moore withdrew to give the fair perverse time to read them miss rawlins for the same reason and because she was sent for home  the widow besought her speedy return i joined in the same request and she was ready enough to promise to oblige us  i excused myself to mrs moore for the disguise i had appeared in at first and for the story i had invented i told her that i held myself obliged to satisfy her for the whole floor we were upon and for an upper room for my servant and that for a month certain  she made many scruples and begged she might not be urged on this head till she had consulted miss rawlins  i consented but told her that she had taken my earnest and i hoped there was no room for dispute  just then miss rawlins returned with an air of eager curiosity and having been told what had passed between mrs moore and me she gave herself airs of office immediately which i humoured plainly perceiving that if i had her with me i had the other  she wished if there were time for it and if it were not quite impertinent in her to desire it that i would give mrs moore and her a brief history of an affair which as she said bore the face of novelty mystery and surprise for sometimes it looked to her as if we were married at other times that point appeared doubtful and yet the lady did not absolutely deny it but upon the whole thought herself highly injured  i said that ours was a very particular case that were i to acquaint them with it some part of it would hardly appear credible but however i would give them as they seemed to be persons of discretion a brief account of the whole and this in so plain and sincere a manner that it should clear up to their satisfaction every thing that had passed or might hereafter pass between us  they sat down by me and threw every feature of their faces into attention i was resolved to go as near the truth as possible lest any thing should drop from my spouse to impeach my veracity and yet keep in view what passed at the flask  it is necessary although thou know my whole story and a good deal of my views that thou should be apprized of the substance of what i told them  i gave them in as concise a manner as i was able the history of our families fortunes alliances antipathies her brothers and mine particularly i averred the truth of our private marriage the captains letter which i will enclose will give thee my reasons for that and besides the women might also perhaps have proposed a parson to me by way of compromise i told them the condition my spouse had made me swear to and which she held me to in order i said to induce me the sooner to be reconciled to her relations  i owned that this restraint made me sometimes ready to fly out and mrs moore was so good as to declare that she did not much wonder at it  thou art a very good sort of woman mrs moore thought i  as miss how has actually detected our mother and might possibly find some way still to acquaint her friend with her discoveries i thought it proper to prepossess them in mrs sinclairs favor and in that of her two nieces  i said they were gentlewomen born had not bad hearts that indeed my spouse did not love them they having once jointly taken the liberty to blame her for her overniceness with regard to me people i said even good people who knew themselves to be guilty of a fault they had no inclination to mend were too often least patient when told of it as they could less bear than others to be thought indifferently of  too often the case they owned  mrs sinclairs house was a very handsome house and fit to receive the first quality true enough jack mrs sinclair was a woman very easy in her circumstances a widowgentlewoman  as you mrs moore are lets lodgings  as you mrs moore do once had better prospects  as you mrs moore may have had the relict of colonel sinclair you mrs moore might know colonel sinclair  he had lodgings at hamstead  she had heard of the name  o he was related to the best families in scotland and his widow is not to be reflected upon because she lets lodgings you know mrs moore  you know miss rawlins  very true and very true and they must needs say it did not look quite so pretty in such a lady as my spouse to be so censorious  a foundation here thought i to procure these womens help to get back the fugitive or their connivance at least at my doing so as well as for anticipating any future information from miss how  i gave them a character of that virago and intinated that for a head to contrive mischief and a heart to execute it she had hardly her equal in her sex  to this miss how it was mrs moore said she supposed that my spouse was so desirous to dispatch a man and horse by daydawn with a letter she wrote before she went to bed last night proposing to stay no longer than till she had received an answer to it  the very same said i i knew she would have immediate recourse to her i should have been but too happy could i have prevented such a letter from passing or so to have managed as to have it given into mrs howes hands instead of her daughters women who had lived some time in the world knew better than to encourage such skittish pranks in young wives  let me just stop to tell thee while it is in my head that i have since given will his cue to find out where the man lives who is gone with the fair fugitives letter and if possible to see him on his return before he sees her  i told the women that i despaired it would ever be better with us while miss how had so strange a predominance over my spouse and remained herself unmarried and until the reconciliation with her friends could be effected or a still happier event  as i should think it who am the last male of my family and which my foolish vow and her rigor had hitherto   here i stopped and looked modest turning my diamond ring round my finger while goody moore looked mighty significant calling it a very particular case and the maiden lady fanned away and primmd and pursd to show that what i said needed no farther explanation  i told them the occasion of our present difference avowed the reality of the fire but owned that i would have made no scruple of breaking the unnatural oath she had bound me in having an husbands right of my side when she was so accidentally frighted into my arms and i blamed myself excessively that i did not since she thought fit to carry her resentment so high and had the injustice to suppose the fire to be a contrivance of mine  nay for that matter mrs moore said  as we were married and madam was so odd  every gentleman would not  and there stopped mrs moore  to suppose i should have recourse to such a poor contrivance said i when i saw the dear creature every hour  was not this a bold put jack  a most extraordinary case truly the maiden lady fanning yet coming in with her wellbuts and her sifting praysirs  and her restraining enoughsirs  flying from the question to the question her seat nowandthen uneasy for fear my want of delicacy should hurt her abundant modesty and yet it was difficult to satisfy her superabundant curiosity  my beloveds jealousy which of itself to female minds accounts for a thousand unaccountablenesses and the imputation of her halfphrensy brought upon her by her fathers wicked curse and by the previous persecutions she had undergone from all her family were what i dwelt upon in order to provide against what might happen  in short i owned against myself most of the offenses which i did not doubt but she would charge me with in their hearing and as every cause has a black and a white side i gave the worst parts of our story the gentlest turn and when i had done gave them some partial hints of the contents of captain tomlinsons letter which i had left with her with a caution to be guarded against the inquiries of james harlowe and of captain singleton or of any sailorlooking men this thou will see from the letter itself was necessary to be done here therefore thou may read it and a charming letter to my purpose if thou give the least attention to its contents will thou find it to be  to robert lovelace esquire dear sir wedn june   although i am obliged to be in town tomorrow or next day at farthest yet i would not dispense with writing to you by one of my servants whom i send up before me upon a particular occasion in order to advertise you that it is probable you will hear from some of your own relations on your supposed what is between hooks  thou may suppose jack i sunk upon the women in the account i gave them of the contents of this letter  nuptials one of the persons mr lilburne by name to whom i hinted my belief of your marriage happens to be acquainted with mr spurrier lady betty lawrances steward and not being under any restriction mentioned it to mr spurrier and he to lady betty as a thing certain and this though i have not the honor to be personally known to her ladyship brought on an inquiry from her ladyship to me by her gentleman who coming to me in company with mr lilburne i had no way but to confirm the report and i understand that lady betty takes it amiss that she was not acquainted with so desirable a piece of news from yourself  her ladyship it seems has business that calls her to town and you will possibly choose to put her right if you do it will i presume be in confidence that nothing may perspire from your own family to contradict what i have given out  i have ever been of opinion that truth ought to be strictly adhered to on all occasions and am concerned that i have departed though with so good a view from my old maxim but my dear friend mr john harlowe would have it so yet i never knew a departure of this kind a single departure but to make the best of it now allow me sir once more to beg the lady as soon as possible to authenticate the report given out when you both join in the acknowlegement it will be impertinent in any one to be inquisitive as to the day or week and if as privately celebrated as you intend while the gentlewomen with whom you lodge are properly instructed as you say they are and who actually believe you were married long ago who shall be able to give a contradiction to my report  and yet it is very probable that minute inquiries will be made and this is what renders precaution necessary for mr james harlowe will not believe that you are married and is sure he says that you both lived together when mr hickmans application was made to mr john harlowe and if you lived together any time unmarried he infers from your character mr lovelace that it is not probable that you would ever marry and he leaves it to his two uncles to decide if you even should be married whether there be not room to believe that his sister was first dishonored and if so to judge of the title she will have to their favor or to the forgiveness of any of her family i believe sir this part of my letter had best to be kept from the lady  what makes young mr harlowe the more earnest to find this out and find it out he is resolved and to come at his sisters speech too and for that purpose sets out tomorrow as i am wellinformed with a large attendance armed and mr solmes is to be of the party is this  mr john harlowe has told the whole family that he will alter and newsettle his will mr antony harlowe is resolved to do the same by his for it seems he has now given over all thoughts of changing his condition having lately been disappointed in a view he had of that sort with mrs how these two brothers generally act in concert and mr james harlowe dreads and let me tell you that he has reason for it on my mr harlowes account that his younger sister will be at last more benefited than he wishes for by the alteration intended he has already been endeavoring to sound his uncle harlowe on this subject and wanted to know whether any new application had been made to him on his sisters part mr harlowe avoided a direct answer and expressed his wishes for a general reconciliation and his hopes that his niece was married this offended the furious young man and he reminded his uncle of engagements they had all entered into at his sisters going away not to be reconciled but by general consent  mr john harlowe complains to me often of the uncontroulableness of his nephew and says that now that the young man has not anybody of whose superior sense he stands in awe he observes not decency in his behavior to any of them and this makes my mr harlowe still more desirous than ever of bringing his younger niece into favor again i will not say all i might of this young mans extraordinary rapaciousness  but one would think that these grasping men expect to live for ever  i took the liberty but within these two hours to propose to set on foot and offered my cover to a correspondence between my friend and his daughterniece as he still sometimes fondly calls her she was mistress of so much prudence i said that i was sure she could better direct every thing to its desirable end than anybody else could but he said he did not think himself entirely at liberty to take such a step at present and that it was best that he should have it in his power to say occasionally that he had not any correspondence with her or letter from her  you will see sir from all this the necessity of keeping our treaty an absolute secret and if the lady has mentioned it to her worthy friend miss how i hope it is in confidence  and now sir a few lines in answer to yours of monday last  mr harlowe was very well pleased with your readiness to come into his proposal but as to what you both desire that he will be present at the ceremony he said that his nephew watched all his steps so narrowly that he thought it was not practicable if he were inclinable to oblige you but that he consented with all his heart that i should be the person privately present at the ceremony on his part  however i think i have an expedient for this if your lady continues to be very desirous of her uncles presence except he should be more determined than his answer seemed to import of which i shall acquaint you and perhaps of what he says to it when i have the pleasure to see you in town but indeed i think you have no time to lose mr harlowe is impatient to hear that you are actually one and i hope i may carry him down word when i leave you next that i saw the ceremony performed  if any obstacle arises from the lady from you it cannot i shall be tempted to think a little hardly of her punctilio  mr harlowe hopes sir that you will rather take pains to avoid than to meet this violent young man he has the better opinion of you let me tell you sir from the account i gave him of your moderation and politeness neither of which are qualities with his nephew but we have all of us something to amend  you cannot imagine how dearly my friend still loves this excellent niece of his  i will give you an instance of it which affected me a good deal  if once more said he the last time but one we were together i can but see this sweet child gracing the upperend of my table as mistress of my house in my allotted month all the rest of the family present but as her guests for so i would have it and had her mothers consent for it  there he stopped for he was forced to turn his reverend face from me tears ran down his cheeks fain would he have hid them but he could not  yet  yet said he  how  how  poor gentleman he perfectly sobbed  how shall i be able to bear the first meeting  i bless god i am no hardhearted man mr lovelace my eyes showed to my worthy friend that he had no reason to be ashamed of his humanity before me  i will put an end to this long epistle be pleased to make my compliments acceptable to the most excellent of women as well as believe me to be  dear sir your faithful friend and humble servant antony tomlinson   during the above conversation i had planted myself at the further end of the apartment we were in over against the door which was open and opposite to the ladys chamber door which was shut i spoke so low that it was impossible at that distance that she should hear what we said and in this situation i could see if her door opened  i told the women that what i had mentioned of lady bettys and her nieces coming to town and of their intention to visit my spouse whom they had never seen nor she them was real and that i expected news of their arrival every hour i then showed them copies of the other two letters which i had left with her the one from lady betty the other from my cousin montague  and here thou may read them if thou will  eternally reproaching eternally upbraiding me are my impertinent relations but they are fond of occasions to find fault with me their love their love jack and their dependence on my known good humor their inducement  to robert lovelace esquire dear nephew wedn morn june   i understand that at length all our wishes are answered in your happy marriage but i think we might as well have heard of it directly from you as from the roundabout way by which we have been made acquainted with it methinks sir the power and the will we have to oblige you should not expose us the more to your slights and negligence my brother had set his heart upon giving to you the wife we have all so long wished you to have but if you were actually married at the time you made him that request supposing perhaps that his gout would not let him attend you it is but like you i gave the women room to think this reproach just jack   if your lady had her reasons to wish it to be private while the differences between her family and self continue you might nevertheless have communicated it to us with that restriction and we should have forborne the public manifestations of our joy upon an event we have so long desired  the distant way we have come to know it is by my steward who is acquainted with a friend of captain tomlinson to whom that gentleman revealed it and he it seems had it from yourself and lady with such circumstances as leave it not to be doubted  i am indeed very much disobliged with you so is my sister sadleir but i shall have a very speedy opportunity to tell you so in person being obliged to go to town on my old chanceryaffair my cousin leeson who is it seems removed to albemarlestreet has notice of it i shall be at her house where i bespeak your attendance on sunday night i have written to my cousin charlotte for either her or her sister to meet me at reading and accompany me to town i shall stay but a few days my business being matter of form only on my return i shall pop upon my brother at m hall to see in what way his last fit has left him  mean time having told you my mind on your negligence i cannot help congratulating you both upon the occasion your fair lady particularly upon her entrance into a family which is prepared to admire and love her  my principal intention of writing to you dispensing with the necessary punctilio is that you may acquaint my dear new niece that i will not be denied the honor of her company down with me into oxfordshire i understand that your proposed house and equipages cannot be soon ready she shall be with me till they are i insist upon it this shall make all up my house shall be her own my servants and equipages hers  lady sarah who has not been out of her own house for months will oblige me with her company for a week in honor of a niece so dearly beloved as i am sure she will be of us all  being but in lodgings in town neither you nor your lady can require much preparation  some time on monday i hope to attend the dear young lady to make her my compliments and to receive her apology for your negligence which and her going down with me as i said before shall be full satisfaction mean time god bless her for her courage tell her i say so and bless you both in each other and that will be happiness to us all  particularly to  your truly affectionate aunt eliz lawrance   to robert lovelace esquire dear cousin at last as we understand there is some hope of you now does my good lord run over his beadroll of proverbs of black oxen wild oats long lanes and so forth  now cousin say i is your time come and you will be no longer i hope an infidel either to the power or excellence of the sex you have pretended hitherto so much to undervalue nor a ridiculer or scoffer at an institution which all sober people reverence and all rakes sooner or later are brought to reverence or to wish they had  i want to see how you become your silken fetters whether the charming yoke fits light upon your shoulders if with such a sweet yoke fellow it does not my lord and my sister as well as i think that you will deserve a closer tie about your neck  his lordship frets like gumd taffaty that you have not written him word of the day the hour the manner and every thing but i ask him how he can already expect any mark of deference or politeness from you he must stay i tell him till that sign of reformation among others must appear from the influence and example of your lady but that if ever you will be good for any thing it will be quickly seen and oh cousin what a vast vast journey have you to take from the dreary land of libertinism through the bright province of reformation into the serene kingdom of happiness  you had need to lose no time you have many a weary step to tread before you can overtake those travelers who set out for it from a less remote quarter but you have a charming pole star to guide you that is your advantage i wish you joy of it and as i have never yet expected any highly complaisant thing from you i make no scruple to begin first but it is purely i must tell you in respect to my new cousin whose accession into our family we most heartily congratulate and rejoice in  i have a letter from lady betty she commands my attendance or my sisters at reading to proceed with her to the great beastly town to cousin leesons she puts lord m in hopes that she shall certainly bring down with her our lovely new relation for she says she will not be denied his lordship is the willinger to let me be the person as i am in a manner wild to see her my sister having two years ago had that honor at sir robert biddulphs so get ready to accompany us in our return except your lady has objections strong enough to satisfy us all lady sarah longs to see her and says this accession to the family will supply to it the loss of her beloved daughter  i shall soon i hope pay my compliments to the dear lady in person so have nothing to add but that i am  your old mad playfellow and cousin charlotte montague   the women having read the copies of these two letters i thought that i might then threaten and swagger  but very little heart have i said i to encourage such a visit from lady betty and miss montague to my spouse for after all i am tired out with her strange ways she is not what she was and as i told her in your hearing ladies i will leave this plaguey island though the place of my birth and though the stake i have in it is very considerable and go and reside in france or italy and never think of myself as a married man nor live like one  o dear said one  that would be a sad thing said the other  nay madam turning to mrs moore  indeed madam to miss rawlins  i am quite desperate i can no longer bear such usage i have had the good fortune to be favored by the smiles of very fine ladies though i say it and i looked modest both abroad and at home  thou know this to be true jack with regard to my spouse here i had but one hope left for as to the reconciliation with her friends i scorn them all too much to value that but for her sake and that was that if it pleased god to bless us with children she might entirely recover her usual serenity and we might then be happy but the reconciliation her heart was so much set upon is now as i hinted before entirely hopeless  made so by this rash step of hers and by the rasher temper she is in since as you will believe her brother and sister when they come to know it will make a fine handle of it against us both  affecting as they do at present to disbelieve our marriage  and the dear creature herself too ready to countenance such a disbelief  as nothing more than the ceremony   here i was bashful for miss rawlins by her preparatory primness put me in mind that it was proper to be so   i turned half round then facing the fanplayer and the matron  you yourselves ladies knew not what to believe till now that i have told you our story and i do assure you that i shall not give myself the same trouble to convince people i hate people from whom i neither expect nor desire any favor and who are determined not to be convinced and what pray must be the issue when her uncles friend comes although he seems to be a truly worthy man is it not natural for him to say to what purpose mr lovelace should i endeavor to bring about a reconciliation between mrs lovelace and her friends by means of her elder uncle when a good understanding is wanting between yourselves  a fair inference mrs moore  a fair inference miss rawlins  and here is the unhappiness  till she is reconciled to them this cursed oath in her notion is binding  the women seemed moved for i spoke with great earnestness though low  and besides they love to have their sex and its favors appear of importance to us they shook their deep heads at each other and looked sorrowful and this moved my tender heart too  it is an unheard of case ladies  had she not preferred me to all mankind  there i stopped  and that resumed i feeling for my handkerchief is what staggered captain tomlinson when he heard of her flight who the last time he saw us together saw the most affectionate couple on earth  the most affectionate couple on earth  in the accentgrievous repeated i  out then i pulled my handkerchief and putting it to my eyes arose and walked to the window  it makes me weaker than a woman  did i not love her as never man loved his wife i have no doubt but i do jack   there again i stopped and resuming  charming creature as you see she is i wish i had never beheld her face  excuse me ladies traversing the room and having rubbed my eyes till i supposed them red i turned to the women and pulling out my lettercase i will show you one letter  here it is  read it miss rawlins if you please  it will confirm to you how much all my family are prepared to admire her i am freely treated in it  so i am in the two others but after what i have told you nothing need be a secret to you two  she took it with an air of eager curiosity and looked at the seal ostentatiously coronetted and at the superscription reading out to robert lovelace esquire  ay madam  ay miss  that is my name giving myself an air though i had told it to them before i am not ashamed of it my wifes maiden name  unmarried name i should rather say  fool that i am  and i rubbed my cheek for vexation fool enough in conscience jack was harlowe  clarissa harlowe  you heard me call her my clarissa   i did  but thought it to be a feigned or lovename said miss rawlins  i wonder what is miss rawlinss lovename jack most of the fair romancers have in their early womanhood chosen lovenames no parson ever gave more real names than i have given fictitious ones and to very good purpose many a sweet dear has answered me a letter for the sake of owning a name which her godmother never gave her  no  it was her real name i said  i bid her read out the whole letter if the spelling be not exact miss rawlins said i you will excuse it the writer is a lord but perhaps i may not show it to my spouse for if those i have left with her have no effect upon her neither will this and i shall not care to expose my lord m to her scorn indeed i begin to be quite careless of consequences  miss rawlins who could not but be pleased with this mark of my confidence looked as if she pitied me  and here thou may read the letter no iii  to robert lovelace esquire cousin lovelace m hall wedn june   i think you might have found time to let us know of your nuptials being actually solemnized i might have expected this piece of civility from you but perhaps the ceremony was performed at the very time that you asked me to be your ladys father  but i shall be angry if i proceed in my guesses  and little said is soon amended  but i can tell you that lady betty lawrance whatever lady sarah does will not so soon forgive you as i have done women resent slights longer than men you that know so much of the sex i speak it not however to your praise might have known that but never was you before acquainted with a lady of such an amiable character i hope there will be but one soul between you i have before now said that i will disinherit you and settle all i can upon her if you prove not a good husband to her  may this marriage be crowned with a great many fine boys i desire no girls to build up again a family so ancient the first boy shall take my surname by act of parliament that is in my will  lady betty and niece charlotte will be in town about business before you know where you are they long to pay their compliments to your fair bride i suppose you will hardly be at the lawn when they get to town because greme informs me you have sent no orders there for your ladys accommodation  pritchard has all things in readiness for signing i will take no advantage of your slights indeed i am too much used to them  more praise to my patience than to your complaisance however  one reason for lady bettys going up as i may tell you under the rose is to buy some suitable presents for lady sarah and all of us to make on this agreeable occasion  we would have blazed it away could we have had timely notice and thought it would have been agreeable to all round the like occasions dont happen every day  my most affectionate compliments and congratulations to my new niece conclude me for the present in violent pains that with all your heroicalness would make you mad  your truly affectionate uncle m   this letter clenchd the nail not but that miss rawlins said she saw i had been a wild gentleman and truly she thought so the moment she beheld me  they began to intercede for my spouse so nicely had i turned the tables and that i would not go abroad and disappoint a reconciliation so much wished for on one side and such desirable prospects on the other in my own family  who knows thought i to myself but more may come of this plot than i had even promised myself what a happy man shall i be if these women can be brought to join to carry my marriage into consummation  ladies you are exceeding good to us both i should have some hopes if my unhappilynice spouse could be brought to dispense with the unnatural oath she has laid me under you see what my case is do you think i may not insist upon her absolving me from this abominable oath will you be so good as to give your advice that one apartment may serve for a man and his wife at the hour of retirement  modestly put belford  and let me here observe that few rakes besides me would find a language so decent as to engage modest women to talk with him in upon such subjects  they both simperd and looked upon one another  these subjects always make women simper at least no need but of the most delicate hints to them a man who is gross in a womans company ought to be knocked down with a club for like so many musical instruments touch but a single wire and the dear souls are sensible all over  to be sure miss rawlins learnedly said playing with her fan a casuist would give it that the matrimonial vow ought to supersede any other obligation  mrs moore for her part was of opinion that if the lady owned herself to be a wife she ought to behave like one  whatever be my luck thought i with this alleyed fair one any other woman in the world from fifteen to fiveandtwenty would be mine upon my own terms before the morning  and now that i may be at hand to take all advantages i will endeavor said i to myself to make sure of good quarters  i am your lodger mrs moore in virtue of the earnest i have given you for these apartments and for any one you can spare above for my servants indeed for all you have to spare  for who knows what my spouses brother may attempt i will pay you your own demand and that for a month or two certain board included as i shall or shall not be your hindrance take that as a pledge or in part of payment  offering her a thirty pound bank note  she declined taking it desiring she might consult the lady first adding that she doubted not my honor and that she would not let her apartments to any other person whom she knew not something of while i and the lady were here  the lady the lady from both the womens mouths continually which still implied a doubt in their hearts and not your spouse and your lady sir  i never met with such women thought i  so thoroughly convinced but this moment yet already doubting i am afraid i have a couple of skeptics to deal with  i knew no reason i said for my wife to object to my lodging in the same house with her here any more than in town at mrs sinclairs but were she to make such objection i would not quit possession since it was not unlikely that the same freakish disorder which brought her to hamstead might carry her absolutely out of my knowledge  they both seemed embarrassed and looked upon one another yet with such an air as if they thought there was reason in what i said and i declared myself her boarder as well as lodger and dinnertime approaching was not denied to be the former  letter iii mr lovelace to john belford esquire i thought it was now high time to turn my whole mind to my beloved who had had full leisure to weigh the contents of the letters i had left with her  i therefore requested mrs moore to step in and desire to know whether she would be pleased to admit me to attend her in her apartment on occasion of the letters i had left with her or whether she would favor me with her company in the dining room  mrs moore desired miss rawlins to accompany her in to the lady they tappd at her door and were both admitted  i cannot but stop here for one minute to remark though against myself upon that security which innocence gives that nevertheless had better have in it a greater mixture of the serpent with the dove for here heedless of all i could say behind her back because she was satisfied with her own worthiness she permitted me to go on with my own story without interruption to persons as great strangers to her as to me and who as strangers to both might be supposed to lean to the side most injured and that as i managed it was to mine a dear silly soul thought i at the time to depend upon the goodness of her own heart when the heart cannot be seen into but by its actions and she to appearance a runaway an eloper from a tender a most indulgent husband  to neglect to cultivate the opinion of individuals when the whole world is governed by appearance  yet what can be expected of an angel under twenty  she has a world of knowledge knowledge speculative as i may say but no experience how should she  knowledge by theory only is a vague uncertain light a will of the wisp which as often misleads the doubting mind as puts it right  there are many things in the world could a moralizer say that would afford inexpressible pleasure to a reflecting mind were it not for the mixture they come to us with to be graver still i have seen parents perhaps my own did so who delighted in those very qualities in their children while young the natural consequences of which too much indulged and encouraged made them as they grew up the plague of their hearts  to bring this home to my present purpose i must tell thee that i adore this charming creature for her vigilant prudence but yet i would not methinks wish her by virtue of that prudence which is however necessary to carry her above the devices of all the rest of the world to be too wise for mine  my revenge my sworn revenge is nevertheless adore her as i will uppermost in my heart  miss how says that my love is an herodian love vol iv p   0  by my soul that girls a witch  i am half sorry to say that i find a pleasure in playing the tyrant over what i love call it an ungenerous pleasure if thou will softer hearts than mine know it the women to a woman know it and show it too whenever they are trusted with power and why should it be thought strange that i who love them so dearly and study them so much should catch the infection of them  letter iv mr lovelace to john belford esquire i will now give thee the substance of the dialogue that passed between the two women and the lady  wonder not that a pervrse wife makes a listening husband the event however as thou will find justified the old observation that listeners seldom hear good of themselves conscious of their own demerits if i may guess by myself there is ingenuity jack and fearful of censure they seldom find themselves disappointed there is something of sense after all in these proverbs in these phrases in this wisdom of nations  mrs moore was to be the messenger but miss rawlins began the dialogue  your spouse madam  devil  only to fish for a negative or affirmative declaration  cl my spouse madam    miss r mr lovelace madam averrs that you are married to him and begs admittance or your company in the dining room to talk upon the subject of the letters he left with you   cl he is a poor wicked wretch let me beg of you madam to favor me with your company as often as possible while he is hereabouts and i remain here   miss r i shall with pleasure attend you madam but methinks i could wish you would see the gentleman and hear what he has to say on the subject of the letters   cl my case is a hard a very hard one  i am quite bewildered  i know not what to do  i have not a friend in the world that can or will help me  yet had none but friends till i knew that man   miss r the gentleman neither looks nor talks like a bad man  not a very bad man as men go   as men go  poor miss rawlins thought i  and do thou know how men go  cl o madam you know him not  he can put on the appearance of an angel of light but has a black a very black heart    poor i   miss r i could not have thought it truly  but men are very deceitful nowadays   nowadays  a fool  have not her historybooks told her that they were always so  mrs moore sighing i have found it so i am sure to my cost    who knows but in her time poor goody moore may have met with a lovelace or a belford or some such vile fellow  my little hareumscareum beauty knows not what strange histories every woman living who has had the least independence of will could tell her were such to be as communicative as she is  but here is the thing  i have given her cause enough of offense but not enough to make her hold her tongue  cl as to the letters he has left with me i know not what to say to them  but am resolved never to have any thing to say to him   miss r if madam i may be allowed to say so i think you carry matters very far   cl has he been making a bad cause a good one with you madam  that he can do with those who know him not indeed i heard him talking though not what he said and am indifferent about it but what account does he give of himself   i was pleased to hear this to arrest to stop her passion thought i in the height of its career is a charming presage  then the busy miss rawlins fished on to find out from her either a confirmation or disavowal of my story was lord m my uncle  did i court her at first with the allowance of her friends her brother excepted had i a rencounter with that brother was she so persecuted in favor of a very disagreeable man one solmes as to induce her to throw herself into my protection  none of these were denied all the objections she could have made were stfled or kept in by the consideration as she mentioned that she should stay there but a little while and that her story was too long but miss rawlins would not be thus easily answered  miss r he says madam that he could not prevail for marriage till he had consented under a solemn oath to separate beds while your family remained unreconciled   cl o the wretch  what can be still in his head to endeavor to pass these stories upon strangers   so no direct denial thought i  admirable  all will do byandby  miss r he has owned that an accidental fire had frightened you very much on wednesday night  and that  and that  and that  an accidental fire had frightened you  very much frightened you  last wednesday night    then after a short pause  in short he owned that he had taken some innocent liberties which might have led to a breach of the oath you had imposed upon him and that this was the cause of your displeasure  i would have been glad to see how my charmer then looked  to be sure she was at a loss in her own mind to justify herself for resenting so highly an offense so trifling she hesitated  did not presently speak  when she did she wished that she miss rawlins might never meet with any man who would take such innocent liberties with her  miss rawlins pushed further  your case to be sure madam is very particular but if the hope of a reconciliation with your own friends is made more distant by your leving him give me leave to say that it is pity  it is pity  i suppose the maiden then primmd fanned and blushed  it is pity the oath cannot be dispensed with especially as he owns he has not been so strict a liver   i could have gone in and kissed the girl  cl you have heard his story mine as i told you before is too long and too melancholy my disorder on seeing the wretch is too great and my time here is too short for me to enter upon it and if he has any end to serve by his own vindication in which i shall not be a personal sufferer let him make himself appear as white as an angel with all my heart   my love for her and the excellent character i gave her were then pleaded  cl specious seducer  only tell me if i cannot get away from him by some backway   how my heart then went pitapat  cl let me look out  i heard the sash lifted up whither does that path lead to is there no possibility of getting to a coach  surely he must deal with some fiend or how could he have found me out  cannot i steal to some neighboring house where i may be concealed till i can get quite away  you are good people  i have not been always among such  o help me help me ladies with a voice of impatience or i am ruined   then pausing is that the way to hendon pointing i suppose  is hendon a private place  the hamstead coach i am told will carry passengers thither  mrs moore i have an honest friend at millhill devil fetch her thought i where if such be your determination madam and if you think yourself in danger you may be safe i believe   cl anywhither if i can but escape from this man  whither does that path lead to out yonder  what is that town on the right hand called   mrs m highgate madam   miss r on the side of the heath is a little village called northend a kinswoman of mine lives there but her house is small i am not sure she could accommodate such a lady   devil take her too thought i  i imagined that i had made myself a better interest in these women but the whole sex love plotting and plot ters too jack  cl a barn an outhouse a garret will be a palace to me if it will but a afford me a refuge from this man    her senses thought i are much livelier than mine what a devil have i done that she should be so very implacable  i told thee belford all i did was there any thing in it so very much amiss  such prospects of familyreconciliation before her too  to be sure she is a very sensible lady   she then espied my new servant walking under the window and asked if he were not one of mine   will was on the lookout for old grimes so is the fellow called whom my beloved has dispatched to miss howe and being told that the man she saw was my servant i see said she that there is no escaping unless you madam to miss rawlins i suppose can befriend me till i can get farther i have no doubt that that fellow is planted about the house to watch my steps but the wicked wretch his master has no right to control me he shall not hinder me from going whither i please i will raise the town upon him if he molests me dear ladies is there no backdoor for me to get out at while you hold him in talk  miss r give me leave to ask you madam is there no room to hope for accommodation had you not better see him he certainly loves you dearly he is a fine gentleman you may exasperate him and make matters more unhappy for yourself   cl o mrs moore o miss rawlins you know not the man  i wish not to see his face nor to exchange another word with him as long as i live   mrs moore i dont find miss rawlins that the gentleman has misrepresented anything you see madam to my clarissa how respectful he is not to come in till permitted he certainly loves you dearly pray madam let him talk to you as he wishes to do on the subject of the letters   very kind of mrs moore mrs moore thought i is a very good woman  i did not curse her then  miss rawlins said something but so low that i could not hear what it was thus it was answered  cl i am greatly distressed i know not what to do  but mrs moore be so good as to give his letters to him  here they are  be pleased to tell him that i wish him and his aunt and cousin a happy meeting he never can want excuses to them for what has happened any more than pretenses to those he would delude tell him that he has ruined me in the opinion of my own friends i am for that reason the less solicitous how i appear to his   mrs moore then came to me and being afraid that something would pass mean time between the other two which i should not like i took the letters and entered the room and found them retired into the closet my beloved whispering with an air of earnestness to miss rawlins who was all attention  her back was toward me and miss rawlins by pulling her sleeve giving intimation of my being there can i have no retirement uninvaded sir said she with indignation as if she was interrupted in some talk her heart was in  what business have you here or with me  you have your letters have not you  lovel i have my dear and let me beg of you to consider what you are about i every moment expect capt tomlinson here upon my soul i do he has promised to keep from your uncle what has happened  but what will he think if he finds you hold in this strange humor   cl i will endeavor sir to have patience with you for a moment or two while i ask you a few questions before this lady and mrs moore who just then came in both whom you have prejudiced in your favor by your specious stories  will you say sir that we are married together lay your hand upon your heart and answer me am i your wedded wife   i am gone too far thought i to give up for such a push as this  homeone as it is  my dearest soul how can you put such a question  is it either for your honor or my own that it should be doubted  surely surely madam you cannot have attended to the contents of capt tomlinsons letter  she complained often of want of spirits throughout our whole contention and of weakness of person and mind from the fits she had been thrown into but little reason had she for this complaint as i thought who was able to hold me to it as she did i own that i was excessively concerned for her several times  you and i vilest of men   my name is lovelace madam   therefore it is that i call you the vilest of men was this pardonable jack you and i know the truth the whole truth  i want not to clear up my reputation with these gentlewomen  that is already lost with every one i had most reason to value but let me have this new specimen of what you are capable of  say wretch say lovelace if thou had rather art thou really and truly my wedded hushand  say answer without hesitation   she trembled with impatient indignation but had a wildness in her manner which i took some advantage of in order to parry this cursed thrust  and a cursed thrust it was since had i positively averred it she never would have believed anything i had said and had i owned that i was not married i had destroyed my own plot as well with the women as with her and could have had no pretense for pursuing her or hindering her from going whithersoever she pleased not that i was ashamed to averr it had it been consistent with policy i would not have thee think me such a milksop neither  lovel my dearest love how wildly you talk what would you have me answer is it necessary that i should answer may i not reappeal this to your own breast as well as to captain tomlinsons treaty and letter you know yourself how matters stand between us  and captain tomlinson    cl o wretch is this an answer to my question say are we married or are we not   lovel what makes a marriage we all know if it be the union of two hearts there was a turn jack to my utmost grief i must say we are not since now i see you hate me if it be the completion of marriage to my confusion and regret i must own we are not but my dear will you be pleased to consider what answer half a dozen people whence you came could give to your question and do not now in the disorder of your mind and in the height of passion bring into question before these gentlewomen a point you have acknowleged before those who know us better   i would have whispered her about the treaty with her uncle and the contents of the captains letter but retreating and with a rejecting hand keep thy distance man cried the dear insolent  to thy own heart i appeal since thou evadest me thus pitifully  i own no marriage with thee bear witness ladies i do not and cease to torment me cease to follow me surely surely faulty as i have been i have not deserved to be thus persecuted  i resume therefore my former language you have no right to pursue me you know you have not begone then and leave me to make the best of my hard lot o my dear cruel papa said she in a violent fit of grief falling upon her knees and clasping her uplifted hands together thy heavy curse is completed upon thy devoted daughter i am punished dreadfully punished by the very wretch in whom i had placed my wicked confidence  by my soul belford the little witch with her words but more by her manner moved me wonder not then that her action her grief her tears set the women into the like compassionate manifestations  had not i a cursed task of it  the two women withdrew to the further end of the room and whispered a strange case there is no frenzy here  i just heard said  the charming creature threw her handkerchief over her head and neck continuing kneeling her back toward me and her face hid upon a chair and repeatedly sobbd with grief and passion  i took this opportunity to step to the women to keep them steady  you see ladies whispering what an unhappy man i am you see what a spirit this dear creature has  all all owing to her implacable relations and to her fathers curse  a curse upon them all they have turned the head of the most charming woman in the world  ah sir sir replied miss rawlins whatever be the fault of her relations all is not as it should be between you and her it is plain she does not think herself married it is plain she does not and if you have any value for the poor lady and would not totally deprive her of her senses you had better withdraw and leave to time and cooler consideration the event in your favor  she will compel me to this at last i fear miss rawlins i fear she will and then we are both undone for i cannot live without her she knows it too well  and she has not a friend will look upon her this also she knows our marriage when her uncles friend comes will be proved incontestably but i am ashamed to think i have given her room to believe it no marriage that is what she harps upon  well it is a strange case a very strange one said miss rawlins and was going to say further when the angry beauty coming toward the door said mrs moore i beg a word with you and they both stepped into the dining room  i saw her just before put a parcel into her pocket and followed them out for fear she should slip away and stepping to the stairs that she might not go by me will cried i aloud though i knew he was not near  pray child to a maid who answered call either of my servants to me  she then came up to me with a wrathful countenance do you call your servant sir to hinder me between you from going whither i please  dont my dearest life misinterpret every thing i do can you think me so mean and so unworthy as to employ a servant to constrain you  i call him to send to the public houses or inns in this town to inquire after captain tomlinson who may have alighted at some one of them and be now perhaps needlessly adjusting his dress and i would have him come were he to be without clothes god forgive me for i am stabbed to the heart by your cruelty  answer was returned that neither of my servants was in the way  not in the way said i  whither can the dogs be gone  o sir with a scornful air not far i will warrant one of them was under the window just now according to order i suppose to watch my steps  but i will do what i please and go whither i please and that to your face  god forbid that i should hinder you in any thing that you may do with safety to yourself  now i verily believe that her design was to slip out in pursuance of the closetwhispering between her and miss rawlins perhaps to miss rawlinss house  she then stepped back to mrs moore and gave her something which proved to be a diamond ring and desired her not whisperingly but with an air of defiance to me that that might be a pledge for her till she defrayed her demands which she should soon find means to do having no more money about her than she might have occasion for before she came to an acquaintances  mrs moore would have declined taking it but she would not be denied and then wiping her eyes she put on her gloves  nobody has a right to stop me said she  i will go  who should i be afraid of  her very question charming creature testifying her fear  i beg pardon madam turning to mrs moore and courtesying for the trouble i have given you  i beg pardon madam to miss rawlins courtesying likewise to her  you may both hear of me in a happier hour if such a one falls to my lot  and god bless you both  struggling with her tears till she sobbd  and away was tripping  i stepped to the door i put it to and setting my back against it took her struggling hand  my dearest life my angel said i why will you thus distress me  is this the forgiveness which you so solemnly promised   unhand me sir  you have no business with me you have no right over me you know you have not  but whither whither my dearest love would you go  think you not that i will follow you were it to the worlds end  whither would you go  well do you ask me whither i would go who have been the occasion that i have not a friend left  but god who knows my innocence and my upight intentions will not wholly abandon me when i am out of your power  but while in it i cannot expect a gleam of the divine grace or favor to reach me  how severe is this  how shockingly severe  out of your presence my angry fair one i can neither hope for the one nor the other as my cousin montague in the letter you have read observes you are my pole star and my guide and if ever i am to be happy either here or hereafter it must be in and by you  she would then have urged me from the door but respectfully opposing her begone man begone mr lovelace said she  stop not my way  if you would not that i should attempt the window give me passage by the door for once more you have no right to detain me  your resentments my dearest life i will own to be wellgrounded  i will acknowledge that i have been all in fault on my knee and down i dropped i ask your pardon and can you refuse to ratify your own promise  look forward to the happy prospect before us see you not my lord m and lady sarah longing to bless you for blessing me and their whole family can you take no pleasure in the promised visit of lady betty and my cousin montague and in the protection they offer you if you are dissatisfied with mine  have you no wish to see your uncles friend  stay only till captain tomlinson comes  receive from him the news of your uncles compliance with the wishes of both  she seemed altogether distressed was ready to sink and forced to lean against the wainscot as i kneeled at her feet a stream of tears at last burst from her less indignant ees  good heaven said she lifting up her lovely face and clasped hands what is at last to be my destiny  deliver me from this dangerous man and direct me  i know not what i do what i can do nor what i ought to do   the women as i had owned our marriage to be but half completed heard nothing in this whole scene to contradict not flagrantly to contradict what i had asserted they believed they saw in her returning temper and staggered resolution a love for me which her indignation had before suppressed and they joined to persuade her to tarry till the captain came and to hear his proposals representing the dangers to which she would be exposed the fatigues she might endure a lady of her appearance unguarded unprotected on the other hand they dwelt upon my declared contrition and on my promises for the performance of which they offered to be bound  so much had my kneeling humility affected them  women jack tacitly acknowledge the inferiority of their own sex in the pride they take to behold a kneeling lover at their feet  she turned from me and threw herself into a chair  i arose and approached her with reverence  my dearest creature said i  and was proceeding  but with a face glowing with conscious dignity she interrupted me  ungenerous ungrateful lovelace  you know not the value of the heart you have insulted nor can you conceive how much my soul despises your meanness but meanness must ever be the portion of the man who can act vilely   the women believing we were likely to be on better terms retired the dear perverse opposed their going but they saw i was desirous of their absence and when they had withdrawn i once more threw myself at her feet and acknowleged my offenses implored her forgiveness for this one time and promised the exactest circumspection for the future  it was impossible for her she said to keep her memory and forgive me what had thou seen in the conduct of clarissa harlowe that should encourage such an insult upon her as thou did dare to make how meanly must thou think of her that thou could presume to be so guilty and expect her to be so weak as to forgive thee   i besought her to let me go over with her captain tomlinsons letter i was sure it was impossible she could have given it the requisite attention  i have given it the requisite attention said she and the other letters too so that what i say is upon deliberation and what have i to fear from my brother and sister  they can but complete the ruin of my fortunes with my father and uncles let them and welcome you sir i thank you have lowered my fortunes but i bless god that my mind is not sunk with my fortunes it is on the contrary raised above fortune and above you and for half a word they shall have the estate they have envied me for and an acquittal of all expectations from my family that may make them uneasy  i lifted up my hands and eyes in silent admiration of her  my brother sir may think me ruined to the praise of your character by whom i have been seduced from them he may think it it impossible to be with you and be innocent you have but too well justified their harshest censures in every part of your conduct but i will now that i have escaped from you and that i am out of the reach of your mysterious devices wrap myself up in my own innocence and then she passionately folded her arms about herself and leave to time and to my future circumspection the reestablishment of my character  leave me then sir  pursue me not   good god interrupting her  and all this for what  hand i not yielded to your entreaties forgive me madam you could not have carried farther your resentments   wretch  was it not crime enough to give occasion for those entreaties would thou make a merit to me that thou did not utterly ruin her whom thou ought to have protected  begone man turning from me her face crimsoned over with passion  see me no more  i cannot bear thee in my sight   dearest dearest creature   if i forgive thee lovelace  and there she stopped to endeavor proceeded she to endeavor to terrify a poor creature by premeditation by low contrivance by cries of fire  a poor creature who had consented to take a wretched chance with thee for life  for heavens sake  offering to take her repulsing hand as she was flying from me toward the closet   what have thou to do to plead the sake of heaven in thy favor o darkest of human minds  then turning from me wiping her eyes and again turning toward me but her sweet face halfaside what difficulties have thou involved me in  thou that had a plain path before thee after thou had betrayed me into thy power  at once my mind takes in the whole of thy crooked behavior and if thou think of clarissa harlowe as her proud heart tells her thou ought to think of her thou will seek thy fortunes elsewhere how often have thou provoked me to tell thee that my soul is above thee  for gods sake madam for a souls sake which it is in your power to save from perdition forgive me the past offense i am the greatest villain on earth if it was a premeditated one yet i presume not to excuse myself on your mercy i throw myself i will not offer at any plea but that of penitence see but captain tomlinson see but my aunt and cousin let them plead for me let them be guaranties for m honor  if captain tomlinson come while i stay here i may see him but as for you sir   dearest creature let me beg of you not to aggravate my offense to the captain when he comes let me beg of you   what ask thou  is it not that i shall be of party against myself  that i shall palliate   do not charge me madam interrupted i with villainous premeditation  do not give such a construction to my offense as may weaken your uncles opinion  as may strengthen your brothers   she flung from me to the further end of the room she could go no further  and just then mrs moore came up and told her that dinner was ready and that she had prevailed upon miss rawlins to give her her company  you must excuse me mrs moore said she miss rawlins i hope also will  but i cannot eat i cannot go down as for you sir i suppose you will think it right to depart hence at least till the gentleman comes whom you expect  i respectfully withdrew into the next room that mrs moore might acquaint her i durst not myself that i was her lodger and boarder as whisperingly i desired she would and meeting miss rawlins in the passage dearest miss rawlins said i stand my friend join with mrs moore to pacify my spouse if she has any new fights upon my having taken lodgings and intending to board here i hope she will have more generosity than to think of hindering a gentlewoman from letting her lodgings  i suppose mrs moore whom i left with my fair one had apprised her of this before miss rawlins went in for i heard her say while i withheld miss rawlins  no indeed he is much mistaken  surely he does not think i will  they both expostulated with her as i could gather from bits and scraps of what they said for they spoke so low that i could not hear any distinct sentence but from the fair perverse whose anger made her louder and to this purpose i heard her deliver herself in answer to different parts of their talk to her  good mrs moore dear miss rawlins press me no further  i cannot sit down at table with him  they said something as i suppose in my behalf  o the insinuating wretch  what defense have i against a man who go where i will can turn every one even of the virtuous of my sex in his favor  after something else said which i heard not distinctly  this is execrable cunning  were you to know his wicked heart he is not without hope of engaging you two good persons to second him in the vilest of his machinations  how came she thought i at the instant by al this penetration my devil surely does not play m booty if i thought he did i would marry and live honest to be even with him  i suppose then they urged the plea which i hinted to miss rawlins at going in that she would not be mrs moores hindrance for thus she expressed herself  he will no doubt pay you your own price you need not question his liberality but one house cannot hold us why if it would did i fly from him to seek refuge among strangers  then in answer to somewhat else they pleaded  it is a mistake madam i am not reconciled to him i will believe nothing he says has he no given you a flagrant specimen of what a man he is and of what he is capable by the disguises you saw him in my story is too long and my stay here will be but short or i could convince you tha my resentments against him are but too wel founded  i suppose then that they pleaded for her leave for my dining with them for she said i have nothing to say to that  it is your own house mrs moore  it is your own table  you may admit whom you please to it  only leave me at my liberty to choose my company  then in answer as i suppose to their offer of sending her up a plate  a bit of bread if you please and a glass of water that is all i can swallow at present i am really very much discomposed saw you not how bad i was  indignation only could have supported my spirits   i have no objection to his dining with you madam added she in reply i suppose to a farther question of the same nature  but i will not stay a night in the house where he lodges if i can help it  i presume miss rawlins had told her that she would not stay dinner  for she said let me not deprive mrs moore of your company miss rawlins you will not be displeased with his talk he can have no design upon you  then i suppose they pleaded what i might say behind her back to make my own story good  i care not what he says or what he thinks of me repentance and amendment are all the harm i wish him whatever becomes of me  by her accent she wept when she spoke these last words  they came out both of them wiping their eyes and would have persuaded me to relinquish the lodgings and to depart till her uncles friend came but i knew better i did not care to trust the devil well as she and miss how suppose me to be acquainted with him for finding her out again if once more she escaped me  what i am most afraid of is that she will throw herself among her own relations and if she does i am confident they will not be able to withstand her affecting eloquence but yet as thou wilt see the captains letter to me is admirably calculated to obviate my apprehensions on this score particularly in that passage where it is said that her uncle thinks not himself at liberty to correspond directly with her or to receive applications from her  but through captain tomlinson as is strongly implied see p    of this volume   i must own notwithstanding the revenge i have so solemnly vowed that i would very fain have made for her a merit with myself in her returning favor and owed as little as possible to the mediation of captain tomlinson my pride was concerned in this and this was one of my reasons for not bringing him with me another was that if i were obliged to have recourse to his assistance i should be better able by visiting her without him to direct him what to say or to do as i should find out the turn of her humor  i was however glad at my heart that mrs moore came up so seasonably with notice that dinner was ready the fair fugitive was all in alt she had the game in her own hands and by giving me so good an excuse for withdrawing i had time to strengthen myself the captain had time to come and the lady to cool shakespeare advises well  oppose not rage while rage is in its force but give it way awhile and let it waste the rising deluge is not stopped with dams those it oerbears and drowns the hope of harvest but wisely managed its divided strength is sluicd in channels and securely drained and when its force is spent and unsupplyd the residue with mounds may be restrained and dryshd we may pass the naked ford i went down with the women to dinner mrs moore sent her fair boarder up a plate but she only eat a little bit of bread and drank a glass of water  doubted not but she would keep her word when it was once gone out is not she an harlowe  she seems to be inuring herself to hardships which at the worst she can never know since though she should ultimately refuse to be obliged to me or to express myself more suitably to my own heart to oblige me every one who sees her must befriend her  but let me ask thee belford art thou not solicitous for me in relation to the contents of the letter which the angry beauty has written and dispatched away by man and horse and for what may be miss howes answer to it art thou not ready to inquire whether it be not likely that miss how when she knows of her saucy friends flight will be concerned about her letter which she must know could not be at wilsons till after that flight and so probably would fall into my hands   all these things as thou wilt see in the sequel are provided for with as much contrivance as human foresight can admit  i have already told thee that will is upon the lookout for old grimes  old grimes is it seems a gossiping sottish rascal and if will can but light of him i will answer for the consequence for has not will been my servant upwards of seven years  letter v mr lovelace in continuation we had at dinner besides miss rawlins a young widowniece of mrs moore who is come to stay a month with her aunt  bevis her name very forward very lively and a great admirer of me i assure you  hanging smirkingly upon all i said and prepared to approve of every word before i spoke and who by the time we had halfdined by the help of what she had collected before was as much acquainted with our story as either of the other two  as it behoved me to prepare them in my favor against whatever might come from miss how i improved upon the hint i had thrown out abovestairs against that mischiefmaking lady i represented her to be an arrogant creature revengeful artful enterprising and one who had she been a man would have sworn and cursed and committed rapes and played the devil as far as i knew and i have no doubt of it jack but who nevertheless by advantage of a female education and pride and insolence i believed was personally virtuous  mrs bevis allowed that there was a vast deal in education  and in pride too she said while miss rawlins came with a prudish god forbid that virtue should be owing to education only however i declared that miss how was a subtle contriver of mischief one who had always been my enemy her motives i knew not but despising the man whom her mother was desirous she should have one hickman although i did not directly averr that she would rather have had me yet they all immediately imagined that that was the ground of her animosity to me and of her envy to my beloved and it was pity they said that so fine a young lady did not see through such a pretended friend  and yet nobody added i has more reason than she to know by experience the force of a hatred founded in envy as i hinted to you above mrs moore and to you miss rawlins in the case of her sister arabella  i had compliments made to my person and talents on this occasion which gave me a singular opportunity of displaying my modesty by disclaiming the merit of them with a no indeed  i should be very vain ladies if i thought so while thus abasing myself and exalting miss how i got their opinion both for modesty and generosity and had all the graces which i disclaimed thrown in upon me besides  in short they even oppressed that modesty which to speak modestly of myself their praises created by disbelieving all i said against myself  and truly i must needs say they have almost persuaded even me myself that miss how is actually in love with me i have often been willing to hope this and who knows but she may the captain and i have agreed that it shall be so insinuated occasionally  and what is thy opinion jack she certainly hates hickman and girls who are disengaged seldom hate though they may not love and if she had rather have another why not that other me for am i not a smart fellow and a rake and do not your sprightly ladies love your smart fellows and your rakes and where is the wonder that the man who could engage the affections of miss harlowe should engage those of a lady with her see vol iv p     where miss how says alas my dear i knew you loved him alass who would be honored in being deemed her second  nor accuse thou me of singular vanity in this presumption belford were thou to know the secret vanity that lurks in the hearts of those who disguise or cloak it best thou would find great reason to acquit at least to allow for me since it is generally the conscious overfulness of conceit that makes the hypocrite most upon his guard to conceal it  yet with these fellows proudlyhumble as they are it will break out sometimes in spite of their cloaks though but in selfdenying complimentbegging selfdegradation  but now i have appealed this matter to thee let me use another argument in favor of my observation that the ladies generally prefer a rake to a sober man and of my presumption upon it that miss how is in love with me it is this  common fame says that hickman is a very virtuous a very innocent fellow  a malevirgin i warrant  an odd dog i always thought him  now women jack like not novices they are pleased with a love of the sex that is founded in the knowledge of it reason good novices expect more than they can possibly find in the commerce with them the man who knows them yet has ardors for them to borrow a word from miss how vol iv p    and      though those ardors are generally owing more to the devil within him than to the witch without him is the man who makes them the highest and most grateful compliment he knows what to expect and with what to be satisfied  then the merit of a woman in some cases must be ignorance whether real or pretended the man in these cases must be an adept will it then be wondered at that a woman prefers a libertine to a novice  while she expects in the one the confidence she wants she considers the other and herself as two parallel lines which though they run side by side can never meet  yet in this the sex is generally mistaken too for these sheepish fellows are fly  i myself was modest once and this as i have elsewhere hinted to thee vol iii p   0      has better enabled me to judge of both  but to proceed with my narrative  having thus prepared everyone against any letter should come from miss how and against my beloveds messenger returns i thought it proper to conclude that subject with a hint that my spouse could not bear to have anything said that reflected upon miss how and with a deep sigh added that i had been made very unhappy more than once by the ill will of ladies whom i had never offended  the widow bevis believed that might very easily be  these hints withindoors joined with others to will both without and within for i intend he shall fall in love with widow moores maid and have saved one hundred pounds in my service at least will be great helps as things may happen  letter vi mr lovelace in continuation we had hardly dined when my coachman who kept a lookout for captain tomlinson as will did for old grimes conducted hither that worthy gentleman attended by one servant both on horseback he alighted i went out to meet him at the door  thou know his solemn appearance and unblushing freedom and yet can not imagine what a dignity the rascal assumed nor how respectful to him i was  i led him into the parlour and presented him to the women and them to him  i thought it highly imported me as they might still have some diffidences about our marriage from my fairones home pushed questions on that head to convince them entirely of the truth of all i had asserted and how could i do this better than by dialoguing with him before them a little  dear captain i thought you long for i have had a terrible conflict with my spouse  capt i am sorry that i am later than my intention  my account with my banker  theres a dog jack took me up longer time to adjust than i had foreseen all the time pulling down and stroking his ruffles for there was a small difference between us  only twenty pounds indeed which i had taken no account of the rascal has not seen twenty pounds of his own these ten years   then had we between us the characters of the harlowe family i railing against them all the captain taking his dear friend mr john harlowes part with a not so fast  not so fast young gentleman  and the like free assumptions  he accounted for their animosity by my defiances no good family having such a charming daughter would care to be defied instead of courted he must speak his mind never was a doubletongud man  he appealed to the ladies if he were not right  he got them of his side  the correction i had given the brother he told me must have aggravated matters  how valiant this made me look to the women  the sex love us mettled fellows at their hearts  be that as it would i should never love any of the family but my spouse and wanting nothing from them would not but for her sake have gone so far as i had gone toward a reconciliation  this was very good of me mrs moore said  very good indeed miss rawlins  good  it is more than good it is very generous said the widow  capt why so it is i must needs say for i am sensible that mr lovelace has been rudely treated by them all  more rudely than it could have been imagined a man of his quality and spirit would have put up with but then sir turning to me i think you are amply rewarded in such a lady and that you ought to forgive the father for the daughters sake   mrs m indeed so i think   miss r so must everyone think who has seen the lady   widow b a fine lady to be sure but she has a violent spirit and some very odd humors too by what i have heard the value of good husbands is not known till they are lost   her conscience then drew a sigh from her  lovel nobody must reflect upon my angel  an angel she is  some little blemishes indeed as to her overhasty spirit and as to her unforgiving temper but this she has from the harlowes instigated too by that miss how  but her innumerable excellencies are all her own   capt ay talk of spirit there is a spirit now you have named miss how and so i led him to confirm all i had said of that vixen yet she was to be pitied too looking with meaning at me   as i have already hinted i had before agreed with him to impute secret love occasionally to miss how as the best means to invalidate all that might come from her in my disfavour  capt mr lovelace but that i know your modesty or you could give a reason    lovel looking down and very modest  i cannot think so captain  but let us call another cause   every woman present could look me in the face so bashful was i  capt well but as to our present situation  only it may not be proper  looking upon me and round upon the women   lovel o captain you may say anything before this company  only andrew to my new servant who attended us at table do you withdraw this good girl looking at the maidservant will help us to all we want   away went andrew he wanted not his cue and the maid seemed highly pleased at my honors preference of her  capt as to our present situation i say mr lovelace  why sir we shall be all untwisted let me tell you if my friend mr john harlowe were to know what that is he would as much question the truth of your being married as the rest of the family do   here the women perked up their ears and were all silent attention  capt i asked you before for particulars mr lovelace but you declined giving them  indeed it may not be proper for me to be acquainted with them  but i must own that it is past my comprehension that a wife can resent anything a husband can do that is not a breach of the peace so far as to think herself justified for eloping from him   lovel captain tomlinson  sir  i do assure you that i shall be offended  i shall be extremely concerned  if i hear that word mentioned again    capt your nicety and your love sir may make you take offense  but it is my way to call everything by its proper name let who will be offended    thou can not imagine belford how brave and how independent the rascal looked  capt when young gentleman you shall think proper to give us particulars we will find a word that shall please you better for this rash act in so admirable a lady  you see sir that being the representative of my dear friend mr john harlowe i speak as freely as i suppose he would do if present but you blush sir  i beg your pardon mr lovelace it becomes not a modest man to pry into those secrets which a modest man cannot reveal   i did not blush jack but denied not the compliment and looked down the women seemed delighted with my modesty but the widow bevis was more inclined to laugh at me than praise me for it  capt whatever be the cause of this step i will not again sir call it elopement since that harsh word wounds your tenderness i cannot but express my surprise upon it when i recollect the affectionate behavior which i was witness to between you when i attended you last overlove sir i think you once mentioned  but overlove smiling give me leave to say sir is an odd cause of quarrel  few ladies    lovel dear captain and i tried to blush   the women also tried and being more used to it succeeded better  mrs bevis indeed has a redhot countenance and always blushes  miss r it signifies nothing to mince the matter but the lady above as good as denies her marriage you know sir that she does turning to me   capt denies her marriage heavens how then have i imposed upon my dear friend mr john harlowe   lovel poor dear  but let not her veracity be called in question she would not be guilty of a wilful untruth for the world   then i had all their praises again  lovel dear creature  she thinks she has reason for her denial you know mrs moore you know miss rawlins what i owned to you above as to my vow    i looked down and as once before turned round my diamond ring  mrs moore looked awry and with a leer at miss rawlins as to her partner in the hintedat reference  miss rawlins looked down as well as i her eyelids halfclosed as if mumbling a paternoster meditating her snuff box the distance between her nose and chin lengthened by a closeshut mouth  she put me in mind of the pious mrs fetherstone at oxford whom i pointed out to thee once among other grotesque figures at st marys church where we went to take a view of her two sisters her eyes shut not daring to trust her heart with them open and but just halfrearing the lids to see who the nextcomer was and falling them again when her curiosity was satisfied  the widow bevis gazed as if on the hunt for a secret  the captain looked archly as if half in possession of one  mrs moore at last broke the bashful silence mrs lovelaces behavior she said could be no otherwise so well accountedfor as by the illoffices of that miss how and by the severity of her relations which might but too probably have affected her head a little at times adding that it was very generous in me to give way to the storm when it was up rather than to exasperate at such a time  but let me tell you sirs said the widow bevis that is not what one husband in a thousand would have done  i desired that no part of this conversation might be hinted to my spouse and looked still more bashfully her great fault i must own was overdelicacy  the captain leered round him and said he believed he could guess from the hints i had given him in town of my overlove and from what had now passed that we had not consummated our marriage  o jack how sheepishly then looked or endeavored to look thy friend how primly goody moore how affectedly miss rawlins  while the honest widow bevis gazed around her fearless and though only simpering with her mouth her eyes laughed outright and seemed to challenge a laugh from every eye in the company  he observed that i was a phoenix of a man if so and he could not but hope that all matters would be happily accommodated in a day or two and that then he should have the pleasure to averr to her uncle that he was present as he might say on our wedding day  the women seemed all to join in the same hope  ah captain ah ladies  how happy should i be if i could bring my dear spouse to be of the same mind  it would be a very happy conclusion of a very knotty affair said widow bevis and i see not why we may not make this very night a merry one  the captain superciliously smiled at me he saw plainly enough he said that we had been at childrens play hitherto a man of my character must have a prodigious value for his lady who could give way to such a caprice as this but one thing he would venture to tell me and that was this  that however desirous young skittish ladies might be to have their way in this particular it was a very bad settingout for the man as it gave his bride a very high proof of the power she had over him and he would engage that no woman thus humoured ever valued the man the more for it but very much the contrary  and there were reasons to be given why she should not  well well captain no more of this subject before the ladies  one feels in a bashful trytoblush manner shrugging my shoulders that one is so ridiculous  i have been punished enough for my tender folly  miss rawlins had taken her fan and would needs hide her face behind it i suppose because her blush was not quite ready  mrs moore hemmed and looked down and by that gave hers over  while the jolly widow laughing out praised the captain as one of hudibrass metaphysicians repeating he knew what is what and that is as high as metaphysic wit can fly   this made miss rawlins blush indeed  fie fie mrs bevis cried she unwilling i suppose to be thought absolutely ignorant  upon the whole i began to think that i had not made a bad exchange of our professing mother for the unprofessing mrs moore and indeed the women and i and my beloved too all mean the same thing we only differ about the manner of coming at the proposed end  letter vii mr lovelace in continuation it was now high time to acquaint my spouse that captain tomlinson was come and the rather as the maid told us that the lady had asked her if such a gentleman describing him was not in the parlour  mrs moore went up and requested in my name that she would give us audience  but she returned with a desire that captain tomlinson would excuse her for the present she was very ill her spirits were too weak to enter into conversation with him and she must lie down  i was vexed and at first extremely disconcerted the captain was vexed too and my concern thou may believe was the greater on his account  she had been very much fatigued i own her fits in the morning must have weakened her and she had carried her resentment so high that it was the less wonder she should find herself low when her raised spirits had subsided very low i may say if sinkings are proportioned to risings for she had been lifted up above the standard of a common mortal  the captain however sent up in his own name that if he could be admitted to drink one dish of tea with her he should take it for a favor and would go to town and dispatch some necessary business if possible to leave his morning free to attend her  but she pleaded a violent headache and mrs moore confirmed the plea to be just  i would have had the captain lodge there that night as well in compliment to him as introductory to my intention of entering my self upon my newtaken apartment but his hours were of too much importance to him to stay the evening  it was indeed very inconvenient for him he said to return in the morning but he was willing to do all in his power to heal this breach and that as well for the sakes of me and my lady as for that of his dear friend mr john harlowe who must not know how far this misunderstanding had gone he would therefore only drink one dish of tea with the ladies and me  and accordingly after he had done so and i had had a little private conversation with him he hurried away  his fellow had given him in the interim a high character to mrs moores servants and this reported by the widow bevis who being no proud woman is hail fellow well met as the saying is with all her aunts servants he was a fine gentleman a discreet gentleman a man of sense and breeding with them all and it was pity that with such great business upon his hands he should be obliged to come again  my life for yours audibly whispered the widow bevis there is humor as well as headache in somebodys declining to see this worthy gentleman  ah lord how happy might some people be if they would   no perfect happiness in this world said i very gravely and with a sigh for the widow must know that i heard her if we have not real unhappiness we can make it even from the overflowings of our own good fortune  very true and very true the two widows a charming observation mrs bevis miss rawlins smiled her assent to it and i thought she called me in her heart charming man for she professes to be a great admirer of moral observations  i had hardly taken leave of the captain and sat down again with the women when will came and calling me out sir sir said he grinning with a familiarity in his looks as if what he had to say entitled him to take liberties i have got the fellow down  i have got old grimes  hah hah hah hah  he is at the lowerflask  almost in the condition of davids sow and please your honor  the dog himself not much better here is his letter  from  from miss how  ha ha ha ha laughed the varlet holding it fast as if to make conditions with me and to excite my praises as well as my impatience  i could have knocked him down but he would have his say out  old grimes knows not that i have the letter  i must get back to him before he misses it  i only made a pretense to go out for a few minutes  but  but  and then the dog laughed again  he must stay  old grimes must stay  till i go back to pay the reckoning  d  n the prater  grinning rascal  the letter  the letter   he gathered in his wide mothe as he calls it and gave me the letter but with a strut rather than a bow and then sidled off like one of widow sorlingss dunghill cocks exulting after a great feat performed and all the time that i was holding up the billet to the light to try to get at its contents without breaking the seal for dispatched in a hurry it had no cover there stood he laughing shrugging playing off his legs now stroking his shining chin now turning his hat upon his thumb then leering in my face flourishing with his head  o christ nowandthen cried the rascal   what joy has this dog in mischief  more than i can have in the completion of my most favorite purposes  these fellows are ever happier than their masters  i was once thinking to rumple up this billet till i had broken the seal young families miss howes is not an ancient one love ostentatious sealings and it might have been supposed to have been squeezed in pieces in old grimess breeches pocket but i was glad to be saved the guilt as well as suspicion of having a hand in so dirty a trick for thus much of the contents enough for my purpose i was enabled to scratch out in character without it the folds depriving me only of a few connecting words which i have supplied between hooks  my miss harlowe thou know had before changed her name to miss laetitia beaumont another alias now jack i have learned her to be half a rogue in this instance for this billet was directed to her by the name of mrs harriot lucas  i congratulate you my dear with all my heart and soul upon your escape from the villain i long for the particulars of all my mamma is out but expecting her return every minute i dispatched your messenger instantly i will endeavor to come at mrs townsend without loss of time and will write at large in a day or two if in that time i can see her mean time i am excessively uneasy for a letter i sent you yesterday by collins who must have left it at wilsons after you got away it is of very great importance i hope the villain has it not i would not for the world that he should immediately send for it if by so doing the place you are at will not be discovered if he has it let me know it by some way out of hand if not you need not send  ever ever yours a h june    o jack what heartsease does this interception give me  i sent the rascal back with the letter to old grimes and charged him to drink no deeper he owned that he was half seas over as he phrased it  dog said i are you not to court one of mrs moores maids to night   cry your mercy sir  i will be sober  i had forgot that  but old grimes is plaguey tough  i thought i should never have got him down  away villain  let old grimes come and on horseback too to the door   he shall and please your honor if i can get him on the saddle and if he can sit   and charge him not to have alighted nor to have seen anybody   enough sir familiarly nodding his head to show he took me and away went the villain into the parlour among the women i  in a quarter of an hour came old grimes on horseback waving to his saddlebow now on this side now on that his head at others joining to that of his more sober beast  it looked very well to the women that i made no effort to speak to old grimes though i wished before them that i knew the contents of what he brought but on the contrary desired that they would instantly let my spouse know that her messenger was returned down she flew violently as she had the headache  o how i prayed for an opportunity to be revenged of her for the ungrateful trouble she had given to her uncles friend  she took the letter from old grimes with her own hands and retired to an inner parlour to read it  she presently came out again to the fellow who had much ado to sit his horse  here is your money friend i thought you long but what shall i do to get somebody to go to town immediately for me i see you cannot  old grimes took his money let fall his hat in doffing it had it given him and rode away his eyes isingglass and set in his head as i saw through the window and in a manner speechless all his language hiccoughs my dog need not have gone so deep with this tough old grimes  but the rascal was in his kingdom with him  the lady applied to mrs moore she mattered not the price could a man and horse be engaged for her  only to go for a letter left for her at one mr wilsons in pall mall  a poor neighbor was hired a horse procured for him he had his directions  in vain did i endeavor to engage my beloved when she was below her headache i suppose returned she like the rest of her sex can be ill or well when she pleases   i see her drift thought i it is to have all her lights from miss how before she resolves and to take her measures accordingly  up she went expressing great impatience about the letter she had sent for and desired mrs moore to let her know if i offered to send any of my servants to town  to get at the letter i suppose was her fear but she might have been quite easy on that head and yet perhaps would not had she known that the worthy captain tomlinson who will be in town before her messenger will leave there the important letter which i hope will help to pacify her and to reconcile her to me  o jack jack think thou that i will take all this roguish pains and be so often called villain for nothing  but yet is it not taking pains to come at the finest creature in the world not for a transitory moment only but for one of our lives  the struggle whether i am to have her in my own way or in hers  but now i know thou will be frightened out of thy wits for me  what lovelace would thou let her have a letter that will inevitably blow thee up and blow up the mother and all her nymphs  yet not intend to reform to marry  patience puppy can thou not trust thy master  letter viii mr lovelace in continuation i went up to my newtaken apartment and fell to writing in character as usual i thought i had made good my quarters but the cruel creature understanding that i intended to take up my lodgings there declared with so much violence against it that i was obliged to submit and to accept of another lodging about twelve doors off which mrs moore recommended and all the advantage i could obtain was that will unknown to my spouse and for fear of a freak should lie in the house  mrs moore indeed was unwilling to disoblige either of us but miss rawlins was of opinion that nothing more ought to be allowed me and yet mrs moore owned that the refusal was a strange piece of tyranny to an husband if i were an husband  i had a good mind to make miss rawlins smart for it come and see miss rawlins jack  if thou likest her i will get her for thee with a wet finger as the saying is  the widow bevis indeed stickled hard for me an innocent or injured man will have friends everywhere she said that to bear much with some wives was to be obliged to bear more and i reflected with a sigh that tame spirits must always be imposed upon and then in my heart i renewed my vows of revenge upon this haughty and perverse beauty  the second fellow came back from town about nine oclock with miss howes letter of wednesday last collins it seems when he left it had desired that it might be safely and speedily delivered into miss laetitia beaumonts own hands but wilson understanding that neither she nor i were in town  he could not know of our difference thou must think resolved to take care of it till our return in order to give it into one of our own hands and now delivered it to her messenger  this was told her wilson i doubt not is in her favor upon it  she took the letter with great eagerness opened it in a hurry i am glad she did yet i believe all was right before mrs moore and mrs bevis miss rawlins was gone home and said she would not for the world that i should have had that letter for the sake of her dear friend the writer who had written to her very uneasily about it  her dear friend repeated mrs bevis when she told me this  such mischiefmakers are always deemed dear friends till they are found out  the widow says that i am the finest gentleman she ever beheld  i have found a warm kiss nowandthen very kindly taken  i might be a very wicked fellow jack if i were to do all the mischief in my power but i am evermore for quitting a tooeasy prey to reptilerakes what but difficulty though the lady is an angel engages me to so much perseverance here and here conquer or die is now the determination  i have just now parted with this honest widow she called upon me at my new lodgings i told her that i saw i must be further obliged to her in the course of this difficult affair she must allow me to make her a handsome present when all was happily over but i desired that she would take no notice of what should pass between us not even to her aunt for that she as i saw was in the power of miss rawlins who being a maiden gentlewoman knew not the right and the fit in matrimonial matters as she my dear widow did  very true how should she said mrs bevis proud of knowing  nothing but for her part she desired no present it was enough if she could contribute to reconcile man and wife and disappoint mischiefmakers she doubted not that such an envious creature as miss how was glad that mrs lovelace had eloped  jealousy and love was old nick  see belford how charmingly things work between me and my new acquaintance the widow  who knows but that she may after a little farther intimacy though i am banished the house on nights contrive a midnight visit for me to my spouse when all is still and fast asleep  where can a woman be safe who has once entered the lists with a contriving and intrepid lover  but as to this letter methinks thou say of miss how  i knew thou would be uneasy for me but did not i tell thee that i had provided for every thing that i always took care to keep seals entire and to preserve covers vol iv p      was it not easy then think thou to contrive a shorter letter out of a longer and to copy the very words  i can tell thee it was so well ordered that not being suspected to have been in my hands it was not easy to find me out had it been my beloveds hand there would have been no imitating it for such a length her delicate and even mind is seen in the very cut of her letters miss howes hand is no bad one but is not so equal and regular that little devils natural impatience hurrying on her fingers gave i suppose from the beginning her handwriting as well as the rest of her its fits and starts and those peculiarities which like strong muscular lines in a face neither the pen nor the pencil can miss  have thou a mind to see what it was i permitted miss how to write to her lovely friend why then read it here as if by way of marginal observation as extracted from hers of wednesday last vol iv p      with a few additions of my own  the additions underscored mr lovelaces additions and connexions in this letter are printed in the italic character   my dearest friend you will perhaps think that i have been too long silent but i had begun two letters at different times since my last and written a great deal each time and with spirit enough i assure you incensed as i was against the abominable wretch you are with particularly on reading yours of the   st of the past month  the first i intended to keep open till i could give you some accounts of my proceedings with mrs townsend it was some days before i saw her and this intervenient space giving me time to reperuse what i had written i thought it proper to lay that aside and to write in a style a little less fervent for you would have blamed me i knew for the freedom of some of my expressions execrations if you please and when i had gone a good way in the second the change in your prospects on his communicating to you miss montagues letter and his better behavior occasioning a change in your mind i laid that aside also and in this uncertainty thought i would wait to see the issue of affairs between you before i wrote again believing that all would soon be decided one way or other   here i was forced to break off i am too little my own mistress  my mother vol iv p     always up and down and watching as if i were writing to a fellow what need i she asks me lock myself in p      if i am only reading past correspondencies for that is my pretense when she comes poking in with her face sharpened to an edge as i may say by a curiosity that gives her more pain than pleasure  the lord forgive me but i believe i shall huff her next time she comes in  do you forgive me too my dear my mother ought because she says i am my fathers girl and because i am sure i am hers  upon my life my dear i am sometimes of opinion that this vile man was capable of meaning you dishonor when i look back upon his past conduct i cannot help thinking so what a villain if so  but now i hope and verily believe that he has laid aside such thoughts my reasons for both opinions i will give you  for the first to wit that he had it once in his head to take you at advantage if he could i consider p      that pride revenge and a delight to tread in unbeaten paths are principal ingredients in the character of this finished libertine he hates all your family yourself excepted  yet is a savage in love his pride and the credit which a few plausible qualities sprinkled among his odious ones have given him have secured him too good a reception from our eyejudging our undistinguishing our selfflattering our tooconfiding sex to make assiduity and obsequiousness and a conquest of his unruly passions any part of his study  he has some reason for his animosity to all the men and to one woman of your family he has always shown you and his own family too that he prefers his pride to his interest he is a declared marriagehater a notorious intriguer full of his inventions and glorying in them as his vanity had made him imagine that no woman could be proof against his love no wonder that he struggled like a lion held in toils vol iv p      against a passion that he thought not returned ibid  hence perhaps it is not difficult to believe that it became possible for such a wretch as this to give way to his old prejudices against marriage and to that revenge which had always been a first passion with him p       and hence may we account for his delays his teazing ways his bringing you to bear with his lodging in the same house his making you pass to the people of it as his wife his bringing you into the company of his libertine companions the attempt of imposing upon you that miss partington for a bedfellow etc  my reasons for the contrary opinion to wit that he is now resolved to do you all the justice in his power to do you are these that he sees that all his own family p   0 have warmly engaged themselves in your cause that the horrid wretch loves you  with such a love however as hd loved his mariamne that on inquiry i find it to be true that counselor williams whom mr hickman knows to be a man of eminence in his profession has actually as good as finished the settlements that two draughts of them have been made one avowedly to be sent to this very captain tomlinson and i find that a license has actually been more than once endeavored to be obtained and that dfficulties have hitherto been made equally to lovelaces vexation and disappointment my mothers proctor who is very intimate with the proctor applied to by the wretch has come at this information in confidence and hints that as mr lovelace is a man of high fortunes these difficulties will probably be got over  i had once resolved to make strict inquiry about tomlinson and still if you will your uncles favorite housekeeper may be sounded at distance  i know that the matter is so laid p      that mrs hodges is supposed to knw nothing of the treaty set on foot by means of capt tomlinson but your uncle is an old man p      and old men imagine themselves to be under obligation to their paramours if younger than themselves and seldom keep any thing from their knowledge  yet methinks there can be no need since tomlinson as you describe him is so good a man and so much of a gentleman the end to be answered by his being an impostor so much more than necessary if lovelace has villainy in his head  and thus what he communicated to you of mr hickmans application to your uncle and of mrs nortons to your mother some of which particulars i am satisfied his vile agent joseph leman could not reveal to his viler employer his pushing on the marriageday in the name of your uncle which it could not answer any wicked purpose for him to do and what he writes of your uncles proposal to have it thought that you were married from the time that you had lived in one house together and that to be made to agree with the time of mr hickmans visit to your uncle the insisting on a trusty persons being present at the ceremony at that uncles nomination  these things make me assured that he now at last means honorably  but if any unexpected delays should happen on his side acquaint me my dear of the very street where mrs sinclair lives and where mrs fretchvilles house is situated which i cannot find that you have ever mentioned in your former letters  which is a little odd and i will make strict inquiries of them and of tomlinson too and i will if your heart will let you take my advice soon procure you a refuge from him with mrs townsend  but why do i now when you seem to be in so good a train puzzle and perplex you with my retrospections and yet they may be of use to you if any delay happen on his part  but that i think cannot well be what you have therefore now to do is so to behave to this proudspirited wretch as may banish from his mind all remembrance of past disobligations vol iv p      and to receive his addresses as those of a betrothed lover you will incur the censure of prudery and affectation if you keep him at that distance which you have hitherto kept him at his sudden and as suddenly recovered illness has given him an opportunity to find out that you love him alas my dear i knew you loved him he has seemed to change his nature and is all love and gentleness and no more quarrels now i beseech you  i am very angry with him nevertheless for the freedoms which he took with your person see p           0  and i think some guard is necessary as he is certainly an incroacher but indeed all men are so and you are such a charming creature and have kept him at such a distance  but no more of this subject only my dear be not overnice now you are so near the state you see what difficulties you laid yourself under when tomlinsons letter called you again into the wretchs company  if you meet with no impediments no new causes of doubt p      your reputation in the eye of the world is concerned that you should be his and as your uncle rightly judges be thought to have been his before now and yet let me tell you i can hardly bear to think that these libertines should be rewarded for their villainy with the best of the sex when the worst of it are too good for them  i shall send this long letter by collins p      who changes his day to oblige me as none of our letters by wilsons conveyance have miscarried when you have been in more apparently disagreeable situations than you are in at present i have no doubt that this will go safe  miss lardner p         whom you have seen at her cousin biddulphs saw you at st jamess church on sunday was fortnight she kept you in her eye during the whole time but could not once obtain the notice of yours though she courtesied to you twice she thought to pay her compliments to you when the service was over for she doubted not but you were married  and for an odd reason  because you came to church by yourself  every eye as usual she said was upon you and this seeming to give you hurry and you being nearer the door than she you slid out before she could go to you but she ordered her servant to follow you till you were housed this servant saw you step into a chair which waited for you and you ordered the men to carry you to the place where they took you up she describes the house as a very gentel house and fit to receive people of fashion and what makes me mention this is that perhaps you will have a visit from her or message at least  so that you have mr dolemans testimony to the credit of the house and people you are with p      and he is a man of fortune and some reputation formerly a rake indeed but married to a woman of family and having had a palsyblow one would think a penitent you have also mr mennells at least passive testimony mr tomlinson s and now lastly miss lardners so that there will be the less need for inquiry but you know my busy and inquisitive temper as well as my affection for you and my concern for your honor but all doubt will soon be lost in certainty  nevertheless i must add that i would have you command me up if i can be of the least service or pleasure to you p      i value not fame i value not censure nor even life itself i verily think as i do your honor and your friendship  for is not your honor my honor and is not your friendship the pride of my life  may heaven preserve you my dearest creature in honor and safety is the prayer the hourly prayer of  your ever faithful and affectionate anna how thursday morn   i have written all night excuse indifferent writing my crowquills are worn to the stmps and i must get a new supply     these ladies always write with crowquills jack   if thou art capable of taking in all my precautionaries in this letter thou will admire my sagacity and contrivance almost as much as i do myself thou see that miss lardner mrs sinclair tomlinson mrs fretchville mennell are all mentioned in it my first liberties with her person also modesty modesty belford i doubt is more confined to time place and occasion even by the most delicate minds than those minds would have it believed to be and why all these taken notice of by me from the genuine letter but for fear some future letter from the vixen should escape my hands in which she might refer to these names and if none of them were to have been found in this that is to pass for hers i might be routed horse and foot as lord m would phrase it in a like case  devilish hard and yet i may thank myself to be put to all this plague and trouble  and for what do thou ask o jack for a triumph of more value to me beforehand than an imperial crown  dont ask me the value of it a month hence but what indeed is an imperial crown itself when a man is used to it  miss how might well be anxious about the letter she wrote her sweet friend from what i have let pass of hers has reason to rejoice in the thought that it fell not into my hands  and now must all my contrivances be set at work to intercept the expected letter from miss how which is as i suppose to direct her to a place of safety and out of my knowledge mrs townsend is no doubt in this case to smuggle her off i hope the villain as i am so frequently called between these two girls will be able to manage this point  but what perhaps thou ask if the lady should take it into her head by the connivance of miss rawlins to quit this house privately in the night  i have thought of this jack does not will lie in the house and is not the widow bevis my fast friend  letter ix mr lovelace to john belford esquire saturday   oclock june  0 the lady gave wills sweetheart a letter last night to be carried to the post house as this morning directed for miss how under cover to hickman i dare say neither cover nor letter will be seen to have been opened the contents but eight lines  to own  the receipt of her doubledated letter in safety and referring to a longer letter which she intends to write when she shall have a quieter heart and less trembling fingers but mentions something to have happened my detecting her she means which has given her very great flutters confusions and apprehensions but which she will await the issue of some hopes for me hence jack before she gives her fresh perturbation or concern on her account  she tells her how impatient she shall be for her next etc  now belford i thought it would be but kind in me to save miss howes concern on these alarming hints since the curiosity of such a spirit must have been prodigiously excited by them having therefore so good a copy to imitate i wrote and taking out that of my beloved put under the same cover the following short billet inscriptive and conclusive parts of it in her own words  hamstead tuesday evening my everdear miss how a few lines only till calmer spirits and quieter fingers be granted me and till i can get over the shock which your intelligence has given me  to acquaint you  that your kind long letter of wednesday and as i may say of thursday morning is come safe to my hands on receipt of yours by my messenger to you i sent for it from wilsons there thank heaven it lay may that heaven reward you for all your past and for all your intended goodness to  your forever obliged cl harlowe   i took great pains in writing this it cannot i hope be suspected her hand is so very delicate yet hers is written less beautifully than she usually writes and i hope miss how will allow somewhat for hurry of spirits and unsteady fingers  my consideration for miss howes ease of mind extended still farther than to the instance i have mentioned  that this billet might be with her as soon as possible and before it could have reached hickman by the post i dispatched it away by a servant of mowbrays miss how had there been any failure or delay might as thou will think have communicated her anxieties to her fugitive friend and she to me perhaps in a way i should not have been pleased with  once more will thou wonderingly question  all this pains for a single girl  yes jack  but is not this girl a clarissa  and who knows but kind fortune as a reward for my perseverance may toss me in her charming friend less likely things have come to pass belford  and to be sure i shall have her if i resolve upon it  letter x mr lovelace to john belford esquire eight oclock sat morn june  0 i am come back from mrs moores whither i went in order to attend my charmers commands but no admittance a very bad night  doubtless she must be as much concerned that she has carried her resentments so very far as i have reason to be that i made such a poor use of the opportunity i had on wednesday night  but now jack for a brief review of my present situation and a slight hint or two of my precautions  i have seen the women this morning and find them halfright halfdoubting  miss rawlinss brother tells her that she lives at mrs mooress  mrs moore can do nothing without miss rawlins  people who keep lodgings at public places expect to get by every one who comes into their purlieus though not permitted to lodge there myself i have engaged all the rooms she has to spare to the very garrets and that as i have told thee before for a month certain and at her own price board included my spouses and all but she must not at present know it so i hope i have mrs moore fast by the interest  this devillike is suiting temptations to inclinations  i have always observed and i believe i have inted as much formerly vol iii p      that all dealers though but for pins may be taken in by customers for pins sooner than by a direct bribe of ten times the value especially if pretenders to conscience for the offer of a bribe would not only give room for suspicion but would startle and alarm their scrupulousness while a high price paid for what you buy is but submitting to be cheated in the method the person makes a profession to get by have i not said that human nature is a rogue vol iii p     vol iv p      and do not i know it  to give a higher instance how many proud senators in the year    0 were induced by presents or subscriptions of south sea stock to contribute to a scheme big with national ruin who yet would have spurned the man who should have presumed to offer them even twice the sum certain that they had a chance to gain by the stock  but to return to my review and my precautions  miss rawlins fluctuates as she hears the ladys story or as she hears mine somewhat of an infidel i doubt is this miss rawlins i have not yet considered her foible the next time i see her i will take particular notice of all the moles and freckles in her mind and then infer and apply  the widow bevis as i have told thee is all my own  my man will lies in the house my other new fellow attends upon me and cannot therefore be quite stupid  already is will over head and ears in love with one of mrs moores maids he was struck with her the moment he set his eyes upon her a raw country wench too but all women from the countess to the cookmaid are put into high good humor with themselves when a man is taken with them at first sight be they ever so plain no woman can be ugly jack they will find twenty good reasons besides the great one for sakes sake by the help of the glass without and perhaps in spite of it and conceit within to justify the honest fellows caption  the rogue has saved   0 l in my service  more by  0 than i bid him save no doubt he thinks he might have done so though i believe not worth a groat the best of masters i  passionate indeed but soon appeased  the wench is extremely kind to him already the other maid is also very civil to him he has a husband for her in his eye she cannot but say that mr andrew my other servant the girl is for fixing the person is a very wellspoken civil young man  we common folks have our joys and please your honor says honest joseph leman like as our betters have vol iii p      and true says honest joseph  did i prefer ease to difficulty i should envy these lowdegree sinners some of their joys  but if will had not made amorous pretensions to the wenches we all know that servants united in one common comparenote cause are intimate the moment they see one another  great genealogists too they know immediately the whole kin and kins kin of each other though dispersed over the three kingdoms as well as the genealogies and kins kin of those they serve  but my precautions end not here  o jack with such an invention what occasion had i to carry my beloved to mrs sinclairs  my spouse may have further occasion for the messengers whom she dispatched one to miss how the other to wilsons with one of these will is already wellacquainted as thou have heard  to mingle liquor is to mingle souls with these fellows with the other he will soon be acquainted if he be not already  the captains servant has his uses and instructions assigned him i have hinted at some of them already page    of this volume  he also serves a most humane and considerate master i love to make everybody respected to my power  the post general and penny will be strictly watched likewise  miss howes collins is remembered to be described miss howes and hickmans liveries also  james harlowe and singleton are warned against i am to be acquainted with any inquiry that shall happen to be made after my spouse whether by her married or maiden name before she shall be told of it  and this that i may have it in my power to prevent mischief  i have ordered mowbray and tourville and belton if his health permit to take their quarters at hamstead for a week with their fellows to attend them i spare thee for the present because of thy private concerns but hold thyself in cheerful readiness however as a mark of thy allegiance  as to my spouse herself has she not reason to be pleased with me for having permitted her to receive miss howes letter from wilsons a plain case either that i am no deep plotter or that i have no further views but to make my peace with her for an offense so slight and so accidental  miss how says though prefaced with an alas that her charming friend loves me she must therefore yearn after this reconciliation  prospects so fair  if she used me with less rigor and more politeness if she showed me any compassion seemed inclinable to spare me and to make the most favorable constructions i cannot but say that it would be impossible not to show her some but to be insulted and defied by a rebel in ones power what prince can bear that  but i return to the scene of action i must keep the women steady i had no opportunity to talk to my worthy mrs bevis in private  tomlinson a dog not come yet  letter xi mr lovelace to john belford esquire from my apartments at mrs moores miss rawlins at her brothers mrs moore engaged in household matters widow bevis dressing i have nothing to do but write this cursed tomlinson not yet arrived nothing to be done without him  i think he shall complain in pretty high language of the treatment he met with yesterday what are our affairs to him he can have no view but to serve us cruel to send back to town unaudienced unseen a man of his business and importance he never stirs a foot but something of consequence depends upon his movements a confounded thing to trifle thus humoursomely with such a gentlemans moments  these women think that all the business of the world must stand still for their figaries a good female word jack the greatest triflers in the creation to fancy themselves the most important beings in it  marry come up as i have heard goody sorlings say to her servants when she has rated at them with mingled anger and disdain  after all methinks i want these tostications thou see how women and womens words fill my mind to be over happily over that i may sit down quietly and reflect upon the dangers i have passed through and the troubles i have undergone i have a reflecting mind as thou know but the very word implies all got over  what briars and thorns does the wretch rush into a scratched face and tattered garments the unavoidable consequence who will needs be for striking out a new path through overgrown underwood quitting that beaten out for him by those who have traveled the same road before him  a visit from the widow bevis in my own apartment she tells me that my spouse had thoughts last night after i was gone to my lodgings of removing from mrs moores i almost wish she had attempted to do so  miss rawlins it seems who was applied to upon it dissuaded her from it  mrs moore also though she did not own that will lay in the house or rather sat up in it courting set before her the difficulties which in her opinion she would have to get clear off without my knowledge assuring her that she could be nowhere safer than with her till she had fixed whither to go and the lady herself recollected that if she went she might miss the expected letter from her dear friend miss how which as she owned was to direct her future steps  she must also surely have some curiosity to know what her uncles friend had to say to her from her uncle contemptuously as she yesterday treated a man of his importance nor could she i should think be absolutely determined to put herself out of the way of receiving the visits of two of the principal ladies of my family and to break entirely with me in the face of them all  besides whither could she have gone  moreover miss howes letter coming after her elopement so safely to her hands must surely put her into a more confiding temper with me and with every one else though she would not immediately own it  but these good folks have so little charity  are such severe censurers  yet who is absolutely perfect  it were to be wished however that they would be so modest as to doubt themselves sometimes then would they allow for others as others excellent as they imagine themselves to be must for them  saturday one oclock tomlinson at last is come forced to ride five miles about though i shall impute his delay to great and important business to avoid the sight of two or three impertinent rascals who little thinking whose affairs he was employed in wanted to obtrude themselves upon him i think i will make this fellow easy if he behave to my liking in this affair  i sent up the moment he came  she desired to be excused receiving his visit till four this afternoon  intolerable  no consideration  none at all in this sex when their cursed humors are in the way  payday pay hour rather will come  o that it were to be the next  the captain is in a pet who can blame him even the women think a man of his consequence and generously coming to serve us hardly used would to heaven she had attempted to get off last night the women not my enemies who knows but the husbands exerted authority might have met with such connivance as might have concluded either in carrying her back to her former lodgings or in consummation at mrs moores in spite of exclamations fits and the rest of the female obsecrations  my beloved has not appeared to anybody this day except to mrs moore is it seems extremely low unfit for the interesting conversation that is to be held in the afternoon longs to hear from her dear friend miss how  yet cannot expect a letter for a day or two has a bad opinion of all mankind  no wonder  excellent creature as she is with such a father such uncles such a brother as she has  how does she look  better than could be expected from yesterdays fatigue and last nights ill rest  these tender doves know not till put to it what they can bear especially when engaged in loveaffairs and their attention wholly engrossed but the sex love busy scenes stilllife is their aversion a woman will create a storm rather than be without one so as they can preside in the whirlwind and direct it they are happy  but my beloveds misfortune is that she must live in tumults yet neither raise them herself nor be able to control them  letter xii mr lovelace to john belford esquire sat night june  0 what will be the issue of all my plots and contrivances devil take me if i am able to divine but i will not as lord m would say forestall my own market  at four the appointed hour i sent up to desire admittance in the captains name and my own  she would wait upon the captain presently not upon me and in the parlour if it were not engaged  the dining room being mine perhaps that was the reason of her naming the parlour  mighty nice again if so  no good sign for me thought i this stiffness  in the parlour with me and the captain were mrs moore miss rawlins and mrs bevis  the women said they would withdraw when the lady came down  lovel not except she chooses you should ladies  people who are so much aboveboard as i am need not make secrets of any of their affairs besides you three ladies are now acquainted with all our concerns   capt i have some things to say to your lady that perhaps she would not herself choose that anybody should hear not even you mr lovelace as you and her family are not upon such a good foot of understanding as were to be wished   lovel well well captain i must submit give us a sign to withdraw and we will withdraw   it was better that the exclusion of the women should come from him than from me  capt i will bow and wave my hand thus  when i wish to be alone with the lady her uncle dotes upon her i hope mr lovelace you will not make a reconciliation more difficult for the earnestness which my dear friend shows to bring it to bear but indeed i must tell you as i told you more than once before that i am afraid you have made lighter of the occasion of this misunderstanding to me than it ought to have been made   lovel i hope captain tomlinson you do not question my veracity   capt i beg your pardon mr lovelace  but those things which we men may think lightly of may not be so to a lady of delicacy  and then if you have bound yourself by a vow you ought    miss rawlins bridling her lips closed but her mouth stretched to a smile of approbation the longer for not buttoning tacitly showed herself pleased with the captain for his delicacy  mrs moore could speak  very true however was all she said with a motion of her head that expressed the bowapprobatory  for my part said the jolly widow staring with eyes as big as eggs i know what i know  but man and wife are man and wife or they are not man and wife  i have no notion of standing upon such niceties  but here she comes cried one  hearing her chamber door open  here she comes another  hearing it shut after her  and down dropped the angel among us  we all stood up bowing and courtesying and could not help it for she entered with such an air as commanded all our reverence yet the captain looked plaguey grave  cl pray keep your seats ladies  pray do not go for they made offers to withdraw yet miss rawlins would have burst had she been suffered to retire before this time you have heard all my story i make no doubt  pray keep your seats  at least all mr lovelaces  a very saucy and whimsical beginning thought i   capt tomlinson your servant addressing herself to him with inimitable dignity i hope you did not take amiss my declining your visit yesterday i was really incapable of talking upon any subject that required attention  capt i am glad i see you better now madam i hope i do   cl indeed i am not well i would not have excused myself from attending you some hours ago but in hopes i should have been better i beg your pardon sir for the trouble i have given you and shall the rather expect it as this day will i hope conclude it all   thus set thus determined thought i  yet to have slept upon it  but as what she said was capable of a good as well as a bad construction i would not put an unfavourable one upon it  lovel the captain was sorry my dear he did not offer his attendance the moment he arrived yesterday he was afraid that you took it amiss that he did not   cl perhaps i thought that my uncles friend might have wished to see me as soon as he came how we stared  but sir to me it might be convenient to you to detain him   the devil thought i  so there really was resentment as well as headache as my good friend mrs bevis observed in her refusing to see the honest gentleman  capt you would detain me mr lovelace  i was for paying my respects to the lady the moment i came    cl well sir interrupting him to wave this for i would not be thought captious  if you have not suffered inconveniency in being obliged to come again i shall be easy   capt halfdisconcerted a little i cannot say but i have i have indeed too many affairs upon my hands but the desire i have to serve you and mr lovelace as well as to oblige my dear friend your uncle harlowe make great inconveniences but small ones   cl you are very obliging sir  here is a great alteration since you parted with us last   capt a great one indeed madam i was very much surprised at it on thursday evening when mr lovelace conducted me to your lodgings where we hoped to find you   cl have you any thing to say to me sir from my uncle himself that requires my private ear dont go ladies for the women stood up and offered to withdraw  if mr lovelace stays i am sure you may   i frowned i bit my lip i looked at the women and shook my head  capt i have nothing to offer but what mr lovelace is a party to and may hear except one private word or two which may be postponed to the last   cl pray ladies keep your seats  things are altered sir since i saw you you can mention nothing that relates to me now to which that gentleman can be a party   capt you surprise me madam i am sorry to hear this  sorry for your uncles sake  sorry for your sake  sorry for mr lovelaces sake  and yet i am sure he must have given greater occasion than he has mentioned to me or    lovel indeed captain indeed ladies i have told you great part of my story  and what i told you of my offense was the truth  what i concealed of my story was only what i apprehended would if known cause this dear creature to be thought more censorious than charitable   cl well well sir say what you please make me as black as you please make yourself as white as you can i am not now in your power that will comfort me for all   capt god forbid that i should offer to plead in behalf of a crime that a lady of virtue and honor cannot forgive but surely surely madam this is going too far   cl do not blame me capt tomlinson i have a good opinion of you as my uncles friend but if you are mr lovelaces friend that is another thing for my interests and mr lovelaces must now be for ever separated   capt one word with you madam if you please  offering to retire   cl you may say all that you please to say before these gentlewomen mr lovelace may have secrets i have none you seem to think me faulty i should be glad that all the world knew my heart let my enemies sit in judgment upon my actions fairly scanned i fear not the result let them even ask me my most secret thoughts and whether they make for me or against me i will reveal them   capt noble lady who can say as you say   the women held up their hands and eyes each as if she had said not i  no disorder here said miss rawlins but judging by her own heart a confounded deal of improbability i believe she thought  finely said to be sure said the widow bevis shrugging her shoulders  mrs moore sighed  jack belford thought i knows all mine and in this i am more ingenuous than any of the three and a fit match for this paragon  cl how mr lovelace has found me out here i cannot tell but such mean devices such artful such worse than waltham disguises put on to obtrude himself into my company such bold such shocking untruths    capt the favor of but one word madam in private    cl in order to support a right which he has not over me  o sir o capt tomlinson  i think i have reason to say that the man is capable of any vileness    the women looked upon one another and upon me by turns to see how i bore it i had such dartings in my head at the instant that i thought i should have gone distracted my brain seemed on fire what would i have given to have had her alone with me  i traversed the room my clenched fist to my forehead o that i had anybody here thought i that herculeslike when flaming in the tortures of deianiras poisoned shirt i could tear in pieces  capt dear lady see you not how the poor gentleman  lord how have i imposed upon your uncle at this rate how happy did i tell him i saw you how happy i was sure you would be in each other   cl oh sir you dont know how many premeditated offenses i had forgiven when i saw you last before i could appear to you what i hoped then i might for the future be  but now you may tell my uncle if you please that i cannot hope for his mediation tell him that my guilt in giving this man an opportunity to spirit me away from my tried my experienced my natural friends harshly as they treated me stares me every day more and more in the face and still the more as my fate seems to be drawing to a crisis according to the malediction of my offended father   and then she burst into tears which even affected that dog who brought to abet me was himself all belforded over  the women so used to cry without grief as they are to laugh without reason by mere force of example confound their promptitudes must needs pull out their handkerchiefs the less wonder however as i myself between confusion surprise and concern could hardly stand it  what is a tender heart good for  who can be happy that has a feeling heart  and yet thou wilt say that he who has it not must be a tiger and no man  capt let me beg the favor of one word with you madam in private and that on my own account   the women hereupon offered to retire she insisted that if they went i should not stay  capt sir bowing to me shall i beg    i hope thought i that i may trust this solemn dog instructed as he is she does not doubt him i will stay out no longer than to give her time to spend her first fire  i then passively withdrew with the women  but with such a bow to my goddess that it won for me every heart but that i wanted most to win for the haughty maid bent not her knee in return  the conversation between the captain and the lady when we were retired was to the following effect they both talked loud enough for me to hear them the lady from anger the captain with design and thou may be sure there was no listener but myself what i was imperfect in was supplied afterward for i had my vellomleavd book to note all down  if she had known this perhaps she would have been more sparing of her invectives  and but perhaps neither  he told her that as her brother was absolutely resolved to see her and as he himself in compliance with her uncles expedient had reported her marriage and as that report had reached the ears of lord m lady betty and the rest of my relations and as he had been obliged in consequence of his first report to vouch it and as her brother might find out where she was and apply to the women here for a confirmation or refutation of the marriage he had thought himself obliged to countenance the report before the women that this had embarassed him not a little as he would not for the world that she should have cause to think him capable of prevarication contrivance or doubledealing and that this made him desirous of a private conversation with her  it was true she said she had given her consent to such an expedient believing it was her uncles and little thinking that it would lead to so many errors yet she might have known that one error is frequently the parent of many mr lovelace had made her sensible of the truth of that observation on more occasions than one and it was an observation that he the captain had made in one of the letters that was shown her yesterday page    of this volume   he hoped that she had no mistrust of him that she had no doubts of his honor if madam you suspect me  if you think me capable  what a man  the lord be merciful to me  what a man must you think me  i hope sir there cannot be a man in the world who could deserve to be suspected in such a case as this i do not suspect you if it were possible there could be one such man i am sure capt tomlinson a father of children a man in years of sense and experience cannot be that man  he told me that just then he thought he felt a sudden flash from her eye an eyebeam as he called it dart through his shivering reins and he could not help trembling  the dogs conscience jack nothing else  i have felt half a dozen such flashes such eyebeams in as many different conversations with this soulpiercing beauty  her uncle she must own was not accustomed to think of such expedients but she had reconciled this to herself as the case was unhappily uncommon and by the regard he had for her honor  this set the puppys heart at ease and gave him more courage  she asked him if he thought lady betty and miss montague intended her a visit  he had no doubt but they did  and does he imagine said she that i could be brought to countenance to them the report you have given out   i had hoped to bring her to this jack or she had not seen their letters but i had told the captain that i believe i must give up this expectation  no he believed that i had not such a thought he was pretty sure that i intended when i saw them to tell them as in confidence the naked truth  he then told her that her uncle had already made some steps toward a general reconciliation the moment madam that he knows you are really married he will enter into conference with your father upon it having actually expressed his desire to be reconciled to you to your mother  and what sir said my mother what said my dear mother with great emotion holding out her sweet face as the captain described her with the most earnest attention as if she would shorten the way which his words were to have to her heart  your mother madam burst into tears upon it and your uncle was so penetrated by her tenderness that he could not proceed with the subject but he intends to enter upon it with her in form as soon as he hears that the ceremony is over  by the tone of her voice she wept the dear creature thought i begins to relent  and i grudged the dog his eloquence i could hardly bear the thought that any man breathing should have the power which i had lost of persuading this highsould lady though in my own favor and would thou think it this reflection gave me more uneasiness at the moment than i felt from her reproaches violent as they were or than i had pleasure in her supposed relenting for there is beauty in everything she says and does beauty in her passion beauty in her tears  had the captain been a young fellow and of rank and fortune his throat would have been in danger and i should have thought very hardly of her  o capt tomlinson said she you know not what i have suffered by this mans strange ways he had as i was not ashamed to tell him yesterday a plain path before him he at first betrayed me into his power but when i was in it  there she stopped then resuming  o sir you know not what a strange man he has been  an unpolite a roughmannerd man  in disgrace of his birth and education and knowledge an unpolite man  and so acting as if his worldly and personal advantages set him above those graces which distinguish a gentleman  the first woman that ever said or that ever thought so of me that is my comfort thought i  but this spoken to her uncles friend behind my back helps to heap up thy already toofull measure dearest  it is down in my vellombook  cl when i look back on his whole behavior to a poor young creature for i am but a very young creature i cannot acquit him either of great folly or of deep design  and last wednesday    there she stopped and i suppose turned away her face i wonder she was not ashamed to hint at what she thought so shameful and that to a man and alone with him  capt far be it from me madam to offer to enter too closely into so tender a subject he owns that you have reason to be displeased with him but he so solemnly clears himself to me of premeditated offense    cl he cannot clear himself mr tomlinson the people of the house must be very vile as well as he i am convinced that there was a wicked confederacy  but no more upon such a subject   capt only one word more madam he tells me that he gave you such an instance of your power over him as never man gave and that you promised to pardon him   cl he knew that he deserved not pardon or he had not extorted that promise from me nor had i given it to him but to shield myself from the vilest outrage    capt i could wish madam inexcusable as his behavior has been since he has something to plead in the reliance he made upon your promise that for the sake of appearances to the world and to avoid the mischiefs that may follow if you absolutely break with him you could prevail upon your naturally generous mind to lay an obligation upon him by your forgiveness   she was silent  capt your father and mother madam deplore a daughter lost to them whom your generosity to mr lovelace may restore do not put it to the possible chance that they may have cause to deplore a double loss the losing of a son as well as a daughter who by his own violence which you may perhaps prevent may be for ever lost to them and to the whole family   she paused she wept she owned that she felt the force of this argument  i will be the making of this fellow thought i  capt permit me madam to tell you that i do not think it would be difficult to prevail upon your uncle if you insist upon it to come up privately to town and to give you with his own hand to mr lovelace  except indeed your present misunderstanding were to come to his ears   cl but why sir should i be so much afraid of my brother my brother has injured me not i him shall i seek protection from my brother of mr lovelace and who shall protect me from mr lovelace  will the one offer to me what the other has offered  wicked ungrateful man to insult a friendless unprotected creature made friendless by himself  i cannot cannot think of him in the light i once thought of him he has no business with me let him leave me let my brother find me i am not such a poor creature as to be afraid to face the brother who has injured me   capt were you and your brother to meet only to confer together to expostulate to clear up difficulties it were another thing but what madam can you think will be the issue of an interview mr solmes with him when he finds you unmarried and resolved never to have mr lovelace supposing mr lovelace were not to interfere which cannot be supposed   cl well sir i can only say i am a very unhappy creature  i must resign to the will of providence and be patient under evils which that will not permit me to shun but i have taken my measures mr lovelace can never make me happy nor i him i wait here only for a letter from miss how that must determine me    determine you as to mr lovelace madam interrupted the captain  cl i am already determined as to him   capt if it be not in his favor i have done i cannot use stronger arguments than i have used and it would be impertinent to repeat them  if you cannot forgive his offense i am sure it must have been much greater than he has owned to me  if you are absolutely determined be pleased to let me know what i shall say to your uncle you was pleased to tell me that this day would put an end to what you called my trouble i should not have thought it any could i have been an humble means of reconciling persons of worth and honor to each other   here i entered with a solemn air  lovel mr tomlinson i have heard a great part of what has passed between you and this unforgiving however otherwise excellent lady i am cut to the heart to find the dear creature so determined i could not have believed it possible with such prospects that i had so little a share in her esteem nevertheless i must do myself justice with regard to the offense i was so unhappy as to give since i find you are ready to think it much greater than it really was   cl i hear not sir your recapitulations i am and ought to be the sole judge of insults offered to my person i enter not into discussion with you nor hear you on the shocking subject and was going   i put myself between her and the door  you may hear all i have to say madam my fault is not o such a nature but that you may i will be a just accuser of myself and will not wound your ears  i then protested that the fire was a real fire so it was i disclaimed less truly indeed premeditation i owned that i was hurried on by the violence of a youthful passion and by a sudden impulse which few other persons in the like situation would have been able to check that i withdrew at her command and entreaty on the promise of pardon without having offered the least indecency or any freedom that would not have been forgiven by persons of delicacy surprised in an attitude so charming  her terror on the alarm of fire calling for a soothing behavior and personal tenderness she being ready to fall into fits my hopedfor happy day so near that i might be presumed to be looked upon as a betrothed lover  and that this excuse might be pleaded even for the women of the house that they thinking us actually married might suppose themselves to be the less concerned to interfere on so tender an occasion  there jack was a bold insinuation in behalf of the women  high indignation filled her disdainful eye eyebeam after eyebeam flashing at me every feature of her sweet face had soul in it yet she spoke not perhaps jack she had a thought that this plea for the women accounted for my contrivance to have her pass to them as married when i first carried her thither  capt indeed sir i must say that you did not well to add to the apprehensions of a lady so much terrified before   she offered to go by me i set my back against the door and besought her to stay a few moments i had not said thus much my dearest creature but for your sake as well as for my own that captain tomlinson should not think i had been viler than i was nor will i say one word more on the subject after i have appealed to your own heart whether it was not necessary that i should say so much and to the captain whether otherwise he would not have gone away with a much worse opinion of me if he had judged of my offense by the violence of your resentment  capt indeed i should i own i should and i am very glad mr lovelace that you are able to defend yourself thus far   cl that cause must be well tried where the offender takes his seat upon the same bench with the judge  i submit not mine to men  nor give me leave to say to you captain tomlinson though i am willing to have a good opinion of you had not the man been assured that he had influenced you in his favor he would not have brought you up to hamstead   capt that i am influenced as you call it madam is for the sake of your uncle and for your own sake more i will say to mr lovelaces face than for his what can i have in view but peace and reconciliation i have from the first blamed and i now again blame mr lovelace for adding distress to distress and terror to terror the lady as you acknowledge sir  looking valiantly ready before to fall into fits   lovel let me own to you captain tomlinson that i have been a very faulty a very foolish man and if this dear creature ever honored me with her love an ungrateful one but i have had too much reason to doubt it and this is now a flagrant proof that she never had the value for me which my proud heart wished for that with such prospects before us a day so near settlements approved and drawn her uncle mediating a reconciliation which for her sake not my own i was desirous to give into she can for an offense so really slight on an occasion so truly accidental renounce me for ever and with me all hopes of that reconciliation in the way her uncle had put it in and she had acquiesced with and risque all consequences fatal ones as they may too possibly be  by my soul captain tomlinson the dear creature must have hated me all the time she was intending to honor me with her hand and now she must resolve to abandon me as far as i know with a preference in her heart of the most odious of men  in favor of that solmes who as you tell me accompanies her brother and with what hopes with what view accompanies him  how can i bear to think of this    cl it is fit sir that you should judge of my regard for you by your own conscious demerits yet you know or you would not have dared to behave to me as sometimes you did that you had more of it than you deserved   she walked from us and then returning captain tomlinson said she i will own to you that i was not capable of resolving to give my hand and  nothing but my hand  have i not given a flagrant proof of this to the once most indulgent of parents which has brought me into a distress which this man has heightened when he ought in gratitude and honor to have endeavored to render it supportable i had even a byas sir in his favor i scruple not to own it long too long bore i with his unaccountable ways attributing his errors to unmeaning gaiety and to a want of knowing what true delicacy and true generosity required from a heart susceptible of grateful impressions to one involved by his means in unhappy circumstances it is now wickedness in him a wickedness which discredits all his professions to say that his last cruel and ungrateful insult was not a premeditated one  but what need i say more of this insult when it was of such a nature that it has changed that byas in his favor and made me choose to forego all the inviting prospects he talks of and to run all hazards to free myself from his power  o my dearest creature how happy for us both had i been able to discover that byas as you condescend to call it through such reserves as man never encountered with   he did discover it captain tomlinson he brought me more than once to own it the more needlessly brought me to own it as i dare say his own vanity gave him no cause to doubt it and as i had no other motive in not being forward to own it than my too just apprehensions of his want of generosity in a word captain tomlinson and now that i am determined upon my measures i the less scruple to say it i should have despised myself had i found myself capable of affectation or tyranny to the man i intended to marry i have always blamed the dearest friend i have in the world for a fault of this nature in a word   lovel and had my angel really and indeed the favor for me she is pleased to own  dearest creature forgive me restore me to your good opinion surely i have not sinned beyond forgiveness you say that i extorted from you the promise you made me but i could not have presumed to make that promise the condition of my obedience had i not thought there was room to expect forgiveness permit i beseech you the prospects to take place that were opening so agreeably before us i will go to town and bring the license all difficulties to the obtaining of it are surmounted captain tomlinson shall be witness to the deeds he will be present at the ceremony on the part of your uncle indeed he gave me hope that your uncle himself    capt i did mr lovelace and i will tell you my grounds for the hope i gave i proposed to my dear friend your uncle madam that he should give out that he would take a turn with me to my little farmhouse as i call it near northampton for a week or so  poor gentleman he has of late been very little abroad too visibly indeed declineing  change of air it might be given out was good for him  but i see madam that this is too tender a subject    the dear creature wept she knew how to apply as meant the captains hint to the occasion of her uncles declining state of health  capt we might indeed i told him set out in that road but turn short to town in my chariot and he might see the ceremony performed with his own eyes and be the desired father as well as the beloved uncle   she turned from us and wiped her eyes  capt and really there seem now to be but two objections to this as mr harlowe discouraged not the proposal  the one the unhappy misunderstanding between you which i would not by any means he should know since then he might be apt to give weight to mr james harlowes unjust surmizes  the other that it would necessarily occasion some delay to the ceremony which i cannot see but may be performed in a day or two  if    and then he reverently bowed to my goddess  charming fellow  but often did i curse my stars for making me so much obliged to his adroitness  she was going to speak but not liking the turn of her countenance although as i thought its severity and indignation seemed a little abated i said and had like to have blown myself up by it  one expedient i have just thought of   cl none of your expedients mr lovelace i abhor your expedients your inventions  i have had too many of them   lovel see capt tomlinson  see sir  o how we expose ourselves to you  little did you think i dare say that we have lived in such a continued misunderstanding together but you will make the best of it all we may yet be happy o that i could have been assured that this dear lady loved me with the hundredth part of the love i have for her  our diffidences have been mutual this dear creature has too much punctilio i am afraid that i have too little hence our difficulties but i have a heart capt tomlinson a heart that bids me hope for her love because it is resolved to deserve it as much as man can deserve it   capt i am indeed surprised at what i have seen and heard i defend not mr lovelace madam in the offense he has given you  as a father of daughters myself i cannot defend him though his fault seems to be lighter than i had apprehended  but in my conscience i think that you madam cany your resentment too high   cl too high sir  too high to the man that might have been happy if he would  too high to the man that has held my soul in suspense an hundred times since by artifice and deceit he obtained a power over me  say lovelace thyself say art thou not the very lovelace that by insulting me have wronged thy own hopes  the wretch that appeared in vile disguises personating an old lame creature seeking for lodgings for thy sick wife  telling the gentlewomen here stories all of thy own invention and asserting to them an husbands right over me which thou had not  and is it turning to the captain to be expected that i should give credit to the protestations of such a man   lovel treat me dearest creature as you please i will bear it and yet your scorn and your violence have fixed daggers in my heart  but was it possible without those disguises to come at your speech  and could i lose you if study if invention would put it in my power to arrest your anger and give me hope to engage you to confirm to me the promised pardon  the address i made to you before the women as if the marriageceremony had passed was in consequence of what your uncle had advised and what you had acquiesced with and the rather made as your brother and singleton and solmes were resolved to find out whether what was reported of your marriage were true or not that they might take their measures accordingly and in hopes to prevent that mischief which i have been but too studious to prevent since this tameness has but invited insolence from your brother and his confederates   cl o thou strange wretch how thou talkest  but captain tomlinson give me leave to say that were i inclined to talk any farther upon this subject i would appeal to miss rawlinss judgment who else have i to appeal to she seems to be a person of prudence and honor but not to any mans judgment whether i carry my resentment beyond fit bounds when i resolve    capt forgive madam the interruption  but i think there can be no reason for this you ought as you said to be the sole judge of indignities offered you the gentlewomen here are strangers to you you will perhaps stay but a little while among them if you lay the state of your case before any of them and your brother come to inquire of them your uncles intended mediation will be discovered and rendered abortive  i shall appear in a light that i never appeared in in my life  for these women may not think themselves obliged to keep the secret   cl o what difficulties has one fatal step involved me in  but there is no necessity for such an appeal i am resolved on my measures   capt absolutely resolved madam   cl i am   capt what shall i say to your uncle harlowe madam  poor gentleman how will he be surprised  you see mr lovelace  you see sir  turning to me with a flourishing hand  but you may thank yourself  and admirably stalked he from us   true by my soul thought i i traversed the room and bit my unpersuasive lips now upper now under for vexation  he made a profound reverence to her  and went to the window where lay his hat and whip and taking them up opened the door child said he to somebody he saw pray order my servant to bring my horse to the door   lovel you will not go sir  i hope you will not  i am the unhappiest man in the world  you will not go  yet alas  but you will not go sir  there may be yet hopes that lady betty may have some weight    capt dear mr lovelace and may not my worthy friend an affectionate uncle hope for some influence upon his daughterniece  but i beg pardon  a letter will always find me disposed to serve the lady and that as well for her sake as for the sake of my dear friend   she had thrown herself into a chair her eyes cast down she was motionless as in a profound study  the captain bowed to her again but met with no return to his bow mr lovelace said he with an air of equality and independence i am yours  still the dear unaccountable sat as immovable as a statue stirring neither hand foot head nor eye  i never before saw any one in so profound a resverie in so waking a dream  he passed by her to go out at the door she sat near though the other door was his direct way and bowed again she moved not i will not disturb the lady in her meditations sir  adieu mr lovelace  no farther i beseech you  she started sighing  are you going sir  capt i am madam i could have been glad to do you service but i see it is not in my power   she stood up holding out one hand with inimitable dignity and sweetness  i am sorry you are going sir  i cannot help it  i have no friend to advise with  mr lovelace has the art or goodfortune perhaps i should call it to make himself many  well sir  if you will go i cannot help it  capt i will not go madam his eyes twinkling again seized with a fit of humanity i will not go if my longer stay can do you either service or pleasure what sir turning to me what mr lovelace was your expedient  perhaps something may be offered madam    she sighed and was silent  revenge invoked i to myself keep thy throne in my heart  if the usurper love once more drive thee from it thou will never regain possession  lovel what i had thought of what i had intended to propose and i sighed  was this that the dear creature if she will not forgive me as she promised would suspend the displeasure she has conceived against me till lady betty arrives  that lady may be the mediatrix between us this dear creature may put herself into her protection and accompany her down to her seat in oxfordshire it is one of her ladyships purposes to prevail on her supposed new niece to go down with her it may pass to every one but to lady betty and to you capt tomlinson and to your friend mr harlowe as he desires that we have been some time married and her being with my relations will amount to a proof to james harlowe that we are and our nuptials may be privately and at this beloved creatures pleasure solemnized and your report captain authenticated   capt upon my honor madam clapping his hand upon his breast a charming expedient this will answer every end   she mused  she was greatly perplexed  at last god direct me said she i know not what to do  a young unfriended creature whom have i to advise with  let me retire if i can retire  she withdrew with slow and trembling feet and went up to her chamber  for heavens sake said the penetrated varlet his hands lifted up for heavens sake take compassion upon this admirable lady  i cannot proceed  i cannot proceed  she deserves all things   softly  damn the fellow  the women are coming in  he sobbd up his grief  turned about  hemmed up a more manly accent  wipe thy cursed eyes  he did the sunshine took place on one cheek and spread slowly to the other and the fellow had his whole face again  the women all three came in led by that evercurious miss rawlins i told them that the lady was gone up to consider of everything that we had hopes of her and such a representation we made of all that had passed as brought either tacit or declared blame upon the fair perverse for hardness of heart and overdelicacy  the widow bevis in particular put out one lip tossed up her head wrinkled her forehead and made such motions with her nowliftedup now castdown eyes as showed that she thought there was a great deal of perverseness and affectation in the lady nowandthen she changed her censuring looks to looks of pity of me  but as she said she loved not to aggravate  a poor business god helps shrugging up her shoulders to make such a rout about and then her eyes laughed heartily  indulgence was a good thing love was a good thing  but too much was too much  miss rawlins however declared after she had called the widow bevis with a prudish simper a comical gentlewoman that there must be something in our story which she could not fathom and went from us into a corner and sat down seemingly vexed that she could not  letter xiii mr lovelace in continuation the lady staying longer above than we wished and hoping that ladylike she only waited for an invitation to return to us i desired the widow bevis in the captains name who wanted to go to town to request the favor of her company  i cared not to send up either miss rawlins or mrs moore on the errand lest my beloved should be in a communicative disposition especially as she had hinted at an appeal to miss rawlins who besides has such an unbounded curiosity  mrs bevis presently returned with an answer winking and pinking at me that the lady would follow her down miss rawlins could not but offer to retire as the others did her eyes however intimated that she had rather stay but they not being answered as she seemed to wish she went with the rest but with slower feet and had hardly left the parlour when the lady entered it by the other door a melancholy dignity in her person and air  she sat down pray mr tomlinson be seated he took his chair over against her i stoo beh hers that i might give him agreedupon signals should there be occasion for them  as thus  a wink of the lefteye was to signify push that point captain  a wink of the right and a nod was to indicate approbation of what he had said  my forefinger held up and biting my lip get off of that as fast as possible  a rightforward nod and a frown  swear to it captain  my whole spread hand to take care not to say too much on that particular subject  and these motions i could make even those with my hand without holding up my arm or moving my wrist had the women been there as when they were agreed upon i knew not but they would  a scouling brow and a positive nod was to bid him rise in his temper  she hemmed  i was going to speak to spare her supposed confusion but this lady never wants presence of mind when presence of mind is necessary either to her honor or to that conscious dignity which distinguishes her from all the women i ever knew  i have been considering said she as well as i was able of every thing that has passed and of all that has been said and of my unhappy situation i mean no ill i wish no ill to any creature living mr tomlinson i have always delighted to draw favorable rather than unfavourable conclusions sometimes as it has proved for very bad hearts censoriousness whatever faults i have is not naturally my fault  but circumstanced as i am treated as i have been unworthily treated by a man who is full of contrivances and glories in them   lovel my dearest life  but i will not interrupt you   cl thus treated it becomes me to doubt  it concerns my honor to doubt to fear to apprehend  your intervention sir is so seasonable so kind for this man  my uncles expedient the first of the kind he ever i believe thought of a plain honest goodminded man as he is not affecting such expedients  your report in conformity to it  the consequences of that report the alarm taken by my brother his rash resolution upon it  the alarm taken by lady betty and the rest of mr lovelaces relations  the sudden letters written to him upon it which with yours he showed me  all ceremony among persons born observers of ceremony and entitled to value themselves upon their distinction  all these things have happened so quick and some of them so seasonable    lovel lady betty you see madam in her letter dispenses with punctilio avowedly in compliment to you charlotte in hers professes to do the same for the same reason good heaven that the respect intended you by my relations who in every other case are really punctilious should be thus construed they were glad madam to have an opportunity to compliment you at my expense every one of my family takes delight in raillying me but their joy on the supposed occasion    cl do i doubt sir that you have not something to say for anything you think fit to do  i am speaking to captain tomlinson sir  i wish you would be pleased to withdraw  at least to come from behind my chair   and she looked at the captain observing no doubt that his eyes seemed to take lessons from mine  a fair match by jupiter  the captain was disconcerted the dog had not had such a blush upon his face for ten years before i bit my lip for vexation walked about the room but nevertheless took my post again and blinkd with my eyes to the captain as a caution for him to take more care of his and then scouling with my brows and giving the nod positive i as good as said resent that captain  capt i hope madam you have no suspicion that i am capable    cl be not displeased with me captain tomlinson i have told you that i am not of a suspicious temper excuse me for the sake of my sincerity there is not i will be bold to say a sincerer heart in the world than hers before you   she took out her handkerchief and put it to her eyes  i was going at the instant after her example to vouch for the honesty of my heart but my conscience mennelld upon me and would not suffer the meditated vow to pass my lips  a devilish thing thought i for a man to be so little himself when he has most occasion for himself  the villain tomlinson looked at me with a rueful face as if he begged leave to cry for company it might have been as well if he had cried a feeling heart or the tokens of it given by a sensible eye are very reputable things when kept in countenance by the occasion  and here let me fairly own to thee that twenty times in this trying conversation i said to myself that could i have thought that i should have all this trouble and incurred all this guilt i would have been honest at first but why questioned i is this dear creature so lovely  yet so invincible  ever heardst thou before that the sweets of may blossomed in december  capt be pleased  be pleased madam  if you have doubts of my honor    a whining varlet he should have been quite angry  for what gave i him the nod positive he should have stalked to the window as for his whip and hat  cl i am only making such observations as my youth my inexperience and my present unhappy circumstances suggest to me  a worthy heart such i hope is captain tomlinsons need not fear an examination  need not fear being looked into  whatever doubt that man who has been the cause of my errors and as my severe father imprecated the punisher of the errors he has caused might have had of me or of my honor i would have forgiven him for them if he had fairly proposed them to me for he might perhaps have had some doubt of the future conduct of a creature whom he could induce to correspond with him against parental prohibition and against the lights which her own judgment threw in upon her and if he had propounded them to me like a man and a gentleman i would have been glad of the opportunity given me to clear my intentions and to have shown myself entitled to his good opinion  and i hope you sir    capt i am ready to hear all your doubts madam and to clear them up    cl i can only put it sir to your conscience and honor    the dog sat uneasy he shifted his feet her eye was upon him he was therefore after the rebuff he had met with afraid to look at me for my motions and now turned his eyes toward me then from me as if he would unlook his own looks his head turning about like a weathercock in a hurricane  cl  that all is true that you have written and that you have told me   i gave him a rightforward nod and a frown  as much as to say swear to it captain but the varlet did not round it off as i would have had him however he averred that it was  he had hoped he said that the circumstances with which his commission was attended and what he had communicated to her which he could not know but from his dear friend her uncle might have shielded him even from the shadow of suspicion  but i am contented said he stammering to be thought  to be thought  what  what you please to think me  till till you are satisfied   a whoresbird  cl the circumstances you refer to i must own ought to shield you sir from suspicion  but the man before you is a man that would make an angel suspected should that angel plead for him   i came forward traversed the room  was indeed in a bloody passion  i have no patience madam  and again i bit my unpersuasive lip   cl no man ought to be impatient at imputations he is not ashamed to deserve an innocent man will not be outrageous upon such imputations a guilty man ought not most excellently would this charming creature cap sentences with lord m but i am not now trying you sir on the foot of your merits i am only sorry that i am constrained to put questions to this worthier gentleman which perhaps i ought not to put so far as they regard himself  and i hope captain tomlinson that you who know not mr lovelace so well as to my unhappiness i do and who have children of your own will excuse a poor young creature who is deprived of all worthy protection and who has been insulted and endangered by the most designing man in the world and perhaps by a confederacy of his creatures   there she stopped and stood up and looked at me fear nevertheless apparently mingled with her anger and so it ought i was glad however of this poor sign of love  no one fears whom they value not  womens tongues were licensed i was going to say  but my conscience would not let me call her a woman nor use to her so vulgar a phrase i could only rave by my motions lift up my eyes spread my hands rub my face pull my wig and look like a fool indeed i had a great mind to run mad had i been alone with her i would and she should have taken consequences  the captain interposed in my behalf gently however and as a man not quite sure that he was himself acquitted some of the pleas we had both insisted on he again enforced  and speaking low  poor gentleman said he who can but pity him  indeed madam it is easy to see with all his failings the power you have over him  cl i have no pleasure sir in distressing any one  not even him who has so much distressed me  but sir when i think and when i see him before me i cannot command my temper  indeed indeed captain tomlinson mr lovelace has not acted by me either as a grateful a generous or a prudent man  he knows not as i told him yesterday the value of the heart he has insulted   there the angel stopped her handkerchief at her eyes  o belford belford that she should so greatly excel as to make me at times a villain in my own eyes  i besought her pardon i promised that it should be the study of my whole life to deserve it my faults i said whatever they had been were rather faults in her apprehension than in fact i besought her to give way to the expedient i had hit upon  i repeated it the captain enforced it for her uncles sake i once more for the sake of the general reconciliation for the sake of all my family for the sake of preventing future mischief   she wept  she seemed staggered in her resolution  she turned from me i mentioned the letter of lord m i besought her to resign to lady bettys mediation all our differences if she would not forgive me before she saw her  she turned toward me  she was going to speak but her heart was full  and again she turned away her face  then half turning it to me her handkerchief at her eyes  and do you really and indeed expect lady betty and miss montague  and do you  again she stopped   i answered in a solemn manner  she turned from me her whole face and paused and seemed to consider but in a passionate accent again turning toward me o how difficult jack for a harlowe spirit to forgive  let her ladyship come if she pleases said she  i cannot cannot wish to see her  and if she plead for you i cannot wish to hear her  the more i think the less can i forgive an attempt that i am convinced was intended to destroy me a plaguey strong word for the occasion supposing she was right what has my conduct been that an insult of such a nature should be offered to me as it would be a weakness to forgive i am sunk in my own eyes  and how can i receive a visit that must depress me more  the captain urged her in my favor with greater earnestness than before we both even clamoured as i may say for mercy and forgiveness didst thou never hear the good folks talk of taking heaven by storm  contrition repeatedly avowed  a total reformation promised  the happy expedient again pleaded   cl i have taken my measures i have gone too far to recede or to wish to recede my mind is prepared for adversity that i have not deserved the evils i have met with is my consolation  i have written to miss how what my intentions are my heart is not with you  it is against you mr lovelace i had not written to you as i did in the letter i left behind me had i not resolved whatever became of me to renounce you for ever   i was full of hope now severe as her expressions were i saw she was afraid that i should think of what she had written and indeed her letter is violence itself angry people jack should never write while their passion holds  lovel the severity you have shown me madam whether by pen or by speech shall never have place in my remembrance but for your honor in the light you have taken things all is deserved and but the natural result of virtuous resentment and i adore you even for the pangs you have given me   she was silent she had employment enough with her handherchief at her eyes  lovel you lament sometimes that you have no friends of your own sex to consult with miss rawlins i must confess is too inquisitive to be confided in i liked not thou may think her appeal to miss rawlins she may mean well but i never in my life knew a person who was fond of prying into the secrets of others that was fit to be trusted the curiosity of such is governed by pride which is not gratified but by whispering about a secret till it becomes public in order to show either their consequence or their sagacity it is so in every case what man or woman who is covetous of power or of wealth is covetous of either for the sake of making a right use of it  but in the ladies of my family you may confide it is their ambition to think of you as one of themselves renew but your consent to pass to the world for the sake of your uncles expedient and for the prevention of mischief as a lady some time married lady betty may be acquainted with the naked truth and you may as she hopes you will accompany her to her seat and if it must be so consider me as in a state of penitence or probation to be accepted or rejected as i may appear to deserve   the captain again clapped his hand on his breast and declared upon his honor that this was a proposal that were the case that of his own daughter and she were not resolved upon immediate marriage which yet he thought by far the more eligible choice he should be very much concerned were she to refuse it  cl were i with mr lovelaces relations and to pass as his wife to the world i could not have any choice and how could he be then in a state of probation o mr tomlinson you are too much his friend to see into his drift   capt his friend madam as i said before as i am yours and your uncles for the sake of a general reconciliation which must begin with a better understanding between yourselves   lovel only my dearest life resolve to attend the arrival and visit of lady betty and permit her to arbitrate between us   capt there can be no harm in that madam  you can suffer no inconvenience from that if mr lovelaces offense be such that a lady of that ladys character judges it to be unpardonable why then    cl interrupting and to me if am not invaded by you sir  if i am as i ought to be my own mistress i think to stay here in this honest houe and then had i an eyebeam as the captain calls it flashed at me till i receive a letter from miss how that i hope will be in a day or two if in that time the ladies come whom you expect and if they are desirous to see the creature whom you have made unhappy i shall know whether i can or cannot receive their visit   she turned short to the door and retiring went up stairs to her chamber  o sir said the captain as soon as she was gone what an angel of a woman is this  i have been and i am a very wicked man  but if any thing should happen amiss to this admirable lady through my means i shall have more cause for selfreproach than for all the bad actions of my life put together  and his eyes glistend  nothing can happen amiss thou sorrowful dog  what can happen amiss  are we to form our opinion of things by the romantic notions of a girl who supposes that to be the greatest which is the slightest of evils have i not told thee our whole story has she not broken her promise did i not generously spare her when in my power i was decent though i had her at such advantage greater liberties have i taken with girls of character at a common rompingbout and all has been laughed off and handkerchief and headcloaths adjusted and petticoats shaken to rights in my presence never man in the like circumstances and resolved as i was resolved goaded on as i was goaded on as well by her own sex as by the impulses of a violent passion was ever so decent yet what mercy does she show me  now jack this pitiful dog was such another unfortunate one as thyself  his arguments serving to confirm me in the very purpose he brought them to prevail upon me to give up had he left me to myself to the tenderness of my own nature moved as i was when the lady withdrew and had sat down and made odious faces and said nothing it is very possible that i should have taken the chair over against him which she had quitted and have cried and blubbered with him for half an hour together but the varlet to argue with me to pretend to convince a man who knows in his heart that he is doing a wrong thing  he must needs think that this would put me upon trying what i could say for myself and when the excited compunction can be carried from the heart to the lips it must evaporate in words  thou perhaps in this place would have urged the same pleas that he urged what i answered to him therefore may do for thee and spare thee the trouble of writing and me of reading a good deal of nonsense  capt you was pleased to tell me sir that you only proposed to try her virtue and that you believed you should actually marry her   lovel so i shall and cannot help it i have no doubt but i shall and as to trying her is she not now in the height of her trial have i not reason to think that she is coming about is she not now yielding up her resentment for an attempt which she thinks she ought not to forgive  and if she do may she not forgive the last attempt  can she in a word resent that more than she does this  women often for their own sakes will keep the last secret but will ostentatiously din the ears of gods and men with their clamours upon a successless offer it was my folly my weakness that i gave her not more cause for this her unsparing violence   capt o sir you never will be able to subdue this lady without force   lovel well then puppy must i not endeavor to find a proper time and place    capt forgive me sir but can you think of force to such a fine creature   lovel force indeed i abhor the thought of and for what think thou have i taken all the pains i have taken and engaged so many persons in my cause but to avoid the necessity of violent compulsion but yet imaginest thou that i expect direct consent from such a lover of forms as this lady is known to be let me tell thee mc donald that thy master belford has urged on thy side of the question all that thou can urge must i have every puppys conscience to pacify as well as my own  by my soul patrick she has a friend here clapping my hand on my breast that pleads for her with greater and more irresistible eloquence than all the men in the world can plead for her and had she not escaped me  and yet how have i answered my first design of trying her vol iii letter xvii p   0 and sq  and in her the virtue of the most virtuous of the sex  thou puppy would thou have me decline a trial that may make for the honor of a sex we all so dearly love   then sir you have no thoughts  no thoughts  looking still more sorrowfully of marrying this wonderful lady  yes puppy but i have but let me first to gratify my pride bring down hers let me see that she loves me well enough to forgive me for my own sake has she not heretofore lamented that she staid not in her fathers house though the consequence must have been if she had that she would have been the wife of the odious solmes if now she be brought to consent to be mine see thou not that the reconciliation with her detested relations is the inducement as it always was and not love of me  neither her virtue nor her love can be established but upon full trial the last trial  but if her resistance and resentment be such as hitherto i have reason to expect they will be and if i find in that resentment less of hatred of me than of the fact then shall she be mine in her own way then hateful as is the life of shackles to me will i marry her  well sir i can only say that i am dough in your hands to be molded into what shape you please but if as i said before   none of your saidsbefore i remember all thou said  and i know all thou can further say  thou art only pontius pilate like washing thine own hands dont i know thee that thou may have something to silence thy conscience with by loading me but we have gone too far to recede are not all our engines in readiness  dry up thy sorrowful eyes let unconcern and heartsease once more take possession of thy solemn features thou have hitherto performed extremely well shame not thy past by thy future behavior and a rich reward awaits thee if thou art dough be dough and i slapt him on the shoulder  resume but thy former shape  and i will be answerable for the event  he bowed assent and compliance went to the glass and began to untwist and unsadden his features pulled his wig right as if that as well as his head and heart had been discomposed by his compunction and once more became old mulcibers and mine  but did thou think jack that there was so much  whatshallicall it  in this tomlinson did thou imagine that such a fellow as that had bowels that nature so long dead and buried in him as to all humane effects should thus revive and exert itself  yet why do i ask this question of thee who to my equal surprise have shown on the same occasion the like compassionate sensibilities  as to tomlinson it looks as if poverty had made him the wicked fellow he is as plenty and wantonness have made us what we are necessity after all is the test of principle but what is there in this dull word or thing called honesty that even i who cannot in my present views be served by it cannot help thinking even the accidental emanations of it amiable in tomlinson though demonstrated in a female case and judging better of him for being capable of such  letter xiv mr lovelace to john belford esquire this debate between the captain and me was hardly over when the three women led by miss rawlins entered hoping no intrusion  but very desirous the maiden said to know if we were likely to accommodate  o yes i hope so you know ladies that your sex must in these cases preserve their forms they must be courted to comply with their own happiness a lucky expedient we have hit upon the uncle has his doubts of our marriage he cannot believe nor will anybody that it is possible that a man so much in love the lady so desirable   they all took the hint  it was a very extraordinary case the two widows allowed women jack as i believe i have observed elsewhere have a high opinion of what they can do for us  miss rawlins desired if i pleased to let them know the expedient and looked as if there was no need to proceed in the rest of my speech  i begged that they would not let the lady know that i had told them what this expedient was  they promised  it was this that to oblige and satisfy mr harlowe the ceremony was to be again performed he was to be privately present and to give his niece to me with his own hands  and she was retired to consider of it  thou see jack that i have provided an excuse to save my veracity to the women here in case i should incline to marriage and she should choose to have miss rawlinss assistance at the ceremony nor doubted i to bring my fairone to save my credit on this occasion if i could get her to consent to be mine  a charming expedient cried the widow they were all three ready to clap their hands for joy upon it women love to be married twice at least jack though not indeed to the same man and all blessed the reconciliatory scheme and the proposer of it and supposing it came from the captain they looked at him with pleasure while his face shined with the applause implied he should think himself very happy if he could bring about a general reconciliation and he flourished with his head like my man will on his victory over old grimes bridling by turns like miss rawlins in the height of a prudish fit  but now it was time for the captain to think of returning to town having a great deal of business to dispatch before morning nor was he certain that he should again be able to attend us at hamstead before he went home  and yet i did not intend that he should leave hampstead this night every thing drawing on to a crisis  a message to the above effect was carried up at my desire by mrs moore with the captains compliments and to know if she had any commands for him to her uncle  but i hinted to the women that it would be proper for them to withdraw if the lady did come down lest she should not care to be so free before them on a proposal so particular as she would be to us who had offered it to her consideration  mrs moore brought down word that the lady was following her they all three withdrew and she entered at one door as they went out at the other  the captain accosted her repeating the contents of the message sent up and desired that she would give him her commands in relation to the report he was to make to her uncle harlowe  i know not what to say sir nor what i would have you to say to my uncle perhaps you may have business in town  perhaps you need not see my uncle till i have heard from miss how till after lady betty  i dont know what to say  i implored the return of that value which she had so generously acknowleged once to have had for me i presumed i said to flatter myself that lady betty in her own person and in the name of all my family would be able on my promised reformation and contrition to prevail in my favor especially as our prospects in other respects with regard to the general reconciliation wished for were so happy but let me owe to your own generosity my dearest creature said i rather than to the mediation of any person on earth the forgiveness i am an humble suitor for how much more agreeable to yourself o best beloved of my soul must it be as well as obliging to me that your first personal knowledge of my relations and theirs of you for they will not be denied attending you should not be begun in recriminations and appeals as lady betty will be here so soon it will not perhaps be possible for you to receive her visit with a brow absolutely serene but dearest dearest creature i beseech you let the misunderstanding pass as a slight one  as a misunderstanding cleared up appeals give pride and superiority to the persons appealed to and are apt to lessen the appellant not only in their eye but in her own exalt not into judges those who are prepared to take lessons and instructions from you the individuals of my family are as proud as i am said to be but they will cheerfully resign to your superiority  you will be the first woman of the family in every ones eyes  this might have done with any other woman in the world but this and yet she is the only woman in the world of whom it may with truth be said  but thus angrily did she disclaim the compliment  yes indeed  and there she stopped a moment her sweet bosom heaving with a noble disdain  tricked out of myself from the very first  a fugitive from my own family renounced by my relations insulted by you  laying humble claim to the protection of yours  is not this the light in which i must appear not only to the ladies of your family but to all the world  think you sir that in these circumstances or even had i been in the happiest that i could be affected by this plea of undeserved superiority  you are a stranger to the mind of clarissa harlowe if you think her capable of so poor and so undue a pride  she went from us to the farther end of the room  the captain was again affected  excellent creature i called her and reverently approaching her urged further the plea i had last made  it is but lately said i that the opinions of my relations have been more than indifferent to me whether good or bad and it is for your sake more than for my own that i now wish to stand well with my whole family the principal motive of lady bettys coming up is to purchase presents for the whole family to make on the happy occasion  this consideration turning to the captain with so nobleminded a dear creature i know can have no weight only as it will show their value and respect but what a damp would their worthy hearts receive were they to find their admired new niece as they now think her not only not their niece but capable of renouncing me for ever they love me they all love me i have been guilty of carelessness and levity to them indeed but of carelessness and levity only and that owing to a pride that has set me above meanness though it has not done every thing for me  my whole family will be guaranties for my good behavior to this dear creature their niece their daughter their cousin their friend their chosen companion and directress all in one  upon my soul captain we may we must be happy  but dearest dearest creature let me on my knees and down i dropped her face all the time turned half from me as she stood at the window her handkerchief often at her eyes plead your promised forgiveness and let us not appear to them on their visit thus unhappy with each other lady betty the next hour that she sees you will write her opinion of you and of the likelihood of our future happiness to lady sarah her sister a weakspirited woman who now hopes to supply to herself in my bride the lost daughter she still mourns for  the captain then joined in reurging her uncles hopes and expectations and his resolution effectually to set about the general reconciliation the mischief that might be prevented the certainty he was in that her uncle might be prevailed upon to give her to me with his own hand if she made it her choice to wait for his coming up but for his own part he humbly advised and fervently pressed her to make the very next day or monday at farthest my happy day  permit me dearest lady said he and i could kneel to you myself bending his knee though i have no interest in my earnestness but the pleasure i should have to be able to serve you all to beseech you to give me an opportunity to assure your uncle that i myself saw with my own eyes the happy knot tied  all misunderstandings all doubts all diffidences will then be at an end  and what madam rejoined i still kneeling can there be in your new measures be they what they will that can so happily so reputably i will presume to say for all round obviate the present difficulties  miss how herself if she loves you and loves your fame madam urged the captain his knee still bent must congratulate you on such a happy conclusion  then turning her face she saw the captain halfkneeling  o sir o capt tomlinson  why this undue condescension extending her hand to his elbow to raise him  i cannot bear this  then casting her eye to me rise mr lovelace kneel not to the poor creature whom you have insulted  how cruel the occasion for it  and how mean the submission  not mean to such an angel  nor can i rise but to be forgiven   the captain then reurged once more the day  he was amazed he said if she ever valued me   o captain tomlinson interrupted she how much are you the friend of this man  if i had never valued him he never would have had it in his power to insult me nor could i have taken to heart as i do the insult execrable as it was so undeservedly so ungratefully given  but let him retire  for a moment let him retire  i was more than half afraid to trust the captain by himself with her  he gave me a sign that i might depend upon him  and then i took out of my pocket his letter to me and lady bettys and miss montagues and lord ms which last she had not then seen and giving them to him procure for me in the first place mr tomlinson a reperusal of these three letters and of this from lord m and i beseech you my dearest life give them due consideration and let me on my return find the happy effects of it  i then withdrew with slow feet however and a misgiving heart  the captain insisted upon this reperusal previously to what she had to say to him as he tells me she complied but with some difficulty as if she was afraid of being softened in my favor  she lamented her unhappy situation destitute of friends and not knowing whither to go or what to do  she asked questions sifting questions about her uncle about her family and after what he knew of mr hickmans fruitless application in her favor  he was well prepared in this particular for i had shown him the letters and extracts of letters of miss how which i had so happily come at vol iv p     and seq  might she be assured she asked him that her brother with singleton and solmes were actually in quest of her  he averred that they were  she asked if he thought i had hopes of prevailing on her to go back to town  he was sure i had not  was he really of opinion that lady betty would pay her a visit  he had no doubt of it  but sir but captain tomlinson  then impatiently turning from him and again to him i know not what to do  but were i your daughter sir  were you my own father  alas sir i have neither father nor mother  he turned from her and wiped his eyes  o sir you have humanity she wept too there are some men in the world thank heaven that can be moved o sir i have met with hardhearted men and in my own family too  or i could not have been so unhappy as i am  but i make everybody unhappy  i suppose his eyes run over  dearest madam heavenly lady  who can  who can  hesitated and blubbered the dog as he owned and indeed i heard some part of what passed though they both talked lower than i wished for from the nature of their conversation there was no room for altitudes  them and both and they  how it goes against me to include this angel of a creature and any man on earth but myself in one word  capt who can forbear being affected  but madam you can be no other mans   cl nor would i be but he is so sunk with me  to fire the house  an artifice so vile  contrived for the worst of purposes  would you have a daughter of yours  but what would i say  yet you see that i have nobody in whom i can confide  mr lovelace is a vindictive man  he could not love the creature whom he could insult as he has insulted me then pausing  in short i never never can forgive him nor he me  do you think sir i would have gone so far as i have gone if i had intended ever to draw with him in one yoke  i left behind me such a letter    you know madam he has acknowleged the justice of your resentment   o sir he can acknowledge and he can retract fifty times a day  but do not think i am trifling with myself and you and want to be persuaded to forgive him and to be his  there is not a creature of my sex who would have been more explicit and more frank than i would have been from the moment i intended to be his had i had a heart like my own to deal with i was always above reserve sir i will presume to say where i had no cause of doubt mr lovelaces conduct has made me appear perhaps overnice when my heart wanted to be encouraged and assured and when if it had been so my whole behavior would have been governed by it  she stopped her handkerchief at her eyes i inquired after the minutest part of her behavior as well as after her words i love thou know to trace human nature and more particularly female nature through its most secret recesses  the pitiful fellow was lost in silent admiration of her  and thus the noble creature proceeded  it is the fate of unequal unions that tolerable creatures through them frequently incurr censure when more happily yoked they might be entitled to praise and shall i not shun an union with a man that might lead into errors a creature who flatters herself that she is blessed with an inclination to be good and who wishes to make everyone happy with whom she has any connection even to her very servants  she paused taking a turn about the room  the fellow devil fetch him a mummy all the time then proceeded  formerly indeed i hoped to be an humble means of reforming him but when i have no such hope is it right you are a serious man sir to make a venture that shall endanger my own morals  still silent was the varlet if my advocate had nothing to say for me what hope of carrying my cause  and now sir what is the result of all  it is this  that you will endeavor if you have that influence over him which a man of your sense and experience ought to have to prevail upon him and that for his own sake as well as mine to leave me free to pursue my own destiny and of this you may assure him that i never will be any other mans  impossible madam  i know that mr lovelace would not hear me with patience on such a topic and i do assure you that i have some spirit and should not care to take an indignity from him or from any man living  she paused  then resuming  and think you sir that my uncle will refuse to receive a letter from me  how averse jack to concede a tittle in my favor  i know madam as matters are circumstanced that he would not answer it if you please i will carry one down from you  and will he not pursue his intentions in my favor nor be himself reconciled to me except i am married  from what your brother gives out and affects to believe on mr lovelaces living with you in the same   no more sir  i am an unhappy creature  he then reurged that it would be in her power instantly or on the morrow to put an end to all her difficulties  how can that be said she the license still to be obtained the settlements still to be signed miss howes answer to my last unreceived  and shall i sir be in such a hurry as if i thought my honor in danger if i delayed yet marry the man from whom only it can be endangered  unhappy thrice unhappy clarissa harlowe  in how many difficulties has one rash step involved thee  and she turned from him and wept  the varlet by way of comfort wept too yet her tears as he might have observed were tears that indicated rather a yielding than a perverse temper  there is a sort of stone thou know so soft in the quarry that it may in a manner be cut with a knife but if the opportunity be not taken and it is exposed to the air for any time it will become as hard as marble and then with difficulty it yields to the chizel the nature of the bath stone in particular  so this lady not taken at the moment after a turn or two cross the room gained more resolution and then she declared as she had done once before that she would wait the issue of miss howes answer to the letter she had sent her from hence and take her measures accordingly leaving it to him mean time to make what report he thought fit to her uncle the kindest that truth could bear she doubted not from captain tomlinson and she should be glad of a few lines from him to hear what that was  she wished him a good journey she complained of her head and was about to withdraw but i stepped round to the door next the stairs as if i had but just come in from the garden which as i entered i called a very pretty one and took her reluctant hand as she was going out my dearest life you are not going  what hopes captain  have you not some hopes to give me of pardon and reconciliation  she said she would not be detained but i would not let her go till she had promised to return when the captain had reported to me what her resolution was  and when he had i claimed her promise and she came down again and repeated it as what she was determined upon  i expostulated with her upon it in the most submissive and earnest manner she made it necessary for me to repeat many of the pleas i had before urged the captain seconded me with equal earnestness at last each fell down on his knees before her  she was distressed i was afraid at one time she would have fainted yet neither of us would rise without some concessions i pleaded my own sake the captain his dear friend her uncles and both the prevention of future mischief and the peace and happiness of the two families  she owned herself unequal to the conflict she sighed she sobbd she wept she wrung her hands  i was perfectly eloquent in my vows and protestations her tearful eyes were cast down upon me a glow upon each charming cheek a visible anguish in every lovely feature  at last her trembling knees seeming to fail her she dropped into the next chair her charming face as if seeking for a hiding place which a mothers bosom would have best supplied sinking upon her own shoulder  i forgot at the instant all my vows of revenge i threw myself at her feet as she sat and snatching her hand pressed it with my lips i besought heaven to forgive my past offenses and prosper my future hopes as i designed honorably and justly by the charmer of my heart if once more she would restore me to her favor and i thought i felt drops of scalding water could they be tears trickle down upon my cheeks while my cheeks glowing like fire seemed to scorch up the unwelcome strangers  i then arose not doubting of an implied pardon in this silent distress i raised the captain i whispered him  by my soul man i am in earnest  now talk of reconciliation of her uncle of the license of settlements  and raising my voice if now at last captain tomlinson my angel will give me leave to call so great a blessing mine it will be impossible that you should say too much to her uncle in praise of my gratitude my affection and fidelity to his charming niece and he may begin as soon as he pleases his kind schemes for effecting the desirable reconciliation  nor shall he prescribe any terms to me that i will not comply with  the captain blessed me with his eyes and hands  thank god whispered he we approached the lady together  what hinders dearest madam said he what now hinders but that lady betty lawrance when she comes may be acquainted with the truth of everything and assist privately at your nuptials  i will stay till they are celebrated and then shall i go down with the happy tidings to my dear mr harlowe  and all will all must soon be happy  i must have an answer from miss how replied the still trembling fairone i cannot change my new measures but with her advice i will forfeit all my hopes of happiness in this world rather than her good opinion and that she should think me giddy unsteady or precipitate all i will further say on the present subject is this that when i have her answer to what i have written i will write to her the whole state of the matter as i shall then be enabled to do  lovel then must i despair for ever  o captain tomlinson miss how hates me  miss how    capt not so perhaps  when miss how knows your concern for having offended she will never advise that with such prospects of general reconciliation the hopes of so many considerable persons in both families should be frustrated some little time as that excellent lady has foreseen and hinted will necessarily be taken up in actually procuring the license and in perusing and signing the settlements in that time miss howes answer may be received and lady betty may arrive and she no doubt will have weight to dissipate the ladys doubts and to accelerate the day it shall be my part mean time to make mr harlowe easy all i fear from delay is from mr james harlowes quarter and therefore all must be conducted with prudence and privacy  as your uncle madam has proposed   she was silent i rejoiced in her silence the dear creature thought i has actually forgiven me in her heart  but why will she not lay me under obligation to her by the generosity of an explicit declaration  and yet as that would not accelerate anything while the license is not in my hands she is the less to be blamed if i do her justice that she took more time to descend  i proposed as on the morrow night to go to town and doubted not to bring the license up with me on monday morning would she be pleased to assure me that she would not depart from mrs moores  she should stay at mrs moores till she had an answer from miss how  i told her that i hoped i might have her tacit consent at least to the obtaining of the license  i saw by the turn of her countenance that i should not have asked this question she was so far from tacitly consenting that she declared to the contrary  as i never intended i said to ask her to enter again into a house with the people of which she was so much offended would she be pleased to give orders for her clothes to be brought up hither or should dorcas attend her for any of her commands on that head  she desired not ever more to see anybody belonging to that house she might perhaps get mrs moore or mrs bevis to go thither for her and take her keys with them  i doubted not i said that lady betty would arrive by that time i hoped she had no objection to my bringing that lady and my cousin montague up with me  she was silent  to be sure mr lovelace said the captain the lady can have no objection to this  she was still silent so silence in this case was assent  would she be pleased to write to miss how   sir sir peevishly interrupting  no more questions no prescribing to me  you will do as you think fit so will i as i please i own no obligation to you captain tomlinson your servant recommend me to my uncle harlowes favor and was going  i took her reluctant hand and besought her only to promise to meet me early in the morning  to what purpose meet you have you more to say than has been said  i have had enough of vows and protestations mr lovelace to what purpose should i meet you tomorrow morning  i repeated my request and that in the most fervent manner naming six in the morning  you know that i am always stirring before that hour at this season of the year was the halfexpressed consent  she then again recommended herself to her uncles favor and withdrew  and thus belford has she mended her markets as lord m would say and i worsted mine miss howes next letter is now the hinge on which the fate of both must turn i shall be absolutely ruined and undone if i cannot intercept it  letter xv mr lovelace to john belford esquire sat midnight no rest says a text that i once heard preached upon to the wicked  and i cannot close my eyes yet wanted only to compound for half an hour in an elbowchair so must scribble on  i parted with the captain after another strong debate with him in relation to what is to be the fate of this lady as the fellow has an excellent head and would have made an eminent figure in any station of life had not his early days been tainted with a deep crime and he detected in it and as he had the right side of the argument i had a good deal of difficulty with him and at last brought myself to promise that if i could prevail upon her generously to forgive me and to reinstate me in her favor i would make it my whole endeavor to get off of my contrivances as happily as i could only that lady betty and charlotte must come and then substituting him for her uncles proxy take shame to myself and marry  but if i should jack with the strongest antipathy to the state that ever man had what a figure shall i make in rakish annals and can i have taken all this pains for nothing or for a wife only that however excellent and any woman do i think i could make good because i could make any woman fear as well as love me might have been obtained without the plague i have been at and much more reputably than with it and have thou not seen that this haughty lady knows not how to forgive with graciousness indeed has not at all forgiven me but holds my soul in a suspense which has been so grievous to her own  at this silent moment i think that if i were to pursue my former scheme and resolve to try whether i cannot make a greater fault serve as a sponge to wipe out a less and then be forgiven for that i can justify myself to myself and that as the fair implacable would say is all in all  it is my intention in all my reflections to avoid repeating at least dwelling upon what i have before written to thee though the state of the case may not have varied so i would have thee reconsider the old reasonings particularly those contained in my answer to thy last expostulatory nonsense see vol iv p     and seq  and add the new as they fall from my pen and then i shall think myself invincible  at least as arguing rake to rake  i take the gaining of this lady to be essential to my happiness and is it not natural for all men to aim at obtaining whatever they think will make them happy be the object more or less considerable in the eyes of others  as to the manner of endeavoring to obtain her by falsification of oaths vows and the like  do not the poets of two thousand years and upwards tell us that jupiter laughs at the perjuries of lovers and let me add to what i have heretofore mentioned on that head a question or two  do not the mothers the aunts the grandmothers the governesses of the pretty innocents always from their very cradles to riper years preach to them the deceitfulness of men  that they are not to regard their oaths vows promises  what a parcel of fibbers would all these reverend matrons be if there were not nowandthen a pretty credulous rogue taken in for a justification of their preachments and to serve as a beacon lighted up for the benefit of the rest  do we not then see that an honest prowling fellow is a necessary evil on many accounts do we not see that it is highly requisite that a sweet girl should be nowandthen drawn aside by him  and the more eminent the lady in the graces of person mind and fortune is not the example likely to be the more efficacious  if these postulata be granted me who i pray can equal my charmer in all these who therefore so fit for an example to the rest of the sex  at worst i am entirely within my worthy friend mandevilles rule that private vices are public benefits  well then if this sweet creature must fall as it is called for the benefit of all the pretty fools of the sex she must and there is an end of the matter and what would there have been in it of uncommon or rare had i not been so long about it  and so i dismiss all further argumentation and debate upon the question and i impose upon thee when thou writest to me an eternal silence on this head  waferd on as an afterwritten introduction to the paragraphs which follow lord jack what shall i do now  how one evil brings on another  dreadful news to tell thee  while i was meditating a simple robbery here have i in my own defense indeed been guilty of murder a bloody murder  so i believe it will prove  at her last gasp  poor impertinent opposer eternally resisting  eternally contradicting there she lies weltering in her blood her deaths wound have i given her  but she was a thief an impostor as well as a tormentor she had stolen my pen  while i was sullenly meditating doubting as to my future measures she stole it and thus she wrote with it in a hand exactly like my own and would have faced me down that it was really my own handwriting  but let me reflect before it be too late on the manifold perfections of this everadmirable creature let me reflect the hand yet is only held up the blow is not struck miss howes next letter may blow thee up in policy thou should be now at least honest thou can not live without her thou would rather marry her than lose her absolutely thou may undoubtedly prevail upon her inflexible as she seems to be for marriage but if now she find thee a villain thou may never more engage her attention and she perhaps will refuse and abhor thee  yet already have i not gone too far like a repentant thief afraid of his gang and obliged to go on in fear of hanging till he comes to be hanged i am afraid of the gang of my cursed contrivances  as i hope to live i am sorry at the present writing that i have been such a foolish plotter as to put it as i fear i have done out of my own power to be honest i hate compulsion in all forms and cannot bear even to be compelled to be the wretch my choice has made me  so now belford as thou have said i am a machine at last and no free agent  upon my soul jack it is a very foolish thing for a man of spirit to have brought himself to such a height of iniquity that he must proceed and cannot help himself and yet to be nextto certain that his very victory will undo him  why was such a woman as this thrown in my way whose very fall will be her glory and perhaps not only my shame but my destruction  what a happiness must that man know who moves regularly to some laudable end and has nothing to reproach himself with in his progress to it when by honest means he attains this end how great and unmixed must be his enjoyments what a happy man in this particular case had i been had it been given me to be only what i wished to appear to be  thus far had my conscience written with my pen and see what a recreant she had made me  i seized her by the throat  there  there said i thou vile impertinent  take that and that  how often have i given thee warning  and now i hope thou intruding varletess have i done thy business  puling and invoiced rearing up thy detested head in vain implorest thou my mercy who in thy day have showed me so little  take that for a risingblow  and now will thy pain and my pain from thee soon be over  lie there  welter on  had i not given thee thy deaths wound thou would have robbed me of all my joys thou could not have mended me it is plain thou could only have thrown me into despair did thou not see that i had gone too far to recede  welter on once more i bid thee  gasp on  that thy last gasp surely  how hard die thou  adieu  it is kind in thee however to bid me adieu  adieu adieu adieu to thee o thou inflexible and till now unconquerable bosomintruder  adieu to thee for ever  letter xvi mr lovelace to john belford esquire sunday morn june      of clock a few words to the information thou sentest me last night concerning thy poor old man and then i rise from my seat shake myself refresh newdress and so to my charmer whom notwithstanding her reserves i hope to prevail upon to walk out with me on the heath this warm and fine morning  the birds must have awakened her before now they are in full song she always gloried in accustoming herself to behold the sunrise one of gods natural wonders as once she called it  her window salutes the east the valleys must be gilded by his rays by the time i am with her for already have they made the uplands smile and the face of nature cheerful  how unsuitable will thou find this gay preface to a subject so gloomy as that i am now turning to  i am glad to hear thy tedious expectations are at last answered  thy servant tells me that thou art plaguily grieved at the old fellows departure  i cannot say but thou may look as if thou were harassed as thou have been for a number of days and nights with a close attendance upon a dying man beholding his drawingon hour  pretending for decencys sake to whine over his excruciating pangs  to be in the way to answer a thousand impertinent inquiries after the health of a man thou wishedst to die  to pray by him  for so once thou wrotest to me  to read by him  to be forced to join in consultations with a parcel of solemn woudseemwise doctors and their officious zanies the apothecaries joined with the butcherly tribe of scarificators all combined to carry on the physical farce and to cut out thongs both from his flesh and his estate  to have the superadded apprehension of dividing thy interest in what he shall leave with a crew of eagerhoping nevertobesatisfied relations legatees and the devil knows who of private gratificators of passions laudable and illaudable  in these circumstances i wonder not that thou look to servants as little grieved at heart as thyself and who are gaping after legacies as thou after heirship as if thou indeed were grieved and as if the most wryfacing woe had befallen thee  then as i have often thought the reflection that must naturally arise from such mortifying objects as the death of one with whom we have been familiar must afford when we are obliged to attend it in its slow approaches and in its facetwisting pangs that it will one day be our own case goes a great way to credit the appearance of grief  and this it is that seriously reflected upon may temporarily give a fine air of sincerity to the wailings of lively widows heartexulting heirs and residuary legatees of all denominations since by keeping down the inward joy those interesting reflections must sadden the aspect and add an appearance of real concern to the assumed sables  well but now thou art come to the reward of all thy watchings anxieties and close attendances tell me what it is tell me if it compensate thy trouble and answer thy hope  as to myself thou see by the gravity of my style how the subject has helped to mortify me but the necessity i am under of committing either speedy matrimony or a rape has saddend over my gayer prospects and more than the case itself contributed to make me sympathize with thy present joyfulsorrow  adieu jack i must be soon out of my pain and my clarissa shall be soon out of hers  for so does the arduousness of the case require  letter xvii mr lovelace to john belford esquire sunday morning i have had the honor of my charmers company for two complete hours we met before six in mrs moores garden a walk on the heath refused me  the sedateness of her aspect and her kind compliance in this meeting gave me hopes and all that either the captain or i had urged yesterday to obtain a full and free pardon that reurged i and i told her besides that capt tomlinson was gone down with hopes to prevail upon her uncle harlowe to come up in person in order to present me with the greatest blessing that man ever received  but the utmost i could obtain was that she would take no resolution in my favor till she received miss howes next letter  i will not repeat the arguments used by me but i will give thee the substance of what she said in answer to them  she had considered of every thing she told me my whole conduct was before her the house i carried her to must be a vile house the people early showed what they were capable of in the earnest attempt made to fasten miss partington upon her as she doubted not with my approbation  surely thought i she has not received a duplicate of miss howes letter of detection they heard her cries my insult was undoubtedly premeditated by my whole recollected behavior to her previous to it it must be so i had the vilest of views no question and my treatment of her put it out of all doubt  soul all over belford she seems sensible of liberties that my passion made me insensible of having taken  she besought me to give over all thoughts of her sometimes she said she thought herself cruelly treated by her nearest and dearest relations at such times a spirit of repining and even of resentment took place and the reconciliation at other times so desirable was not then so much the favorite wish of her heart as was the scheme she had formerly planned  of taking her good norton for her directress and guide and living upon her own estate in the manner her grandfather had intended she should live  this scheme she doubted not that her cousin morden who was one of her trustees for that estate would enable her and that as she hoped without litigation to pursue and if he can and does what sir let me ask you said she have i seen in your conduct that should make me prefer to it an union of interests where there is such a disunion in minds  so thou see jack there is reason as well as resentment in the preference she makes against me  thou see that she presumes to think that she can be happy without me and that she must be unhappy with me  i had besought her in the conclusion of my reurged arguments to write to miss how before miss howes answer could come in order to lay before her the present state of things and if she would defere to her judgment to let her have an opportunity to give it on the full knowledge of the case   so i would mr lovelace was the answer if i were in doubt myself which i would prefer marriage or the scheme i have mentioned you cannot think sir but the latter must be my choice i wish to part with you with temper  dont put me upon repeating   part with me madam interrupted i  i cannot bear those words  but let me beseech you however to write to miss how i hope if miss how is not my enemy   she is not the enemy of your person sir  as you would be convinced if you saw her last letter to me the lady innocently means mr lovelaces forged one p    of this volume  but were she not an enemy to your actions she would not be my friend nor the friend of virtue why will you provoke from me mr lovelace the harshness of expression which however deserved by you i am unwilling just now to use having suffered enough in the two past days from my own vehemence  i bit my lip for vexation i was silent  miss how proceeded she knows the full state of matters already sir the answer i expect from her respects myself not you her heart is too warm in the cause of friendship to leave me in suspense one moment longer than is necessary as to what i want to know nor does her answer depend absolutely upon herself she must see a person first and that person perhaps must see others  the cursed smugglerwoman jack  miss howes townsend i doubt not  plot contrivance intrigue stratagem  underground moles these ladies but let the earth cover me let me be a mole too thought i if they carry their point  and if this lady escape me now  she frankly owned that she had once thought of embarking out of all our ways for some one of our american colonies but now that she had been compelled to see me which had been her greatest dread and which she would have given her life to avoid she thought she might be happiest in the resumption of her former favorite scheme if miss how could find her a reputable and private asylum till her cousin morden could come but if he came not soon and if she had a difficulty to get to a place of refuge whether from her brother or from anybody else meaning me i suppose she might yet perhaps go abroad for to say the truth she could not think of returning to her fathers house since her brothers rage her sisters upbraidings her fathers anger her mothers still moreaffecting sorrowings and her own consciousness under them all would be insupportable to her  o jack i am sick to death i pine i die for miss howes next letter i would bind gag strip rob and do any thing but murder to intercept it  but determined as she seems to be it was evident to me nevertheless that she had still some tenderness for me  she often wept as she talked and much oftener sighed she looked at me twice with an eye of undoubted gentleness and three times with an eye tending to compassion and softness but its benign rays were as often snatched back as i may say and her face averted as if her sweet eye were not to be trusted and could not stand against my eager eyes seeking as they did for a lost heart in hers and endeavoring to penetrate to her very soul  more than once i took her hand she struggled not much against the freedom i pressed it once with my lips she was not very angry a frown indeed but a frown that had more distress in it than indignation  how came the dear soul clothed as it is with such a silken vesture by all its steadiness see vol i p  0               for what she herself says on that steadiness which mr lovelace though a deserved sufferer by it cannot help admiring   was it necessary that the active gloom of such a tyrant of a father should commix with such a passive sweetness of a willless mother to produce a constancy an equanimity a steadiness in the daughter which never woman before could boast of  if so she is more obliged to that despotic father than i could have imagined a creature to be who gave distinction to every one related to her beyond what the crown itself can confer  i hoped i said that she would admit of the intended visit of the two ladies which i had so often mentioned  she was here she had seen me she could not help herself at present she ever had the highest regard for the ladies of my family because of their worthy characters there she turned away her sweet face and vanquished a halfrisen sigh  i kneeled to her then it was upon a verdant cushion for we were upon the grasswalk i caught her hand i besought her with an earnestness that called up as i could feel my heart to my eyes to make me by her forgiveness and example more worthy of them and of her own kind and generous wishes by my soul madam said i you stab me with your goodness your undeserved goodness and i cannot bear it  why why thought i as i did several times in this conversation will she not generously forgive me why will she make it necessary for me to bring my aunt and my cousin to my assistance can the fortress expect the same advantageous capitulation which yields not to the summons of a resistless conqueror as if it gave not the trouble of bringing up and raising its heavy artillery against it  what sensibilities said the divine creature withdrawing her hand must thou have suppressed  what a dreadful what a judicial hardness of heart must thine be who can be capable of such emotions as sometimes thou have shown and of such sentiments as sometimes have flowed from thy lips yet can have so far overcome them all as to be able to act as thou have acted and that from settled purpose and premeditation and this as it is said throughout the whole of thy life from infancy to this time  i told her that i had hoped from the generous concern she had expressed for me when i was so suddenly and dangerously taken ill  the ipecacuanha experiment jack  she interrupted me  well have you rewarded me for the concern you speak of  however i will frankly own now that i am determined to think no more of you that you might unsatisfied as i nevertheless was with you have made an interest   she paused i besought her to proceed  do you suppose sir and turned away her sweet face as we walked do you suppose that i had not thought of laying down a plan to govern myself by when i found myself so unhappily overreached and cheated as i may say out of myself  when i found that i could not be and do what i wished to be and to do do you imagine that i had not cast about what was the next proper course to take  and do you believe that this next course has not cost me some pain to be obliged to   there again she stopped  but let us break off discourse resumed she the subject grows too  she sighed  let us break off discourse  i will go in  i will prepare for church  the devil thought i well as i can appear in these everyday worn clothes  looking upon herself  i will go to church  she then turned from me to go into the house  bless me my beloved creature bless me with the continuance of this affecting conversation  remorse has seized my heart  i have been excessively wrong  give me further cause to curse my heedless folly by the continuance of this calm but soulpenetrating conversation  no no mr lovelace i have said too much impatience begins to break in upon me if you can excuse me to the ladies it will be better for my minds sake and for your credits sake that i do not see them call me to them overnice petulant prudish what you please call me to them nobody but miss how to whom next to the almighty and my own mother i wish to stand acquitted of wilful error shall know the whole of what has passed be happy as you may  deserve to be happy and happy you will be in your own reflection at least were you to be ever so unhappy in other respects for myself if i shall be enabled on due reflection to look back upon my own conduct without the great reproach of having wilfully and against the light of my own judgment erred i shall be more happy than if i had all that the world accounts desirable  the noble creature proceeded for i could not speak  this selfacquittal when spirits are lent me to dispel the darkness which at present too often overclouds my mind will i hope make me superior to all the calamities that can befall me  her whole person was informed by her sentiments she seemed to be taller than before how the god within her exalted her not only above me but above herself  divine creature as i thought her i called her i acknowleged the superiority of her mind and was proceeding  but she interrupted me  all human excellence said she is comparative only my mind i believe is indeed superior to yours debased as yours is by evil habits but i had not known it to be so if you had not taken pains to convince me of the inferiority of yours  how great how sublimely great this creature  by my soul i cannot forgive her for her virtues  there is no bearing the consciousness of the infinite inferiority she charged me with  but why will she break from me when good resolutions are taking place  the redhot iron she refuses to strike  o why will she suffer the yielding wax to harden  we had gone but a few paces toward the house when we were met by the impertinent women with notice that breakfast was ready i could only with uplifted hands beseech her to give me hope of a renewed conversation after breakfast  no she would go to church  and into the house she went and upstairs directly nor would she oblige me with her company at the teatable  i offered by mrs moore to quit both the table and the parlour rather than she should exclude herself or deprive the two widows of the favor of her company  that was not all the matter she told mrs moore she had been struggling to keep down her temper it had cost her some pains to do it she was desirous to compose herself in hopes to receive benefit by the divine worship she was going to join in  mrs moore hoped for her presence at dinner  she had rather be excused yet if she could obtain the frame of mind she hoped for she might not be averse to show that she had got above those sensibilities which gave consideration to a man who deserved not to be to her what he had been  this said no doubt to let mrs moore know that the gardenconversation had not been a reconciling one  mrs moore seemed to wonder that we were not upon a better foot of understanding after so long a conference and the more as she believed that the lady had given in to the proposal for the repetition of the ceremony which i had told them was insisted upon by her uncle harlowe but i accounted for this by telling both widows that she was resolved to keep on the reserve till she heard from capt tomlinson whether her uncle would be present in person at the solemnity or would name that worthy gentleman for his proxy  again i injoined strict secrecy as to this particular which was promised by the widows as well for themselves as for miss rawlins of whose taciturnity they gave me such an account as showed me that she was secretkeepergeneral to all the women of fashion at hamstead  the lord jack what a world of mischief at this rate must miss rawlins know  what a pandoras box must her bosom be  yet had i nothing that was more worthy of my attention to regard i would engage to open it and make my uses of the discovery  and now belford thou perceivest that all my reliance is upon the mediation of lady betty and miss montague and upon the hope of intercepting miss howes next letter  the fair inexorable is actually gone to church with mrs moore and mrs bevis but will closely attends her motions and i am in the way to receive any occasional intelligence from him  she did not choose a mighty word with the sex as if they were always to have their own wills that i should wait upon her i did not much press it that she might not apprehend that i thought i had reason to doubt her voluntary return  i once had it in my head to have found the widow bevis other employment and i believe she would have been as well pleased with my company as to go to church for she seemed irresolute when i told her that two out of a family were enough to go to church for one day but having her things on as the women call everything and her aunt moore expecting her company she thought it best to go  lest it should look oddly you know whispered she to one who was above regarding how it looked  letter xix mr lovelace to john belford esquire sunday afternoon o belford what a hairsbreadth escape have i had  such a one that i tremble between terror and joy at the

and by such an accident but here with the former i dispatch this thy messenger waiting  letter xx mr lovelace in continuation thus it was  my charmer accompanied mrs moore again to church this afternoon i had been very earnest in the first place to obtain her company at dinner but in vain according to what she had said to mrs moore page      i was too considerable to her to be allowed that

thought one sermon a day wellobserved enough so stayed at home to bear me company  the lady and mrs moore had not been gone a quarter of an hour when a young countryfellow on horseback came to the door and inquired for mrs harriot lucas the widow and i undetermined how we were to entertain each other were in the parlour next the door and hearing the fellows inquiry o my dear mrs bevis said i i

right  and dismiss the rascal  here he comes  as soon as you can   in came the fellow bowing and scraping his hat poked out before him with both his hands  fellow i am sorry madam and please you to

sorry you are so bad   widow do you live with miss how   fellow no madam i am one of her tenants sons her ladymother must not know as how i came of this errand but the letter i suppose will tell you all   widow how shall i satisfy you for this kind trouble   fellow na how at all what i do is for love of miss how she will satisfy me more than enough but mayhap you can send no answer you are so ill   widow was you ordered to wait for an answer   fellow no i cannot say i was but i was bidden to observe how you looked and how you was and if you did write a line or so to take care of it and give it only to our young landlady in secret   widow you see i look strangely not so well as i used to do   fellow nay i dont know that i ever saw you but once before and that was at a style where i met you and my young landlady but knew better than to stare a gentlewoman in the face especially at a style   widow will you eat or drink friend   fellow a cup of small ale i dont care if i do   widow margaret take the young man down and treat him with what the house affords   fellow your servant madam but i staid to eat as i came along just upon the heath yonder or else to say the truth i had been here sooner  thank my stars thought i thou didst a piece of powdered beef was upon the table at the sign of the castle where i stopped to inquire for this house and so thoff i only intended to whet my whistle i could not help eating so shall only taste of your ale for the beef was woundily cornd   he withdrew bowing and scraping  pox on thee thought i get thee gone for a prating dog  margaret whispered i in a female voice whipping out of the closet and holding the parlourdoor in my hand get him out of the house as fast as you can lest they come from church and catch him here  peggy never fear sir   the fellow went down and it seems drank a large draught of ale and margaret finding him very talkative told him she begged his pardon but she had a sweetheart just come from sea whom she was forced to hide in the pantry so was sure he would excuse her from staying with him  ay ay to be sure the clown said for if he could not make sport he would spoil none but he whispered her that one squire lovelace was a damnation rogue if the truth might be told  for what said margaret and could have given him she said a good dowse of the chaps  for kissing all the women he came near  at the same time the dog wrapped himself round margery and gave her a smack that she told mrs bevis afterward she might have heard into the parlour  such jack is human nature thus does it operate in all degrees and so does the clown as well as his betters practice what he censures and censure what he practices yet this sly dog knew not but the wench had a sweetheart locked up in the pantry if the truth were known some of the ruddyfaced dairy wenches might perhaps call him a damnation rogue as justly as their betters of the same sex might squire lovelace  the fellow told the maid that by what he discerned of the young ladys face it looked very rosy to what he took it to be and he thought her a good deal fatter as she lay and not so tall  all women are born to intrigue jack and practice it more or less as fathers guardians governesses from dear experience can tell and in loveaffairs are naturally expert and quicker in their wits by half than men this ready though raw wench gave an instance of this and improved on the dropsical hint i had given her the ladys seeming plumpness was owing to a dropsical disorder and to the round posture she lay in  very likely truly her appearing to him to be shorter he might have observed was owing to her drawing her feet up from pain and because the couch was too short she supposed  adso he did not think of that her rosy color was owing to her grief and headache  ay that might very well be  but he was highly pleased he had given the letter into mrs harriots own hand as he should tell miss how  he desired once more to see the lady at his going away and would not be denied the widow therefore sat up with her handkerchief over her face leaning her head against the wainscot  he asked if she had any partiklar message  no she was so ill she could not write which was a great grief to her  should he call next day for he was going to london now he was so near and should stay at a cousins that night who lived in a street called fetterlane  no she would write as soon as able and send by the post  well then if she had nothing to send by him mayhap he might stay in town a day or two for he had never seen the lions in the tower nor bedlam nor the tombs and he would make a holiday or two as he had leave to do if she had no business or message that required his posting down next day  she had not  she offered him the halfguinea i had given her for him but he refused it with great professions of disinterestedness and love as he called it to miss how to serve whom he would ride to the worlds end or even to jericho  and so the shocking rascal went away and glad at my heart was i when he was gone for i feared nothing so much as that he would have staid till they came from church  thus jack got i my heartsease the letter of miss how and through such a train of accidents as makes me say that the ladys stars fight against her but yet i must attribute a good deal to my own precaution in having taken right measures for had i not secured the widow by my stories and the maid by my servant all would have signified nothing and so heartily were they secured the one by a single guinea the other by half a dozen warm kisses and the aversion they both had to such wicked creatures as delighted in making mischief between man and wife that they promised that neither mrs moore miss rawlins mrs lovelace nor anybody living till a week at least were past and till i gave leave should know any thing of the matter  the widow rejoiced that i had got the mischiefmakers letter i excused myself to her and instantly withdrew with it and after i had read it fell to my shorthand to acquaint thee with my good luck and they not returning so soon as church was done stepping as it proved in to miss rawlinss and tarrying there a while to bring that busy girl with them to drink tea i wrote thus far to thee that thou might when thou came to this place rejoice with me upon the occasion  they are all three just come in  i hasten to them  letter xxi mr lovelace to john belford esquire i have begun another letter to thee in continuation of my narrative but i believe i shall send thee this before i shall finish that by the enclosed thou will see that neither of the correspondents deserve mercy from me and i am resolved to make the ending with one the beginning with the other  if thou say that the provocations i have given to one of them will justify her freedoms i answer so they will to any other person but myself but he that is capable of giving those provocations and has the power to punish those who abuse him for giving them will show his resentment and the more vindictively perhaps as he has deserved the freedoms  if thou say it is however wrong to do so i reply that it is nevertheless human nature  and would not have me be a man jack  here read the letter if thou will but thou art not my friend if thou offerest to plead for either of the saucy creatures after thou have read it  to mrs harriot lucas at mrs moores at hamstead after the discoveries i had made of the villainous machinations of the most abandoned of men particularized in my long letter of wednesday last vol iv p      you will believe my dearest friend that my surprise upon perusing yours of thursday evening from hamstead see vol iv p     was not so great as my indignation had the villain attempted to fire a city instead of a house i should not have wondered at it all that i am amazed at is that he whose boast as i am told it is that no woman shall keep him out of her bedchamber when he has made a resolution to be in it did not discover his foot before and it is as strange to me that having got you at such a shocking advantage and in such an horrid house you could at the time escape dishonor and afterward get from such a set of infernals  i gave you in my long letter of wednesday and thursday last reasons why you ought to mistrust that specious tomlinson that man my dear must be a solemn villain may lightning from heaven blast the wretch who has set him and the rest of his remorseless gang at work to endeavor to destroy the most consummate virtue heaven be praised you have escaped from all their snares and now are out of danger  so i will not trouble you at present with the particulars that i have further collected relating to this abominable imposture  for the same reason i forbear to communicate to you some new stories of the abhorred wretch himself which have come to my ears one in particular of so shocking a nature  indeed my dear the man is a devil  the whole story of mrs fretchville and her house i have no doubt to pronounce likewise an absolute fiction  fellow  how my soul spurns the villain  your thought of going abroad and your reasons for so doing most sensibly affect me but be comforted my dear i hope you will not be under a necessity of quitting your native country were i sure that that must be the cruel case i would abandon all my own better prospects and soon be with you and i would accompany you whithersoever you went and share fortunes with you for it is impossible that i should be happy if i knew that you were exposed not only to the perils of the sea but to the attempts of other vile men your personal graces attracting every eye and exposing you to those hourly dangers which others less distinguished by the gifts of nature might avoid  all that i know that beauty so greatly coveted and so greatly admired is good for  o my dear were i ever to marry and to be the mother of a clarissa  clarissa must be the name if promisingly lovely how often would my heart ache for the dear creature as she grew up when i reflected that a prudence and discretion unexampled in woman had not in you been a sufficient protection to that beauty which had drawn after it as many admirers as beholders  how little should i regret the attacks of that cruel distemper as it is called which frequently makes the greatest ravages in the finest faces  sat afternoon i have just parted with mrs townsend for the account of mrs townsend etc see vol iv p  0   0   0   i thought you had once seen her with me but she says she never had the honor to be personally known to you she has a manlike spirit she knows the world and her two brothers being in town she is sure she can engage them in so good a cause and if there should be occasion both their ships crews in your service  give your consent my dear and the horrid villain shall be repaid with broken bones at least for all his vileness  the misfortune is mrs townsend cannot be with you till thursday next or wednesday at soonest are you sure you can be safe where you are till then i think you are too near london and perhaps you had better be in it if you remove let me know whither the very moment  how my heart is torn to think of the necessity so dear a creature is driven to of hiding herself devilish fellow he must have been sportive and wanton in his inventions  yet that cruel that savage sportiveness has saved you from the sudden violence which he has had recourse to in the violation of others of names and families not contemptible for such the villain always gloried to spread his snares  the vileness of this specious monster has done more than any other consideration could do to bring mr hickman into credit with me mr hickman alone knows for me of your flight and the reason of it had i not given him the reason he might have thought still worse of the vile attempt i communicated it to him by showing him your letter from hamstead when he had read it  and he trembled and reddened as he read he threw himself at my feet and besought me to permit him to attend you and to give you the protection of his house the goodnatured man had tears in his eyes and was repeatedly earnest on this subject proposing to take his chariotandfour or a set and in person in the face of all the world give himself the glory of protecting such an oppressed innocent  i could not but be pleased with him and i let him know that i was i hardly expected so much spirit from him but a mans passiveness to a beloved object of our sex may not perhaps argue want of courage on proper occasions  i thought i ought in return to have some consideration for his safety as such an open step would draw upon him the vengeance of the most villainous enterprizer in the world who has always a gang of fellows such as himself at his call ready to support one another in the vilest outrages but yet as mr hickman might have strengthened his hands by legal recourses i should not have stood upon it had i not known your delicacies since such a step must have made a great noise and given occasion for scandal as if some advantage had been gained over you and were there not the greatest probability that all might be more silently and more effectually managed by mrs townsends means  mrs townsend will in person attend you  she hopes on wednesday  her brothers and some of their people will scatteringly and as if they knew nothing of you so we have contrived see you safe not only to london but to her house at deptford  she has a kinswoman who will take your commands there if she herself be obliged to leave you and there you may stay till the wretchs fury on losing you and his search are over  he will very soon it is likely enter upon some new villainy which may engross him and it may be given out that you are gone to lay claim to the protection of your cousin morden at florence  possibly if he can be made to believe it he will go over in hopes to find you there  after a while i can procure you a lodging in one of the neighboring villages where i may have the happiness to be your daily visiter and if this hickman be not silly and apish and if my mother do not do unaccountable things i may the sooner think of marrying that i may without control receive and entertain the darling of my heart  many very many happy days do i hope we shall yet see together and as this is my hope i expect that it will be your consolation  as to your estate since you are resolved not to litigate for it we will be patient either till col morden arrives or till shame compels some people to be just  upon the whole i cannot but think your prospects now much happier than they could have been had you been actually married to such a man as this i must therefore congratulate you upon your escape not only from a horrid libertine but from so vile a husband as he must have made to any woman but more especially to a person of your virtue and delicacy  you hate him heartily hate him i hope my dear  i am sure you do it would be strange if so much purity of life and manners were not to abhor what is so repugnant to itself  in your letter before me you mention one written to me for a feint vol iv p               i have not received any such depend upon it therefore that he must have it and if he has it is a wonder that he did not likewise get my long one of the  th heaven be praised that he did not and that it came safe to your hands  i send this by a young fellow whose father is one of our tenants with command to deliver it to no other hands but yours he is to return directly if you give him any letter if not he will proceed to london upon his own pleasures he is a simple fellow but very honest so you may say any thing to him if you write not by him i desire a line or two as soon as possible  my mother knows nothing of his going to you nor yet of your abandoning the fellow forgive me  but he is not entitled to good manners  i shall long to hear how you and mrs townsend order matters i wish she could have been with you sooner but i have lost no time in engaging her as you will suppose i refer to her what i have further to say and advise so shall conclude with my prayers that heaven will direct and protect my dearest creature and make your future days happy  anna how   and now jack i will suppose that thou have read this cursed letter allow me to make a few observations upon some of its contents which i will do in my crowquill shorthand that they may have the appearance of notes upon the vixens text  it is strange to miss how that having got her friend at such a shocking advantage etc and it is strange to me too if ever i have such another opportunity given me the cause of both our wonder i believe will cease  so thou see tomlinson is further detected no such person as mrs fretchville may lightning from heaven  o lord o lord o lord  what a horrid vixen is this  my gang my remorseless gang too is brought in  and thou will plead for these girls again will thou  heaven be praised she says that her friend is out of danger  miss how should be sure of that and that she herself is safe  but for this termagant as i have often said i must surely have made a better hand of it   new stories of me jack  what can they be  i have not found that my generosity to my rosebud ever did me due credit with this pair of friends very hard belford that credits cannot be set against debits and a balance struck in a rakes favor as well as in that of every common man  but he from whom no good is expected is not allowed the merit of the good he does  i ought to have been a little more attentive to character than i have been for notwithstanding that the measures of right and wrong are said to be so manifest let me tell thee that character byasses and runs away with all mankind let a man or woman once establish themselves in the worlds opinion and all that either of them do will be sanctified nay in the very courts of justice does not character acquit or condemn as often as facts and sometimes even in spite of facts  yet impolitic that i have been and am to be so careless of mine  and now i doubt it is irretrievable  but to leave moralizing  thou jack know almost all my enterprises worth remembering can this particular story which this girl hints at be that of lucy villars  or can she have heard of my intrigue with the pretty gypsey who met me in norwood and of the trap i caught her cruel husband in a fellow as gloomy and tyrannical as old harlowe when he pursued a wife who would not have deserved ill of him if he had deserved well of her  but he was not quite drowned the man is alive at this day and miss how mentions the story as a very shocking one besides both these are a twelvemonth old or more  but evil fame and scandal are always new when the offender has forgot a vile fact it is often told to one and to another who having never heard of it before trumpet it about as a novelty to others but well said the honest corregidor at madrid a saying with which i enriched lord ms collection  good actions are remembered but for a day bad ones for many years after the life of the guilty  such is the relish that the world has for scandal in other words such is the desire which everyone has to exculpate himself by blackening his neighbor you and i belford have been very kind to the world in furnishing it with many opportunities to gratify its devil  miss how will abandon her own better prospects and share fortunes with her were she to go abroad  charming romancer  i must set about this girl jack i have always had hopes of a woman whose passions carry her into such altitudes  had i attacked miss how first her passions inflamed and guided as i could have managed them would have brought her to my lure in a fortnight  but think thou and yet i think thou do that there is any thing in these high flights among the sex verily jack these vehement friendships are nothing but chaff and stubble liable to be blown away by the very wind that raises them apes mere apes of us they think the word friendship has a pretty sound with it and it is much talked of a fashionable word and so truly a single woman who thinks she has a soul and knows that she wants something would be thought to have found a fellowsoul for it in her own sex but i repeat that the word is a mere word the thing a mere name with them a corkbottomed shuttlecock which they are fond of striking to and fro to make one another glow in the frosty weather of a single state but which when a man comes in between the pretended inseparables is given up like their music and other maidenly amusements which nevertheless may be necessary to keep the pretty rogues out of more active mischief they then in short having caught the fish lay aside the net he alludes here to the story of a pope who once a poor fisherman through every preferment he rose to even to that of the cardinalate hung up in view of all his guests his net as a token of humility but when he arrived at the pontificate he took it down saying that there was no need of the net when he had caught the fish   thou have a mind perhaps to make an exception for these two ladies with all my heart my clarissa has if woman has a soul capable of friendship her flame is bright and steady but miss howes were it not kept up by her mothers opposition is too vehement to endure how often have i known opposition not only cement friendship but create love i doubt not but poor hickman would fare the better with this vixen if her mother were as heartily against him as she is for him  thus much indeed as to these two ladies i will grant thee that the active spirit of the one and the meek disposition of the other may make their friendship more durable than it would otherwise be for this is certain that in every friendship whether male or female there must be a man and a woman spirit that is to say one of them a forbearing one to make it permanent  but this i pronounce as a truth which all experience confirms that friendship between women never holds to the sacrifice of capital gratifications or to the endangering of life limb or estate as it often does in our nobler sex  well but next comes an indictment against poor beauty  what has beauty done that miss how should be offended at it  miss how jack is a charming girl she has no reason to quarrel with beauty  did ever see her  too much fire and spirit in her eye indeed for a girl  but that is no fault with a man that can lower that fire and spirit at pleasure and i know i am the man that can  a sweet auburn beauty is miss how a first beauty among beauties when her sweeter friend with such a commixture of serene gracefulness of natural elegance of native sweetness yet conscious though not arrogant dignity every feature glowing with intelligence is not in company  the difference between the two when together i have sometimes delighted to read in the addresses of a stranger entering into the presence of both when standing side by side there never was an instance on such an occasion where the stranger paid not his first devoirs to my clarissa  a respectful solemn awe sat upon every feature of the addressers face his eye seemed to ask leave to approach her and lower than common whether man or woman was the bow or courtesy and although this awe was immediately diminished by her condescending sweetness yet went it not so entirely off but that you might see the reverence remain as if the person saw more of the goddess than the woman in her  but the moment the same stranger turns to miss how though proud and saucy and erect and bridling she you will observe by the turn of his countenance and the air of his address a kind of equality assumed he appears to have discovered the woman in her charming as that woman is he smiles he seems to expect repartee and smartness and is never disappointed but then visibly he prepares himself to give as well as take he dares after he has been a while in her company to dispute a point with her  every point yielded up to the other though no assuming or dogmatical air compels it  in short with miss how a bold man sees no doubt but sir george colmar did that he and she may either very soon be familiar together i mean with innocence or he may so far incur her displeasure as to be forbid her presence for ever  for my own part when i was first introduced to this lady which was by my goddess when she herself was a visiter at mrs howes i had not been half an hour with her but i even hungered and thirsted after a rompingbout with the lively rogue and in the second or third visit was more deterred by the delicacy of her friend than by what i apprehended from her own this charming creatures presence thought i awes us both and i wished her absence though any other lady were present that i might try the difference in miss howes behavior before her friends face or behind her back  delicate ladies make delicate ladies as well as decent men with all miss howes fire and spirit it was easy to see by her very eye that she watched for lessons and feared reproof from the penetrating eye of her milderdispositiond friend miss how in vol iii p     says that she was always more afraid of her than of her mother and in p     that she fears her as much as she loves her and in many other places in her letters to miss harlowe verifies this observation of mr lovelace  and yet it was as easy to observe in the candor and sweet manners of the other that the fear which miss how stood in of her was more owing to her own generous apprehension that she fell short of her excellencies than to miss harlowes consciousness of excellence over her i have often since i came at miss howes letters revolved this just and fine praise contained in one of them vol iv p     every one saw that the preference each gave you to herself exalted you not into any visible triumph over her for you had always something to say on every point you carried that raised the yielding heart and left every one pleased and satisfied with herself though she carried not off the palm  as i propose in my more advanced life to endeavor to atone for my youthful freedoms with individuals of the sex by giving caution and instructions to the whole i have made a memorandum to enlarge upon this doctrine  to wit that it is full as necessary to direct daughters in the choice of their female companions as it is to guard them against the designs of men  i say not this however to the disparagement of miss how she has from pride what her friend has from principle the lord help the sex if they had not pride  but yet i am confident that miss how is indebted to the conversation and correspondence of miss harlowe for her highest improvements but both these ladies out of the question i make no scruple to averr and i jack should know something of the matter that there have been more girls ruined at least prepared for ruin by their own sex taking in servants as well as companions than directly by the attempts and delusions of men  but it is time enough when i am old and joyless to enlarge upon this topic  as to the comparison between the two ladies i will expatiate more on that subject for i like it when i have had them both  which this letter of the vixen girls i hope thou will allow warrants me to try for  i return to the consideration of a few more of its contents to justify my vengeance so nearly now in view  as to mrs townsend her manlike spirit her two brothers and their ships crews  i say nothing but this to the insolent threatening  let em come   but as to her sordid menace  to repay the horrid villain as she calls me for all my vileness by broken bones  broken bones belford  who can bear this porterly threatening  broken bones jack  damn the little vulgar  give me a name for her  but i banish all furious resentment if i get these two girls into my power heaven forbid that i should be a second phalaris and turn his bull upon the artist no bones of theirs will i break  they shall come off with me upon much lighter terms   but these fellows are smugglers it seems and am not i a smuggler too  i have not the least doubt that i shall have secured my goods before thursday or wednesday either  but did i want a plot what a charming new one does this letter of miss how strike me out i am almost sorry that i have fixed upon one  for here how easy would it be for me to assemble a crew of swabbers and to create a mrs townsend whose person thou see my beloved knows not to come on tuesday at miss howes renewed urgency in order to carry my beloved to a warehouse of my own providing  this however is my triumphant hope that at the very time that these ragamuffins will be at hamstead looking for us my dear miss harlowe and i so the fates i imagine have ordained shall be fast asleep in each others arms in town  lie still villain till the time comes  my heart jack my heart  it is always thumping away on the remotest prospects of this nature  but it seems that the vileness of this specious monster meaning me jack has brought hickman into credit with her so i have done some good  but to whom i cannot tell for this poor fellow should i permit him to have this termagant will be punished as many times we all are by the enjoyment of his own wishes  nor can she be happy as i take it with him were he to govern himself by her will and have none of his own since never was there a directing wife who knew where to stop power makes such a one wanton  she despises the man she can govern like alexander who wept that he had no more worlds to conquer she will be looking out for new exercises for her power till she grow uneasy to herself a discredit to her husband and a plague to all about her  but this honest fellow it seems with tears in his eyes and with humble prostration besought the vixen to permit him to set out in his chariot and four in order to give himself the glory of protecting such an oppressed innocent in the face of the whole world  nay he reddend it seems and trembled too as he read the fair complainants letter  how valiant is all this  women love brave men and no wonder that his tears his trembling and his prostration gave him high reputation with the meek miss how  but do think jack that i in the like case and equally affected with the distress should have acted thus  do think that i should not first have rescued the lady and then if needful have asked excuse for it the lady in my hand  would not thou have done thus as well as i  but it is best as it is honest hickman may now sleep in a whole skin and yet that is more perhaps than he would have done the ladys deliverance unattempted had i come at this requested permission of his any other way than by a letter that it must not be known i have intercepted  she thinks i may be diverted from pursuing my charmer by some newstarted villainy villainy is a word that she is extremely fond of but i can tell her that it is impossible i should till the end of this villainy be obtained difficulty is a stimulus with such a spirit as mine i thought miss how knew me better were she to offer herself person for person in the romancing zeal of her friendship to save her friend it should not do while the dear creature is on this side the moon  she thanks heaven that her friend has received her letter of the  th we are all glad of it she ought to thank me too but i will not at present claim her thanks  but when she rejoices that that letter went safe does she not in effect call out for vengeance and expect it  all in good time miss how when set thou out for the isle of wight love  i will close at this time with desiring thee to make a list of the virulent terms with which the enclosed letter abounds and then if thou supposest that i have made such another and have added to it all the flowers of the same blow in the former letters of the same fancy creature and those in that of miss harlowe left for me on her elopement thou will certainly think that i have provocations sufficent to justify me in all i shall do to either  return the enclosed the moment thou have perused it  letter xxii mr lovelace to john belford esquire sunday night  monday morning i went down with revenge in my heart the contents of miss howes letter almost engrossing me the moment that miss harlowe and mrs moore accompanied by miss rawlins came in but in my countenance all the gentle the placid the serene that the glass could teach and in my behavior all the polite that such an unpolite creature as she has often told me i am could put on  miss rawlins was sent for home almost as soon as she came in to entertain an unexpected visiter to her great regret as well as to the disappointment of my fair one as i could perceive from the looks of both for they had agreed it seems if i went to town as i said i intended to do to take a walk upon the heath at least in mrs moores garden and who knows what might have been the issue had the spirit of curiosity in the one met with the spirit of communication in the other  miss rawlins promised to return if possible but sent to excuse herself her visiter intending to stay with her all night  i rejoiced in my heart at her message and after much supplication obtained the favor of my beloveds company for another walk in the garden having as i told her abundance of things to say to propose and to be informed of in order ultimately to govern myself in my future steps  she had vouchsafed i should tell thee with eyes turned from me and in an halfaside attitude to sip two dishes of tea in my company  dear soul  how anger unpolishes the most polite for i never saw miss harlowe behave so aukwardly i imagined she knew not how to be awkward  when we were in the garden i poured my whole soul into her attentive ear and besought her returning favor  she told me that she had formed her scheme for her future life that vile as the treatment was which she had received from me that was not all the reason she had for rejecting my suit but that on the maturest deliberation she was convinced that she could neither be happy with me nor make me happy and she injoined me for both our sakes to think no more of her  the captain i told her was rid down post in a manner to forward my wishes with her uncle  lady betty and miss montague were undoubtedly arrived in town by this time  i would set out early in the morning to attend them  they adored her they longed to see her they would see her  they would not be denied her company into oxfordshire  where could she better go to be free from her brothers insults  where to be absolutely made unapprehensive of anybody else  might i have any hopes of her returning favor if miss how could be prevailed upon to intercede for me  miss how prevailed upon to intercede for you repeated she with a scornful bridle but a very pretty one  and there she stopped  i repeated the concern it would be to me to be under a necessity of mentioning the misunderstanding to lady betty and my cousin as a misunderstanding still to be made up and as if i were of very little consequence to a dear creature who was of so much to me urging that it would extremely lower me not only in my own opinion but in that of my relations  but still she referred to miss howes next letter and all the concession i could bring her to in this whole conference was that she would wait the arrival and visit of the two ladies if they came in a day or two or before she received the expected letter from miss how  thank heaven for this thought i and now may i go to town with hopes at my return to find thee dearest where i shall leave thee  but yet i shall not entirely trust to this as she may find reasons to change her mind in my absence my fellow therefore who is in the house and who by mrs beviss kind intelligence will know every step she can take shall have andrew and a horse ready to give me immediate notice of her motions and moreover go where she will he shall be one of her retinue though unknown to herself if possible  this was all i could make of the fair inexorable should i be glad of it or sorry for it   glad i believe and yet my pride is confoundedly abated to think that i had so little hold in the affections of this daughter of the harlowes  dont tell me that virtue and principle are her guides on this occasion  it is pride a greater pride than my own that governs her love she has none thou see nor ever had at least not in a superior degree  love never was under the dominion of prudence or of any reasoning power  she cannot bear to be thought a woman i warrant  and if in the last attempt i find her not one what will she be the worse for the trial  no one is to blame for suffering an evil he cannot shun or avoid  were a general to be overpowered and robbed by a highwayman would he be less fit for the command of an army on that account  if indeed the general pretending great valor and having boasted that he never would be robbed were to make but faint resistance when he was brought to the test and to yield his purse when he was master of his own sword then indeed will the highwayman who robs him be thought the braver man  but from these last conferences am i furnished with an argument in defense of my favorite purpose which i never yet pleaded  o jack what a difficulty must a man be allowed to have to conquer a predominant passion be it what it will when the gratifying of it is in his power however wrong he knows it to be to resolve to gratify it reflect upon this and then will thou be able to account for if not to excuse a projected crime which has habit to plead for it in a breast as stormy as uncontrollable   this my new argument   should she fail in the trial should i succeed and should she refuse to go on with me and even to marry me which i can have no notion of  and should she disdain to be obliged to me for the handsome provision i should be proud to make for her even to the half of my estate yet cannot she be altogether unhappy  is she not entitled to an independent fortune will not col morden as her trustee put her in possession of it and did she not in our former conference point out the way of life that she always preferred to the married life  to take her good norton for her directress and guide and to live upon her own estate in the manner her grandfather desired she should live see p       it is moreover to be considered that she cannot according to her own notions recover above one half of her fame were we now to intermarry so much does she think she has suffered by her going off with me and will she not be always repining and mourning for the loss of the other half  and if she must live a life of such uneasiness and regret for half may she not as well repine and mourn for the whole  nor let me tell thee will her own scheme of penitence in this case be half so perfect if she do not fall as if she does for what a foolish penitent will she make who has nothing to repent of  she piques herself thou know and makes it matter of reproach to me that she went not off with me by her own consent but was tricked out of herself  nor upbraid thou me upon the meditated breach of vows so repeatedly made she will not thou see permit me to fulfill them and if she would this i have to say that at the time i made the most solemn of them i was fully determined to keep them but what prince thinks himself obliged any longer to observe the articles of the most sacredly swornto treaties than suits with his interest or inclination although the consequence of the infraction must be as he knows the destruction of thousands  is not this then the result of all that miss clarissa harlowe if it be not her own fault may be as virtuous after she has lost her honor as it is called as she was before she may be a more eminent example to her sex and if she yield a little yield in the trial may be a completer penitent nor can she but by her own wilfulness be reduced to low fortunes  and thus may her old nurse and she an old coachman and a pair of old coachhorses and two or three old maidservants and perhaps a very old footman or two for every thing will be old and penitential about her live very comfortably together reading old sermons and old prayerbooks and relieving old men and old women and giving old lessons and old warnings upon new subjects as well as old ones to the young ladies of her neighborhood and so pass on to a good old age doing a great deal of good both by precept and example in her generation  and is a lady who can live thus prettily without control who ever did prefer and who still prefers the single to the married life and who will be enabled to do every thing that the plan she had formed will direct her to do be said to be ruined undone and such sort of stuff  i have no patience with the pretty fools who use those strong words to describe the most transitory evil and which a mere churchform makes none  at this rate of romancing how many flourishing ruins do thou as well as i know let us but look about us and we shall see some of the haughtiest and most censorious spirits among our acquaintance of that sex now passing for chaste wives of whom strange stories might be told and others whose husbands hearts have been made to ache for their gaieties both before and after marriage and yet know not half so much of them as some of us honest fellows could tell them  but having thus satisfied myself in relation to the worst that can happen to this charming creature and that it will be her own fault if she be unhappy i have not at all reflected upon what is likely to be my own lot  this has always been my notion though miss how grudges us the best of the sex and says that the worst is too good for us vol iv p      that the wife of a libertine ought to be pure spotless uncontaminated to what purpose has such a one lived a free life but to know the world and to make his advantages of it  and to be very serious it would be a misfortune to the public for two persons heads of a family to be both bad since between two such a race of varlets might be propagated lovelaces and belfords if thou will who might do great mischief in the world  thou see at bottom that i am not an abandoned fellow and that there is a mixture of gravity in me this as i grow older may increase and when my active capacity begins to abate i may sit down with the preacher and resolve all my past life into vanity and vexation of spirit  this is certain that i shall never find a woman so well suited to my taste as miss clarissa harlowe i only wish if i live to see that day that i may have such a lady as her to comfort and adorn my settingsun i have often thought it very unhappy for us both that so excellent a creature sprung up a little too late for my settingout and a little too early in my progress before i can think of returning and yet as i have picked up the sweet traveller in my way i cannot help wishing that she would bear me company in the rest of my journey although she were to step out of her own path to oblige me and then perhaps we could put up in the evening at the same inn and be very happy in each others conversation recounting the difficulties and dangers we had passed in our way to it  i imagine that thou will be apt to suspect that some passages in this letter were written in town why jack i cannot but say that the westminster air is a little grosser than that at hamstead and the conversation of mrs sinclair and the nymphs less innocent than mrs moores and miss rawlinss and i think in my heart that i can say and write those things at one place which i cannot at the other nor indeed anywhere else  i came to town about seven this morning  all necessary directions and precautions remembered to be given  i besought the favor of an audience before i set out i was desirous to see which of her lovely faces she was pleased to put on after another night had passed but she was resolved i found to leave our quarrel open she would not give me an opportunity so much as to entreat her again to close it before the arrival of lady betty and my cousin  i had notice from my proctor by a few lines brought by man and horse just before i set out that all difficulties had been for two days past surmounted and that i might have the license for fetching  i sent up the letter to my beloved by mrs bevis it procured me not admittance though my request for that was sent with it  and now belford i set out upon business  letter xxiii mr lovelace to john belford esquire monday june    did ever see a license jack  nn by divine permission lord bishop of london to our wellbeloved in christ robert lovelace your servant my good lord what have i done to merit so much goodness who never saw your lordship in my life of the parish of st martins in the fields bachelor and clarissa harlowe of the same parish spinster sends greeting  whereas ye are as is alleged determined to enter into the holy state of matrimony this is only alleged thou observest by and with the consent of etc etc etc and are very desirous of obtaining your marriage to be solemnized in the face of the church we are willing that such your honest desires honest desires jack may more speedily have their due effect and therefore that ye may be able to procure such marriage to be freely and lawfully solemnized in the parish church of st martin in the fields or st giless in the fields in the county of middlesex by the rector vicar or curate thereof at any time of the year at any time of the year jack without publication of banes provided that by reason of any precontract i verily think that i have had three or four precontracts in my time but the good girls have not claimed upon them of a long time consanguinity affinity or any other lawful cause whatsoever there be no lawful impediment in this behalf and that there be not at this time any action suit plaint quarrel or demand moved or depending before any judge ecclesiastical or temporal for or concerning any marriage contracted by or with either of you and that the said marriage be openly solemnized in the church abovementioned between the hours of eight and twelve in the forenoon and without prejudice to the minister of the place where the said woman is a parishioner we do hereby for good causes it cost me  let me see jack  what did it cost me give and grant our license or faculty as well to you the parties contracting as to the rector vicar or curate of the said church where the said marriage is intended to be solemnized to solemnize the same in manner and form abovespecified according to the rites and ceremonies prescribed in the book of common prayer in that behalf published by authority of parliament provided always that if hereafter any fraud shall appear to have been committed at the time of granting this license either by false suggestions or concealment of the truth now this belford is a little hard upon us for i cannot say that every one of our suggestions is literally true  so in good conscience i ought not to marry under this licence the license shall be void to all intents and purposes as if the same had not been granted and in that case we do inhibit all ministers whatsoever if any thing of the premises shall come to their knowledge from proceeding to the celebration of the said marriage without first consulting us or our vicar general given etc  the follow the registers name and a large pendent seal with these words round it  seal of the vicar general and officialprincipal of the diocese of london  a good whimsical instrument take it all together  but what think thou are the arms to this matrimonial harbinger  why in the first place two crossed swords to show that marriage is a state of offense as well as defense three lions to denote that those who enter into the state ought to have a triple proportion of courage and could thou have imagined that these priestly fellows in so solemn a case would cut their jokes upon poor souls who come to have their honest desires put in a way to be gratified there are three crooked horns smartly topknotted with ribbands which being the ladies wear seem to indicate that they may very probably adorn as well as bestow the bulls feather  to describe it according to heraldryart if i am not mistaken  gules two swords saltirewise or second coat a chevron sable between three buglehorns or  so it ought to be on a chief of the second three lions rampant of the first  but the devil take them for their hieroglyphics should i say if i were determined in good earnest to marry  and determined to marry i would be were it not for this consideration that once married and i am married for life  that is the plague of it  could a man do as the birds do change every valentines day a natural appointment for birds have not the sense forsooth to fetter themselves as we wiseacre men take great and solemn pains to do there would be nothing at all in it and what a glorious time would the lawyers have on the one hand with their noverint universis and suits commenceable on restitution of goods and chattels and the parsons on the other with their indulgencies renewable annually as other licenses to the honest desires of their clients  then were a stated mulct according to rank or fortune to be paid on every change toward the exigencies of the state but none on renewals with the old loves for the sake of encouraging constancy especially among the minores the change would be made sufficiently difficult and the whole public would be the better for it while those children which the parents could not agree about maintaining might be considered as the children of the public and provided for like the children of the ancient spartans who were as ours would in this case be a nation of heroes how jack could i have improved upon lycurguss institutions had i been a lawgiver did i never show thee a scheme which i drew up on such a notion as this  in which i demonstrated the conveniences and obviated the inconveniences of changing the present mode to this i believe i never did  i remember i proved to a demonstration that such a change would be a means of annihilating absolutely annihilating four or five very atrocious and capital sins  rapes vulgarly so called adultery and fornication nor would polygamy be panted after frequently would it prevent murders and duelling hardly any such thing as jealousy the cause of shocking violences would be heard of and hypocrisy between man and wife be banished the bosoms of each nor probably would the reproach of barrenness rest as now it too often does where it is least deserved  nor would there possibly be such a person as a barren woman  moreover what a multitude of domestic quarrels would be avoided were such a scheme carried into execution since both sexes would bear with each other in the view that they could help themselves in a few months  and then what a charming subject for conversation would be the gallant and generous last partings between man and wife each perhaps a new mate in eye and rejoicing secretly in the manumission could afford to be complaisantlysorrowful in appearance he presented her with this jewel it will be said by the reporter for example sake she him with that how he wept how she sobbd how they looked after one another yet that is the jest of it neither of them wishing to stand another twelvemonths trial  and if giddy fellows or giddy girls misbehave in a first marriage whether from noviceship having expected to find more in the matter than can be found or from perverseness on her part or positiveness on his each being mistaken in the other a mighty difference jack in the same person an inmate or a visiter what a fine opportunity will each have by this scheme of recovering a lost character and of setting all right in the next adventure  and o jack with what joy with what rapture would the changelings or changeables if thou like that word better number the weeks the days the hours as the annual obligation approached to its desirable period  as for the spleen or vapors no such malady would be known or heard of the physical tribe would indeed be the sufferers and the only sufferers since fresh health and fresh spirits the consequences of sweet blood and sweet humors the mind and body continually pleased with each other would perpetually flow in and the joys of expectation the highest of all our joys would salubriate and keep all alive  but that no body of men might suffer the physicians i thought might turn parsons as there would be a great demand for parsons besides as they would be partakers in the general benefit they must be sorry fellows indeed if they preferred themselves to the public  every one would be married a dozen times at least both men and women would be careful of their characters and polite in their behavior as well as delicate in their persons and elegant in their dress a great matter each of these let me tell thee to keep passion alive either to induce a renewal with the old love or to recommend themselves to a new while the newspapers would be crowded with paragraphs all the world their readers as all the world would be concerned to see who and who is together   yesterday for instance entered into the holy state of matrimony we should all speak reverently of matrimony then the right honorable robert earl lovelace i shall be an earl by that time with her grace the duchess dowager of fiftymanors his lordships one and thirtieth wife  i shall then be contented perhaps to take up as it is called with a widow but she must not have had more than one husband neither thou know that i am nice in these particulars  i know jack that thou for thy part wilt approve of my scheme  as lord m and i between us have three or four boroughs at command i think i will get into parliament in order to bring in a bill for this good purpose  neither will the houses of parliament nor the houses of convocation have reason to object to it and all the courts whether spiritual or sensual civil or uncivil will find their account in it when passed ino a law  by my soul jack i should be apprehensive of a general insurrection and that incited by the women were such a bill to be thrown out  for here is the excellency of the scheme the women will have equal reason with the men to be pleased with it  dst think that old prerogative harlowe for example must not if such a law were in being have pulled in his horns  so excellent a lady as he has would never else have renewed with such a gloomy tyrant who as well as all other tyrants must have been upon good behavior from year to year  a termagant wife if such a law were to pass would be a phoenix  the churches would be the only marketplaces for the fair sex and domestic excellence the capital recommendation  nor would there be an old maid in great britain and all its territories for what an odd soul must she be who could not have her twelvemonths trial  in short a total alteration for the better in the morals and way of lfe in both sexes must in a very few years be the consequence of such a saltary law  who would have expected such a one from me i wish the devil owe me not a spite for it  then would not the distinction be very pretty jack as in flowers  such a gentleman or such a lady is an annual  such a one a perennial  one difficulty however as i remember occurred to me upon the probability that a wife might be ensient as the lawyers call it but thus i obviated it  that no man should be allowed to marry another woman without his then wifes consent till she were broughttobed and he had defrayed all incident charges and till it was agreed upon between them whether the child should be his hers or the publics the women in this case to have what i call the coercive option for i would not have it in the mans power to be a dog neither  and indeed i gave the turn of the scale in every part of my scheme in the womens favor for dearly do i love the sweet rogues  how infinitely more preferable this my scheme than the polygamy one of the old patriarchs who had wives and concubines without number i believe david and solomon had their hundreds at a time had they not jack  let me add that annual parliaments and annual marriages are the projects next my heart how could i expatiate upon the benefits that would arise from both     letter xxiv mr lovelace to john belford esquire well but now my plots thicken and my employment of writing to thee on this subject will soon come to a conclusion for now having got the license and mrs townsend with her tars being to come to hamstead next wednesday or thursday and another letter possibly or message from miss how to inquire how miss harlowe does upon the rustics report of her ill health and to express her wonder that she has not heard from her in answer to hers on her escape  i must soon blow up the lady or be blown up myself and so i am preparing with lady betty and my cousin montague to wait upon my beloved with a coach and four or a set for lady betty will not stir out with a pair for the world though but for two or three miles and this is a wellknown part of her character  but as to her arms and crest upon the coach and trappings  do thou not know that a blunts must supply her while her own is newlining and repairing an opportunity she is willing to take now she is in town nothing of this kind can be done to her mind in the country liveries nearly lady bettys  thou have seen lady betty lawrance several times  have thou not belford  no never in my life  but thou have and lain with her too or fame does thee more credit than thou deservest  why jack know thou not lady bettys other name  other name  has she two  she has and what think thou of lady bab wallis  o the devil  now thou have it lady barbara thou know lifted up in circumstances and by pride never appears or produces herself but on occasions special  to pass to men of quality or price for a duchess or countess at least she has always been admired for a grandeur in her air that few women of quality can come up to and never was supposed to be other than what she passed for though often and often a paramour for lords  and who think thou is my cousin montague  nay how should i know  how indeed why my little johanetta golding a lively yet modestlooking girl is my cousin montague  there belford is an aunt  there is a cousin both have wit at will both are accustomed to ape quality both are genteelly descended mistresses of themselves and well educated  yet past pity true spartan dames ashamed of nothing but detection  always therefore upon their guard against that and in their own conceit when assuming top parts the very quality they ape  and how do think i dress them out  i will tell thee  lady betty in a rich gold tissue adorned with jewels of high price  my cousin montague in a pale pink nding an end with silver flowers of her own  charlotte as well as my beloved is admirable at her needle not quite so richly jeweld out as lady betty but earrings and solitaire very valuable and infinitely becoming  johanetta thou know has a good complexion a fine neck and ears remarkably fine  so has charlotte she is nearly of charlottes stature too  laces both the richest that could be procured  thou can not imagine what a sum the loan of the jewels cost me though but for three days  this sweet girl will half ruin me but see thou not by this time that her reign is short  it must be

reluctance next to fainting  in spite of all her foresight vigilance suspicion once more is the charmer of my soul in her new lodgings  now throbs away every pulse now thump thump thumps my bounding heart for something  but i have not time for the particulars of our management  my beloved is now directing some of her clothes to be packed up  never more to enter this house nor ever more will she i dare say when once again out of it  yet not so much as a condition of forgiveness  the harlowespirited fairone will not deserve my mercy  she will wait for miss howes next letter and then if she find a difficulty in her new schemes thank her for nothing  will  will what  why even then will take time to consider whether i am to be forgiven or for ever rejected an indifference that revives in my heart the remembrance of a thousand of the like nature  and yet lady betty and miss montague one would be tempted to think jack that they wish her to provoke my vengeance declare that i ought to be satisfied with such a proud suspension  they are entirely attached to her whatever she says is must be gospel  they are guarantees for her return to hamstead this night they are to go back with her a supper bespoke by lady betty at mrs moores all the vacant apartments there by my permission for i had engaged them for a month certain to be filled with them and their attendants for a week at least or till they can prevail upon the dear perverse as they hope they shall to restore me to her favor and to accompany lady betty to oxfordshire  the dear creature has thus far condescended  that she will write to miss how and acquaint her with the present situation of things  if she write i shall see what she writes but i believe she will have other employment soon  lady betty is sure she tells her that she shall prevail upon her to forgive me though she dares say that i deserve not forgiveness lady betty is too delicate to inquire strictly into the nature of my offense but it must be an offense against herself against miss montague against the virtuous of the whole sex or it could not be so highly resented yet she will not leave her till she forgive me and till she see our nuptials privately celebrated mean time as she approves of her uncles expedient she will address her as already my wife before strangers  stedman her solicitor may attend her for orders in relation to her chanceryaffair at hamstead not one hour they can be favored with will they lose from the company and conversation of so dear so charming a new relation  hard then if she had not obliged them with her

her as his niece  how will lady sarah bless herself  she will now think her loss of the dear daughter she mourns for happily supplied miss montague dwells upon every word that falls from her lips she perfectly adores her new cousin for her cousin she must be and her cousin will she call her she answers for equal admiration in her sister patty  ay cry i whispering loud enough for her to hear how will my cousin pattys doves eyes glisten and run over on the very first interview  so gracious so noble so unaffected a dear creature  what a happy family chorus we all will ours be  these and suchlike congratulatory admirations every hour repeated her modesty hurt by the ecstatic praises  her graces are too natural to herself for her to be proud of them  but she must be content to be punished for excellencies that cast a shade upon the most excellent  in short we are here as at hamstead all joy and rapture all of us except my beloved in whose sweet face her almost fainting reluctance to reenter these doors not overcome reigns a kind of anxious serenity  but how will even that be changed in a few hours  methinks i begin to pity the halfapprehensive beauty  but avaunt thou unseasonablyintruding pity thou have more than once already well nigh undone me  and adieu reflection begone consideration and commiseration i dismiss ye all for at least a week to come  be remembered her broken word her flight when my fond soul was meditating mercy to her  be remembered her treatment of me in her letter on her escape to hamstead  her hamstead virulence  what is it she ought not to expect from an unchained beelzebub and a plotting villain  be her preference of the single life to me also remembered  that she despises me  that she even refuses to be my wife  a proud lovelace to be denied a wife  to be more proudly rejected by a daughter of the harlowes  the ladies of my own family she thinks them the ladies of my family supplicating in vain for her returning favor to their despised kinsman and taking laws from her still prouder punctilio  be the execrations of her vixen friend likewise remembered poured out upon me from her representations and thereby made her own execrations  be remembered still more particularly the townsend plot set on foot between them and now in a day or two ready to break out and the sordid threatenings thrown out against me by that little fury  is not this the crisis for which i have been long waiting shall tomlinson shall these women be engaged shall so many engines be set at work at an immense expense with infinite contrivance and all to no purpose  is not this the hour of her trial  and in her of the trial of the virtue of her whole sex so long premeditated so long threatened  whether her frost is frost indeed whether her virtue is principle whether if once subdued she will not be always subdued and will she not want the very crown of her glory the proof of her till now allsurpassing excellence if i stop short of the ultimate trial  now is the end of purposes long overawed often suspended at hand and need i to throw the sins of her cursed family into the too weighty scale  abhorred be force  be the thoughts of force there is no triumph over the will in force this i know i have said vol iv p      but would i not have avoided it if i could  have i not tried every other method and have i any other recourse left me can she resent the last outrage more than she has resented a fainter effort  and if her resentments run ever so high cannot i repair by matrimony  she will not refuse me i know jack the haughty beauty will not refuse me when her pride of being corporally inviolate is brought down when she can tell no tales but when be her resistance what it will even her own sex will suspect a yielding in resistance and when that modesty which may fill her bosom with resentment will lock up her speech  but how know i that i have not made my own difficulties  is she not a woman  what redress lies for a perpetrated evil  must she not live  her piety will secure her life  and will not time be my friend  what in a word will be her behavior afterward  she cannot fly me  she must forgive me  and as i have often said once forgiven will be for ever forgiven  why then should this enervating pity unsteel my foolish heart   it shall not all these things will i remember and think of nothing else in order to keep up a resolution which the women about me will have it i shall be still unable to hold  i will teach the dear charming creature to emulate me in contrivance  i will teach her to weave webs and plots against her conqueror  i will show her that in her smuggling schemes she is but a spider compared to me and that she has all this time been spinning only a cobweb  what shall we do now  we are immersed in the depth of grief and apprehension  how ill do women bear disappointment  set upon going to hamstead and upon quitting for ever a house she reenterd with infinite reluctance what things she intended to take with her ready packed up herself on tiptoe to be gone and i prepared to attend her thither she begins to be afraid that she shall not go this night and in grief and despair has flung herself into her old apartment locked herself in and through the keyhole dorcas sees her on her knees  praying i suppose for a safe deliverance  and from what  and wherefore these agonizing apprehensions  why here this unkind lady betty with the dear creatures knowledge though to her concern and this madheaded cousin montague without it while she was employed in directing her package have hurried away in the coach to their own lodgings  only indeed to put up some nightcloaths and so forth in order to attend their sweet cousin to hamstead and no less to my surprise than hers are not yet returned  i have sent to know the meaning of it  in a great hurry of spirits she would have had me gone myself hardly any pacifying her  the girl god bless her is wild with her own idle apprehensions  what is she afraid of  i curse them both for their delay  my tardy villain how he stays  devil fetch them let them send their coach and well go without them in her hearing i bid the fellow tell them so  perhaps he stays to bring the coach if any thing happens to hinder the ladies from attending my beloved this night  devil take them again say i  they promised too they would not stay because it was but two nights ago that a chariot was robbed at the foot of hamstead hill which alarmed my fairone when told of it  oh here is my aunts servant with a billet  to robert lovelace esquire monday night excuse us dear nephew i beseech you to my dearest kinswoman one night cannot break squares for here miss montague has been taken violently ill with three fainting fits one after another the hurry of her joy i believe to find your dear lady so much surpass all expectation never did familylove you know reign so strong as among us and the too eager desire she had to attend her have occasioned it for she has but weak spirits poor girl well as she looks  if she be better we will certainly go with you tomorrow morning after we have breakfasted with her at your lodgings but whether she be or not i will do myself the pleasure to attend your lady to hamstead and will be with you for that purpose about nine in the morning with due compliments to your most worthily beloved i am  yours affectionately elizab lawrance   faith and troth jack i know not what to do with myself for here just now having sent in the above note by dorcas out came my beloved with it in her hand in a fit of phrensy  true by my soul  she had indeed complained of her head all the evening  dorcas ran to me out of breath to tell me that her lady was coming in some strange way but she followed her so quick that the frighted wench had not time to say in what way  it seems when she read the billet  now indeed said she am i a lost creature o the poor clarissa harlowe  she tore off her headcloaths inquired where i was and in she came her shining tresses flowing about her neck her ruffles torn and hanging in tatters about her snowy hands with her arms spread out her eyes wildly turned as if starting from their orbits  down sunk she at my feet as soon as she approached me her charming bosom heaving to her uplifted face and clasping her arms about my knees dear lovelace said she if ever  if ever  if ever  and unable to speak another word quitting her clasping hold down prostrate on the floor sunk she neither in a fit nor out of one  i was quite astonished  all my purposes suspended for a few moments i knew neither what to say nor what to do but recollecting myself am i again thought i in a way to be overcome and made a fool of  if i now recede i am gone for ever  i raised her but down she sunk as if quite disjointed her limbs failing her  yet not in a fit neither i never heard of or saw such a dear unaccountable almost lifeless and speechless too for a few moments  what must her apprehensions be at that moment and for what  an highnotioned dear soul  pretty ignorance thought i  never having met with a repugnance so greatly repugnant i was staggered  i was confounded  yet how should i know that it would be so till i tried  and how having proceeded thus far could i stop were i not to have had the women to goad me on and to make light of circumstances which they pretended to be better judges of than me  i lifted her however into a chair and in words of disordered passion told her all her fears were needless wondered at them begged of her to be pacified besought her reliance on my faith and honor and revowed all my old vows and poured forth new ones  at last with an heartbreaking sob i see i see mr lovelace in broken sentences she spoke  i see i see  that at last  at last  i am ruined  ruined  if your pity  let me implore your pity  and down on her bosom like a halfbrokenstalkd lily topheavy with the overcharging dews of the morning sunk her head with a sigh that went to my heart  all i could think of to reassure her when a little recovered i said  why did i not send for their coach as i had intimated it might return in the morning for the ladies  i had actually done so i told her on seeing her strange uneasiness but it was then gone to fetch a doctor for miss montague lest his chariot should not be so ready  an lovelace said she with a doubting face anguish in her imploring eye  lady betty would think it very strange i told her if she were to know it was so disagreeable to her to stay one night for her company in a house where she had passed so many  she called me names upon this  she had called me names before  i was patient  let her go to lady bettys lodgings then directly go if the person i called lady betty was really lady betty  if my dear good heaven what a villain does that if show you believe me to be  i cannot help it  i beseech you once more let me go to mrs leesons if that if ought not to be said  then assuming a more resolute spirit  i will go i will inquire my way  i will go by myself  and would have rushed by me  i folded my arms about her to detain her pleading the bad way i heard poor charlotte was in and what a farther concern her impatience if she went would give her  she would believe nothing i said unless i would instantly order a coach since she was not to have lady bettys nor was permitted to go to mrs leesons and let her go in it to hamstead late as it was and all alone so much the better for in the house of people of whom lady betty upon inquiry had heard a bad character  dropped foolishly this by my prating new relation in order to do credit to herself by depreciating others every thing and every face looking with so much meaning vileness as well as my own thou art still too sensible thought i my charmer she was resolved not to stay another night  dreading what might happen as to her intellects and being very apprehensive that she might possibly go through a great deal before morning though more violent she could not well be with the worst she dreaded i humoured her and ordered will to go and endeavor to get a coach directly to carry us to hamstead i cared not at what price  robbers whom i would have terrified her with she feared not  i was all her fear i found and this house her terror for i saw plainly that she now believed that lady betty and miss montague were both impostors  but her mistrust is a little of the latest to do her service  and o jack the rage of love the rage of revenge is upon me by turns they tear me  the progress already made  the womens instigations  the power i shall have to try her to the utmost and still to marry her if she be not to be brought to cohabitation  let me perish belford if she escape me now  will is not yet come back  near eleven   will is this moment returned  no coach to be got for love or money  once more she urges  to mrs leesons let me go  lovelace good lovelace let me go to mrs leesons  what is miss montagues illness to my terror  for the almightys sake mr lovelace  her hands clasped   o my angel what a wildness is this  do you know do you see my dearest life what an appearance your causeless apprehensions have given you  do you know it is past eleven oclock  twelve one two three four  any hour  i care not  if you mean me honorably let me go cut of this hated house  thou wilt observe belford that though this was written afterward yet as in other places i write it as it was spoken and happened as if i had retired to put down every sentence as spoken i know thou likest this lively presenttense manner as it is one of my peculiars  just as she had repeated the last words if you mean me honorably let me go out of this hated house in came mrs sinclair in a great ferment  and what pray madam has this house done to you  mr lovelace you have known me some time and if i have not the niceness of this lady i hope i do not deserve to be treated thus  she set her huge arms akembo hoh madam let me tell you i am amazed at your freedoms with my character and mr lovelace holding up and violently shaking her head if you are a gentleman and a man of honor   having never before seen any thing but obsequiousness in this woman little as she liked her she was frighted at her masculine air and fierce look  god help me cried she what will become of me now then turning her head hither and thither in a wild kind of amaze whom have i for a protector what will become of me now  i will be your protector my dearest love  but indeed you are uncharitably severe upon poor mrs sinclair indeed you are  she is a gentlewoman born and the relict of a man of honor and though left in such circumstances as oblige her to let lodgings yet would she scorn to be guilty of a wilful baseness  i hope so  it may be so  i may be mistaken  but  but there is no crime i presume no treason to say i dont like her house  the old dragon straddled up to her with her arms kembod again  her eyebrows erect like the bustles upon a hogs back and scouling over her shortened nose more than halfhid her ferret eyes her mouth was distorted she pouted out her blubberlips as if to bellows up wind and sputter into her horsenostrils and her chin was curdled and more than usually prominent with passion  with two hohmadams she accosted the frighted fairone who terrified caught hold of my sleeve  i feared she would fall into fits and with a look of indignation told mrs sinclair that these apartments were mine and i could not imagine what she meant either by listening to what passed between me and my spouse or to come in uninvited much less to give herself these violent airs  i may be to blame jack for suffering this wretch to give herself these airs but her coming in was without my orders  the old beldam throwing herself into a chair fell a blubbering and exclaiming and the pacifying of her and endeavoring to reconcile the lady to her took up till near one a clock  and thus between terror and the late hour and what followed she was diverted from the thoughts of getting out of the house to mrs leesons or anywhere else  letter xxvi mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday morn june    and now belford i can go no farther the affair is over clarissa lives and i am  your humble servant r lovelace  the whole of this black transaction is given by the injured lady to miss how in her subsequent letters dated thursday july   to which the reader is referred  letter xxvii mr belford to robert lovelace esquire watford wedn june    o thou savagehearted monster what work have thou made in one guilty hour for a whole age of repentance  i am inexpressibly concerned at the fate of this matchless lady she could not have fallen into the hands of any other man breathing and suffered as she has done with thee  i had written a great part of another long letter to try to soften thy flinty heart in her favor for i thought it but too likely that thou should succeed in getting her back again to the accursed womans but i find it would have been too late had i finished it and sent it away yet cannot i forbear writing to urge thee to make the only amends thou now can make her by a proper use of the license thou have obtained  poor poor lady it is a pain to me that i ever saw her such an adorer of virtue to be sacrificed to the vilest of her sex and thou their implement in the devils hands for a purpose so base so ungenerous so inhumane  pride thyself o cruellest of men in this reflection and that thy triumph over a lady who for thy sake was abandoned of every friend she had in the world was effected not by advantages taken of her weakness and credulity but by the blackest artifice after a long course of studied deceits had been tried to no purpose  i can tell thee it is well either for thee or for me that i am not the brother of the lady had i been her brother her violation must have been followed by the blood of one of us  excuse me lovelace and let not the lady fare the worse for my concern for her and yet i have but one other motive to ask thy excuse and that is because i owe to thy own communicative pen the knowledge i have of thy barbarous villainy since thou might if thou would have passed it upon me for a common seduction  clarissa lives thou say that she does is my wonder and these words show that thou thyself though thou could nevertheless proceed hardly expectedst she would have survived the outrage what must have been the poor ladys distress watchful as she had been over her honor when dreadful certainty took place of cruel apprehension  and yet a man may guess what it must have been by that which thou paintest when she suspected herself tricked deserted and betrayed by thy pretended aunt and cousin  that thou could behold her phrensy on this occasion and her halfspeechless halffainting prostration at thy feet and yet retain thy evil purposes will hardly be thought credible even by those who know thee if they have seen her  poor poor lady with such noble qualities as would have adorned the most exalted married life to fall into the hands of the only man in the world who could have treated her as thou have treated her  and to let loose the old dragon as thou properly call her upon the beforeaffrighted innocent what a barbarity was that what a poor piece of barbarity in order to obtain by terror what thou despairedst to do by love though supported by stratagems the most insidious  o lovelace lovelace had i doubted it before i should now be convinced that there must be a world after this to do justice to injured merit and to punish such a barbarous perfidy could the divine socrates and the divine clarissa otherwise have suffered  but let me if possible for one moment try to forget this villainous outrage on the most excellent of women  i have business here which will hold me yet a few days and then perhaps i shall quit this house for ever  i have had a solemn and tedious time of it i should never have known that i had half the respect i really find i had for the old gentleman had i not so closely at his earnest desire attended him and been a witness of the tortures he underwent  this melancholy occasion may possibly have contributed to humanize me but surely i never could have been so remorseless a caitiff as thou have been to a woman of half this ladys excellence  but prythee dear lovelace if you are a man and not a devil resolve out of hand to repair thy sin of ingratitude by conferring upon thyself the highest honor thou can receive in making her lawfully thine  but if thou can not prevail upon thyself to do her this justice i think i should not scruple a tilt with thee an everlasting rupture at least must follow if thou sacrificest her to the accursed women  thou art desirous to know what advantage i reap by my uncles demise i do not certainly know for i have not been so greedily sollicitous on this subject as some of the kindred have been who ought to have shown more decency as i have told them and suffered the corpse to have been cold before they had begun their hungry inquiries but by what i gathered from the poor mans talk to me who oftener than i wished touched upon the subject i deem it will be upwards of  000 l in cash and in the funds after all legacies paid besides the real estate which is a clear  00 l a year  i wish from my heart thou were a moneylover were the estate to be of double the value thou should have it every shilling only upon one condition for my circumstances before were as easy as i wish them to be while i am single  that thou would permit me the honor of being this fatherless ladys father as it is called at the altar  think of this my dear lovelace be honest and let me present thee with the brightest jewel that man ever possessed and then body and soul will thou bind to thee for ever thy  belford  letter xxviii mr lovelace to john belford esquire thursday june    let me alone you great dog you  let me alone  have i heard a lesser boy his coward arms held over his head and face say to a bigger who was pummeling him for having run away with his apple his orange or his gingerbread  so say i to thee on occasion of thy severity to thy poor friend who as thou ownest has furnished thee ungenerous as thou art with the weapons thou brandishest so fearfully against him  and to what purpose when the mischief is done when of consequence the affair is irretrievable and when a clarissa could not move me  well but after all i must own that there is something very singular in this ladys case and at times i cannot help regretting that i ever attempted her since not one power either of body or soul could be moved in my favor and since to use the expression of the philosopher on a much graver occasion there is no difference to be found between the skull of king philip and that of another man  but peoples extravagant notions of things alter not facts belford and when all is done mss clarissa harlowe has but run the fate of a thousand others of her sex  only that they did not set such a romantic value upon what they call their honor that is all  and yet i will allow thee this  that if a person sets a high value upon any thing be it ever such a trifle in itself or in the eye of others the robbing of that person of it is not a trifle to him take the matter in this light i own i have done wrong great wrong to this admirable creature  but have i not known twenty and twenty of the sex who have seemed to carry their notions of virtue high yet when brought to the test have abated of their severity and how should we be convinced that any of them are proof till they are tried  a thousand times have i said that i never yet met with such a woman as this if i had i hardly ever should have attempted miss clarissa harlowe hitherto she is all angel and was not that the point which at setting out i proposed to try vol iii p      and was not cohabitation ever my darling view and am i not now at last in the highroad to it  it is true that i have nothing to boast of as to her will the very contrary but now are we come to the test whether she cannot be brought to make the best of an irreparable evil  if she exclaim she has reason to exclaim and i will sit down with patience by the hour together to hear her exclamations till she is tired of them she will then descend to expostulation perhaps expostulation will give me hope expostulation will show that she hates me not and if she hate me not she will forgive and if she now forgive then will all be over and she will be mine upon my own terms and it shall then be the whole study of my future life to make her happy  so belford thou see that i have journeyed on to this stage indeed through infinite mazes and as infinite remorses with one determined point in view from the first to thy urgent supplication then that i will do her grateful justice by marriage let me answer in matt priors two lines on his hopedfor auditorship as put into the mouths of his st john and harley  let that be done which matt does say yea quoth the earl  but not today   thou see jack that i make no resolutions however against doing her one time or other the wished for justice even were i to succeed in my principal view cohabitation and of this i do assure thee that if i ever marry it must it shall be miss clarissa harlowe  nor is her honor at all impaired with me by what she has so far suffered but the contrary she must only take care that if she be at last brought to forgive me she show me that her lovelace is the only man on earth whom she could have forgiven on the like occasion  but ah jack what in the mean time shall i do with this admirable creature at present  i am loath to say it  but at present she is quite stupefied  i had rather methinks she should have retained all her active powers though i had suffered by her nails and her teeth than that she should be sunk into such a state of absolute  insensibility shall i call it as she has been in ever since tuesday morning yet as she begins a little to revive and nowandthen to call names and to exclaim i dread almost to engage with the anguish of a spirit that owes its extraordinary agitations to a niceness that has no example either in ancient or modern story for after all what is there in her case that should stupefy such a glowing such a blooming charmer  excess of grief excess of terror has made a persons hair stand on end and even as we have read changed the color of it but that it should so stupefy as to make a person at times insensible to those imaginary wrongs which would raise others from stupefaction is very surprising  but i will leave this subject lest it should make me too grave  i was yesterday at hamstead and discharged all obligations there with no small applause i told them that the lady was now as happy as myself and that is no great untruth for i am not altogether so when i allow myself to think  mrs townsend with her tars had not been then there i told them what i would have them say to her if she come  well but after all how many afteralls have i i could be very grave were i to give way to it  the devil take me for a fool what is the matter with me i wonder  i must breathe a fresher air for a few days  but what shall i do with this admirable creature the while  hang me if i know  for if i stir the venomous spider of this habitation will want to set upon the charming fly whose silken wings are already so entangled in my enormous web that she cannot move hand or foot for so much has grief stupefied her that she is at present as destitute of will as she always seemed of desire i must not therefore think of leaving her yet for two days together  letter xxix mr lovelace to john belford esquire i have just now had a specimen of what this dear creatures resentment will be when quite recovered an affecting one  for entering her apartment after dorcas and endeavoring to soothe and pacify her disordered mind in the midst of my blandishments she held up to heaven in a speechless agony the innocent license which she has in her own power as the poor distressed catalans held up their english treaty on an occasion that keeps the worst of my actions in countenance  she seemed about to call down vengeance upon me when happily the leaden god in pity to her trembling lovelace waved over her halfdrowned eyes his somniferous wand and laid asleep the fair exclaimer before she could go half through with her intended imprecation  thou will guess by what i have written that some little art has been made use of but it was with a generous design if thou wilt allow me the word on such an occasion in order to lessen the too quick sense she was likely to have of what she was to suffer a contrivance i never had occasion for before and had not thought of now if mrs sinclair had not proposed it to me to whom i left the management of it and i have done nothing but curse her ever since lest the quantity should have for ever damped her charming intellects  hence my concern  for i think the poor lady ought not to have been so treated poor lady did i say  what have i to do with thy creeping style  but have not i the worst of it since her insensibility has made me but a thief to my own joys  i did not intend to tell thee of this little innocent trick for such i designed it to be but that i hate disingenuity to thee especially and as i cannot help writing in a more serious vein than usual thou would perhaps had i not hinted the true cause have imagined that i was sorry for the fact itself and this would have given thee a good deal of trouble in scribbling dull persuasives to repair by matrimony and me in reading thy crude nonsense besides one day or other thou might had i not confessed it have heard of it in an aggravated manner and i know thou have such an high opinion of this ladys virtue that thou would be disappointed i thou had reason to think that she was subdued by her own consent or any the least yielding in her will and so is she beholden to me in some measure that at the expense of my honor she may so justly form a plea which will entirely salve hers  and now is the whole secret out  thou will say i am a horrid fellow  as the lady does that i am the unchained beelzebub and a plotting villain and as this is what you both said beforehand and nothing worse can be said i desire if thou would not have me quite serious with thee and that i should think thou meanest more by thy tiltinghint than i am willing to believe thou do that thou will forbear thy invectives for is not the thing done  can it be helped  and must i not now try to make the best of it  and the rather do i injoin thee this and inviolable secrecy because i begin to think that my punishment will be greater than the fault were it to be only from my own reflection  letter xxx mr lovelace to john belford esquire friday june    i am sorry to hear of thy misfortune but hope thou will not long lie by it thy servant tells me what a narrow escape thou had with thy neck i wish it may not be ominous but i think thou seem not to be in so enterprising a way as formerly and yet merry or sad thou see a rakes neck is always in danger if not from the hangman from his own horse but it is a vicious toad it seems and i think thou should never venture upon his back again for it is a plaguey thing for rider and horse both to be vicious  thy fellow tells me thou desire me to continue to write to thee to divert thy chagrin on thy forced confinement but how i can think it in my power to divert when my subject is not pleasing to myself  caesar never knew what it was to be hypd i will call it till he came to be what pompey was that is to say till he arrived at the height of his ambition nor did thy lovelace know what it was to be gloomy till he had completed his wishes upon the charmingst creature in the world as the other did his upon the most potent republic that ever existed  and yet why say i completed when the will the consent is wanting  and i have still views before me of obtaining that  yet i could almost join with thee in the wish which thou sendest me up by thy servant unfriendly as it is that i had had thy misfortune before monday night last for here the poor lady has run into a contrary extreme to that i told thee of in my last for now is she as much too lively as before she was too stupid and bating that she has pretty frequent lucid intervals would be deemed raving mad and i should be obliged to confine her  i am most confoundedly disturbed about it for i begin to fear that her intellects are irreparably hurt  who the devil could have expected such strange effects from a cause so common and so slight  but these high sould and highsensd girls who had set up for shining lights and examples to the rest of the sex i now see that such there are are with such difficulty brought down to the common standard that a wise man who prefers his peace of mind to his glory in subduing one of that exalted class would have nothing to say to them  i do all in my power to quiet her spirits when i force myself into her presence  i go on begging pardon one minute and vowing truth and honor another  i would at first have persuaded her and offered to call witnesses to the truth of it that we were actually married though the license was in her hands i thought the assertion might go down in her disorder and charming consequences i hoped would follow but this would not do   i therefore gave up that hope and now i declare to her that it is my resolution to marry her the moment her uncle harlowe informs me that he will grace the ceremony with his presence  but she believes nothing i say nor whether in her senses or not bears me with patience in her sight  i pity her with all my soul and i curse myself when she is in her wailing fits and when i apprehend that intellects so charming as hers are for ever damped  but more i curse these women who put me upon such an expedient  lord lord what a hand have i made of it  and all for what  last night for the first time since monday last she got to her pen and ink but she pursues her writing with such eagerness and hurry as show too evidently her discomposure  i hope however that this employment will help to calm her spirits  just now dorcas tells me that what she writes she tears and throws the paper in fragments under the table either as not knowing what she does or disliking it then gets up wrings her hands weeps and shifts her seat all round the room then returns to her table sits down and writes again  one odd letter as i may call it dorcas has this moment given me from her  carry this said she to the vilest of men dorcas a toad brought it without any further direction to me  i sat down intending though it is pretty long to give thee a copy of it but for my life i cannot it is so extravagant and the original is too much an original to let it go out of my hands  but some of the scraps and fragments as either torn through or flung aside i will copy for the novelty of the thing and to show thee how her mind works now she is in this whimsical way yet i know i am still furnishing thee with new weapons against myself but spare thy comments my own reflections render them needless dorcas thinks her lady will ask for them so wishes to have them to lay again under her table  by the first thou wilt guess that i have told her that miss how is very ill and cannot write that she may account the better for not having received the letter designed for her  paper i torn in two pieces my dearest miss how o what dreadful dreadful things have i to tell you  but yet i cannot tell you neither but say are you really ill as a vile vile creature informs me you are  but he never yet told me truth and i hope has not in this and yet if it were not true surely i should have heard from you before now  but what have i to do to upbraid  you may well be tired of me  and if you are i can forgive you for i am tired of myself and all my own relations were tired of me long before you were  how good you have always been to me mine own dear anna how  but how i ramble  i sat down to say a great deal  my heart was full  i did not know what to say first  and thought and grief and confusion and o my poor head i cannot tell what  and thought and grief and confusion came crouding so thick upon me one would be first another would be first all would be first so i can write nothing at all  only that whatever they have done to me i cannot tell but i am no longer what i was in any one thing  in any one thing did i say yes but i am for i am still and i ever will be  your true   plague on it i can write no more of this eloquent nonsense myself which rather shows a raised than a quenched imagination but dorcas shall transcribe the others in separate papers as written by the whimsical charmer and some time hence when all is over and i can better bear to read them i may ask thee for a sight of them preserve them therefore for we often look back with pleasure even upon the heaviest griefs when the cause of them is removed  paper ii scratched through and thrown under the table  and can you my dear honored papa resolve for ever to reprobate your poor child  but i am sure you would not if you knew what she has suffered since her unhappy  and will nobody plead for your poor suffering girl  no one good body  why then dearest sir let it be an act of your own innate goodness which i have so much experienced and so much abused  i dont presume to think you should receive me  no indeed  my name is  i dont know what my name is  i never dare to wish to come into your family again  but your heavy curse my papa  yes i will call you papa and help yourself as you can  for you are my own dear papa whether you will or not  and though i am an unworthy child  yet i am your child   paper iii a lady took a great fancy to a young lion or a bear i forget which  but a bear or a tiger i believe it was it was made her a present of when a whelp she fed it with her own hand she nursed up the wicked cub with great tenderness and would play with it without fear or apprehension of danger and it was obedient to all her commands and its tameness as she used to boast increased with its growth so that like a lapdog it would follow her all over the house but mind what followed at last somehow neglecting to satisfy its hungry maw or having otherwise disobliged it on some occasion it resumed its nature and on a sudden fell upon her and tore her in pieces  and who was most to blame i pray the brute or the lady the lady surely  for what she did was out of nature out of character at least what it did was in its own nature  paper iv how art thou now humbled in the dust thou proud clarissa harlowe thou that never steppedst out of thy fathers house but to be admired who were wont to turn thine eye sparkling with healthful life and selfassurance to different objects at once as thou passedst as if for so thy penetrating sister used to say to plume thyself upon the expected applauses of all that beheld thee thou that usedst to go to rest satisfied with the adulations paid thee in the past day and could put off every thing but thy vanity   paper v rejoice not now my bella my sister my friend but pity the humbled creature whose foolish heart you used to say you beheld through the thin veil of humility which covered it  it must have been so my fall had not else been permitted   you penetrated my proud heart with the jealousy of an elder sisters searching eye  you knew me better than i knew myself  hence your upbraidings and your chidings when i began to totter  but forgive now those vain triumphs of my heart  i thought poor proud wretch that i was that what you said was owing to your envy  i thought i could acquit my intention of any such vanity  i was too secure in the knowledge i thought i had of my own heart  my supposed advantages became a snare to me  and what now is the end of all   paper vi what now is become of the prospects of a happy life which once i thought opening before me  who now shall assist in the solemn preparations who now shall provide the nuptial ornaments which soften and divert the apprehensions of the fearful virgin no court now to be paid to my smiles no encouraging compliments to inspire thee with hope of laying a mind not unworthy of thee under obligation no elevation now for conscious merit and applauded purity to look down from on a prostrate adorer and an admiring world and up to pleased and rejoicing parents and relations  paper vii thou pernicious caterpillar that preyest upon the fair leaf of virgin fame and poisonest those leaves which thou can not devour  thou fell blight thou eastern blast thou overspreading mildew that destroyest the early promises of the shining year that mockest the laborious toil and blastest the joyful hopes of the painful husbandman  thou fretting moth that corruptest the fairest garment  thou eating cankerworm that preyest upon the opening bud and turnest the damask rose into livid yellowness  if as religion teaches us god will judge us in a great measure by our benevolent or evil actions to one another  o wretch bethink thee in time bethink thee how great must be thy condemnation  paper viii at first i saw something in your air and person that displeased me not your birth and fortunes were no small advantages to you  you acted not ignobly by my passionate brother everybody said you were brave everybody said you were generous a brave man i thought could not be a base man a generous man could not i believed be ungenerous where he acknowleged obligation thus prepossessed all the rest that my soul loved and wished for in your reformation i hoped  i knew not but by report any flagrant instances of your vileness you seemed frank as well as generous frankness and generosity ever attracted me whoever kept up those appearances i judged of their hearts by my own and whatever qualities i wished to find in them i was ready to find and when found i believed them to be natives of the soil  my fortunes my rank my character i thought a further security i was in none of those respects unworthy of being the niece of lord m and of his two noble sisters  your vows your imprecations  but oh you have barbarously and basely conspired against that honor which you ought to have protected and now you have made me  what is it of vile that you have not made me   yet god knows my heart i had no culpable inclinations  i honored virtue  i hated vice  but i knew not that you were vice itself  paper ix had the happiness of any the poorest outcast in the world whom i had never seen never known never before heard of lain as much in my power as my happiness did in yours my benevolent heart would have made me fly to the succor of such a poor distressed  with what pleasure would i have raised the dejected head and comforted the desponding heart  but who now shall pity the poor wretch who has increased instead of diminished the number of the miserable  paper x lead me where my own thoughts themselves may lose me where i may doze out what i have left of life forget myself and that days guilt  cruel remembrance  how shall i appease thee  oh you have done an act that blots the face and blush of modesty takes off the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love and makes a blister there  then down i laid my head down on cold earth and for a while was dead and my freed soul to a strange somewhere fled ah sottish soul said i when back to its cage again i saw it fly fool to resume her broken chain and row the galley here again fool to that body to return where it condemned and destined is to mourn o my miss how if thou have friendship help me and speak the words of peace to my divided soul that wars within me and raises every sense to my confusion i am tottering on the brink of peace and thou art all the hold i have left assist me in the pangs of my affliction when honors lost it is a relief to die deaths but a sure retreat from infamy then farewell youth and all the joys that dwell with youth and life and life itself farewell for life can never be sincerely blessed heaven punishes the bad and proves the best death only can be dreadful to the bad to innocence it is like a bugbear dressed to frighten children pull but off the mask and he will appear a friend i could a tale unfold  would harrow up thy soul  by swift misfortunes how am i pursued which on each other are like waves renewed after all belford i have just skimmd over these transcriptions of dorcas and i see there is method and good sense in some of them wild as others of them are and that her memory which serves her so well for these poetical flights is far from being impaired and this gives me hope that she will soon recover her charming intellects  though i shall be the sufferer by their restoration i make no doubt  but in the letter she wrote to me there are yet greater extravagancies and though i said it was too affecting to give thee a copy of it yet after i have let thee see the loose papers enclosed i think i may throw in a transcription of that dorcas therefore shall here transcribe it i cannot the reading of it affected me ten times more than the severest reproaches of a regular mind  to mr lovelace i never intended to write another line to you i would not see you if i could help it o that i never had  but tell me of a truth is miss how really and truly ill  very ill  and is not her illness poison and dont you know who gave it her  what you or mrs sinclair or somebody i cannot tell who have done to my poor head you best know but i shall never be what i was my head is gone i have wept away all my brain i believe for i can weep no more indeed i have had my full share so it is no matter  but good now lovelace dont set mrs sinclair upon me again i never did her any harm she so affrights me when i see her  ever since  when was it i cannot tell you can i suppose she may be a good woman as far as i know she was the wife of a man of honor  very likely  though forced to let lodgings for her livelihood poor gentlewoman let her know i pity her but dont let her come near me again  pray dont  yet she may be a very good woman   what would i say  i forget what i was going to say  o lovelace you are satan himself or he helps you out in every thing and that is as bad  but have you really and truly sold yourself to him and for how long what duration is your reign to have  poor man the contract will be out and then what will be your fate  oh lovelace if you could be sorry for yourself i would be sorry too  but when all my doors are fast and nothing but the keyhole open and the key of late put into that to be where you are in a manner without opening any of them  o wretched wretched clarissa harlowe  for i never will be lovelace  let my uncle take it as he pleases  well but now i remember what i was going to say  it is for your good  not mine  for nothing can do me good now  o thou villainous man thou hated lovelace  but mrs sinclair may be a good woman  if you love me  but that you dont  but dont let her bluster up with her worse than mannish airs to me again o she is a frightful woman if she be a woman  she needed not to put on that fearful mask to scare me out of my poor wits but dont tell her what i say  i have no hatred to her  it is only fright and foolish fear that is all  she may not be a bad woman  but neither are all men any more than all women alike  god forbid they should be like you  alas you have killed my head among you  i dont say who did it  god forgive you all  but had it not been better to have put me out of all your ways at once you might safely have done it for nobody would require me at your hands  no not a soul  except indeed miss how would have said when she should see you what lovelace have you done with clarissa harlowe  and then you could have given any slight gay answer  sent her beyond sea or she has run away from me as she did from her parents and this would have been easily credited for you know lovelace she that could run away from them might very well run away from you  but this is nothing to what i wanted to say now i have it  i have lost it again  this foolish wench comes teazing me  for what purpose should i eat for what end should i wish to live  i tell thee dorcas i will neither eat nor drink i cannot be worse than i am  i will do as you would have me  good dorcas look not upon me so fiercely  but thou can not look so bad as i have seen somebody look  mr lovelace now that i remember what i took pen in hand to say let me hurry off my thoughts left i lose them again  here i am sensible  and yet i am hardly sensible neither  but i know my head is not as it should be for all that  therefore let me propose one thing to you it is for your good  not mine and this is it  i must needs be both a trouble and an expense to you and here my uncle harlowe when he knows how i am will never wish any man to have me no not even you who have been the occasion of it  barbarous and ungrateful  a less complicated villainy cost a tarquin  but i forget what i would say again   then this is it i never shall be myself again i have been a very wicked creature  a vain proud poor creature  full of secret pride  which i carried off under an humble guise and deceived everybody  my sister says so  and now i am punished  so let me be carried out of this house and out of your sight and let me be put into that bedlam privately which once i saw but it was a sad sight to me then little as i thought what i should come to myself  that is all i would say this is all i have to wish for  then i shall be out of all your ways and i shall be taken care of and bread and water without your tormentings will be dainties and my straw bed the easiest i have lain in  for  i cannot tell how long   my clothes will sell for what will keep me there perhaps as long as i shall live but lovelace dear lovelace i will call you for you have cost me enough i am sure  dont let me be made a show of for my familys sake nay for your own sake dont do that  for when i know all i have suffered which yet i do no and no matter if i never do  i may be apt to rave again you by name and tell of all your baseness to a poo humbled creature that once was as proud as anybody  but of what i cannot tell  except of my own folly and vanity  but let that pass  since i am punished enough for it   so suppose instead of bedlam it were a private madhouse where nobody comes  that will be better a great deal  but another thing lovelace dont let them use me cruelly when i am there  you have used me cruelly enough you know dont let them use me cruelly for i will be very tractable and do as anybody would have me do  except what you would have me do  for that i never will  another thing lovelace dont let this good woman i was going to say vile woman but dont tell her that  because she will not let you send me to this happy refuge perhaps if she were to know it   another thing lovelace and let me have pen and ink and paper allowed me  it will be all my amusement  but they need not send to anybody i shall write to what i write because it will but trouble them and somebody may do you a mischief maybe  i wish not that anybody do anybody a mischief upon my account  you tell me that lady betty lawrance and your cousin montague were here to take leave of me but that i was asleep and could not be waked so you told me at first i was married you know and that you were my husband  ah lovelace look to what you say  but let not them for they will sport with my misery let not that lady betty let not that miss montague whatever the real ones may do nor mrs sinclair neither nor any of her lodgers nor her nieces come to see me in my place  real ones i say for lovelace i shall find out all your villainies in time  indeed i shall  so put me there as soon as you can  it is for your good  then all will pass for ravings that i can say as i doubt not many poor creatures exclamations do pass though there may be too much truth in them for all that  and you know i began to be mad at hamstead  so you said  ah villainous man what have you not to answer for  a little interval seems to be lent me i had begun to look over what i have written it is not fit for any one to see so far as i have been able to reperuse it but my head will not hold i doubt to go through it all if therefore i have not already mentioned my earnest desire let me tell you it is this that i be sent out of this abominable house without delay and locked up in some private madhouse about this town for such it seems there are never more to be seen or to be produced to anybody except in your own vindication if you should be charged with the murder of my person a much lighter crime than that of my honor which the greatest villain on earth has robbed me of and deny me not this my last request i beseech you and one other and that is never to let me see you more this surely may be granted to  the miserably abused clarissa harlowe   i will not hear thy heavy preachments upon this plaguey letter so not a word of that sort the paper thou wilt see is blisterd with the tears even of the hardened transcriber which has made her ink run hereandthere  mrs sinclair is a true heroine and i think shames us all and she is a woman too thou wilt say the best things corrupted become the worst but this is certain that whatever the sex set their hearts upon they make thorough work of it and hence it is that a mischief which would end in simple robbery among menrogues becomes murder if a woman be in it  i know thou will blame me for having had recourse to art but do not physicians prescribe opiates in acute cases where the violence of the disorder would be apt to throw the patient into a fever or delirium i averr that my motive for this expedient was mercy nor could it be any thing else for a rape thou know to us rakes is far from being an undesirable thing nothing but the law stands in our way upon that account and the opinion of what a modest woman will suffer rather than become a viva voce accuser lessens much an honest fellows apprehensions on that score then if these somnivolences i hate the word opiates on this occasion have turned her head that is an effect they frequently have upon some constitutions and in this case was rather the fault of the dose than the design of the giver  but is not wine itself an opiate in degree  how many women have been taken advantage of by wine and other still more intoxicating viands  let me tell thee jack that the experience of many of the passive sex and the consciences of many more of the active appealed to will testify that thy lovelace is not the worst of villains nor would i have thee put me upon clearing myself by comparisons  if she escape a settled delirium when my plots unravel i think it is all i ought to be concerned about what therefore i desire of thee is that if two constructions may be made of my actions thou will afford me the most favorable for this not only friendship but my own ingenuity which has furnished thee with the knowledge of the facts against which thou art so ready to inveigh require of thee  will is just returned from an errand to hamstead and acquaints me that mrs townsend was yesterday at mrs moores accompanied by three or four rough fellows she was strangely surprised at the news that my spouse and i are entirely reconciled and that two fine ladies my relations came to visit her and went to town with her where she is very happy with me she was sure we were not married she said unless it was while we were at hamstead and they were sure the ceremony was not performed there but that the lady is happy and easy is unquestionable and a fling was thrown out by mrs moore and mrs bevis at mischiefmakers as they knew mrs townsend to be acquainted with miss how  now since my fairone can neither receive nor send away letters i am pretty easy as to this mrs townsend and her employer and i fancy miss how will be puzzled to know what to think of the matter and afraid of sending by wilsons conveyance and perhaps suppose that her friend slights her or has changed her mind in my favor and is ashamed to own it as she has not had an answer to what she wrote and will believe that the rustic dlivered her last letter into her own hand  mean time i have a little project come into my head of a new kind just for amusementsake that is all variety has irresistible charms i cannot live without intrigue my charmer has no passions that is to say none of the passions that i want her to have she engages all my reverence i am at present more inclined to regret what i have done than to proceed to new offenses and shall regret it till i see how she takes it when recovered  shall i tell thee my project it is not a high one  it is this  to get hither mrs moore miss rawlins and my widow bevis for they are desirous to make a visit to my spouse now we are so happy together and if i can order it right belton mowbay tourville and i will show them a little more of the ways of this wicked town than they at present know why should they be acquainted with a man of my character and not be the better and wiser for it  i would have everybody rail against rakes with judgment and knowledge if they will rail two of these women gave me a great deal of trouble and the third i am confident will forgive a merry evening  i am really sick at heart for a frolic and have no doubt but this will be an agreeable one these women already think me a wild fellow nor do they like me the less for it as i can perceive and i shall take care that they shall be treated with so much freedom before one anothers faces that in policy they shall keep each others counsel and will not this be doing a kind thing by them since it will knit an indissoluble band of union and friendship between three women who are neighbors and at present have only common obligations to one another for thou want not to be told that secrets of love and secrets of this nature are generally the strongest cement of female friendships  but after all if my beloved should be happily restored to her intellects we may have scenes arise between us that will be sufficiently busy to employ all the faculties of thy friend without looking out for new occasions already as i have often observed has she been the means of saving scores yet without her own knowledge  sat night by dorcass account of her ladys behavior the dear creature seems to be recovering i shall give the earliest notice of this to the worthy captain tomlinson that he may apprise uncle john of it i must be properly enabled from that quarter to pacify her or at least to rebate her first violence  letter xxxi mr lovelace to john belford esquire sunday afternoon   oclock june    i went out early this morning and returned not till just now when i was informed that my beloved in my absence had taken it into her head to attempt to get away  she trippd down with a parcel tied up in a handkerchief her hood on and was actually in the entry when mrs sinclair saw her  pray madam whipping between her and the streetdoor be pleased to let me know whither you are going  who has a right to control me was the word  i have madam by order of your spouse and kemboing her arms as she owned i desire you will be pleased to walk up again  she would have spoken but could not and bursting into tears turned back and went up to her chamber and dorcas was taken to task for suffering her to be in the passage before she was seen  this shows as we hoped last night that she is recovering her charming intellects  dorcas says she was visible to her but once before the whole day and then seemed very solemn and sedate  i will endeavor to see her it must be in her own chamber i suppose for she will hardly meet me in the dining room what advantage will the confidence of our sex give me over the modesty of hers if she be recoverd  i the most confident of men she the most delicate of women sweet soul methinks i have have her before me her face averted speech lost in sighs  abashed  conscious  what a triumphant aspect will this give me when i gaze in her downcast countenance  this moment dorcas tells me she believes she is coming to find me out she asked her after me and dorcas left her drying her redswoln eyes at her glass no design of moving me by her tears sighing too sensibly for my courage but to what purpose have i gone thus far if i pursue not my principal end  niceness must be a little abated she knows the worst that she cannot fly me that she must see me and that i can look her into a sweet confusion are circumstances greatly in my favor what can she do but rave and exclaim i am used to raving and exclaiming  but if recovered i shall see how she behaves upon this our first sensible interview after what she has suffered  here she comes   letter xxxii mr lovelace to john belford esquire sunday night never blame me for giving way to have art used with this admirable creature all the princes of the air or beneath it joining with me could never have subdued her while she had her senses  i will not anticipate  only to tell thee that i am too much awakened by her to think of sleep were i to go to bed and so shall have nothing to do but to write an account of our odd conversation while it is so strong upon my mind that i can think of nothing else  she was dressed in a white damask nightgown with less negligence than for some days past i was sitting with my pen in my fingers and stood up when i first saw her with great complaisance as if the day were still her own and so indeed it is  she entered with such dignity in her manner as struck me with great awe and prepared me for the poor figure i made in the subsequent conversation a poor figure indeed  but i will do her justice  she came up with quick steps pretty close to me a white handkerchief in her hand her eyes neither fierce nor mild but very earnest and a fixed sedateness in her whole aspect which seemed to be the effect of deep contemplation and thus she accosted me with an air and action that i never saw equaled  you see before you sir the wretch whose preference of you to all your sex you have rewarded  as it indeed deserved to be rewarded my fathers dreadful curse has already operated upon me in the very letter of it as to this life and it seems to me too evident that it will not be your fault that it is not entirely completed in the loss of my soul as well as of my honor  which you villainous man have robbed me of with a baseness so unnatural so inhuman that it seems you even you had not the heart to attempt it till my senses were made the previous sacrifice  here i made an hesitating effort to speak laying down my pen  but she proceeded  hear me out guilty wretch  abandoned man  man did i say  yet what name else can i since the mortal worryings of the fiercest beast would have been more natural and infinitely more welcome than what you have acted by me and that with a premeditation and contrivance worthy only of that single heart which now base as well as ungrateful as thou art seems to quake within thee  and well may thou quake well may thou tremble and falter and hesitate as thou do when thou reflectest upon what i have suffered for thy sake and the returns thou have made me  by my soul belford my whole frame was shaken for not only her looks and her action but her voice so solemn was inexpressibly affecting and then my cursed guilt and her innocence and merit and rank and superiority of talents all stared me at that instant in the face so formidably that my present account to which she unexpectedly called me seemed as i then thought to resemble that general one to which we are told we shall be summoned when our conscience shall be our accuser  but she had had time to collect all the powers of her eloquence the whole day probably in her intellects and then i was the more disappointed as i had thought i could have gazed the dear creature into confusion  but it is plain that the sense she has of her wrongs sets this matchless woman above all lesser all weaker considerations  my dear  my love  i  i  i never  no never  lips trembling limbs quaking voice inward hesitating broken  never surely did miscreant look so like a miscreant while thus she proceeded waving her snowy hand with all the graces of moving oratory  i have no pride in the confusion visible in thy whole person i have been all the day praying for a composure if i could not escape from this vile house that should once more enable me to look up to my destroyer with the consciousness of an innocent sufferer  thou see me since my wrongs are beyond the power of words to express thou see me calm enough to wish that thou may continue harassed by the workings of thy own conscience till effectual repentance take hold of thee that so thou may not forfeit all title to that mercy which thou have not shown to the poor creature now before thee who had so well deserved to meet with a faithful friend where she met with the worst of enemies  but tell me for no doubt thou have some scheme to pursue tell me since i am a prisoner as i find in the vilest of houses and have not a friend to protect or save me what thou intendest shall become of the remnant of a life not worth the keeping tell me if yet there are more evils reserved for me and whether thou have entered into a compact with the grand deceiver in the person of his horrid agent in this house and if the ruin of my soul that my fathers curse may be fulfilled is to complete the triumphs of so vile a confederacy  answer me  say if thou have courage to speak out to her whom thou have ruined tell me what further i am to suffer from thy barbarity  she stopped here and sighing turned her sweet face from me drying up with her handkerchief those tears which she endeavored to restrain and when she could not to conceal from my sight  as i told thee i had prepared myself for high passions raving flying tearing execration these transient violences the workings of sudden grief and shame and vengeance would have set us upon a par with each other and quitted scores these have i been accustomed to and as nothing violent is lasting with these i could have wished to encounter but such a majestic composure  seeking me  whom yet it is plain by her attempt to get away she would have avoided seeing  no lucretialike vengeance upon herself in her thought  yet swallowed up her whole mind swallowed up as i may say by a grief so heavy as in her own words to be beyond the power of speech to express  and to be able discomposed as she was to the very morning to put such a homequestion to me as if she had penetrated my future view  how could i avoid looking like a fool and answering as before in broken sentences and confusion  what  whata  what  has been done  i i i  cannot but say  must own  must confess  hem  hem  is not right  is not what should have been  buta  but  but  i am truly  truly  sorry for it  upon my soul i am  and  and  will do all  do every thing  do what  whatever is incumbent upon me  all that you  that you  that you shall require to make you amends   o belford belford whose the triumph now  hers or mine  amends o thou truly despicable wretch  then lifting up her eyes  good heaven who shall pity the creature who could fall by so base a mind  yet  and then she looked indignantly upon me  yet i hate thee not base and lowsould as thou art half so much as i hate myself that i saw thee not sooner in thy proper colors  that i hoped either morality gratitude or humanity from a libertine who to be a libertine must have got over and defied all moral sanctions her cousin mordens words to her in his letter from florence see vol iii p       she then called upon her cousin mordens name as if he had warned her against a man of free principles and walked toward the window her handkerchief at her eyes but turning short toward me with an air of mingled scorn and majesty   what at the moment would i have given never to have injured her what amends have thou to propose  what amends can such a one as thou make to a person of spirit or common sense for the evils thou have so inhumanly made me suffer  as soon madam  as soon  as  as soon as your uncle  or  not waiting   thou would tell me i suppose  i know what thou would tell me  but think thou that marriage will satisfy for a guilt like thine destitute as thou have made me both of friends and fortune i too much despise the wretch who could rob himself of his wifes virtue to endure the thoughts of thee in the light thou seem to hope i will accept thee in   i hesitated an interruption but my meaning died away upon my trembling lips i could only pronounce the word marriage  and thus she proceeded  let me therefore know whether i am to be controuled in the future disposal of myself whether in a country of liberty as this where the sovereign of it must not be guilty of your wickedness and where you neither durst have attempted it had i one friend or relation to look upon me i am to be kept here a prisoner to sustain fresh injuries whether in a word you intend to hinder me from going whither my destiny shall lead me  after a pause for i was still silent  can you not answer me this plain question  i quit all claim all expectation upon you  what right have you to detain me here  i could not speak what could i say to such a question  o wretch wringing her uplifted hands had i not been robbed of my senses and that in the basest manner  you best know how  had i been able to account for myself and your proceedings or to have known but how the days passed a whole week should not have gone over my head as i find it has done before i had told you what i now tell you  that the man who has been the villain to me you have been shall never make me his wife  i will write to my uncle to lay aside his kind intentions in my favor  all my prospects are shut in  i give myself up for a lost creature as to this world  hinder me not from entering upon a life of severe penitence for corresponding after prohibition with a wretch who has too well justified all their warnings and inveteracy and for throwing myself into the power of your vile artifices  let me try to secure the only hope i have left  this is all the amends i ask of you i repea therefore am i now at liberty to dispose of myse as i please  now comes the fool the miscreant again hestating his broken answer my dearest love i am confounded quite confounded at the thought o what  of what has been done and at the thoug of  to whom i see i see there is no withstaning your eloquence  such irresistible proofs of t love of virtue for its own sake  did i never hear o nor meet with in all my reading and if you can fogive a repentant villain that thus on his knees iplores your forgiveness then down i dropped absolutely in earnest in all i said i vow by all that is sacred and just and a may a thunderbolt strike me dead at your feet if i am not sincere that i will by marriage before tomorrownoon without waiting for your uncle or anybody do you all the justice i now can do you and you shall ever after control and direct me as you please till you have made me more worthy of your angelic purity than now i am nor will i presume so much as to touch your garment till i have the honor to call so great a blessing lawfully mine  o thou guileful betrayer there is a just god whom thou invokest yet the thunderbolt descends not and thou live to imprecate and deceive  my dearest life rising for i hoped she was relenting   had thou not sinned beyond the possibility of forgiveness interrupted she and had this been the first time that thus thou solemnly promisest and invokest the vengeance thou have as often defied the desperateness of my condition might have induced me to think of taking a wretched chance with a man so profligate but after what i have suffered by thee it would be criminal in me to wish to bind my soul in covenant to a man so nearly allied to perdition  good god  how uncharitable  i offer not to defend  would to heaven that i could recall  so early allied to perdition madam  so profligate a man madam   o how short is expression of thy crimes and my fferings  such premeditation in thy baseness  o prostitute the characters of persons of honor of y own family  and all to delude a poor creature whom thou ought  but why talk i to thee  be y crimes upon thy head  once more i ask thee m i or am i not at my own liberty now  i offered to speak in defense of the women declaring that they really were the very persons   presume not interrupted she base as thou art to say one word in thine own vindication on this head i have been contemplating their behavior their conversation their overready acquiescencies to my declarations in thy disfavour their free yet affectedly reserved light manners and now that the sad event has opened my eyes and i have compared facts and passages together in the little interval that has been lent me i wonder i could not distinguish the behavior of the unmatronlike jilt whom thou broughtest to betray me from the worthy lady whom thou have the honor to call thy aunt and that i could not detect the superficial creature whom thou passedst upon me for the virtuous miss montague  amazing uncharitableness in a lady so good herself  that the high spirits those ladies were in to see you should subject them to such censures  i do most solemnly vow madam   that they were interrupting me verily and indeed lady betty lawrance and thy cousin montague  o wretch i see by thy solemn averrment  i had not yet averred it what credit ought to be given to all the rest had i no other proof   interrupting her i besought her patient ear i had found myself i told her almost a vowedly despised and hated i had no hope of gaining he love or her confidence the letter she had left behind her on her removal to hamstead sufficiently convinced me that she was entirely under miss howes influence and waited but the return of a letter from her to enter upon measures that would deprive me of her for ever miss how had ever been my nemy more so then no doubt from the contents of the letter she had written to her on her first coming to hamstead that i dared not to stand the event of such a letter and was glad of an opportunity by lady bettys and my cousins means though they knew not my motive to get her back to town far at the time from intending the outrage which my despair and her want of confidence in me put me so vilely upon   i would have proceeded and particularly would have said something of captain tomlinson and her uncle but she would not hear me further and indeed it was with visible indignation and not without several angry interruptions that she heard me say so much  would i dare she asked me to offer at a palliation of my baseness  the two women she was convinced were impostors  she knew not but captain tomlinson and mr mennell were so too but whether they were so or not i was and she insisted upon being at her own disposal for the remainder of her short life  for indeed she abhorred me in every light and more particularly in that in which i offered myself to her acceptance  and saying this she flung from me leaving me absolutely shocked and confounded at her part of a conversation which she began with such uncommon however severe composure and concluded with so much sincere and unaffected indignation  and now jack i must address one serious paragraph particularly to thee  i have not yet touched upon cohabitation  her uncles mediation she does not absolutely discredit as i had the pleasure to find by one hint in this conversation  yet she suspects my future views and has doubts about mennell and tomlinson  i do say if she come fairly at her lights at her clues or what shall i call them her penetration is wonderful  but if she do not come at them fairly then is her incredulity then is her antipathy to me evidently accounted for  i will speak out  thou could not surely play me booty jack  surely thou could not let thy weak pity for her lead thee to an unpardonable breach of trust to thy friend who has been so unreserved in his communications to thee  i cannot believe thee capable of such a baseness satisfy me however upon this head i must make a cursed figure in her eye vowing and protesting as i shall not scruple occasionally to vow and protest if all the time she has had unquestionable informations of my perfidy  i know thou as little fear me as i do thee in any point of manhood and wilt scorn to deny it if thou have done it when thus home pressed  and here i have a good mind to stop and write no farther till i have thy answer  and so i will  monday morn past three  letter xxxiii mr lovelace to john belford esquire monday morn   oclock june    i must write on nothing else can divert m and i think thou can not have been a dog to me  i would fain have closed my eyes but sleep  me well says horace as translated by cowley  the halcyon sleep will never build his nest in any stormy breast it is not enough that he does find clouds and darkness in the mind darkness but half his work will do it is not enough he must find quiet too now indeed do i from my heart wish that i h never known this lady but who would have thoug there had been such a woman in the world of  the sex i have hitherto known or heard or read  it was once subdued and always subdued the first struggle was generally the last or at least the subsequent struggles were so much fainter and fainter that a man would rather have them than be without them but how know i yet   it is now near six  the sun has been illuminating for several hours every thing about me for that impartial orb shines upon mother sinclairs house as well as upon any other but nothing within me can it illuminate  at daydawn i looked through the keyhole of my beloveds door she had declared she would not put off her clothes any more in this house there i beheld her in a sweet slumber which i hope will prove refreshing to her disturbed senses sitting in her elbowchair her apron over her head and that supported by one sweet hand the other hanging down upon her side in a sleepy lifelessness half of one pretty foot only visible  see the difference in our cases thought i she the charming injured can sweetly sleep while the varlet injurer cannot close his eyes and has been trying to no purpose the whole night to divert his melancholy and to fly from himself  as every vice generally brings on its own punishment even in this life if any thing were to tempt me to doubt of future punishment it would be that there can hardly be a greater than that which i at this instant experience in my own remorse  i hope it will go off  if not well will the dear creature be avenged for i shall be the most miserable or men  six of clock just now dorcas tells me that her lady is preparing openly and without disguise to be gone very probable the humor she flew away from me in last night has given me expectation of such an enterprise  now jack to be thus hated and despised  and if i have sinned beyond forgiveness   but she has sent me a message by dorcas that she will meet me in the dining room and desires odd enough that the wench may be present at the conversation that shall pass between us this message gives me hope  nine of clock confounded art cunning villainy  by my soul she had like to have slipped through my fingers she meant nothing by her message but to get dorcas out of the way and a clear coast is a fancied distress sufficient to justify this lady for dispensing with her principles does she not show me that she can wilfully deceive as well as i  had she been in the forehouse and no passage t go through to get at the streetdoor she had certainly been gone but her haste betrayed her for sally martin happening to be in the foreparlour and hearing a swifter motion than usual and a rustling  silks as if from somebody in a hurry looked out and seeing who it was stepped between her and the door and set her back against it  you must not go madam indeed you must not  by what right  and how dare you  and suc like imperious airs the dear creature gave herself while sally called out for her aunt and half a doze voices joined instantly in the cry for me to haste down to hasten down in a moment  i was gravely instructing dorcas abovestairs a wondering what would be the subject of the coversation which she was to be a witness to when the outcries reached my ears and down i flew  a there was the charming creature the sweet deceive panting for breath her back against the partition parcel in her hand women make no excursions without their parcels sally polly but polly obligingly pleading for her the mother mabell and peter the footman of the house about her all however keeping their distance the mother and sally between her and the door  in her soft rage the dear soul repeating i will go  nobody has a right  i will go  if you kill me women i will not go up again  as soon as she saw me she stepped a pace or two toward me mr lovelace i will go said she  do you authorize these women  what right have they or you either to stop me  is this my dear preparative to the conversation you led me to expect in the dining room and do you think i can part with you thus  do you think i will  and am i sir to be thus beset  surrounded thus  what have these women to do with me  i desired them to leave us all but dorcas who was down as soon as i i then thought it right to assume an air of resolution having found my tameness so greatly triumphed over and now my dear said i urging her reluctant feet be pleased to walk into the foreparlour here since you will not go up stairs  here we may hold our parley and dorcas e witness to it  and now madam seating her and sticking my hands in my sides your pleasure  insolent villain said the furious lady and rising an to the window and threw up the sash she knew ot i suppose that there were iron rails before the indows and when she found she could not get ut into the street clasping her uplifted hands together  having dropped her parcel  for the love of god ood honest man  for the love of god mistress   two passersby  a poor poor creature said she hind   i clasped her in my arms people beginning to gather  out the window and then she cried out murder help help  and carried her up to the dining room in spite of her little plotting heart as i may now cal it although she violently struggled catching hold of the banisters here and there as she could i would have seated her there but she sunk down halfmotionless pale as ashes and a violent burst of tears happly relieved her  dorcas wept over her the wench was actually moved for her  violent hysterics succeeded i left her to mabell dorcas and polly the latter the most supportable to her of the sisterhood  this attempt so resolutely made alarmed me not a little  mrs sinclair and her nymphs are much more concerned because of the reputation of their house as they call it having received some insults broken windows threatened to make them produce the young creature who cried out  while the mobbish inquisitors were in the heigh of their office the women came running up to me to know what they should do a constable being actually fetched  get the constable into the parlour said i wi three or four of the forwardest of the mob and produce one of the nymphs onioneyd in a moment with disordered headdress and neckkerchief and le her own herself the person the occasion a femal skirmish but satisfied with the justice done her the give a dram or two to each fellow and all will be we  eleven oclock all done as i advised and all is well  mrs sinclair wishes she never had seen the face so skittish a lady and she and sally are extreme pressing with me to leave the perverse beauty to the breaking as they call it for four or five days b i cursed them into silence only ordering doub precaution for the future  polly though she consoled the dear perverseone all she could when with her insists upon it to me that nothing but terror will procure me tolerable usage  dorcas was challenged by the women upon her tears she owned them real said she was ashamed of herself but could not help it so sincere so unyielding a grief in so sweet a lady   the women laughed at her but i bid her make no apologies for her tears nor mind their laughing i was glad to see them so ready good use might be made of such strangers in short i would have her indulge them often and try if it were not possible to gain her ladys confidence by her concern for her  she said that her lady did take kind notice of them to her and was glad to see such tokens of humanity in her  well then said i your part whether any thing come of it or not is to be tenderhearted it can do no harm if no good but take care you are not too suddenly or too officiously compassionate  so dorcas will be a humane good sort of creature i believe very quickly with her lady and as it becomes women to be so and as my beloved is willing to think highly of her own sex it will the more readily pass with her  i thought to have had one trial having gone so far for cohabitation but what hope can there be of succeeding  she is invincible  against all my notions against all my conceptions thinking of her as a woman and in the very bloom of her charms she is absolutely invincible  my whole view at the present is to do her legal justice if i can but once more get her out of her altitudes  the consent of such a lady must make her ever new ever charming but astonishing can the want of a church ceremony make such a difference  she owes me her consent for hitherto i have had nothing to boast of all of my side has been deep remorse anguish of mind and love increased rather than abated  how her proud rejection stings me  and yet i hope still to get her to listen to my stories of the familyreconciliation and of her uncle and capt tomlinson  and as she has given me a pretense to detain her against her will she must see me whether in temper or not  she cannot help it and if love will not do terror as the women advise must be tried  a nice part after all has my beloved to act if she forgive me easily i resume perhaps my projects  if she carry her rejection into violence that violence may make me desperate and occasion fresh violence  she ought since she thinks she has found the women out to consider where she is  i am confoundedly out of conceit with myself if i give up my contrivances my joy in stratagem and plot and invention i shall be but a common man such another dull heavy creature as thyself yet what does even my success in my machinations bring me but disgrace repentance regret but i a overmatched egregiously overmatched by this lady what to do with her or without her i know not  letter xxxiv mr lovelace to john belford esquire i have this moment intelligence from simon parso one of lord ms stewards that his lordship is ve ill simon who is my obsequious servant in vir of my presumptive heirship gives me a hint in  letter that my presence at mhall will not be am so i must accelerate whatever be the course i she be allowed or compelled to take  no bad prospects for this charming creature the old peer would be so kind as to surrender a many a summons has his gout given him a g  000 l a year and perhaps the title reversiona would help me up with her  proudly as this lady pretends to be above all pride grandeur will have its charms with her for grandeur always makes a mans face shine in a womans eye i have a pretty good because a clear estate as it is but what a noble variety of mischief will  000 l a year enable a man to do  perhaps thou wilt say i do already all that comes into my head but that is a mistake  not one half i will assure thee and even good folks as i have heard love to have the power of doing mischief whether they make use of it or not the late queen anne who was a very good woman was always fond of prerogative and her ministers in her name in more instances than one made a ministerial use of this her foible  but now at last am i to be admitted to the presence of my angry fairone after three denials nevertheless and a peremptory from me by dorcas that i must see her in her chamber if i cannot see her in the dining room  dorcas however tells me that she says if she were at her own liberty she would never see me more and that she has been asking after the characters and conditions of the neighbors i suppose now she has found her voice to call out for help from them if there were any to hear her  she will have it now it seems that i had the wickedness from the very beginning to contrive for her ruin a house so convenient for dreadful mischief  dorcas begs of her to be pacified  entreats her to see me with patience  tells her that i am one of the most determined of men as she has heard say  that gentleness may do with me but that nothing else will she believes and what as her ladyship as she always styles her is married if i had broke my oath or intended to break it   she hinted plain enough to the honest wench that she was not married  but dorcas would not understand her  this shows that she is resolved to keep no measures and now is to be a trial of skill whether she shall or not  dorcas has hinted to her my lords illness as a piece of intelligence that dropped in conversation from me  but here i stop my beloved pursuant to my peremptory message is just gone up into the dining room  letter xxxv mr lovelace to john belford esquire monday afternoon june    pity me jack for pitys sake since if thou do not nobody else will and yet never was there a man of my genius and lively temper that wanted it more we are apt to attribute to the devil everything that happens to us which we would not have happen but here being as perhaps thou wilt say the devil myself my plagues arise from an angel i suppose all mankind is to be plagued by its contrary  she began with me like a true woman  she in the fault i to be blamed the moment i entered the dining room  not the least apology not the least excuse for the uproar she had made and the trouble she had given me  i come said she into thy detested presence because i cannot help it but why am i to be imprisoned here  although to no purpose i cannot help   dearest madam interrupted i give not way to so much violence you must know that your detention is entirely owing to the desire i have to make you all the amends that is in my power to make you and this as well for your sake as my own  surely there is still one way left to repair the wrongs you have suffered   can thou blot out the past week several weeks past i should say ever since i have been with thee can thou call back time  if thou can   surely madam again interrupting her if i may be permitted to call you legally mine i might have but anticip   wretch that thou art say not another word upon this subject when thou vowedst when thou promisedst at hamstead i had begun to think that i must be thine if i had consented at the request of those i thought thy relations this would have been a principal inducement that i could then have brought thee what was most wanted an unsullied honor in dowry to a wretch destitute of all honor and could have met the gratulations of a family to which thy life has been one continued disgrace with a consciousness of deserving their gratulations but think thou that i will give a harlotniece to thy honorable uncle and to thy real aunts and a cousin to thy cousins from a brothel for such in my opinion is this detested house  then lifting up her clasped hands great and good god of heaven said she give me patience to support myself under the weight of those afflictions which thou for wise and good ends though at present impenetrable by me have permitted  then turning toward me who knew neither what to say to her nor for myself i renounce thee for ever lovelace  abhorred of my soul for ever i renounce thee  seek thy fortunes wheresoever thou will  only now that thou have already ruined me   ruined you madam  the world need not  i knew not what to say   ruined me in my own eyes and that is the same to me as if all the world knew it  hinder me not from going whither my mysterious destiny shall lead me   why hesitate you sir what right have you to stop me as you lately did and to bring me up by force my hands and arms bruised with your violence what right have you to detain me here  i am cut to the heart madam with invectives so violent i am but too sensible of the wrong i have done you or i could not bear your reproaches the man who perpetrates a villainy and resolves to go on with it shows not the compunction i show yet if you think yourself in my power i would caution you madam not to make me desperate for you shall be mine or my life shall be the forfeit nor is life worth having without you   be thine  i be thinesaid the passionate beauty o how lovely in her violence   yes madam be mine  i repeat you shall be mine  my very crime is your glory my love my admiration of you is increased by what has passed and so it ought i am willing madam to court your returning favor but let me tell you were the house beset by a thousand armed men resolved to take you from me they should not effect their purpose while i had life  i never never will be yours said she clasping her hands together and lifting up her eyes  i never will be yours  we may yet see many happy years madam all your friends may be reconciled to you the treaty for that purpose is in greater forwardness than you imagine you know better than to think the worse of yourself for suffering what you could not help injoin but the terms i can make my peace with you upon and i will instantly comply  never never repeated she will i be yours   only forgive me my dearest life this one time  a virtue so invincible what further view can i have against you  have i attempted any further outrage  if you will be mine your injuries will be injuries done to myself you have too well guessed at the unnatural arts that have been used  but can a greater testimony be given of your virtue  and now i have only to hope that although i cannot make you complete amends yet that you will permit me to make you all the amends that can possibly be made  hear me out i beseech you madam for she was going to speak with an aspect unpacifiedly angry the god whom you serve requires but repentance and amendment imitate him my dearest love and bless me with the means of reforming a course of life that begins to be hateful to me that was once your favorite point resume it dearest creature in charity to a soul as well as body which once as i flattered myself was more than indifferent to you resume it and let tomorrows sun witness to our espousals  i cannot judge thee said she but the god to whom thou so boldly referrest can and assure thyself he will but if compunction has really taken hold of thee if indeed thou art touched for thy ungrateful baseness and meanest any thing by pleading the holy example thou recommendest to my imitation in this thy pretended repentant moment let me sift thee thoroughly and by thy answer i shall judge of the sincerity of thy pretended declarations  tell me then is there any reality in the treaty thou have pretended to be on foot between my uncle and captain tomlinson and thyself  say and hesitate not is there any truth in that story  but remember if there be not and thou avowest that there is what further condemnation attends thy averrment if it be as solemn as i require it to be  this was a cursed thrust what could i say  surely this merciless lady is resolved to damn me thought i and yet accuses me of a design against her soul  but was i not obliged to proceed as i had begun  in short i solemnly averred that there was  how one crime as the good folks say brings on another  i added that the captain had been in town and would have waited on her had she not been indisposed that he went down much afflicted as well on her account as on that of her uncle though i had not acquainted him either with the nature of her disorder or the evertoberegretted occasion of it having told him that it was a violent fever that he had twice since by her uncles desire sent up to inquire after her health and that i had already dispatched a man and horse with a letter to acquaint him and her uncle through him with her recovery making it my earnest request that he would renew his application to her uncle for the favor of his presence at the private celebration of our nuptials and that i expected an answer if not this night as tomorrow  let me ask thee next said she thou know the opinion i have of the women thou broughtest to me at hamstead and who have seduced me hither to my ruin let me ask thee if really and truly they were lady betty lawrance and thy cousin montague  what say thou  hesitate not  what say thou to this question  astonishing my dear that you should suspect them  but knowing your strange opinion of them what can i say to be believed  and is this the answer thou returnest me do thou thus evade my question but let me know for i am trying thy sincerity now and shall judge of thy new professions by thy answer to this question let me know i repeat whether those women be really lady betty lawrance and thy cousin montague  let me my dearest love be enabled tomorrow to call you lawfully mine and we will set out the next day if you please to berkshire to my lord ms where they both are at this time and you shall convince yourself by your own eyes and by your own ears which you will believe sooner than all i can say or swear  now belford i had really some apprehension of treachery from thee which made me so miserably evade for else i could as safely have sworn to the truth of this as to that of the former but she pressing me still for a categorical answer i ventured plumb and swore to it  lovers oaths jack that they were really and truly lady betty lawrance and my cousin montgue  she lifted up her hands and eyes  what can i think  what can i think   you think me a devil madam a very devil or you could no after you have put these questions to me seem to doubt the truth of answers so solemnly sworn to  and if i do think thee so have i not cause is there another man in the world i hope for the sake of human nature there is not who could act by any poor friendless creature as thou have acted by me whom thou have made friendless  and who before i knew thee had for a friend every one who knew me  i told you madam before that my aunt and cousin were actually here in order to take leave of you before they set out for berkshire but the effects of my ungrateful crime such with shame and remorse i own it to be were the reason you could not see them nor could i be fond that they should see you since they never would have forgiven me had they known what had passed  and what reason had i to expect your silence on the subject had you been recovered  it signifies nothing now that the cause of their appearance has been answered in my ruin who or what they are but if thou have averred thus solemnly to two falsehoods what a wretch do i see before me   i thought she had now reason to be satisfied and i begged her to allow me to talk to her of tomorrow as of the happiest day of my life we have the license madam  and you must excuse me that i cannot let you go hence till i have tried every way i can try to obtain your forgiveness  and am i then with a kind of frantic wildness to be detained a prisoner in this horrid house  am i sir  take care  take care holding up her hand menacing how you make me desperate  if i fall though by my own hand inquisition will be made for my blood and be not out in thy plot lovelace if it should be so  make sure work i charge thee dig a hole deep enough to cram in and conceal this unhappy body for depend upon it that some of those who will not stir to protect me living will move heaven and earth to avenge me dead  a horrid dear creature  by my soul she made me shudder she had need indeed to talk of her unhappiness in falling into the hands of the only man in the world who could have used her as i have used her she is the only woman in the world who could have shocked and disturbed me as she has done  so we are upon a foot in that respect and i think i have the worst of it by much since very little has been my joy very much my trouble and her punishment as she calls it is over but when mine will or what it may be who can tell  here only recapitulating think then how i must be affected at the time i was forced to leave off and sing a song to myself i aimed at a lively air but i croaked rather than sung and fell into the old dismal thirtieth of january strain i hemmed up for a sprightlier note but it would not do and at last i ended like a malefactor in a dead psalmmelody  highho  i gape like an unfledged kite in its nest wanting to swallow a chicken bobbd at its mouth by its marauding dam   what a devil ails me  i can neither think nor write   lie down pen for a moment   letter xxxvi mr lovelace to john belford esquire there is certainly a good deal in the observation that it costs a man ten times more pains to be wicked than it would cost him to be good what a confounded number of contrivances have i had recourse to in order to carry my point with this charming creature and after all how have i puzzled myself by it and yet am near tumbling into the pit which it was the end of all my plots to shun what a happy man had i been with such an excellence could i have brought my mind to marry when i first prevailed upon her to quit her fathers house but then as i have often reflected how had i known that a but blossoming beauty who could carry on a private correspondence and run such risques with a notorious wild fellow was not prompted by inclination which one day might give such a free liver as myself as much pain to reflect upon as at the time it gave me pleasure thou remembrest the hosts tale in ariosto and thy experience as well as mine can furnish out twenty fiamettos in proof of the imbecility of the sex  but to proceed with my narrative  the dear creature resumed the topic her heart was so firmly fixed upon and insisted upon quitting the odious house and that in very high terms  i urged her to meet me the next day at the altar in either of the two churches mentioned in the license and i besought her whatever were her resolution to let me debate this matter calmly with her  if she said i would have her give what i desired the least moments consideration i must not hinder her from being her own mistress to what purpose did i ask her consent if she had not a power over either her own person or actions  will you give me your honor madam if i consent to your quitting a house so disagreeable to you   my honor sir said the dear creature  alas  and turned weeping from me with inimitable grace  as if she had said  alas  you have robbed me of my honor  i hoped then that her angry passions were subsiding  but i was mistaken  for urging her warmly for the day and that for the sake of our mutual honor and the honor of both our families in this highflown and highsould strain she answered me  and can thou lovelace be so mean  as to wish to make a wife of the creature thou have insulted dishonored and abused as thou have me was it necessary to humble clarissa harlowe down to the low level of thy baseness before she could be a wife meet for thee thou had a father who was a man of honor a mother who deserved a better son  thou have an uncle who is no dishonor to the peerage of a kingdom whose peers are more respectable than the nobility of any other country thou have other relations also who may be thy boast though thou can not be theirs and can thou not imagine that thou hear them calling upon thee the dead from their monuments the living from their laudable pride not to dishonor thy ancient and splendid house by entering into wedlock with a creature whom thou have levelled with the dirt of the street and classed with the vilest of her sex  i extolled her greatness of soul and her virtue i execrated myself for my guilt and told her how grateful to the manes of my ancestors as well as to the wishes of the living the honor i supplicated for would be  but still she insisted upon being a free agent of seeing herself in other lodgings before she would give what i urged the least consideration nor would she promise me favor even then or to permit my visits how then as i asked her could i comply without resolving to lose her for ever  she put her hand to her forehead often as she talked and at last pleading disorder in her head retired neither of us satisfied with the other but she ten times more dissatisfied with me than i with her  dorcas seems to be coming into favor with her   what now  what now   monday night how determined is this lady  again had she like to have escaped us  what a fixed resentment  she only i find assumed a little calm in order to quiet suspicion she was got down and actually had unbolted the streetdoor before i could get to her alarmed as i was by mrs sinclairs cookmaid who was the only one that saw her fly through the passage yet lightning was not quicker than i  again i brought her back to the dining room with infinite reluctance on her part and before her face ordered a servant to be placed constantly at the bottom of the stairs for the future  she seemed even choked with grief and disappointment  dorcas was exceedingly assiduous about her and confidently gave it as her own opinion that her dear lady should be permitted to go to another lodging since this was so disagreeable to her were she to be killed for saying so she would say it and was good dorcas for this afterward  but for some time the dear creature was all passion and violence   i see i see said she when i had brought her up what i am to expect from your new professions o vilest of men   have i offered to you my beloved creature any thing that can justify this impatience after a more hopeful calm  she wrung her hands she disordered her headdress she tore her ruffles she was in a perfect phrensy  i dreaded her returning malady but entreaty rather exasperating i affected an angry air  i bid her expect the worst she had to fear  and was menacing on in hopes to intimidate her when dropping down at my feet  twill be a mercy said she the highest act of mercy you can do to kill me outright upon this spot  this happy spot as i will in my last moments call it  then baring with a still more frantic violence part of her enchanting neck  here here said the soulharrowing beauty let thy pointed mercy enter and i will thank thee and forgive thee for all the dreadful past  with my latest gasp will i forgive and thank thee  or help me to the means and i will myself put out of thy way so miserable a wretch and bless thee for those means  why all this extravagant passion why all these exclamations have i offered any new injury to you my dearest life what a phrensy is this am i not ready to mke you all the reparation that i can make you had i not reason to hope   no no no no  half a dozen times as fast as she could speak  had i not reason to hope that you were meditating upon the means of making me happy and yourself not miserable rather than upon a flight so causeless and so precipitate   no no no no as before shaking her head with wild impatience as resolved not to attend to what i said  my resolutions are so honorable if you will permit them to take effect that i need not be solicitous whither you go if you will but permit my visits and receive my vows and god is my witness that i bring you not back from the door with any view to your dishonor but the contrary and this moment i will send for a minister to put an end to all your doubts and fears  say this and say a thousand times more and bind every word with a solemn appeal to that god whom thou art accustomed to invoke to the truth of the vilest falsehoods and all will still be short of what thou have vowed and promised to me and were not my heart to abhor thee and to rise against thee for thy perjuries as it does i would not i tell thee once more i would not bind my soul in covenant with such a man for a thousand worlds  compose yourself however madam for your own sake compose yourself permit me to raise you up abhorred as i am of your soul   nay if i must not touch you for she wildly lap my hands but with such a sweet passionate air her bosom heaving and throbbing as she looked up to me that although i was most sincerely enraged i could with transport have pressed her to mine   if i must not touch you i will not  but depend upon it and i assumed the sternest air i could assume to try what that would do depend upon it madam that this is not the way to avoid the evils you dread let me do what i will i cannot be used worse  dorcas be gone  she arose dorcas being about to withdraw and wildly caught hold of her arm o dorcas if thou art of mine own sex leave me not i charge thee  then quitting dorcas down she threw herself upon her knees in the furthermost corner of the room clasping a chair with her face laid upon the bottom of it  o where can i be safe  where where can i be safe from this man of violence   this gave dorcas an opportunity to confirm herself in her ladys confidence the wench threw herself at my feet while i seemed in violent wrath and embracing my knees kill me sir kill me sir if you please  i must throw myself in your way to save my lady i beg your pardon sir  but you must be set on  god forgive the mischiefmakers  but your own heart if left to itself would not permit these things  spare however sir spare my lady i beseech you bustling on her knees about me as if i were intending to approach her lady had i not been restrained by her  this humored by me begone devil  officious devil begone  startled the dear creature who snatching up hastily her head from the chair and as hastily popping it down again in terror hit her nose i suppose against the edge of the chair and it gushed out with blood running in a stream down her bosom she herself too much affrighted to heed it   never was mortal man in such terror and agitation as i for i instantly concluded that she had stabbed herself with some concealed instrument  i ran to her in a wild agony  for dorcas was frighted out of all her mock interposition   what have you done  o what have you done  look up to me my dearest life  sweet injured innocence look up to me what have you done  long will i not survive you  and i was upon the point of drawing my sword to dispatch myself when i discovered  what an unmanly blockhead does this charming creature make me at her pleasure that all i apprehended was but a bloody nose which as far as i know for it could not be stopped in a quarter of an hour may have saved her head and her intellects  but i see by this scene that the sweet creature is but a pretty coward at bottom and that i can terrify her out of her virulence against me whenever i put on sternness and anger but then as a qualifier to the advantage this gives me over her i find myself to be a coward too which i had not before suspected since i was capable of being so easily terrified by the apprehensions of her offering violence to herself  letter xxxvii mr lovelace to john belford esquire but with all this dear creatures resentment against me i cannot for my heart think but she will get all over and consent to enter the pale with me were she even to die tomorrow and to know she should would not a woman of her sense of her punctilio and in her situation and of so proud a family rather die married than otherwise  no doubt but she would although she were to hate the man ever so heartily if so there is now but one man in the world whom she can have  and that is me  now i talk  familiar writing is but talking jack thus glibly of entering the pale thou will be ready to question me i know as to my intentions on this head  as much of my heart as i know of it myself will i tell thee  when i am from her i cannot still help hesitating about marriage and i even frequently resolve against it and am resolved to press my favorite scheme for cohabitation but when i am with her i am ready to say to swear and to do whatever i think will be most acceptable to her and were a parson at hand i should plunge at once no doubt of it into the state  i have frequently thought in common cases that it is happy for many giddy fellows there are giddy fellows as well as giddy girls jack and perhaps those are as often drawn in as these that ceremony and parade are necessary to the irrevocable solemnity and that there is generally time for a man to recollect himself in the space between the heated overnight and the cooler next morning or i know not who could escape the sweet gypsies whose fascinating powers are so much aided by our own raised imaginations  a wife at any time i used to say i had ever confidence and vanity enough to think that no woman breathing could deny her hand when i held out mine i am confoundedly mortified to find that this lady is able to hold me at bay and to refuse all my honest vows  what force allow me a serious reflection jack it will be put down what force have evil habits upon the human mind when we enter upon a devious course we think we shall have it in ou power when we will to return to the right path but it is not so i plainly see for who can acknowledge with more justice this dear creatures merits and his own errors than i whose regret at times can be deeper than mine for the injurie i have done her whose resolutions to repair those injuries stronger  yet how transitory is my penitence  how am i hurried away  can thou te by what  o devil of youth and devil of intrigue how do ye mislead me  how often do we en in occasions for the deepest remorse what we begin in wantonness   at the present writing however the turn of the scale is in favor of matrimony  for i despair of carrying with her my favorite point  the lady tells dorcas that her heart is broken and that she shall live but a little while i think nothing of that if we marry in the first place she knows not what a mind unapprehensive will do for her in a state to which all the sex look forward with high satisfaction how often have the whole sacred conclave been thus deceived in their choice of a pope not considering that the new dignity is of itself sufficient to give new life  a few months heartsease will give my charmer a quite different notion of things and i dare say as i have heretofore said see p  0  of this volume  once married and i am married for life  i will allow that her pride in one sense has suffered abasement but her triumph is the greater in every other and while i can think that all her trials are but additions to her honor and that i have laid the foundations of her glory in my own shame can i be called cruel if i am not affected with her grief as some men would be   and for what should her heart be broken her will is unviolated  at present however her will is unviolated the destroying of good habits and the introducing of bad to the corrupting of the whole heart is the violation that her will is not to be corrupted that her mind is not to be debased she has hitherto unquestionably proved and if she give cause for further trials and hold fast her integrity what ideas will she have to dwell upon that will be able to corrupt her morals  what vestigia what remembrances but such as will inspire abhorrence of the attempter  what nonsense then to suppose that such a mere notional violation as she has suffered should be able to cut asunder the strings of life  her religion married or not married will set her above making such a trifling accident such an involuntary suffering ftal to her  such considerations as these they are that support me against all apprehension of bugbear consequences and i would have them have weight with thee who art such a doughty advocate for her and yet i allow thee this that she really makes too much of it takes it too much to heart to be sure she ought to have forgot it by this time except the charming charming consequence happen that still i am in hopes will happen were i to proceed no further and if she apprehend this herself then has the dear overnice soul some reason for taking it so much to heart and yet would not i think refuse to legitimate  o jack had i an imperial diadem i swear to thee that i would give it up even to my enemy to have one charming boy by this lady and should she escape me and no such effect follow my revenge on her family and in such a case on herself would be incomplete and i should reproach myself as long as i lived  were i to be sure that this foundation is laid and why may i not hope it is i should not doubt to have her still should she withstand her day of grace on my own conditions nor should i if it were so question that revived affection in her which a woman seldom fails to have for the father of her first child whether born in wedlock or out of it  and prythee jack see in this aspiration let me call it a distinction in my favor from other rakes who almost to a man follow their inclinations without troubling themselves about consequences in imitation as one would think of the strutting villain of a bird which from feathered lady to feathered lady pursues his imperial pleasures leaving it to his sleek paramours to hatch the genial product in holes and corners of their own finding out  letter xxxviii mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday morn june  0 well jack now are we upon another foot together this dear creature will not let me be good she is now authorizing all my plots by her own example  thou must be partial in the highest degree if now thou blamest me for resuming my former schemes since in that case i shall but follow her clue no forced construction of her actions do i make on this occasion in order to justify a bad cause or a worse intention a little pretense indeed served the wolf when he had a mind to quarrel with the lamb but this is not now my case  for here would thou have thought it taking advantage of dorcass compassionate temper and of some warm expressions which the tenderhearted wench let fall against the cruelty of men and wishing to have it in her power to serve her has she given her the following note signed by her maiden name for she has thought fit in positive and plain words to own to the pitying dorcas that she is not married  monday june    i the underwritten do hereby promise that on my coming into possession of my own estate i will provide for dorcas martindale in a gentlewomanlike manner in my own house or if i do not soon obtain that possession or should first die i do hereby bind myself my executors and administrators to pay to her or her order during the term of her natural life the sum of five pounds on each of the four usual quarterly days in the year that is to say twenty pounds by the year on condition that she faithfully assist me in my escape from an illegal confinement which i now labor under the first quarterly payment to commence aid be payable at the end of three months immediately following the day of my deliverance and i do also promise to give her as a testimony of my honor in the rest a diamond ring which i have showed her witness my hand this nineteenth day of june in the year abovewritten  clarissa harlowe  now jack what terms would thou have me to keep with such a sweet corruptress  see thou not how she hates me  see thou not that she is resolved never to forgive me  see thou not however that she must disgrace herself in the eye of the world if she actually should escape  that she must be subjected to infinite distress and hazard  for whom has she to receive and protect her  yet to determine to risque all these evils  and furthermore to stoop to artifice to be guilty of the reigning vice of the times of bribery and corruption o jack jack say not write not another word in her favor   thou have blamed me for bringing her to this house but had i carried her to any other in england where there would have been one servant or inmate capable either of compassion or corruption what must have been the consequence  but see thou not however that in this flimsy contrivance the dear implacable like a drowning man catches at a straw to save herself  a straw shall she find to be the refuge she has resorted to  letter xxxix mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday morn  0 oclock very ill  exceeding ill  as dorcas tells me in order to avoid seeing me  and yet the dear soul may be so in her mind  but is not that equivocation  some one passion predominating in every human breast breaks through principle and controuls us all mine is love and revenge taking turns hers is hatred  but this is my consolation that hatred appeased is love begun or love renewed i may rather say if love ever had footing here  but reflectioning apart thou see jack that her plot is beginning to work tomorrow it is to break out  i have been abroad to set on foot a plot of circumvention all fair now belford   i insisted upon visiting my indisposed fair one dorcas made officious excuses for her i cursed the wench in her hearing for her impertinence and stamped and made a clutter  which was improved into an apprehension to the lady that i would have flung her faithful confidante from the top of the stairs to the bottom  he is a violent wretch  but dorcas  dear dorcas now it is thou shall have a friend in me to the last day of my life  and what now do think the name of her good angel is  why dorcas martindale christian and super no more wykes as in the promisory note in my former  and the dear creature has bound her to her by the most solemn obligations besides the tie of interest  whither madam do you design to go when you get out of this house  i will throw myself into the first open house i can find and beg protection till i can get a coach or a lodging in some honest family  what will you do for clothes madam  i doubt you will not be able to take any away with you but what you will have on  o no matter for clothes if i can but get out of this house  what will you do for money madam i have heard his honor express his concern that he could not prevail upon you to be obliged to him though he apprehended that you must be short of money  o i have rings and other valuables indeed i have but four guineas and two of them i found lately wrapped up in a bit of lace designed for a charitable use but now alas charity begins at home but i have one dear friend left if she be living as i hope in god she is to whom i can be obliged if i want o dorcas i must ere now have heard from her if i had had fair play  well madam yours is a hard lot i pity you at my heart  thank you dorcas  i am unhappy that i did not think before that i might have confided in thy pity and in thy sex  i pitied you madam often and often but you were always as i thought diffident of me and then i doubted not but you were married and i thought his honor was unkindly used by you so that i thought it my duty to wish well to his honor rather than to what i thought to be your humors madam would to heaven that i had known before that you were not married  such a lady  such a fortune  to be so sadly betrayed   ah dorcas i was basely drawn in my youth my ignorance of the world  and i have some things to reproach myself with when i look back  lord madam what deceitful creatures are these men  neither oaths nor vows  i am sure i am sure  and then with her apron she gave her eyes half a dozen hearty rubs  i may curse the time that i came into this house   here was accounting for her bold eyes and was it not better to give up a house which her lady could not think worse of than she did in order to gain the reputation of sincerity than by offering to vindicate it to make her proffered services suspected  poor dorcas  bless me how little do we who have lived all our time in the country know of this wicked town   had i been able to write cried the veteran wench i should certainly have given some other near relations i have in wales a little inkling of matters and they would have saved me from  from  from   her sobs were enough the apprehensions of women on such subjects are ever aforehand with speech  and then sobbing on she lifted her apron to her face again she showed me how  poor dorcas  again wiping her own charming eyes  all love all compassion is this dear creature to every one in affliction but me  and would not an aunt protect her kinswoman  abominable wretch  i cannot  i cannot  i cannot  say my aunt was privy to it she gave me good advice she knew not for a great while that i was  that i was  that i was  ugh  ugh  ugh   no more no more good dorcas  what a world we live in  what a house am i in but ome dont weep though she herself could not forear my being betrayed into it though to my own  may be a happy event for thee and if i live  shall  i thank you my good lady blubbering i am sorry very sorry you have had so hard a lot but it may be the saving of my soul if i can get to your ladyships house  had i but known that your ladyship was not married i would have eat my own flesh before before before   dorcas sobbd and wept the lady sighed and wept also  but now jack for a serious reflection upon the premises  how will the good folks account for it that satan has such faithful instruments and that the bond of wickedness is a stronger bond than the ties of virtue  as if it were the nature of the human mind to be villainous for here had dorcas been good and tempted as she was tempted to any thing evil i make no doubt but she would have yielded to the temptation  and cannot our fraternity in an hundred instances give proof of the like predominance of vice over virtue and that we have risqued more to serve and promote the interests of the former than ever a good man did to serve a good man or a good cause for have we not been prodigal of life and fortune have we not defied the civil magistrate upon occasion and have we not attempted rescues and dared all things only to extricate a pounded profligate   whence jack can this be  o i have it i believe the vicious are as bad as they can be and do the devils work without looking after while he is continually spreading snares for the others and like a skilful angler suiting his baits to the fish he angles for  nor let even honest people so called blame po dorcas for her fidelity in a bad cause for does no the general who implicitly serves an ambitious princ in his unjust designs upon his neighbors or upon his own oppressed subjects and even the lawyer who for the sake of a paltry fee undertakes to whiten a black cause and to defend it against one he knows to be good do the very same thing as dorcas and are they not both every whit as culpable yet the one shall be dubbed a hero the other a charming fellow and be contended for by every client and his doublepaced abilities shall carry him through all the high preferments of the law with reputation and applause  well but what shall be done since the lady is so much determined on removing  is there no way to oblige her and yet to make the very act subservient to my own views  i fancy such a way may be found out  i will study for it   suppose i suffer her to make an escape her heart is in it if she effect it the triumph she will have over me upon it will be a counterbalance for all she has suffered  i will oblige her if i can  letter xl mr lovelace to john belford esquire tired with a succession of fatiguing days and sleepless nights and with contemplating the precarious situation i stand in with my beloved i fell into a profound resverie which brought on sleep and that produced a dream a fortunate dream which as i imagine will afford my working mind the means to effect the obliging double purpose my heart is now once more set upon  what as i have often contemplated is the enjoyment of the finest woman in the world to the contrivance the bustle the surprises and at last the happy conclusion of a welllaid plot  the charming roundabouts to come the nearest way home  the doubts the apprehensions the heartakings the meditated triumphs  these are the joys that make the blessing dear  for all the rest what is it  what but to find an angel in imagination dwindled down to a woman in fact  but to my dream   methought it was about nine on wednesday morning that a chariot with a dowagers arms upon the doors and in it a grave matronly lady not unlike mother h in the face but in her heart o how unlike stopped at a grocers shop about ten doors on the other side of the way in order to buy some groceries and methought dorcas having been out to see if the coast were clear for her ladys flight and if a coach were to be got near the place espied this chariot with the dowagers arms and this matronly lady and what methought did dorcas that subtle traitress do but whip up to the old matronly lady and lifting up her voice say good my lady permit me one word with your ladyship  what thou have to say to me say on quoth the old lady the grocer retiring and standing aloof to give dorcas leave to speak who methought in words like these accosted the lady  you seem madam to be a very good lady and here in this neighborhood at a house of no high repute is an innocent lady of rank and fortune beautiful as a may morning and youthful as a rosebud and full as sweet and lovely who has been tricked thither by a wicked gentleman practiced in the ways of the town and this very night will she be ruined if she get not out of his hands now o lady if you will extend your compassionate goodness to this fair young lady in whom the moment you behold her you will see cause to believe all i say and let her but have a place in your chariot and remain in your protection for one day only till she can send a man and a horse to her rich and powerful friends you may save from ruin a lady who has no equal for virtue as well as beauty  methought the old lady moved with dorcass story answered and said hasten o damsel who in a happy moment art come to put it in my power to serve the innocent and the virtuous which it has always been my delight to do hasten to this young lady and bid her hie hither to me with all speed and tell her that my chariot shall be her asylum and if i find all that thou say true my house shall be her sanctuary and i will protect her from all her oppressors  hereupon methought this traitress dorcas hied back to the lady and made report of what she had done and methought the lady highly approved of dorcass proceeding and blessed her for her good thought  and i lifted up mine eyes and behold the lady issued out of the house and without looking back ran to the chariot with the dowagers coat upon it and was received by the matronly lady with open arms and welcome welcome welcome fair young lady who so well answer the description of the faithful damsel and i will carry you instantly to my house where you shall meet with all the good usage your heart can wish for till you can apprise your rich and powerful friends of your past dangers and present escape  thank you thank you thank you thank you worthy thrice worthy lady who afford so kindly your protection to a most unhappy young creature who has been basely seduced and betrayed and brought to the very brink of destruction  methought then the matronly lady who had by the time the young lady came to her bought and paid for the goods she wanted ordered her coachman to drive home with all speed who stopped not till he had arrived in a certain street not far from lincolnsinnfields where the matronly lady lived in a sumptuous dwelling replete with damsels who wrought curiously in muslins cambricks and fine linen and in every good work that industrious damsels love to be employed about except the loom and the spinningwheel  and methought all the way the young lady and the old lady rode and after they came in till dinner was ready the young lady filled up the time with the dismal account of her wrongs and her sufferings the like of which was never heard by mortal ear and this in so moving a manner that the good old lady did nothing but weep and sigh and sob and inveigh against the arts of wicked men and against that abominable squire lovelace who was a plotting villain methought she said and more than that an unchained beelzebub  methought i was in a dreadful agony when i found the lady had escaped and in my wrath had like to have slain dorcas and our mother and every one i met but by some quick transition and strange metamorphosis which dreams do not usually account for methought all of a sudden this matronly lady was turned into the famous mother h herself and being an old acquaintance of mother sinclair was prevailed upon to assist in my plot upon the young lady  then methought followed a strange scene for mother h longing to hear more of the young ladys story and night being come besought her to accept of a place in her own bed in order to have all the talk to themselves for methought two young nieces of hers had broken in upon them in the middle of the dismal tale  accordingly going early to bed and the sad story being resumed with as great earnestness on one side as attention on the other before the young lady had gone far in it mother h methought was taken with a fit of the colic and her tortures increasing was obliged to rise to get a cordial she used to find specific in this disorder to which she was unhappily subject  having thus risen and stepped to her closet methought she let fall the wax taper in her returns and then o metamorphosis still stranger than the former what unaccountable things are dreams coming to bed again in the dark the young lady to her infinite astonishment grief and surprise found mother h turned into a young person of the other sex and although lovelace was the abhorred of her soul yet fearing it was some other person it was matter of some consolation to her when she found it was no other than himself and that she had been still the bedfellow of but one and the same man  a strange promiscuous huddle of adventures followed scenes perpetually shifting now nothing heard from the lady but sighs groans exclamations faintings dyings  from the gentleman but vows promises protestations disclaimers of purposes pursued and all the gentle and ungentle pressures of the lovers warfare  then as quick as thought for dreams thou know confine not themselves to the rules of the drama ensued recoveries lyingsin christenings the smiling boy amply even in her own opinion rewarding the suffering mother  then the grandfathers estate yielded up possession taken of it  living very happily upon it  her beloved norton her companion miss how her visitor and admirable thrice admirable i enabled to compare notes with her a charming girl by the same father to her friends charming boy who as they grow up in order to consolidate their mammas friendships for neither have dreams regard to consanguinity intermarry change names by act of parliament to enjoy my estate  and i know not what of the like incongruous stuff  i awoke as thou may believe in great disorder and rejoiced to find my charmer in the next room and dorcas honest  now thou will say this was a very odd dream and yet for i am a strange dreamer it is not altogether improbable that something like it may happen as the pretty simpleton has the weakness to confide in dorcas whom till now she disliked  but i forgot to tell thee one part of my dream and that was that the next morning the lady gave way to such transports of grief and resentment that she was with difficulty diverted from making an attempt upon her own life but however at last was prevailed upon to resolve to live and to make the best of the matter a letter methought from capt tomlinson helping to pacify her written to apprise me that her uncle harlowe would certainly be at kentishtown on wednesday night june    the following day the   th being his anniversary birthday and he doubly desirous on that account that our nuptials should be then privately solemnized in his presence  but is thursday the   th her uncles anniversary methinks thou ask  it is or else the day of celebration should have been earlier still three weeks ago i heard her say it was and i have down the birthday of every one of her family and the wedding day of her father and mother the minutest circumstances are often of great service in matters of the last importance  and what say thou now to my dream  who says that sleeping and waking i have not fine helps from some body some spirit rather as thou wilt be apt to say  but no wonder that a beelzebub has his devilkins to attend his call  i can have no manner of doubt of succeeding in mother hs part of the scheme for will the lady who resolves to throw herself into the first house she can enter or to bespeak the protection of the first person she meets and who thinks there can be no danger out of this house equal to what she apprehends from me in it scruple to accept of the chariot of a dowager accidentally offering and the ladys protection engaged by her faithful dorcas so highly bribed to promote her escape  and then mrs h has the air and appearance of a venerable matron and is not such a forbidding devil as mrs sinclair  the pretty simpleton knows nothing of the world nor that people who have money never want assistants in their views be they what they will how else could the princes of the earth be so implicitly served as they are change they hands ever so often and be their purposes ever so wicked  if i can but get her to go on with me till wednesday next week we shall be settled together pretty quietly by that time and indeed if she has any gratitude and has in her the least of her sexs foibles she must think i deserve her favor by the pains she has cost me for dearly do they all love that men should take pains about them and for them  and here for the present i will lay down my pen and congratulate myself upon my happy invention since her obstinacy puts me once more upon exercising it  but with this resolution i think that if the present contrivance fail me i will exert all the faculties of my mind all my talents to procure for myself a legal right to her favor and that in defiance of all my antipathies to the married state and of the suggestions of the great devil out of the house and of his secret agents in it  since if now she is not to be prevailed upon or drawn in it will be in vain to attempt her further  letter xli mr lovelace to john belford esquire tuesday night june  0 no admittance yet to my charmer she is very ill  in a violent fever dorcas thinks yet will have no advice  dorcas tells her how much i am concerned at it  but again let me ask does this lady do right to make herself ill when she is not ill for my own part libertine as people think me when i had occasion to be sick i took a dose of ipecacuanha that i might not be guilty of a falsehood and most heartily sick was i as she who then pitied me full well knew but here to pretend to be very ill only to get an opportunity to run away in order to avoid forgiving a man who has offended her how unchristian  if good folks allow themselves in these breaches of a known duty and in these presumptuous contrivances to deceive who belford shall blame us  i have a strange notion that the matronly lady will be certainly at the grocers shop at the hour of nine tomorrow morning for dorcas heard me tell mrs sinclair that i shall go out at eight precisely and then she is to try for a coach and if the dowagers chariot should happen to be there how lucky will it be for my charmer how strangely will my dream be made out  i have just received a letter from captain tomlinson is it not wonderful for that was part of my dream  i shall always have a prodigious regard to dreams henceforward i know not but i may write a book upon that subject for my own experience will furnish out a great part of it glanville of witches and baxters history of spirits and apparitions and the royal insignificants demonology will be nothing at all to lovelaces resveries  the letter is just what i dreamed it to be i am only concerned that uncle johns anniversary did not happen three or four days sooner for should any new misfortune befall my charmer she may not be able to support her spirits so long as till thursday in the next week yet it will give me the more time for new expedients should my present contrivance fail which i cannot however suppose  to robert lovelace esquire dear sir monday june    i can now return you joy for the joy you have given me as well as my dear friend mr harlowe in the news of his beloved nieces happy recovery for he is determined to comply with her wishes and yours and to give her to you with his own hand  as the ceremony has been necessarily delayed by reason of her illness and as mr harlowes birthday is on thursday the   th of this instant june when he enters into the seventyfourth year of his age and as time may be wanted to complete the dear ladys recovery he is very desirous that the marriage shall be solemnized upon it that he may afterward have double joy on that day to the end of his life  for this purpose he intends to set out privately so as to be at kentishtown on wednesday sennight in the evening  all the family used he says to meet to celebrate it with him but as they are at present in too unhappy a situation for that he will give out that not being able to bear the day at home he has resolved to be absent for two or three days  he will set out on horseback attended only with one trusty servant for the greater privacy he will be at the most creditablelooking public house there expecting you both next morning if he hear nothing from me to prevent him and he will go to town with you after the ceremony is performed in the coach he supposes you will come in  he is very desirous that i should be present on the occasion but this i have promised him at his request that i will be up before the day in order to see the settlements executed and every thing properly prepared  he is very glad that you have the license ready  he speaks very kindly of you mr lovelace and says that if any of the family stand out after he has seen the ceremony performed he will separate from them and unite himself to his dear niece and her interests  i owned to you when in town that i took slight notice to my dear friend of the misunderstanding between you and his niece and that i did this for fear the lady should have shown any little discontent in his presence were i to have been able to prevail upon him to go up in person as then was doubtful but i hope nothing of that discontent remains now  my absence when your messenger came must excuse me for not writing by him  be pleased to make my most respectful compliments acceptable to the admirable lady and believe me to be  your most faithful and obedient servant antony tomlinson   this letter i sealed and broke open it was brought thou may suppose by a particular messenger the seal such a one as the writer need not be ashamed of i took care to inquire after the captains health in my beloveds hearing and it is now ready to be produced as a pacifier according as she shall take on or resent if the two metamorphoses happen pursuant to my wonderful dream as having great faith in dreams i dare say they will  i think it will not be amiss in changing my clothes to have this letter of the worthy captain lie in my beloveds way  letter xlii mr lovelace to john belford esquire wedn noon june    what shall i say now  i who but a few hours ago had such faith in dreams and had proposed out of hand to begin my treatise of dreamssleeping and dreamswaking and was pleasing myself with the dialoguings between the old matronly lady and the young lady and with the two metamorphoses absolutely assured that every thing would happen as my dream chalked it out shall never more depend upon those flying follies those illusions of a fancy depraved and run mad  thus confoundedly have matters happened  i went out at eight oclock in high good humor with myself in order to give the soughtfor opportunity to the plotting mistress and corrupted maid only ordering will to keep a good lookout for fear his lady should mistrust my plot or mistake a hackneycoach for the dowagerladys chariot but first i sent to know how she did and received for anwer very ill  had a very bad night which latter was but too probable since this i know that people who have plots in their heads as seldom have as deserve good ones  i desired a physician might be called in but was refused  i took a walk in st jamess park congratulating myself all the way on my rare inventions then impatient i took coach with one of the windows quite up the other almost up playing at bopeep at every chariot i saw pass in my way to lincolnsinnfields and when arrived there i sent the coachman to desire any one of mother hs family to come to me to the coachside not doubting but i should have intelligence of my fair fugitive there it being then half an hour after ten  a servant came to me who gave me to understand that the matronly lady was just returned by herself in the chariot  frighted out of my wits i alighted and heard from the mothers own mouth that dorcas had engaged her to protect the lady but came to tell her afterward that she had changed her mind and would not quit the house  quite astonished not knowing what might have happened i ordered the coachman to lash away to our mothers  arriving here in an instant the first word i asked was if the lady were safe mr lovelace gives here a very circumstantial relation of all that passed between the lady and dorcas but as he could only guess at her motives for refusing to go off when dorcas told her that she had engaged for her the protection of the dowager lady it is thought proper to omit his relation and to supply it by some memoranda of the ladys but it is first necessary to account for the occasion on which those memoranda were made  the reader may remember that in the letter wrote to miss how on her escape to hamstead see vol iv p      she promises to give her the particulars of her flight at leisure  she had indeed thoughts of continuing her account of every thing that had passed between her and mr lovelace since her last narrative letter but the uncertainty she was in from that time with the execrable treatment she met with on her being deluded back again followed by a weeks delirium had hitherto hindered her from prosecuting her intention but nevertheless having it still in her view to perform her promise as soon as she had opportunity she made minutes of every thing as it passed in order to help her memory  which as she observes in one place she could less trust to since her late disorders than before  in these minutes or book of memoranda she observes that having apprehensions that dorcas might be a traitress she would have got away while she was gone out to see for a coach and actually slid down stairs with that intent but that seeing mrs sinclair in the entry whom dorcas had planted there while she went out she speeded up again unseen  she then went up to the dining room and saw the letter of captain tomlinson on which she observes in her memorandumbook as follows  how am i puzzled now  he might leave this letter on purpose none of the other papers left with it being of any consequence  what is the alternative  to stay and be the wife of the vilest of men  how my heart resists that  to attempt to get off and fail ruin inevitable  dorcas may betray me  i doubt she is still his implement  at his going out he whispered her as i saw unobserved  in a very familiar manner too  never fear sir with a courtesy  in her agreeing to connive at my escape she provided not for her own safety if i got away yet had reason in that case to expect his vengeance and wants not forethought  to have taken her with me was to be in the power of her intelligence if a faithless creature  let me however though i part not with my caution keep my charity  can there be any woman so vile to woman  o yes  mrs sinclair her aunt  the lord deliver me  but alas i have put myself out of the course of his protection by the natural means  and am already ruined  a fathers curse likewise against me  having made vain all my friends cautions and solicitudes i must not hope for miracles in my favor  if i do escape what may become of me a poor helpless deserted creature  helpless from sex  from circumstances  exposed to every danger  lord protect me  his vile man not gone with him  lurking hereabouts no doubt to watch my steps  i will not go away by the chariot however  that this chariot should come so opportunely  so like his many opportunelies  that dorcas should have the sudden thought  should have the courage with the thought to address a lady in behalf of an absolute stranger to that lady  that the lady should so readily consent  yet the transaction between them to take up so much time their distance in degree considered for arduous as the case was and precious as the time dorcas was gone above half an hour yet the chariot was said to be ready at a grocers not many doors off  indeed some elderly ladies are talkative and there are no doubt some good people in the world   but that it should chance to be a widow lady who could do what she pleased that dorcas should know her to be so by the lozenge persons in her station not usually so knowing i believe in heraldry  yet some may  for servants are fond of deriving collateral honors and distinctions as i may call them from the quality or people of rank whom they serve  but his sly servant not gone with him  then this letter of tomlinsons   although i am resolved never to have this wretch yet may i not throw myself into my uncles protection at kentishtown or highgate if i cannot escape before and so get clear of him  may not the evil i know be less than what i may fall into if i can avoid further villainy  further villainy he has not yet threatened  freely and justly as i have treated him  i will not go i think at least unless i can send this fellow out of the way she tried to do this but was prevented by the fellows pretending to put his ancle out by a slip down stairs  a trick says his contriving master in his omitted relation i had learned him on a like occasion at amiens   the fellow a villain the wench i doubt a vile wench at last concerned for her own safety plays off and on about a coach  all my hopes of getting off at present over  unhappy creature  to what further evils art thou reserved  o how my heart rises at the necessity i must still be under to see and converse with so very vile a man     letter xliii mr lovelace to john belford esquire wednesday afternoon disappointed in her meditated escape  obliged against her will to meet me in the dining room  and perhaps apprehensive of being upbraided for her art in feigning herself ill i expected that the dear perverse would begin with me with spirit and indignation but i was in hopes from the gentleness of her natural disposition from the consideration which i expected from her on her situation on the letter of captain tomlinson which dorcas told me she had seen and from the time she had had to cool and reflect since she last admitted me to her presence that she would not have carried it so strongly through as she did  as i entered the dining room i congratulated her and myself upon her sudden recovery and would have taken her hand with an air of respectful tenderness but she was resolved to begin where she left off  she turned from me drawing in her hand with a repulsing and indignant aspect  i meet you once more said she because i cannot help it what have you to say to me why am i to be thus detained against my will  with the utmost solemnity of speech and behavior i urged the ceremony i saw i had nothing else for it  i had a letter in my pocket i said feeling for it although i had not taken it from the table where i left it and which we were then near the contents of which if attended to would make us both happy i had been loath to show it to her before because i hoped to prevail upon her to be mine sooner than the day mentioned in it  i felt for it in all my pockets watching her eye mean time which i saw glance toward the table where it lay  i was uneasy that i could not find it  at last directed again by her sly eye i spied it on the table at the further end of the room  with joy i fetched it be pleased to read that letter madam with an air of satisfied assurance  she took it and cast her eye over it in such a careless way as made it evident that she had read it before and then unthankfully tossed it into the windowseat before her  i urged her to bless me tomorrow or friday morning at least that she would not render vain her uncles journey and kind endeavors to bring about a reconciliation among us all  among us all repeated she with an air equally disdainful and incredulous o lovelace thou art surely nearly allied to the grand deceiver in thy endeavor to suit temptations to inclinations  but what honor what faith what veracity were it possible that i could enter into parley with thee on this subject which it is not may i expect from such a man as thou have shown thyself to be  i was touched to the quick a lady of your perfect character madam who has feigned herself sick on purpose to avoid seeing the man who adored her should   i know what thou would say interrupted she  twenty and twenty low things that my soul would have been above being guilty of and which i have despised

may yet as far as i know lie in wait for my perdition  she would be very loath i said that mrs sinclair and her nieces should be called up to vindicate themselves and their house  would but they kill me let them come and welcome i will bless the hand that will strike the blow indeed i will  it is idle very idle to talk of dying mere younglady talk when controuled by those they hate  but let me

gout in his stomach to an extreme degree occaiond by drinking a great quantity of limonade  a man of  000 l a year to prefer his appetite to s health  he deserves to die  but we have all f us our inordinate passions to gratify  and they enerally bring their punishment along with them  o witnesses the nephew as well as the uncle  the fellow was sent up on other business but retched his orders a little to make his court to a uccessor  i am glad i was not at m hall at the time my lord took the grateful dose it was certainly grateful him at the time there are people in the world o would have had the wickedness to say that i d persuaded him to drink it  the man says that his lordship was so bad when he came away that the family began to talk of sending for me in posthaste as i know the old peer has a good deal of cash by him of which he seldom keeps account it behooves me to go down as soon as i can but what shall i do with this dear creature the while  tomorrow over i shall perhaps be able to answer my own question  i am afraid she will make me desperate  for here have i sent to implore her company and am denied with scorn  i have been so happy as to receive this moment a third letter from my dear correspondent miss how a little severe devil  it would have broke the heart of my beloved had it fallen into her hands i will enclose a copy of it read it here  my dearest miss harlowe tuesday june  0 again i venture to write to you almost against inclination and that by your former conveyance little a i like it  i know not how it is with you it may be bad an then it would be hard to upbraid you for a silence yo may not be able to help but if not what shall i say severe enough that you have not answered either of m last letters the first vol iv p     of which and i think it imported you too much to be silent upon it you owned the receipt of the other which was delivered into yo own hands see p     of this volume  was so pressing for the favor of a  from you that i am amazed i could not be obliged and still more that i have not heard from you since  the fellow made so strange a story of the condition  saw you in and of your speech to him that i know t what to conclude from it only that he is a simple bldering and yet conceited fellow who aiming at descrtion and the rustic wonderful gives an air of bumki romance to all he tells that this is his character y will believe when you are informed that he describ you in grief excessive see p     to     of this volume  yet so improved in your person and features and so rosy that was his word in your face and so flushcolourd and so plump in your arms that one would conclude you were laboring under the operation of some malignant poison and so much the rather as he was introduced to you when you were upon a couch from which you offered not to rise or sit up  upon my word miss harlowe i am greatly distressed upon your account for i must be so free as to say that in your ready return with your deceiver you have not at all answered my expectations nor acted up to your own character for mrs townsend tells me from the women at hamstead how cheerfully you put yourself into his hands again yet at the time it was impossible you should be married  lord my dear what pity it is that you took so much pains to get from the man but you know best  sometimes i think it could not be you to whom the rustic delivered my letter but it must too yet it is strange i could not have one line by him  not one  and you so soon well enough to go with him back again  i am not sure that the letter i am now writing will come to your hands so shall not say half that i have upon my mind to say but if you think it worth your while to write to me pray let me know what fine ladies his relations those were who visited you at hamstead and carried you back again so joyfully to a place that i had so fully warned you  but i will say no more at least till i know more for i can do nothing but wonder and stand amazed  notwithstanding all the mans baseness it is plain there was more than a lurking love  good god  but i have done  yet i know not how to have done neither  yet i must  i will  only account to me my dear for what i cannot at all account for and inform me whether you are really married or not  and then i shall know whether there must or must not be a period shorter than that of one of our lives to a friendship which has hitherto been the pride and boast of  your anna how   dorcas tells me that she has just now had a searching conversation as she calls it with her lady she is willing she tells the wench still to place a confidence in her dorcas hopes she has reassured her but wishes me not to depend upon it yet captain tomlinsons letter must assuredly weigh with her i sent it in just now by dorcas desiring her to reperuse it and it was not returned me as i feared it would be and that is a good sign i think  i say i think and i think for this charming creature entangled as i am in my own inventions puzzles me ten thousand times more than i her  letter xlv mr lovelace to john bblford esquire thursday noon june    let me perish if i know what to make either of myself or of this surprising creature  now calm now tempestuous  but i know thou love not anticipation any more than me  at my repeated requests she met me at six this morning she was ready dressed for she has not had her clothes off ever since she declared that they never more should be off in this house and charmingly she looked with all the disadvantages of a three hours violent stomachach for dorcas told me that she had been really ill no rest and eyes red and swelled with weeping strange to me that those charming fountains have not been long ago exhausted but she is a woman and i believe anatomists allow that women have more watery heads than men  well my dearest creature i hope you have now thoroughly considered of the contents of captain tomlinsons letter but as we are thus early met let me beseech you to make this my happy day  she looked not favorably upon me a cloud hung upon her brow at her entrance but as she was going to answer me a still greater solemnity took possession of her charming features  your air and your countenance my beloved creature are not propitious to me let me beg of you before you speak to forbear all further recriminations for already i have such a sense of my vileness to you that i know not how to bear the reproaches of my own mind  i have been endeavoring said she since i am not permitted to avoid you after a composure which i never more expected to see you in how long i may enjoy it i cannot tell but i hope i shall be enabled to speak to you without that vehemence which i expressed yesterday and could not help it the lady in her minutes says i fear dorcas is a false one may i not be able to prevail upon him to leave me at my liberty better to try than to trust to her if i cannot prevail but must meet him and my uncle i hope i shall have fortitude enough to renounce him then but i would fain avoid qualifying with the wretch or to give him an expectation which i intend not to answer if i am mistress of my own resolutions my uncle himself shall not prevail with me to bind my soul in covenant with so vile a man   after a pause for i was all attention thus she proceeded  it easy for me mr lovelace to see that further violences are intended me if i comply not with your purposes whatever they are i will suppose them to be what you so solemnly profess they are but i have told you as solemnly my mind that i never will that i never can be yours nor if so any mans upon earth all vengeance nevertheless for the wrongs you have done me i disclaim i want but to slide into some obscure corner to hide myself from you and from every one who once loved me the desire lately so near my heart of a reconciliation with my friends is much abated they shall not receive me now if they would sunk in my own eyes i now think myself unworthy of their favor in the anguish of my soul therefore i conjure you lovelace tears in her eyes to leave me to my fate in doing so you will give me a pleasure the highest i now can know  whither my dearest life   no matter whither i will leave to providence when i am out of this house the direction of my future steps i am sensible enough of my destitute condition i know that i have not now a friend in the world even miss how has given me up  or you are  but i would fain keep my temper  by your means i have lost them all  and you have been a barbarous enemy to me you know you have  she paused  i could not speak  the evils i have suffered proceeded she turning from me however irreparable are but temporary evils  leave me to my hopes of being enabled to obtain the divine forgiveness for the offense i have been drawn in to give to my parents and to virtue that so i may avoid the evils that are more than temporary this is in now all i have to wish for and what is it that i demand that i have not a right to and from which it is an illegal violence to withold me  it was impossible for me i told her plainly to comply i besought her to give me her hand as this very day i could not live without her i communicated to her my lords illness as a reason why i wished not to stay for her uncles anniversary i besought her to bless me with her consent and after the ceremony was passed to accompany me down  berks and thus my dearest life said i will yo be freed from a house to which you have conceive so great an antipathy  this thou will own was a princely offer and i was resolved to be as good as my word i though i had killed my conscience as i told thee belford some time ago but conscience i find though it man be temporarily stifled cannot die and when it da not speak aloud will whisper and at this instant i thought i felt the revived varletess on but a slight retrograde motion writhing round my pericardium like a serpent and in the action of a dying one collecting all its force into its head fix its plaguey fangs into my heart  she hesitated and looked down as if irresolute and this set my heart up at my mouth and believe me i had instantly popt in upon me in imagination an old spectacled parson with a white surplice thrown over a black habit a fit emblem of the halcyon office which under a benign appearance often introduces a life of storms and tempests whining and snuffling through his nose the irrevocable ceremony  i hope now my dear life said i snatching her hand and pressing it to my lips that your silence bodes me good let me my beloved creature have but your tacit consent this moment to step out and engage a minister  and then i promised how much my whole future life should be devoted to her commands and that i would make her the best and tenderest of husbands  at last turning to me i have told you my mind mr lovelace said she think you that i could thus solemnly  there she stopped  i am too much in your power proceeded she your prisoner rather than a person free to choose for myself or to say what i will do or be  but as a testimony that you mean me well let me instantly quit this house and i will then give you such an answer in writing as best befits my unhappy circumstances  and imaginest thou fairest thought i that this will go down with a lovelace thou ought to have known that freelivers like ministers of state never part with a power put into their hands without an equivalent of twice the value  i pleaded that if we joined hands this morning if not tomorrow if not on thursday her uncles birthday and in his presence and afterward as i had proposed set out for berks we should of course quit this house and on our return to town should have in readiness the house i was in treaty for  she answered me not but with tears and sighs fond of believing what i hoped i imputed her silence to the modesty of her sex the dear creature thought i solemnly as she began with me is ruminating in a sweet suspense how to put into fit words the gentle purposes of her condescending heart but looking in her averted face with a soothing gentleness i plainly perceived that it was resentment and not bashfulness that was struggling in her bosom the lady in her minutes owns the difficulty she lay under to keep her temper in this conference but when i found says she that all my entreaties were ineffectual and that he was resolved to detain me i could no longer withold my impatience   at last she broke silence  i have no patience said she to find myself a slave a prisoner in a vile house  tell me sir in so many words tell me whether it be or be not your intention to permit me to quit it  to permit me the freedom which is my birthright as an english subject  will not the consequence of your departure hence be that i shall lose you for ever madam  and can i bear the thoughts of that  she flung from me  my soul disdains to hold parley with thee were her violent words  but i threw myself at her feet and took hold of her reluctant hand and began to imprecate to vow to promise  but thus the passionate beauty interrupting me went on  i am sick of thee man  one continued string of vows oaths and protestations varied only by time and place fill thy mouth  why detainest thou me my heart rises against thee o thou cruel implement of my brothers causeless vengeance  all i beg of thee is that thou will remit me the future part of my fathers dreadful curse the temporary part base and ungrateful as thou art thou have completed  i was speechless  well i might  her brothers implement  james harlowes implement  zounds jack what words were these  i let go her struggling hand she took two or three turns cross the room her whole haughty soul in her air  then approaching me but in silence turning from me and again to me in a milder voice  i see thy confusion lovelace or is it thy remorse  i have but one request to make thee  the request so often repeated  that thou will this moment permit me to quit this house adieu then let me say for ever adieu and may thou enjoy that happiness in this world which thou have robbed me of as thou have of every friend i have in it  and saying this away she flung leaving me in a confusion so great that i knew not what to think say or do  but dorcas soon roused me  do you know sir i running in hastily that my lady is gone down stairs  no sure  and down i flew and found her once more at the streetdoor contending with polly horton to get out  she rushed by me into the foreparlour and flew to the window and attempted once more to throw up the sash  good people good people cried she  i caught her in my arms and lifted her from the window but being afraid of hurting the charming creature charming in her very rage she slid through my arms on the floor  let me die here let me die here were her words remaining jointless and immovable till sally and mrs sinclair hurried in  she was visibly terrified at the sight of the old wretch while i sincerely affected appealed bear witness mrs sinclair  bear witness miss martin  miss horton  every one bear witness that i offer not violence to this beloved creature  she then found her feet  o house looking toward the windows and all round her o house contrived on purpose for my ruin said she  but let not that woman come into my presence  nor that miss horton neither who would not have dared to control me had she not been a base one  hoh sir hoh madam vociferated the old creature her arms kemboed and flourishing with one foot to the extent of her petticoats  what ados here about nothing  i never knew such work in my life between a chicken of a gentleman and a tiger of a lady   she was visibly affrighted and up stairs she hastened a bad woman is certainly jack more terrible to her own sex than even a bad man  i followed her up she rushed by her own apartment into the dining room no terror can make her forget her punctilio  to recite what passed there of invective exclamations threatenings even of her own life on one side of expostulations supplications and sometimes menaces on the other would be too affecting and after my particularity in like scenes these things may as well be imagined as expressed  i will therefore only mention that at length i extorted a concession from her she had reason the lady mentions in her memorandumbook that she had no other way as she apprehended to save herself from instant dishonor but by making this concession her only hope now she says if she cannot escape by dorcass connivance whom nevertheless she suspects is to find a way to engage the protection of her uncle and even of the civil magistrate on thursday next if necessary he shall see she says tame and timid as he has thought her what she dare to do to avoid so hated a compulsion and a man capable of a baseness so premeditatedly vile and inhuman to think it would have been worse for her on the spot if she had not made it it was that she would endeavor to make herself easy till she saw what next thursday her uncles birthday would produce but o that it were not a sin she passionately exclaimed on making this poor concession to put an end to her own life rather than yield to give me but that assurance  this however shows me that she is aware that the reluctantlygiven assurance may be fairly construed into a matrimonial expectation on my side and if she will now even now look forward i think from my heart that i will put on her livery and wear it for life  what a situation am i in with all my cursed inventions i am puzzled confounded and ashamed of myself upon the whole to take such pains to be a villain  but for the fiftieth time let me ask thee who would have thought that there had been such a woman in the world  nevertheless she had best take care that she carries not her obstinacy much further she knows not what revenge for slighted love will make me do  the busy scenes i have just passed through have given emotions to my heart which will not be quieted one while my heart i see on reperusing what i have written has communicated its tremors to my fingers and in some places the characters are so indistinct and unformed that thou wilt hardly be able to make them out but if one half of them only are intelligible that will be enough to expose me to thy contempt for the wretched hand i have made of my plots and contrivances  but surely jack i have gained some ground by this promise  and now one word to the assurances thou sendest me that thou have not betrayed my secrets in relation to this charming creature thou might have spared them belford my suspicions held no longer than while i wrote about them see p     of this volume  for well i knew when i allowed myself time to think that thou had no principles no virtue to be misled by a great deal of strong envy and a little of weak pity i knew to be thy motives thou could not provoke my anger and my compassion thou ever had and art now more especially entitled to it beause thou art a pityful fellow  all thy new expostulations in my beloveds behalf i will answer when i see thee  letter xlvi mr lovelace to john belford esquire thursday night confoundedly out of humor with this perverse lady nor will thou blame me if thou art my friend she regards the concession she made as a concession extorted from her and we are but just where we were before she made it  with great difficulty i prevailed upon her to favor me with her company for one halfhour this evening the necessity i was under to go down to m hall was the subject i wanted to talk to her upon  i told her that as she had been so good as to promise that she would endeavor to make herself easy till she saw the thursday in next week over  i hoped that she would not scruple to oblige me with her word that i should find her here at my return from m hall  indeed she would make me no such promise nothing of this house was mentioned to me said she you know it was not and do you think that i would have given my consent to my imprisonment in it  i was plaguily nettled and disappointed too if i go not down to m hall madam you will have no scruple to stay here i suppose till thursday is over  if i cannot help myself i must  but i insist upon being permitted to go out of this house whether you leave it or not  well madam then i will comply with your commands and i will go out this very evening in quest of lodgings that you shall have no objection to  i will have no lodgings of your providing sir  i will go to mrs moores at hamstead  mrs moores madam  i have no objection to mrs moores  but will you give me your promise to admit me there to your presence  as i do here  when i cannot help it  very well madam  will you be so good as to let me know what you intended by your promise to make yourself easy   to endeavor sir to make myself easy  were the words    till you saw what next thursday would produce  ask me no questions that may ensnare me i am too sincere for the company i am in  let me ask you madam what meant you when you said that were it not a sin you would die before you gave me that assurance  she was indignantly silent  you thought madam you had given me room to hope your pardon by it  when i think i ought to answer you with patience i will speak  do you think yourself in my power madam  if i were not  and there she stopped   dearest creature speak out  i beseech you dearest creature speak out   she was silent her charming face all in a glow  have you madam any reliance upon my honor  still silent  you hate me madam you despise me more than you do the most odious of gods creatures  you ought to despise me if i did not  you say madam you are in a bad house you have no reliance upon my honor  you believe you cannot avoid me   she arose i beseech you let me withdraw  i snatched her hand rising and pressed it first to my lips and then to my heart in wild disorder she might have felt the bounding mischief ready to burst its bars  you shall go  to your own apartment if you please  but by the great god of heaven i will accompany you thither  she trembled  pray pray mr lovelace dont terrify me so  be seated madam i beseech you be seated   i will sit down   do then madam  do then  all my soul in my eyes and my hearts blood throbbing at my fingers ends  i will  i will  you hurt me  pray mr lovelace dont  dont frighten me so  and down she sat trembling my hand still grasping hers  i hung over her throbbing bosom and putting my other arm round her waist  and you say you hate me madam  and you say you despise me  and you say you promised me nothing   yes yes i did promise you  let me not be held down thus  you see i sat down when you bid me  why struggling need you hold me down thus  i did promise to endeavor to be easy till thursday was over but you will not let me  how can i be easy  pray let me not be thus terrified  and what madam meant you by your promise did you mean anything in my favor  you designed that i should at the time think you did did you mean any thing in my favor madam  did you intend that i should think you did  let go my hand sir  take away your arm from about me struggling yet trembling  why do you gaze upon me so  answer me madam  did you mean any thing in my favor by your promise  let me not be thus constrained to answer  then pausing and gaining more spirit let me go said she i am but a woman  but a weak woman  but my life is in my own power though my person is not  i will not be thus constrained  you shall not madam quitting her hand bowing but my heart at my mouth and hoping farther provocation  she arose and was hurrying away  i pursue you not madam  i will try your generosity  stop  return  this moment stop return if madam you would not make me desperate  she stopped at the door burst into tears  o lovelace  how how have i deserved   be pleased dearest angel to return  she came back  but with declared reluctance and imputing her compliance to terror  terror jack as i have heretofore found out though i have so little benefited by the discovery must be my resort if she make it necessary  nothing else will do with the inflexible charmer  she seated herself over against me extremely discomposed  but indignation had a visible predominance in her features  i was going toward her with a countenance intendedly changed to love and softness sweetest dearest angel were my words in the tenderest accent  but rising up she insisted upon my being seated at distance from her  i obeyed  and begged her hand over the table to my extended hand to see as i said if in any thing she would oblige me  but nothing gentle soft or affectionate would do she refused me her hand  was she wise jack to confirm to me that nothing but terror would do  let me only know madam if your promise to endeavor to wait with patience the event of next thursday meant me favor  do you expect any voluntary favor from one to whom you give not a free choice  do you intend madam to honor me with your hand in your uncles presence or do you not  my heart and my hand shall never be separated why think you did i stand in opposition to the will of my best my natural friends  i know what you mean madam  am i then as hateful to you as the vile solmes  ask me not such a question mr lovelace  i must be answered am i as hateful to you as the vile solmes  why do you call mr solmes vile  dont you think him so madam  why should i did mr solmes ever do vilely by me  dearest creature dont distract me by hateful comparisons and perhaps by a more hateful preference  dont you sir put questions to me that you know i will answer truly though my answer were ever so much to enrage you  my heart madam my soul is all yours at present but you must give me hope that your promise in your own construction binds you no new cause to the contrary to be mine on thursday how else can i leave you  let me go to hamstead and trust to my favor  may i trust to it  say only may i trust to it  how will you trust to it if you extort an answer to this question  say only dearest creature say only may i trust to your favor if you go to hamstead  how dare you sir if i must speak out expect a promise of favor from me  what a mean creature must you think me after your ungrateful baseness to me were i to give you such a promise  then standing up thou have made me o vilest of men her hands clasped and a face crimsoned over with indignation an inmate of the vilest of houses  nevertheless while i am in it i shall have a heart incapable of any thing but abhorrence of that and of thee  and round her looked the angel and upon me with fear in her sweet aspect of the consequence of her free declaration  but what a devil must i have been i who love bravery in a man had i not been more struck with admiration of her fortitude at the instant than stimulated by revenge  noblest of creatures  and do you think i can leave you and my interest in such an excellence precarious no promise  no hope  if you make me not desperate may lightning blast me if i do you not all the justice it is in my power to do you  if you have any intention to oblige me leave me at my own liberty and let me not be detained in this abominable house to be constrained as i have been constrained to be stopped by your vile agents to be brought up by force and to be bruised in my own defense against such illegal violence  i dare to die lovelace  and the person that fears not death is not to be intimidated into a meanness unworthy of her heart and principles  wonderful creature but why madam did you lead me to hope for something favorable for next thursday  once more make me not desperate  with all your magnanimity glorious creature i was more than half frantic belford you may you may  but do not do not make me brutally threaten you  do not do not make me desperate  my aspect i believe threatened still more than my words i was rising  she arose  mr lovelace be pacified  you are even more dreadful than the lovelace i have long dreaded  let me retire  i ask your leave to retire  you really frighten me  yet i give you no hope  from my heart i ab   say not madam you abhor me  you must for your own sake conceal your hatred  at least not avow it  i seized her hand  let me retire  let me retire said she  in a manner out of breath  i will only say madam that i refer myself to your generosity my heart is not to be trusted at this instant as a mark of my submission to your will you shall if you please withdraw  but i will not go to m hall  live or die my uncle i will not go to m hall  but will attend the effect of your promise remember madam you have promised to endeavor to make yourself easy till you see the event of next thursday  next thursday remember your uncle comes up to see us married  that is the event  you think ill of your lovelace  do not madam suffer your own morals to be degraded by the infection as you called it of his example  away flew the charmer with this halfpermission  and no doubt thought that she had an escapenor without reason  i knew not for half an hour what to do with myself vexed at the heart nevertheless now she was from me when i reflected upon her hatred of me and her defiances that i suffered myself to be so overawed checked restrained   and now i have written thus far having of course recollected the whole of our conversation i am more and more incensed against myself  but i will go down to these women  and perhaps suffer myself to be laughed at by them  devil fetch them they pretend to know their own sex sally was a woman well educated  polly also  both have read  both have sense  of parentage not contemptible  once modest both  still they say had been modest but for me  not entirely indelicate now though too little nice for my personal intimacy loath as they both are to have me think so  the old one too a woman of family though thus from bad inclination as well as at first from low circumstances miserably sunk  and hence they all pretend to remember what once they were and vouch for the inclinations and hypocrisy of the whole sex and wish for nothing so ardently as that i will leave the perverse lady to their management while i am gone to berkshire undertaking absolutely for her humility and passiveness on my return and continually boasting of the many perverse creatures whom they have obliged to draw in their traces  they often upbraidingly tell me that they are sure i shall marry at last  and sally the last time i was with her had the confidence to hint that when a wife some other person would not find half the difficulty that i had found  confidence indeed but yet i must say that this dear creature is the only woman in the world of whom i should not be jealous and yet if a man gives himself up to the company of these devils they never let him rest till he either suspect or hate his wife  but a word or two of other matters if possible  methinks i long to know how causes go at m hall i have another private intimation that the old peer is in the greatest danger  i must go down yet what to do with this lady the mean while  these cursed women are full of cruelty and enterprise she will never be easy with them in my absence they will have provocation and pretense therefore but woe be to them if   yet what will vengeance do after an insult committed the two nymphs will have jealous rage o goad them on  and what will withold a jealous and alreadyruined woman  to let her go elsewhere that cannot he done i am still resolved to be honest if she will give me hope if yet she will let me be honest  but i will see how she will be after the contention she will certainly have between her resentment and the terror she had reason for from our last conversation  so let this subject rest till the morning and to the old peer once more  i shall have a good deal of trouble i reckon though no sordid man to be decent on the expected occasion then how to act i who am no hypocrite in the days of condolement what farces have i to go through and to be a principal actor in them  i will try to think of my own latter end a gray beard and a graceless heir in order to make me serious  thou belford know a good deal of this sort of grimace and can help a gay heart to a little of the dismal but then every feature of thy face is cut out for it my heart may be touched perhaps sooner than thine for believe me or not i have a very tender one  but then no man looking in my face be the occasion for grief ever so great will believe that heart to be deeply distressed  all is placid easy serene in my countenance sorrow cannot sit half an hour together upon it nay i believe that lord ms recovery should it happen would not affect me above a quarter of an hour only the new scenery and the pleasure of aping an heraclitus to the family while i am a democritus among my private friends or i want nothing that the old peer can leave me wherefore then should grief sadden and distort such blythe such jocund features as mine  but as for thine were there murder committed in the street and thou were but passing by the murderer even in sight the pursuers would quit him and lay hold of thee and thy very looks would hang as well as apprehend thee  but one word to business jack whom dealtest thou with for thy blacks  were thou well used  i shall want a plaguey parcel of them for i intend to make every soul of the family mourn  outside if not in   letter xlvii mr lovelace to john belford esquire june    friday morning i went out early this morning on a design that i know not yet whether i shall or shall not pursue and on my return found simon parsons my lords berkshire bailiff just before arrived waiting for me with a message in form sent by all the family to press me to go down and that at my lords particular desire who wants to see me before he dies  simon has brought my lords chariotandsix perhaps my own by this time to carry me down i have ordered it to be in readiness by four tomorrow morning the cattle shall smoke for the delay and by the rest they will have in the interim will be better able to bear it  i am still resolved upon matrimony if my fair perverse will accept of me but if she will not  why then i must give an uninterrupted hearing not to my conscience but to these women below  dorcas had acquainted her lady with simons arrival and errand my beloved had desired to see him but my coming in prevented his attendance on her just as dorcas was instructing him what questions he should not answer to that might be asked of him  i am to be admitted to her presence immediately at my repeated request  surely the acquisition in view will help me to make all up with her  she is just gone up to the dining room  nothing will do jack  i can procure no favor from her though she has obtained from me the point which she had set her heart upon  i will give thee a brief account of what passed between us  i first proposed instant marriage and this in the most fervent manner but was denied as fervently  would she be pleased to assure me that she would stay here only till tuesday morning i would but just go down and see how my lord was  to know whether he had any thing particular to say or injoin me while yet he was sensible as he was very earnest to see me  perhaps i might be up on sunday  concede in something  i beseech you madam show me some little consideration  why mr lovelace must i be determined by your motions  think you that i will voluntarily give a sanction to the imprisonment of my person of what importance to me ought to be your stay or your return  give a sanction to the imprisonment of your person do you think madam that i fear the law   i might have spared this foolish question of defiance  but my pride would not let me i thought she threatened me jack  i dont think so sir  you are too brave to have any regard either to moral or divine sanctions  it is well madam  but ask me any thing i can do to oblige you and i will oblige you though in nothing will you oblige me  then i ask you then i request of you to let me go to hamstead  i paused  and at last  by my soul you shall  this very moment i will wait upon you and see you fixed there if you will promise me your hand on thursday in presence of your uncle  i want not you to see me fixed  i will promise nothing  take care madam that you dont let me see that i can have no reliance upon your future favor  i have been used to be threatened by you sir  but i will accept of your company to hamstead  i will be ready to go in a quarter of an hour  my clothes may be sent after me  you know the condition madam  next thursday  you dare not trust   my infinite demerits tell me that i ought not  nevertheless i will confide in your generosity  tomorrow morning no new cause arising to give reason to the contrary as early as you please you may go to hamstead  this seemed to oblige her but yet she looked with a face of doubt  i will go down to the women and having no better judges at hand will hear what they say upon my critical situation with this proud beauty who has so insolently rejected a lovelace kneeling at her feet though making an earnest tender of himself for a husband in spite of all his prejudices to the state of shackles  letter xlviii mr lovelace to john belford esquire just come from the women  have i gone so far and am i afraid to go farther  have i not already as it is evident by her behavior sinned beyond forgiveness  a womans tears used to be to me but as water sprinkled on a glowing fire which gives it a fiercer and brighter blaze what defense has this lady but her tears and her eloquence she was before taken at no weak advantage she was insensible in her moments of trial had she been sensible she must have been sensible so they say the methods taken with her have augmented her glory and her pride she has now a tale to tell that she may tell with honor to herself no accompliceinclination she can look me into confusion without being conscious of so much as a thought which she need to be ashamed of  this jack the substance of my conference with the women  to which let me add that the dear creature now sees the necessity i am in to leave her detecting me is in her head my contrivances are of such a nature that i must appear to be the most odious of men if i am detected on this side matrimony and yet i have promised as thou see that she shall set out to hamstead as soon as she pleases in the morning and that without condition on her side  do thou ask what i meant by this promise  no new cause arising was the proviso on my side thou wilt remember but there will be a new cause  suppose dorcas should drop the promisorynote given her by her lady servants especially those who cannot read or write are the most careless people in the world of written papers suppose i take it up  at a time too that i was determined that the dear creature should be her own mistress  will not this detection be a new cause  a cause that will carry against her the appearance of ingratitude with it  that she designed it a secret from me argues a fear of detection and indirectly a sense of guilt i wanted a pretense can i have a better if i am in a violent passion upon the detection is not passion an universally allowed extenuator of violence  is not every man and woman obliged to excuse that fault in another which at times they find attended with such ungovernable effects in themselves  the mother and sisterhood suppose brought to sit in judgment upon the vile corrupted  the least benefit that must accrue from the accidental discovery if not a pretense for perpetration which however may be the case an excuse for renewing my orders for her detention till my return from m hall the fault her own and for keeping a stricter watch over her than before with direction to send me any letters that may be written by her or to her  and when i return the devils in it if i find not a way to make her choose lodgings for herself since these are so hateful to her that shall answer all my purposes and yet no more appear to direct her choice than i did before in these  thou will curse me when thou come to this place i know thou will but think thou that after such a series of contrivance i will lose this inimitable woman for want of a little more a rakes a rake jack  and what rake is withheld by principle from the perpetration of any evil his heart is set upon and in which he thinks he can succeed  besides am i not in earnest as to marriage  will not the generality of the world acquit me if i do marry and what is that injury which a churchrite will at any time repair is not the catastrophe of every story that ends in wedlock accounted happy be the difficulties in the progress to it ever so great  but here how am i engrossed by this lady while poor lord m as simon tells me lies groaning in the dreadfulest agonies  what must he suffer  heaven relieve him  i have a too compassionate heart and so would the dear creature have found could i have thought the worst of her sufferings equal to the lightest of his i mean as to fact for as to that part of hers which arises from extreme sensibility i know nothing of that and cannot therefore be answerable for it  letter xlix mr lovelace to john belford esquire just come from my charmer she will not suffer me to say half the obliging the tender things which my honest heart is ready to overflow with a confounded situation that when a man finds himself in humor to be eloquent and pathetic at the same time yet cannot engage the mistress of his fate to lend an ear to his fine speeches  i can account now how it comes about that lovers when their mistresses are cruel run into solitude and disburthen their minds to stocks and stones for am i not forced to make my complaints to thee  she claimed the performance of my promise the moment she saw me of permitting her haughtily she spoke the word to go to hamstead as soon as i were gone to berks  most cheerfully i renewed it  she desired me to give orders in her hearing  i sent for dorcas and will they came  do you both take notice but perhaps sir i may take you with me that your lady is to be obeyed in all her commands she purposes to return to hamstead as soon as i am gone  my dear will you not have a servant to attend you  i shall want no servant there  will you take dorcas  if i should want dorcas i can send for her  dorcas could not but say she should be very proud   well well that may be at my return if your lady permit  shall i my dear call up mrs sinclair and give her orders to the same effect in your hearing  i desire not to see mrs sinclair nor any that belong to her  as you please madam  and then the servants being withdrawn i urged her again for the assurance that she would meet me at the altar on thursday next but to no purpose may she not thank herself for all that may follow  one favor however i would not be denied to be admitted to pass the evening with her  all sweetness and obsequiousness will i be on this occasion my whole soul shall be poured out to move her to forgive me if she will not and if the promisorynote should fall in my way my revenge will doubtless take total possession of me  all the house in my interest and every one in it not only engaging to intimidate and assist as occasion shall offer but staking all their experience upon my success if it be not my own fault what must be the consequence  this jack however shall be her last trial and if she behave as nobly in and after this second attempt all her senses about her as she has done after the first she will come out an angel upon full proof in spite of man woman and devil then shall there be an end of all her sufferings i will then renounce that vanquished devil and reform and if any vile machination start up presuming to mislead me i will sooner stab it in my heart as it rises than give way to it  a few hours will now decide all but whatever be the event i shall be too busy to write again till i get to m hall  mean time i am in strange agitations i must suppress them if possible before i venture into her presence  my heart bounces my bosom from the table i will lay down my pen and wholly resign to its impulses  letter l mr lovelace to john belford esquire frid night or rather sat morn   oclock i thought i should not have had either time or inclination to write another line before i got to m hall but have the first must find the last since i can neither sleep nor do any thing but write if i can do that i am most confoundedly out of humor the reason let it follow if it will follow  no preparation for it from me  i tried by gentleness and love to soften  what  marble a heart incapable either of love or gentleness her past injuries for ever in her head ready to receive a favor the permission to go to hamstead but neither to deserve it nor return any so my scheme of the gentle kind was soon given over  i then wanted her to provoke me like a coward boy who waits for the first blow before he can persuade himself to fight i half challenged her to challenge or defy me she seemed aware of her danger and would not directly brave my resentment but kept such a middle course that i neither could find a pretense to offend nor reason to hope yet she believed my tale that her uncle would come to kentish town and seemed not to apprehend that tomlinson was an impostor  she was very uneasy upon the whole in my company wanted often to break from me yet so held me to my promise of permitting her to go to hamstead that i knew not how to get off of it although it was impossible in my precarious situation with her to think of performing it  in this situation the women ready to assist and if i proceeded not as ready to ridicule me what had i left me but to pursue the concerted scheme and seek a pretense to quarrel with her in order to revoke my promised permission and to convince her that i would not be upbraided as the most brutal of ravishers for nothing  i had agreed with the women that if i could not find a pretense in her presence to begin my operations the note should lie in my way and i was to pick it up soon after her retiring from me but i began to doubt at near ten oclock so earnest was she to leave me suspecting my overwarm behavior to her and eager grasping of her hand two or three times with eyestrings as i felt on the strain while her eyes showed uneasiness and apprehension that if she actually retired for the night it might be a chance whether it would be easy to come at her again loath therefore to run such a risque i stepped out at a little after ten with intent to alter the preconcerted disposition a little saying i would attend her again instantly but as i returned i met her at the door intending to withdraw for the night i could not persuade her to go back nor had i presence of mind so full of complaisancy as i was to her just before to stay her by force so she slid through my hands into her own apartment i had nothing to do therefore but to let my former concert take place  i should have premised but care not for order of time connection or any thing else that between eight and nine oclock in the evening another servant of lord ms on horseback came to desire me to carry down with me dr s my uncle having been once  in extremis as they judge he is now relieved and reprieved by him i sent and engaged the doctor to accompany me down and am to call upon him by four this morning or the devil should have uncle and doctor if i would stir till i got all made up  poke thy damned nose forward into the event if thou will  curse me if thou shall have it till its proper time and place  and too soon then  she had hardly got into her chamber but i found a little paper as i was going into mine which i took up and opening it for it was carefully pinned in another paper what should it be but a promisory note given as a bribe with a further promise of a diamond ring to induce dorcas to favor her mistresss escape  how my temper changed in a moment  ring ring ring ring my bell with a violence enough to break the string and as if the house were on fire  every devil frighted into active life the whole house in an uproar up runs will  sir  sir  sir  eyes goggling mouth distended  bid the damned toad dorcas come hither as i stood at the stairhead in a horrible rage and out of breath cried i  in sight came the trembling devil  but standing aloof from the report made her by will of the passion i was in as well as from what she heard  flash came out my sword immediately for i had it ready on  cursed confounded villainous bribery and corruption   up runs she to her ladys door screaming out for safety and protection  good your honor interposed will for gods sake  o lord o lord  receiving a good cuff   take that varlet for saving the ungrateful wretch from my vengeance   wretch i intended to say but if it were some other word of like ending passion must be my excuse  up ran two or three of the sisterhood what is the matter what is the matter  the matter for still my beloved opened not her door on the contrary drew another bolt this abominable dorcas  call her aunt up  let her see what a traitress she has placed about me  and let her bring the toad to answer for herself  has taken a bribe a provision for life to betray her trust by that means to perpetuate a quarrel between a man and his wife and frustrate for ever all hopes of reconciliation between us  let me perish belford if i have patience to proceed with the farce  up came the aunt puffing and blowing  as she hoped for mercy she was not privy to it  she never knew such a plotting perverse lady in her life  well might servants be at the pass they were when such ladies as mrs lovelace made no conscience of corrupting them for her part she desired no mercy for the wretch no niece of hers if she were not faithful to her trust  but what was the proof   she was shown the paper   but too evident  cursed cursed toad devil jade passed from each mouth  and the vileness of the corrupted and the unworthiness of the corruptress were inveighed against  up we all went passing the ladys door into the dining room to proceed to trial   stamp stamp stamp up each on her heels rave rave rave every tongue   bring up the creature before us all this instant   and would she have got out of the house say you   these the noises and the speeches as we clatterd by the door of the fair briberess   up was brought dorcas whimpering between two both bawling out  you must go you shall go  it is fit you should answer for yourself  you are a discredit to all worthy servants  as they pulled and pushed her up stairs  she whining i cannot see his honor  i cannot look so good and so generous a gentleman in the face  o how shall i bear my aunts ravings   come up and be d  nd  bring her forward her imperial judge  what a plague it is the detection not the crime that confounds you you could be quiet enough for days together as i see by the date under the villainy tell me ungrateful devil tell me who made the first advances  ay disgrace to my family and blood cried the old one  tell his honor tell the truth  who mde the first advances   ay cursed creature cried sally who made the first advances  i have betrayed one trust already  o let me not betray another  my lady is a good lady  o let not her suffer   tell all you know tell the whole truth dorcas cried polly horton  his honor loves his lady too well to make her suffer much little as she requites his love   everybody sees that cried sally  too well indeed for his honor i was going to say  till now i thought she deserved my love but to bribe a servant thus whom she supposed had orders to watch her steps for fear of another elopement and to impute that precaution to me as a crime  yet i must love her  ladies forgive my weakness   curse upon my grimaces  if i have patience to repeat them  but thou shall have them all  thou can not despise me more than i despise myself   but suppose sir said sally you have my lady and the wench face to face you see she cares not to confess  o my carelessness cried dorcas  dont let my poor lady suffer  indeed if you all knew what i know you would say her ladyship has been cruelly treated   see  see  see  see  repeatedly every one at once  only sorry for the detection as your honor said  not the fault   cursed creature and devilish creature from every mouth  your lady will not she dare not come out to save you cried sally though it is more his honors mercy than your desert if he does not cut your vile throat this instant  say repeated polly was it your lady that made the first advances or was it you you creature   if the lady has so much honor bawled the mother excuse me so  excuse me sir  confound the old wretch she had like to have said son  if the lady has so much honor as we have supposed she will appear to vindicate a poor servant misled as she has been by such large promises  but i hope sir you will do them both justice i hope you will  good lack good lack clapping her hands together to grant her every thing she could ask to indulge her in her unworthy hatred to my poor innocent house to let her go to hamstead though your honor told us you could get no condescension from her no not the least  o sir  o sir  i hope  i hope  if your lady will not come out  i hope you will find a way to hear this cause in her presence i value not my doors on such an occasion as this justice i ever loved i desire you will come at the bottom of it in clearance to me  i will be sworn i had no privity in this black corruption  just then we heard the ladys door unbar unlock unbolt   now sir  now mr lovelace  now sir from every encouraging mouth   but o jack jack jack i can write no more  if you must have it all you must  now belford see us all sitting in judgment resolved to punish the fair briberess  i and the mother the hitherto dreaded mother the nieces sally polly the traitress dorcas and mabell a guard as it were over her that she might not run away and hide herself  all predetermined and of necessity predetermined from the journey i was going to take and my precarious situation with her  and hear her unbolt unlock unbar the door then as it proved afterward put the key into the lock on the outside lock the door and put it in her pocket will i knew below who would give me notice if while we were all above she should mistake her way and go down stairs instead of coming into the dining room the streetdoors also doubly secured and every shutter to the windows round the house fastened that no noise or screaming should be heard such was the brutal preparation  and then hear her step toward us and instantly see her enter among us confiding in her own innocence and with a majesty in her person and manner that is natural to her but which then shone out in all its glory  every tongue silent every eye awed every heart quaking mine in a particular manner sunk throbless and twice below its usual region to once at my throat  a shameful recreant  she silent too looking round her first on me then on the mother as no longer fearing her then on sally polly and the culprit dorcas  such the glorious power of innocence exerted at that awful moment  she would have spoken but could not looking down my guilt into confusion a mouse might have been heard passing over the floor her own light feet and rustling silks could not have prevented it for she seemed to tread air and to be all soul  she passed to the door and back toward me two or three times before speech could get the better of indignation and at last after twice or thrice hemming to recover her articulate voice  o thou contemptible and abandoned lovelace think thou that i see not through this poor villainous plot of thine and of these thy wicked accomplices  thou woman looking at the mother once my terror always my dislike but now my detestation should once more for thine perhaps was the preparation have provided for me intoxicating potions to rob me of my senses   and then turning to me thou wretch might more securely have depended upon such a low contrivance as this   and ye vile women who perhaps have been the ruin body and soul of hundreds of innocents you show me how in full assembly know that i am not married  ruined as i am by your helps i bless god i am not married to this miscreant  and i have friends that will demand my honor at your hands  and to whose authority i will apply for none has this man over me look to it then what further insults you offer me or incite him to offer me i am a person though thus vilely betrayed of rank and fortune i never will be his and to your utter ruin will find friends to pursue you and now i have this full proof of your detestable wickedness and have heard your base incitements will have no mercy upon you   they could not laugh at the poor figure i made  lord how every devil conscienceshaken trembled   what a dejection must ever fall to the lot of guilt were it given to innocence always thus to exert itself   and as for thee thou vile dorcas  thou double deceiver  whining out thy pretended love for me  begone wretch  nobody will hurt thee  begone i say  thou have too well acted thy part to be blamed by any here but myself  thou art safe thy guilt is thy security in such a house as this  thy shameful thy poor part thou have as well acted as the low farce could give thee to act  as well as they each of them thy superiors though not thy betters thou see can act theirs  steal away into darkness no inquiry after this will be made whose the first advances thine or mine  and as i hope to live the wench confoundedly frightened slunk away so did her sentinel mabell though i endeavoring to rally cried out for dorcas to stay but i believe the devil could not have stopped her when an angel bid her begone  madam said i let me tell you and was advancing toward her with a fierce aspect most cursedly vexed and ashamed too   but she turned to me stop where thou art o vilest and most abandoned of men  stop where thou art  nor with that determined face offer to touch me if thou would not that i should be a corpse at thy feet  to my astonishment she held forth a penknife in her hand the point to her own bosom grasping resolutely the whole handle so that there was no offering to take it from her  i offer not mischief to anybody but myself you sir and ye women are safe from every violence of mine the law shall be all my resource the law and she spoke the word with emphasis that to such people carries natural terror with it and now struck a panic into them  no wonder since those who will damn themselves to procure ease and plenty in this world will tremble at every thing that seems to threaten their methods of obtaining that ease and plenty   the law only shall be my refuge   the infamous mother whispered me that it were better to make terms with this strange lady and let her go  sally notwithstanding all her impudent bravery at other times said if mr lovelace had told them what was not true of her being his wife   and polly horton that she must needs say the lady if she were not my wife had been very much injured that was all  that is not now a matter to be disputed cried i you and i know madam   we do so said she and i thank god i am not thine  once more i thank god for it i have no doubt of the further baseness that thou had intended me by this vile and low trick but i have my senses lovelace and from my heart i despise thee thou very poor lovelace how can thou stand in my presence  thou that   madam madam madam  these are insults not to be borne  and was approaching her she withdrew to the door and set her back against it holding the pointed knife to her heaving bosom while the women held me beseeching me not to provoke the violent lady  for their house sake and be cursed to them they besought me  and all three hung upon me  while the truly heroic lady braved me at that distance  approach me lovelace with resentment if thou will i dare die it is in defense of my honor god will be merciful to my poor soul  i expect no mercy from thee i have gained this distance and two steps nearer me and thou shall see what i dare do   leave me women to myself and to my angel  they retired at a distance  o my beloved creature how you terrify me  holding out my arms and kneeling on one knee  not a step not a step further except to receive the death myself at that injured hand that threatens its own  i am a villain the blackest or villains  say you will sheath your knife in the injurers not the injureds heart and then will i indeed approach you but not else  the mother twangd her damned nose and sally and polly pulled out their handkerchiefs and turned from us they never in their lives they told me afterward beheld such a scene   innocence so triumphant villainy so debased they must mean  unawares to myself i had moved onward to my angel  and do thou do thou still disclaiming still advancing  do thou do thou still insidiously move toward me and her hand was extended  i dare  i dare  not rashly neither  my heart from principle abhors the act which thou make necessary  god in thy mercy  lifting up her eyes and hands  god in thy mercy   i threw myself to the further end of the room an ejaculation a silent ejaculation employing her thoughts that moment polly says the whites of her lovely eyes were only visible and in the instant that she extended her hand assuredly to strike the fatal blow how the very recital tumults me she cast her eye toward me and saw me at the utmost distance the room would allow and heard my broken voice my voice was utterly broken nor knew i what i said or whether to the purpose or not and her charming cheeks that were all in a glow before turned pale as if terrified at her own purpose and lifting up her eyes  thank god  thank god said the angel  delivered for the present for the present delivered from myself  keep sir keep that distance looking down toward me who was prostrate on the floor my heart pierced as with an hundred daggers that distance has saved a life to what reserved the almighty only knows   to be happy madam and to make happy  and o let me but hope for your favor for tomorrow  i will put off my journey till then  and may god   swear not sir  with an awful and piercing aspect  you have tootoo often sworn  gods eye is upon us  his more immediate eye and looked wildly  but the women looked up to the ceiling and trembled as if afraid of gods eye and well they might and i too who so very lately had each of us the devil in our hearts  if not tomorrow madam say but next thursday your uncles birthday say but next thursday   this i say of this you may assure yourself i never never will be yours  and let me hope that i may be entitled to the performance of your promise to permit me to leave this innocent house as one called it but long have my ears been accustomed to such inversions of words as soon as the day breaks  did my perdition depend upon it that you cannot madam but upon terms and i hope you will not terrify me  still dreading the accursed knife  nothing less than an attempt upon my honor shall make me desperate  i have no view but to defend my honor with such a view only i entered into treaty with your infamous agent below the resolution you have seen i trust god will give me again upon the same occasion but for a less i wish not for it only take notice women that i am no wife of this man basely as he has used me i am not his wife he has no authority over me if he go away byandby and you act by his authority to detain me look to it  then taking one of the lights she turned from us and away she went unmolested  not a soul was able to molest her  mabell saw her tremblingly and in a hurry take the key of her chamber door out of her pocket and unlock it and as soon as she entered heard her double lock bar and bolt it  by her taking out her key when she came out of her chamber to us she no doubt suspected my design which was to have carried her in my arms thither if she made such force necessary after i had intimidated her and to have been her companion for that night  she was to have had several bedchamberwomen to assist to undress her upon occasion but from the moment she entered the dining room with so much intrepidity it was absolutely impossible to think of prosecuting my villainous designs against her  this this belford was the hand i made of a contrivance i expected so much from  and now am i ten times worse off than before  thou never saw people in thy life look so like fools upon one another as the mother her partners and i did for a few minutes and at last the two devilish nymphs broke out into insulting ridicule upon me while the old wretch was concerned for her house the reputation of her house i cursed them all together and retiring to my chamber locked myself in  and now it is time to set out all i have gained detection disgrace fresh guilt by repeated perjuries and to be despised by her i dote upon and what is still worse to a proud heart by myself  success success in projects is every thing what an admirable fellow did i think myself till now even for this scheme among the rest but how pitifully foolish does it appear to me now  scratch out erase never to be read every part of my preceding letters where i have boastingly mentioned it  and never presume to railly me upon the cursed subject for i cannot bear it  but for the lady by my soul i love her i admire her more than ever  i must have her i will have her still  with honor or without as i have often vowed  my cursed fright at her accidental bloody nose so lately put her upon improving upon me thus had she threatened me i should soon have been mistress of one arm and in both  but for so sincere a virtue to threaten herself and not offer to intimidate any other and with so much presence of mind as to distinguish in the very passionate intention the necessity of the act in defnce of her honor and so fairly to disavow lesser occasions showed such a deliberation such a choice such a principle and then keeping me so watchful at a distance that i could not seize her hand so soon as she could have given the fatal blow how impossible not to be subdued by so true and so discreet a magnanimity  but she is not gone shall not go i will press her with letters for the thursday  she shall yet be mine legally mine for as to cohabitation there is now no such thing to be thought of  the captain shall give her away as proxy for her uncle my lord will die my fortune will help my will and set me above everything and everybody  but here is the curse  she despises me jack  what man as i have heretofore said can bear to be despised  especially by his wife  o lord o lord what a hand what a cursed hand have i made of this plot  and here ends  the history of the lady and the penknife  the devil take the penknife  it goes against me to say god bless the lady  near   sat morn letter li mr lovelace to miss clarissa harlowe superscribed to mrs lovelace m hall sat night june    my dearest life if you do not impute to love and to terror raised by love the poor figure i made before you last night you will not do me justice i thought i would try to the very last moment if by complying with you in everything i could prevail upon you to promise to be mine on thursday next since you refused me an earlier day could i have been so happy you had not been hindered going to hamstead or wherever else you pleased but when i could not prevail upon you to give me this assurance what room had i my demerit so great to suppose that your going thither woud not be to lose you for ever  i will own to you madam that yesterday afternoon i picked up the paper dropped by dorcas who has confessed that she would have assisted you in getting away if she had had an opportunity so to do and undoubtedly dropped it by accident  and could i have prevailed upon you as to the thursday next i would have made no use of it secure as i should then have been in your word given to be mine but when i found you inflexible i was resolved to try if by resenting dorcass treachery i could not make your pardon of me the condition of mine to her and if not to make a handle of it to revoke my consent to your going away from mrs sinclairs since the consequence of that must have been so fatal to me  so far indeed was my proceeding low and artful and when i was challenged with it as such in so high and noble a manner i could not avoid taking shame to myself upon it  but you must permit me madam to hope that you will not punish me too heavily for so poor a contrivance since no dishonor was meant you and since in the moment of its execution you had as great an instance of my incapacity to defend a wrong a low measure and at the same time of your power over me as mortal man could give in a word since you must have seen that i was absolutely under the control both of conscience and of love  i will not offer to defend myself for wishing you to remain where you are till either you give me your word to meet me at the altar on thursday or till i have the honor of attending you preparative to the solemnity which will make that day the happiest of my life  i am but too sensible that this kind of treatment may appear to you with the face of an arbitrary and illegal imposition but as the consequences not only to ourselves but to both our families may be fatal if you cannot be moved in my favor let me beseech you to forgive this act of compulsion on the score of the necessity you your dear self have laid me under to be guilty of it and to permit the solemnity of next thursday to include an act of oblivion of all past offenses  the orders i have given to the people of the house are that you shall be obeyed in every particular that is consistent with my expectations of finding you there on my return to town on wednesday next that mrs sinclair and her nieces having incurred your just displeasure shall not without your orders come into your presence that neither shall dorcas till she has fully cleared her conduct to your satisfaction be permitted to attend you but mabell in her place of whom you seemed some time ago to express some liking will i have left behind me to attend your commands if he be either negligent or impertinent your dismission shall be a dismission of him from my service for ever but as to letters which may be sent you or any which you may have to send i must humbly entreat that none such pass from or to you for the few days that i shall be absent but i do assure you madam that the seals of both sorts shall be sacred and the letters if such be sent shall be given into your own hands the moment the ceremony is performed or before if you require it  mean time i will inquire and send you word how miss how does and to what if i can be informed her long silence is owing  dr perkins i found here attending my lord when i arrived with dr s he acquaints me that your father mother uncles and the still less worthy persons of your family are well and intend to be all at your uncle harlowes next week i presume to keep his anniversary this can make no alteration but a happy one as to persons on thursday because mr tomlinson assured me that if anything fell out to hinder your uncles coming up in person which however he did not then expect he would be satisfied if his friend the captain were proxy for him i shall send a man and horse tomorrow to the captain to be at greater certainty  i send this by a special messenger who will wait your pleasure which i humbly hope will be signified in a line in relation to the impatientlywishedfor thursday  my lord though hardly sensible and unmindful of everything but of our felicity desires his most affectionate compliments to you he has in readiness to present you several valuables which he hopes will be acceptable whether he lives to see you adorn them or not  lady sarah and lady betty have also their tokens of respect ready to court your acceptance but may heaven incline you to give the opportunity of receiving their personal compliments and those of my cousins montague before the next week be out  his lordship is exceeding ill dr s has no hopes of him the only consolation i can have for the death of a relation who loves me so well if he do die must arise from the additional power it will put into my hands of showing how much i am  my dearest life your everaffectionate and faithful lovelace  letter lii mr lovelace to miss clarissa harlowe superscribed to mrs lovelace m hall sunday night june    my dearest love i cannot find words to express how much i am mortified at the return of my messenger without a line from you  thursday is so near that i will send messenger after messenger every four hours till i have a favorable answer the one to meet the other till its eve arrives to know if i may venture to appear in your presence with the hope of having my wishes answered on that day  your love madam i neither expect nor ask for nor will till my future behavior gives you cause to think i deserve it all i at present presume to wish is to have it in my power to do you all the justice i can now do you and to your generosity will i leave it to reward me as i shall merit with your affection  at present revolving my poor behavior of friday night before you i think i should sooner choose to go to my last audit unprepared for it as i am than to appear in your presence unless you give me some hope that i shall be received as your elected husband rather than however deserved as a detested criminal  let me therefore propose an expedient in order to spare my own confusion and to spare you the necessity for that soulharrowing recrimination which i cannot stand and which must be disagreeable to yourself  to name the church and i will have every thing in readiness so that our next interview will be in a manner at the very altar and then you will have the kind husband to forgive for the faults of the ungrateful lover if your resentment be still too high to write more let it only be in your own dear hand these words st martins church thursday  or these st giless church thursday nor will i insist upon any inscription or subscription or so much as the initials of your name this shall be all the favor i will expect till the dear hand self is given to mine in presence of that being whom i invoke as a witness of the inviolable faith and honor of  your adoring lovelace  letter liii mr lovelace to miss clarissa harlowe superscribed to mrs lovelace m hall monday june    once more my dearest love do i conjure you to send me the four requested words there is no time to be lost and i would not have next thursday go over without being entitled to call you mine for the world and that as well for your sake as my own hitherto all that has passed is between you and me only but after thursday if my wishes are unanswered the whole will be before the world  my lord is extremely ill and endures not to have me out of his sight for one halfhour but this shall not weigh with me one iota if you be pleased to hold out the olive branch to me in the four requested words  i have the following intelligence from captain tomlinson  all your family are at your uncle harlowes your uncle finds he cannot go up and names captain tomlinson for his proxy he proposes to keep all your family with him till the captain assures him that the ceremony is over  already he has begun with hope of success to try to reconcile your mother to you  my lord m but just now has told me how happy he should think himself to have an opportunity before he dies to salute you as his niece i have put him in hopes that he shall see you and have told him that i will go to town on wednesday in order to prevail upon you to accompany me down on thursday or friday i have ordered a set to be in readiness to carry me up and were not my lord so very ill my cousin montague tells me she would offer her attendance on you if you please therefore we can set out for this place the moment the solemnity is performed  do not dearest creature dissipate all these promising appearances and by refusing to save your own and your familys reputation in the eye of the world use yourself worse than the ingratefullest wretch on earth has used you for if we are married all the disgrace you imagine you have suffered while a single lady will be my own and only known to ourselves  once more then consider well the situation we are both in and remember my dearest life that thursday will be soon here and that you have no time to lose  in a letter sent by the messenger whom i dispatch with this i have desired that my friend mr belford who is your very great admirer and who knows all the secrets of my heart will wait upon you to know what i am to depend upon as to the chosen day  surely my dear you never could at any time suffer half so much from cruel suspense as i do  if i have not an answer to this either from your own goodness or through mr belfords intercession it will be too late for me to set out and captain tomlinson will be disappointed who goes to town on purpose to attend your pleasure  one motive for the gentle restraint i have presumed to lay you under is to prevent the mischiefs that might ensue as probably to the more innocent as to the less were you to write to anybody while your passions were so much raised and inflamed against me having apprised you of my direction on this head i wonder you should have endeavored to send a letter to miss how although in a cover directed to that young ladys the lady had made an attempt to send away a letter servant as you must think it would be likely to fall into my hands  the just sense of what i have deserved the contents should be leaves me no room to doubt what they are nevertheless i return it you enclosed with the seal as you will see unbroken  relieve i beseech you dearest madam by the four requested words or by mr belford the anxiety of  your everaffectionate and obliged lovelace remember there will not there cannot be time for further writing and for my comingup by thursday your uncles birthday    letter live mr lovelace to john belford esquire monday june    thou will see the situation i am in with miss harlowe by the enclosed copies of three letters to two of which i am too much scorned to have one word given me in answer and of the third now sent by the messenger who brings thee this i am afraid as little notice will be taken  and if so her day of grace is absolutely over  one would imagine so long used to constraint too as she has been that she might have been satisfied with the triumph she had over us all on friday night a triumph that to this hour has sunk my pride and my vanity so much that i almost hate the words plot contrivance scheme and shall mistrust my self in future for every one that rises to my inventive head  but see thou not that i am under a necessity to continue her at sinclairs and to prohibit all her correspondences  now belford as i really in my present mood think of nothing less than marrying her if she let not thursday slip i would have thee in pursuance of the intimation i have given her in my letter of this date to attend her and vow for me swear for me bind thy soul to her for my honor and use what arguments thy friendly heart can suggest in order to procure me an answer from her which as thou will see she may give in four words only and then i purpose to leave lord m dangerously ill as he is and meet her at her appointed church in order to solemnize if she will sign but cl h to thy writing the four words that shall do for i would not come up to be made a fool of in the face of all my family and friends  if she should let the day go off  i shall be desperate  i am entangled in my own devices and cannot bear that she should detect me  o that i had been honest  what a devil are all my plots come to what do they end in but one grand plot upon myself and a title to eternal infamy and disgrace but depending on thy friendly offices i will say no more of this  let her send me but one line  but one line  not treat me as unworthy of her notice yet be altogether in my power  i cannot  i will not bear that  my lord as i said is extremely ill the doctors give him over he gives himself over those who would not have him die are afraid he will but as to myself i am doubtful for these long and violent struggles between the constitution and the disease though the latter has three physicians and an apothecary to help it forward and all three as to their prescriptions of different opinions too indicate a plaguey tough habit and favor more of recovery than death and the more so as he has no sharp or acute animal organs to whet out his bodily ones and to raise his fever above the symptomatic helpful one  thou will see in the enclosed what pains i am at to dispatch messengers who are constantly on the road to meet each other and one of them to link in the chain with a fourth whose station is in london and five miles onward or till met but in truth i have some other matters for them to perform at the same time with my lords banker and his lawyer which will enable me if his lordship is so good as to die this bout to be an overmatch for some of my other relations i dont mean charlotte and patty for they are noble girls but others who have been scratching and clawing underground like so many moles in my absence and whose workings i have discovered since i have been down by the little heaps of dirt they have thrown up  a speedy account of thy commission dear jack the letter travels all night  letter lv mr belford to robert lovelace esquire london june    tuesday you must excuse me lovelace from engaging in the office you would have me undertake till i can be better assured you really intend honorably at last by this muchinjured lady  i believe you know your friend belford too well to think he would be easy with you or with any man alive who should seek to make him promise for him what he never intended to perform and let me tell thee that i have not much confidence in the honor of a man who by imitation of hands i will only call it has shown so little regard to the honor of his own relations  only that thou have such jesuitical qualifyings or i should think thee at last touched with remorse and brought within view of being ashamed of thy cursed inventions by the ill success of thy last which i heartily congratulate thee upon  o the divine lady  but i will not aggravate  yet when thou writest that in thy present mood thou think of marrying and yet can so easily change thy mood when i know thy heart is against the state  that the four words thou courtest from the lady are as much to thy purpose as if she wrote forty since it will show she can forgive the highest injury that can be offered to woman and when i recollect how easily thou can find excuses to postpone thou must be more explicit a good deal as to thy real intentions and future honor than thou art for i cannot trust to a temporary remorse which is brought on by disappointment too and not by principle and the like of which thou have so often got over  if thou can convince me time enough for the day that thou meanest to do honorably by her in her own sense of the word or if not time enough wilt fix some other day which thou ought to leave to her option and not bind her down for the thursday and the rather as thy pretense for so doing is founded on an absolute fiction i will then most cheerfully undertake thy cause by person if she will admit me to her presence if not by pen but in this case thou must allow me to be guarantee for thy faith and if so as much as i value thee and respect thy skill in all the qualifications of a gentleman thou may depend upon it that i will act up to the character of a guarantee with more honor than the princes of our day usually do  to their shame be it spoken  mean time let me tell thee that my heart bleeds for the wrongs this angelic lady has received and if thou do not marry her if she will have thee and when married make her the best and tenderest of husbands i would rather be a dog a monkey a bear a viper or a toad than thee  command me with honor and thou shall find none readier to oblige thee than  thy sincere friend john belford  letter lvi mr lovelace to john belford esquire m hall june    tuesday night near    yours reached me this moment by an extraordinary push in the messengers  what a man of honor thou of a sudden  and so in the imaginary shape of a guarantee thou threatenest me  had i not been in earnest as to the lady i should not have offered to employ thee in the affair but let me tell thee that had thou undertaken the task and i had afterward thought fit to change my mind i should have contented myself to tell thee that that was my mind when thou engagedst for me and to have given thee the reasons for the change and then left thee to thy own direction for never knew i what fear of man was  nor fear of woman neither till i became acquainted with miss clarissa harlowe nay what is most surprising till i came to have her in my power  and so thou will not wait upon the charmer of my heart but upon terms and conditions  let it alone and be cursed i care not  but so much credit did i give to the value thou expressedst for her that i thought the office would have been as acceptable to thee as serviceable to me for what was it but to endeavor to persuade her to consent to the reparation of her own honor for what have i done but disgraced myself and been a thief to my own joys  and if there be an union of hearts and an intention to solemnize what is there wanting but the foolish ceremony  and that i still offer but if she will keep back her hand if she will make me hold out mine in vain  how can i help it  i write her one more letter and if after she has received that she keep sullen silence she must thank herself for what is to follow  but after all my heart is wholly hers i love her beyond expression and cannot help it i hope therefore she will receive this last tender as i wish i hope she intends not like a true woman to plague and vex and teaze me now she has found her power if she will take me to mercy now these remorses are upon me though i scorn to condition with thee for my sincerity all her trials as i have heretofore declared shall be over and she shall be as happy as i can make her for ruminating upon all that has passed between us from the first hour of our acquaintance till the present i must pronounce that she is virtue itself and once more i say has no equal  as to what you hint of leaving to her choice another day do you consider that it will be impossible that my contrivances and stratagems should be much longer concealed  this makes me press that day though so near and the more as i have made so much ado about her uncles anniversary if she send me the four words i will spare no fatigue to be in time if not for the canonical hour at church for some other hour of the day in her own apartment or any other for money will do every thing and that i have never spared in this affair  to show thee that i am not at enmity with thee i enclose the copies of two letters one to her it is the fourth and must be the last on the subject the other to captain tomlinson calculated as thou will see for him to show her  and now jack interfere in this case or not thou know the mind of  r lovelace  letter lvii mr lovelace to miss clarissa harlowe superscribed to mrs lovelace m hall wed morn one oclock june    not one line my dearest life not one word in answer to three letters i have written the time is now so short that this must be the last letter that can reach you on this side of the important hour that might make us legally one  my friend mr belford is apprehensive that he cannot wait upon you in time by reason of some urgent affairs of his own  i the less regret the disappointment because i have procured a more acceptable person as i hope to attend you captain tomlinson i mean to whom i had applied for this purpose before i had mr belfords answer  i was the more solicitous to obtain this favor from him because of the office he is to take upon him as i humbly presume to hope tomorrow that office obliged him to be in town as this day and i acquainted him with my unhappy situation with you and desired that he would show me on this occasion that i had as much of his favor and friendship as your uncle had since the whole treaty must be broken off if he could not prevail upon you in my behalf  he will dispatch the messenger directly whom i propose to meet in person at slough either to proceed onward to london with a joyful heart or to return back to m hall with a broken one  i ought not but cannot help it to anticipate the pleasure mr tomlinson proposes to himself in acquainting you with the likelihood there is of your mothers seconding your uncles views for it seems he has privately communicated to her his laudable intentions and her resolution depends as well as his upon what tomorrow will produce  disappoint not then i beseech you for an hundred persons sakes as well as for mine that uncle and that mother whose displeasure i have heard you so often deplore  you may think it impossible for me to reach london by the canonical hour if it should the ceremony may be performed in your own apartment at any time in the day or at night so that captain tomlinson may have it to aver to your uncle that it was performed on his anniversary  tell but the captain that you forbid me not to attend you and that shall be sufficient for bringing  you on the wings of love  your evergrateful and affectionate lovelace  letter lviii to mr patrick mdonald at his lodgings at mr browns perukemaker in st martinslane westminster m hall wedn morning two oclock june    dear mdonald the bearer of this has a letter to carry to the lady viz the preceding letter  i have been at the trouble of writing a copy of it which i enclose that you may not mistake your cue  you will judge of my reasons for antedating the enclosed sealed one see the next letter  directed to you by the name of tomlinson which you are to show the lady as in confidence you will open it of course  i doubt not your dexterity and management dear mdonald nor your zeal especially as the hope of cohabitation must now be given up impossible to be carried is that scheme i might break her heart but not incline her will am in earnest therefore to marry her if she let not the day slip  improve upon the hint of her mother that must touch her but john harlowe remember has privately engaged that lady  privately i say else not to mention the reason for her uncle harlowes former expedient you know she might find means to get a letter away to the one or the other to know the truth or to miss how to engage her to inquire into it and if she should the word privately will account for the uncles and mothers denying it  however fail not as from me to charge our mother and her nymphs to redouble their vigilance both as to her person and letters all is upon a crisis now but she must not be treated ill neither  thursday over i shall know what to resolve upon  if necessary you must assume authority the devils in it if such a girl as this shall awe a man of your years and experience fly out if she doubt your honor spirits naturally soft may be beat out of their play and borne down though ever so much raised by higher anger all women are cowards at bottom only violent when they may i have often stormed a girl out of her mistrusts and made her yield before she knew where she was to the point indignantly mistrusted and that to make up with me though i was the aggressor  if this matter succeed as i would have it or if not and do not fail by your fault i will take you off of the necessity of pursuing your cursed smuggling which otherwise may one day end fatally for you  we are none of us perfect mcdonald this sweet lady makes me serious sometimes in spite of my heart but as private vices are less blameable than public and as i think smuggling as it is called a national evil i have no doubt to pronounce you a much worse man than myself and as such shall take pleasure in reforming you  i send you enclosed ten guineas as a small earnest of further favors hitherto you have been a very clever fellow  as to clothes for thursday monmouthstreet will afford a ready supply clothes quite new would make your condition suspected but you may defer that care till you see if she can be prevailed upon your ridingdress will do for the first visit nor let your boots be over clean i have always told you the consequence of attending to the minutiae where art or imposture as the illmannerd would call it is designed  your linen rumpled and soily when you wait upon her  easy terms these  just come to town  remember as formerly to loll to throw out your legs to stroke and grasp down your ruffles as if of significance enough to be careless what though the presence of a fine lady would require a different behavior are you not of years to dispense with politeness you have no design upon her you know are a father yourself of daughters as old as she evermore is parade and obsequiousness suspectable it must show either a foolish head or a knavish heart make yourself of consequence therefore and you will be treated as a man of consequence i have often more than half ruined myself by my complaisance and being afraid of control have brought control upon myself  i think i have no more to say at present i intend to be at slough or on the way to it as by mine to the lady adieu honest mcdonald  r l  letter lix to captain antony tomlinson inclosed in the preceding to be shown to the lady as in confidence m hall tuesday morn june    dear capt tomlinson an unhappy misunderstanding having arisen between the dearest lady in the world and me the particulars of which she perhaps may give you but i will not because i might be thought partial to myself and the refusing to answer my most pressing and respectful letters i am at a most perplexing uncertainty whether she will meet us or not next thursday to solemnize  my lord is so extremely ill that if i thought she would not oblige me i would defer going up to town for two or three days he cares not to have me out of his sight yet is impatient to salute my beloved as his niece before he dies this i have promised to give him an opportunity to do intending if the dear creature will make me happy to set out with her for this place directly from church  with regret i speak it of the charmer of my soul but irreconcileableness is her familyfault the less excuseable indeed in her as she herself suffers by it in so high a degree from her own relations  now sir as you intended to be in town some time before thursday if it be not too great an inconvenience to you i could be glad you would go up as soon as possible for my sake and this i the more boldly request as i presume that a man who has so many great affairs of his own in hand as you have would be glad to be at a certainty himself as to the day  you sir can so pathetically and justly set before er the unhappy consequences that will follow if the day be postponed as well with regard to her uncles disappointment as to the part you have assured me her mother is willing to take in the wishedfor reconciliation that i have great hopes she will suffer herself to be prevailed upon and a man and horse shall be in waiting to take your dispatches and bring them to me  but if you cannot prevail in my favor you will be pleased to satisfy your friend mr john harlowe that it is not my fault that he is not obliged i am dear sir  your extremely obliged and faithful servant r lovelace  letter lx to robert lovelace esquire wedn june    near    oclock honored sir i received yours as your servant desired me to acquaint you by ten this morning horse and man were in a foam  i instantly equipped myself as if come off from a journey and posted away to the lady intending to plead great affairs that i came not before in order to favor your antedate and likewise to be in a

heard from mcdonald and mowbray the news bad or good i know not which thou wilt deem it i only wish i could have given thee joy upon the same account before the unhappy lady was seduced from hamstead for then of what an ungrateful villainy had thou been spared the perpetration which now thou have to answer for  i came to town purely to serve thee with her expecting that thy next would satisfy me that i might endeavor it without dishonor and at first when i found her gone i half pitied thee for now will thou be inevitably blown up and in what an execrable light will thou appear to all the world poor lovelace caught in thy own snares thy punishment is but beginning  but to my narrative for i suppose thou expectest all particulars from me since mowbray has informed thee that i have been collecting them  the noble exertion of spirit she had made on friday night had it seems greatly disordered her insomuch that she was not visible till saturday evening when mabell saw her and she seemed to be very ill but on sunday morning having dressed herself as if designing to go to church she ordered mabell to get her a coach to the door  the wench told her she was to obey her in every thing but the calling of a coach or chair  she sent for will and gave him the same command  he pleaded his masters orders to the contrary and desired to be excused  upon this down she went herself and would have gone out without observation but finding the streetdoor doublelockd and the key not in the lock she stepped into the streetparlour and would have thrown up the sash to call out to the people passing by as they doubted not but that since her last attempt of the same nature had been fastened down  hereupon she resolutely stepped into mrs sinclairs parlour in the backhouse where were the old devil and her two partners and demanded the key of the streetdoor or to have it opened for her  they were all surprised but desired to be excused pleading your orders  she asserted that you had no authority over her and never should have any that their present refusal was their own act and deed she saw the intent of their backhouse and the reason of putting her there she pleaded her condition and fortune and said they had no way to avoid utter ruin but by opening their doors to her or by murdering her and burying her in their garden or cellar too deep for detection that already what had been done to her was punishable by death and bid them at their peril detain her  what a noble what a right spirit has this charming creature in cases that will justify an exertion of spirit   they answered that mr lovelace could prove his marriage and would indemnify them and they all would have vindicated their behavior on friday night and the reputation of their house but refusing to hear them on that topic she flung from them threatening  she then went up half a dozen stairs in her way to her own apartment but as if she had bethought herself down she stepped again and proceeded toward the streetparlour saying as she passed by the infamous dorcas i will make myself protectors though the windows suffer but that wench of her own head on the ladys going out of that parlour to mrs sinclairs had locked the door and taken out the key so that finding herself disappointed she burst into tears and went menacing and sobbing up stairs again  she made no other attempt till the effectual one your letters and messages they supposed coming so fast upon one another though she would not answer one of them gave her some amusement and an assurance to them that she would at last forgive you and that then all would end as you wished  the women in pursuance of your orders offered not to obtrude themselves upon her and dorcas also kept out of her sight all the rest of sunday also on monday and tuesday but by the ladys condescension even to familiarity to mabell they imagined that she must be working in her mind all that time to get away they therefore redoubled their cautions to the wench who told them so faithfully all that passed between her lady and her that they had no doubt of her fidelity to her wicked trust  it is probable she might have been contriving something all this time but saw no room for perfecting any scheme the contrivance by which she effected her escape seems to me not to have been fallen upon till the very day since it depended partly upon the weather as it proved but it is evident she hoped something from mabells simplicity or gratitude or compassion by cultivating all the time her civility to her  polly waited on her early on wednesday morning and met with a better reception than she had reason to expect she complained however with warmth of her confinement polly said there would be an happy end to it if it were a confinement next day she presumed she absolutely declared to the contrary in the way polly meant it and said that mr lovelace on his return  which looked as if she intended to wait for it should have reason to repent the orders he had given as they all should their observance of them let him send twenty letters she would not answer one be the consequence what it would nor give him hope of the least favor while she was in that house she had given mrs sinclair and themselves fair warning she said no orders of another ought to make them detain a free person but having made an open attempt to go and been detained by them she was the calmer she told polly let them look to the consequence  but yet she spoke this with temper and polly gave it as her opinion with apprehension for their own safety that having so good a handle to punish them all she would not go away if she might and what inferred polly is the indemnity of a man who has committed the vilest of rapes on a person of condition and must himself if prosecuted for it either fly or be hanged  sinclair so i will still call her upon this representation of polly foresaw she said the ruin of her poor house in the issue of this strange business as she called it and sally and dorcas bore their parts in the apprehension and this put them upon thinking it advisable for the future that the streetdoor should generally in the daytime be only left upon a boltlatch as they called it which anybody might open on the inside and that the key should be kept in the door that their numerous comers and goers as they called their guests should be able to give evidence that she might have gone out if she would not forgetting however to renew their orders to will to dorcas to mabell and the rest to redouble their vigilance on this occasion to prevent her escape  none of them doubting at the same time that her love of a man so considerable in their eyes and the prospect of what was to happen as she had reason to believe on thursday her uncles birthday would though perhaps not till the last hour for her pridesake was their word engage her to change her temper  they believe that she discovered the key to be left in the door for she was down more than once to walk in the little garden and seemed to cast her eye each time to the streetdoor  about eight yesterday morning an hour after polly had left her she told mabell she was sure she should not live long and having a good many suits of apparel which after her death would be of no use to anybody she valued she would give her a brown lustring gown which with some alterations to make it more suitable to her degree would a great while serve her for a sunday wear for that she mabell was the only person in that house of whom she could think without terror or antipathy  mabell expressing her gratitude upon the occasion the lady said she had nothing to employ herself about and if she could get a workwoman directly she would look over her things then and give her what she intended for her  her mistresss mantuamaker the maid replied lived but a little way off and she doubted not that she could procure her or one of her journeywomen to alter the gown out of hand  i will give you also said she a quilted coat which will require but little alteration if any for you are much about my stature but the gown i will give directions about because the sleeves and the robings and facings must be altered for your wear being i believe above your station and try said she if you can get the workwoman and well advise about it if she cannot come now let her come in the afternoon but i had rather now because it will amuse me to give you a lift  then stepping to the window it rains said she and so it had done all the morning slip on the hood and short cloak i have seen you wear and come to me when you are ready to go out because you shall bring me in something that i want  mabell equipped herself accordingly and received her commands to buy her some trifles and then left her but in her way out stepped into the back parlour where dorcas was with mrs sinclair telling her where she was going and on what account bidding dorcas look out till she came back so faithful was the wench to the trust reposed in her and so little had the ladys generosity wrought upon her  mrs sinclair commended her dorcas envied her and took her cue and mabell soon returned with the mantuamakers journeywoman she was resolved she said she would not come without her and then dorcas went off guard  the lady looked out the gown and petticoat and before the workwoman caused mabell to try it on and that it might sit the better made the willing wench pull off her upper petticoat and put on that she gave her then she bid them go into mr lovelaces apartment and contrive about it before the pierglass there and stay till she came to them to give them her opinion  mabell would have taken her own clothes and hood and short cloak with her but her lady said no matter you may put them on again here when we have considered about the alterations there is no occasion to litter the other room  they went and instantly as it is supposed she slipped on mabells gown and petticoat over her own which was white damask and put on the wenchs hood short cloak and ordinary apron and down she went  hearing somebody tripping along the passage both will and dorcas whipped to the innerhall door and saw her but taking her for mabell are you going far mabell cried will  without turning her face or answering she held out her hand pointing to the stairs which they construed as a caution for them to look out in her absence and supposing she would not be long gone as she had not formally repeated her caution to them up went will tarrying at the stairshead in expectation of the supposed mabells return  mabell and the workwoman waited a good while amusing themselves not disagreeably the one with contriving in the way of her business the other delighting herself with her fine gown and coat but at last wondering the lady did not come in to them mabell tiptoed it to her door and tapping and not being answered stepped into the chamber  will at that instant from his station at the stairshead seeing mabell in her ladys clothes for he had been told of the present gifts to servants fly from servant to servant in a minute was very much surprised having as he thought just seen her go out in her own and stepping up met her at the door how the devil can this be said he just now you went out in your own dress how came you here in this and how could you pass me unseen but nevertheless kissing her said he would now brag he had kissed his lady or one in her clothes  i am glad mr william cried mabell to see you here so diligently but know you where my lady is  in my masters apartment int she interrogated will was she not talking with you this moment  no that is mrs dolinss journeywoman  they both stood aghast as they said will again recollecting he had seen mabell as he thought go out in her own clothes and while they were debating and wondering up comes dorcas with your fourth letter just then brought for her lady and seeing mabell dressed out whom she had likewise beheld a little before as she supposed in her common clothes she joined in the wonder till mabell reentering the ladys apartment missed her own clothes and then suspecting what had happened and letting the others into the ground of her suspicion they all agreed that she had certainly escaped and then followed such an uproar of mutual accusation and you should have done this and you should have done that as alarmed the whole house every apartment in both houses giving up its devil to the number of fourteen or fifteen including the mother and her partners  will told them his story and then ran out as on the like occasion formerly to make inquiry whether the lady was seen by any of the coachmen chairmen or porters plying in that neighborhood while dorcas cleared herself immediately and that at the poor mabells expense who made a figure as guilty as awkward having on the suspected price of her treachery which dorcas out of envy was ready to tear from her back  hereupon all the pack opened at the poor wench while the mother foaming at the mouth bellowed out her orders for seizing the suspected offender who could neither be heard in her own defense nor had she been heard would have been believed  that such a perfidious wretch should ever disgrace her house was the mothers cry good people might be corrupted but it was a fine thing if such a house as hers could not be faithfully served by cursed creatures who hired themselves upon character and had no pretense to principle  damn her the wretch proceeded  she had no patience with her call the cook and call the scullion  they were at hand  see that guilty pyeball devil was her word her ladys gown upon her back  but i will punish her for a warning to all betrayers of their trust put on the great gridiron this moment an oath or a curse at every word make up a roaring fire  the cleaver bring me this instant  i will cut her into quarters with my own hands and carbonade and broil the traitress for a feast to all the dogs and cats in the neighborhood and eat the first slice of the toad myself without salt or pepper  the poor mabell frightened out of her wits expected every moment to be torn in pieces having half a score openclawd paws upon her all at once she promised to confess all but that all when she had obtained a hearing was nothing for nothing had she to confess  sally hereupon with a curse of mercy ordered her to retire undertaking that she and polly would examine her themselves that they might be able to write all particulars to his honor and then if she could not clear herself or if guilty give some account of the lady who had been so wicked as to give them all this trouble so as they might get her again then the cleaver and gridiron might go to work with all their hearts  the wench glad of this reprieve went up stairs and while sally was laying out the law and prating away in her usual dictatorial manner whipped on another gown and sliding down stairs escaped to her relations and this flight which was certainly more owing to terror than guilt was in the true old bailey construction made a confirmation of the latter  these are the particulars of miss harlowes flight thou wilt hardly think me too minute  how i long to triumph over thy impatience and fury on the occasion  let me beseech thee my dear lovelace in thy next letter to rave most gloriously  i shall be grievously disappointed if thou do not  where lovelace can the poor lady be gone and who can describe the distress she must be in  by your former letters it may be supposed that she can have very little money nor by the suddenness of her flight more clothes than those she has on and thou know who once said vol iv p     her parents will not receive her her uncles will not entertain her her norton is in their direction and cannot miss how dare not she has not one friend or intimate in town entirely a stranger to it and let me add has been despoiled of her honor by the man for whom she made all these sacrifices and who stood bound to her by a thousand oaths and vows to be her husband her protector and friend  how strong must be her resentment of the barbarous treatment she has received how worthy of herself that it has made her hate the man she once loved and rather than marry him choose to expose her disgrace to the whole world to forego the reconciliation with her friends which her heart was so set upon and to hazard a thousand evils to which her youth and her sex may too probably expose an indigent and friendless beauty  rememberest thou not that home push upon thee in one of the papers written in her delirium of which however it favors not   i will assure thee that i have very often since most seriously reflected upon it and as thy intended second outrage convinces me that it made no impression upon thee then and perhaps thou have never thought of it since i will transcribe the sentence  if as religion teaches us god will judge us in a great measure by our benevolent or evil actions to one another  o wretch bethink thee in time bethink thee how great must be thy condemnation see p     of this volume   and is this amiable doctrine the sum of religion upon my faith i believe it is for to indulge a serious thought since we are not atheists except in practice does god the being of beings want any thing of us for himself and does he not injoin us works of mercy to one another as the means to obtain his mercy a sublime principle and worthy of the supreme superintendent and father of all things  but if we are to be judged by this noble principle what indeed must be thy condemnation on the score of this lady only and what mine and what all our confraternitys on the score of other women though we are none of us half so bad as thou art as well for want of inclination i hope as of opportunity  i must add that as well for thy own sake as for the ladys i wish ye were yet to be married to each other it is the only medium that can be hit upon to salve the honor of both all that is past may yet be concealed from the world and from her relations and thou may make amends for all her sufferings if thou resolvest to be a tender and kind husband to her  and if this really be thy intention i will accept with pleasure of a commission from thee that shall tend to promote so good an end whenever she can be found that is to say if she will admit to her presence a man who professes friendship to thee nor can i give a greater demonstration that i am  thy sincere friend j belford ps mabells clothes were thrown into the passage this morning nobody knows by whom    end of vol v
