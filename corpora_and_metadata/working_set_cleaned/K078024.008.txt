more permanent and characteristic distinctions  linnaeus and after him fabricius describes three varieties of phalaena pavonia a minor b meda and g major the first is the species found in this country and in the north of europe the existence of the second was formerly disputed by some naturalists and the last is so extremely different at least in point of magnitude that we may almost venture to remove it entirely from the two preceding  the difference between the male and female of the common emperor moth is strikingly obvious the male is smaller than the female and the colors in general darker the posterior wings also are orange in the male and not so in the female and finally the two sexes may be determined by the structure of the antennae those of the male being nearly oval and very deeply feathered or pectinated and those of the female being also pectinated but so slightly as to appear setaceous as the structure of the antennae is an unerring criterion by which the sexes are ascertained the phalaena pavonia media is a phenomenon in entomology for both the male and female so perfectly resembles the female emperor moth p p media which we have figured that it may be mistaken for the same species the female differs in no respect from it and the male only in the form of the antennae we have received this remarkable species from italy and germany it is figured only

longer had it not been injured in the journey and weakened by long confinement we remarked that in feeding it cuts the stalk asunder in the middle or near the root and tearing off the leaves eats only the pith this may in some measure account for the great mischief and depredation these creatures commit when they settle in vast numbers on any tract of cultivated land  though we regard the gryllus migratorius as an object of curiosity in this country in many others they are the terror of the inhabitants we are not perhaps to admit implicitly the relations of all authors but in those of
