the impartial an address without flattery being a poets free thoughts on the situation of our public affairs anno       london printed for m cooper in paternoster row m dcc xliv  to the great original of the following picture my lord that i decline the honor of attending with at least one honest address is from some hazard there might be of your mistaking the true motive of it free from all ambition to make one among the worshippers of your fortune i present you and at distance too a bare confession of your virtues  to know the writer of this piece can be of no importance to your lordship he lies too low to merit a great ministers inquiry it will please the public better that he knows you rightly and that he does so he appeals to the poem  he is too well acquainted with the modern turn of sentiment in some who for a few years must be called great men to look for any present consequence from poetry where even the best finds more contempt than due discernment but at the same time he knows that this is one among the faults of bad administration which a soul like yours came qualified to think worth mending and we might have had more certainty that you would do it had you been as pleased with your own profit as the publics since the clearest interest is his in every honor done the muses who is born for actions of a pitch above the spirit of cold writers  i have nothing more to trouble you with except the warm and just good wishes of  your lordship s quondam schoolfellow and one of your sincerest humble servants ignotus  the impartial an address without flattery are these the marks then of our promised shame or did detraction steal the patriots name weak if we were how rose we now so strong or whence if powerful were we scorned so long burn sooty slander burn thy blotted scroll greatness is greatness spite of factions soul i gaze astonished kingdom over thy face and each weighed wonder to its fountain trace glory flows in where infamy was spread and longlost triumph lifts her towry head warm over the icy north thy influent awe bids hostile leagues dissolve in friendly thaw up rhines long stream britannic thunders wind and alpine

bold tremble and the backward dare high to the nations points their guardians throne and acts and arbitrates and shines alone and have such fires inflamed a patient reign immortal heaven and must we still complain still must we rail and blacken and suspect at once curb vigilance and goad neglect deep let my soul detest the adhesive pride that changing sentiment unchanges side true to contempt of truth repents within  yet screens conviction and strains hard to sin shame on this craft to scare  this toil to seem o heart indignant fly thunmanly scheme blush for thy past injustice shrink no more but wake  and wonder thou were dark before learn from whose hand thunlookdfor effluence came and in the teeth of insult sound his name what though some friend thou love had narrower sight truth knows no parties and involves like light shadows and names fright cowards  but the strong never call that lightness which is scorn of wrong dare to be just it is all that bravry means he stoops too basely who to flattery leans but whom pale prejudice has taught his part born for a slave wears fetters on his heart sees undiscerning feels without his touch judges too little  and decides too much poets have nobler souls fames paths they show they glow themselves  and teach the world to glow satires whole power their own  yet praise they choose even of unconscious kings who slight the muse proud of neglected force each heavntouchd mind open to reason is to interest blind self all unthought of can for others think swim till the state rides safe  then smile and sink lift even the worth that hates him love it shown and for his countrys joys exclude his own this is to think like muses act like man this princes ought to feel  and poets can ye once misguided is retraction vain trust the brave
