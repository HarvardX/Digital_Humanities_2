the east indian a comedy  in five acts  as performed at the theater royal drury lane  by m g lewis esquire m p author of the monk castle spectre etc  second edition  quadringenta tibi si quis deus aut similis diis et melior fatis donaret homuncio quantus ex nihilo fieres quantus virronis amicus da trebio  pone ad trebium  vis rator ab ipsis ilibus  o nummi vobis hunc praestat honorem vos estis fratres juvenal sat   london printed by j davis chancery lane for j bell no     oxford street m dccc  preface the plot of this comedy as far as regards riverss visits to modish and mrs ormond was taken from the novel of sidney biddulph mr sheridan had already borrowed the same incident from the same source and employed it though in a different manner in the school for scandal  the east indian was admirably well acted from beginning to end particularly the part of rivers by mr kemble nothing was overcharged nothing underacted indeed to call his performance acting is doing it injustice it was nature throughout  this comedy was written before i was sixteen it was performed last season for the benefits of mrs jordan and mrs powell and in consequence of the approbation with which it was received was brought forward again in last december it was again received with applause for which i thank the public the succeeding representations did not prove attractive for which i here make my acknowledgments to mr sheridan who blocked up my road mounted on his great tragic warhorse pizarro and trampled my humble padnag of a comedy under foot without the least compunction my readers must decide whether my play merited so transient an existence it is unnecessary to say that i am quite of the contrary opinion  jan      00 m g lewis  prologue by the author spoken by mr c kemble in lifes gay spring while yet the careless hours dance light on blooming beds of early flowers ere knowledge of the world has taught the mind to sorrow for itself and shun mankind in sweet vain dreams still fancy bids the boy dote on fair prospects of ideal joy lifes choicest fruits then court his eager hand each eye is gentle and each voice is bland false friendship prompts no sigh and draws no tear and love seems scarce more beauteous than sincere ere sixteen years had winged their wanton flight while yet his head was young and heart was light our author planned these scenes and while he drew how bright each color seemed each line how true gods with what rapture every speech he spoke gods how he chuckled as he penned each joke and when at length his ravished eyes survey that wondrous work complete  a five act play his youthful heart how self applauses swell  it is not perfect but its vastly well  since then with many a pang our bard has bought more just decision and less partial thought kind vanity no longer blinds his sight his fillet falls and lets in odious light time bids the darling work its leaves expand each flower parnassian withers in his hand stern judgment every latent fault detects and all its fancied beauties prove defects yet for she thinks some scenes possess an art to please the fancy and to melt the heart thalia bids his play tonight appear thalia called in heaven but jordan here the comedy was first performed for the benefit of mrs jordan  so frail his hope so weak he thinks his cause our author says he dares not ask applause he only begs that with indulgence new you will hear him patiently and hear him through then if his piece proves worthless never sham it but damn it gentle friends  oh damn it damn it  dramatis personae lord listless mr

table robert waiting walsingham beauchamp say you   rob i think that is the gentlemans name sir   wall show him up   exit robert  i am glad that he is returned to england for though a young man and a gay man beauchamp is among the few whom i esteem   enter beauchamp my dear ned  beau mr walsingham  this pleasure is quite unexpected but where have you been concealed these hundred years i was afraid that cynthia wearied of her endymion had pitched upon you for his successor and believed you at this moment an inhabitant of the moon   wall no no my young friend the goddess has too much taste to select such an old weatherbeaten fellow for a cecisbeo but if you seriously ask what i have been doing for these last three years you must know i have been foolhunting   beau foolhunting   wall yes being of an adust cynical constitution infinite laughter is absolutely necessary for my health for this purpose my physician prescribed me a course of fools and truly i have reaped great benefit from his advice   beau why then leave great britain heaven knows a scarcity of fools is not one of our wants   wall true but the growth of english absurdity for the year    not being to my taste i determined to change my fools as other invalids change the air but after all i must give the preference to the folly of my own country   beau your own country is very much obliged to you but since this is your taste i have a superb feast for you in lord listless   wall what your uncle   beau no to my sorrow he sleeps with his forefathers while my noble cousin possesses his title and estate and what is worst has me entirely in his power   wall how so   beau it is a tedious story but the short of it is that when i married my generous uncle discharged my debts to the tune of  oool unluckily he neglected to destroy my acknowledgment which falling into his sons hands the present earl wisely keeps it and calls himself my sole creditor discharge it for some time i cannot but however unless we disagree he will not press me for immediate payment   wall well well and even if he should well find means to satisfy him and so away with that gloomy face dear ned as soon as i saw you i guessed that something was wrong but i am glad twas nothing more than a pecuniary difficulty   beau would to heaven it were   wall hey why what other cause    beau oh mr walsingham how shall i tell you    wall out with it   beau that i have been  that i still am  a villain   wall i dont believe one word of it he who dares own that he has been a villain must needs already have ceased to be one   beau hear me then and judge for yourself  you knew well the character of the woman to whose fate while i was still a stripling accident not affection united mine   wall yes and a miserable life she led you   beau jealous without love profuse without generosity negligent in her dress violent in her temper coarse in her manners with no virtue but that one which she owed to constitution not to principle during three years she rendered my home an hell my patience was at length exhausted i made over to her the remnants of an estate which her extravagance had ruined bade this domestic fiend an eternal farewell and sailed under the assumed name of dorimant to india   wall i see no harm as yet lived with her three years i wouldnt have lived with her three days  no not to have buried her on the fourth   beau soon after my arrival it was my chance to save the life of the famous mortimer who    wall the nabob whose immense wealth    beau the same this procured me admission to his house where i saw his daughter she was lovely and grateful to me for the preservation of her fathers life opportunities of seeing each other were frequent and in an unguarded moment  yet heaven can witness to my intentions  in an unguarded moment i  i was a villain   wall shaking his head  little better i must say   beau her weakness and my perdy were soon discovered marry her i could not her fathers wrath was dreadful she sought a refuge from it in my arms and fled with me from india   wall from india and from her father young man young man and what says your wife to all this   beau soon after our separation i find that she went abroad nor has she been heard of for near two years either by her banker or her friends report says that she is dead if so my hand is zoraydas and in the mean while she resides with my cousin lady clara modish   wall lady clara and how the devil came she to receive her   beau the devil made her the great devil of all money man darling money her ladyship had been extravagant and so i paid a gaming debt or two for her besides this the appearance of protecting a friendless orphan flatters that oftentatious sensibility which it is her passion to display on every occasion   wall but does she know the history of her protegee   beau i was compelled to trust her with it under a promise of profound secrecy   wall and how has she kept her promise   beau why really extremely well considering she is a woman of fashion she only confided it to her most intimate friends who told it again to all their particular acquaintance who repeated it to every creature they knew and now the whole town is informed of the whole transaction   wall and you really have the heart to present this poor young creature to the world in a light so despicable   beau spare your reproaches my dear sir they have already been made by a very able advocate you remember modishs sister emily   wall young ormonds widow  a charming creature   beau she is interested about zorayda and has frequently written to me on this subject her remonstrances have carried with them conviction and i am resolved to wait on her this morning to entreat her protection for zorayda and should she grant it to engage cruel as

exclaim thou folly art my goddess i can promise you some diversion in your own way for lady claras table is seldom unsupplied with a plentiful banquet of fools   wall every table in town may be supplied with that article at a very small expense i doubt not for after all my peregrinations in quest of folly i am decided that no country abounds more with that luxury than little england where

explain to her the object of my journey to turin and should it prove unsuccessful strive to reconcile her to the cruel alternative    mrs orm all this shall be done though not exactly by me situated as i am with lady clara i cannot go myself to her house uninvited but i think mr rivers may without impropriety under the pretext of returning to her this now unnecessary present   beau unnecessary have his wants then been already relieved   mrs orm they needed no relief rivers is wealthy and the object of his visit to lady claras this morning was to make an experiment on her heart not her purse zoraydas gift therefore being now superfluous i will persuade rivers to return it to her himself and while expressing his gratitude for her wellintended benevolence he may take an opportunity of convincing her that your absence is necessary that lady claras is by no means a proper abode for her and he shall press her till the result of your inquiries shall have determined her future conduct

a thousand pounds for a dish of tea how unlucky it was that i had just sent away the chocolate this trait is borrowed from merciers habitant de la guadaloupe    mrs orm then he has such plans for
