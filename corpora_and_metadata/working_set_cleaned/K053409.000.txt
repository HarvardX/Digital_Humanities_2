a tract on the law of nature and principles of action in man  by granville sharp  for ye are all the sons of god by faith in christ jesus gal iii      one is your master even christ and all ye are brethren and  one is your father which is in heaven matthew xxiii     london printed for b white at horaces head in fleet street and e and c dilly in the poultry  mdcclxxvii  a tract on the law of nature etc i have neither leisure nor abilities to undertake a regular definition of the law of nature with all the doctrines usually ranked under that head and indeed if i had both leisure and abilities i should want inclination because such a work would unavoidably become voluminous on account of the variety of authors necessary to be mentioned who have treated the subject with different views and as all science is vain which is not reduced to practice so the more voluminous any subject is rendered the less it can be useful on account of the increased difficulty of communicating it to the generality of readers i have therefore confined my tract to such general remarks on the subject as are most necessary for the observation of my countrymen at large with respect more particularly to one point viz the illegality of reducing or subjecting mankind to involuntary servitude either under political or private dominion as all pretensions to an unlimited authority of any man or men over others are contrary to natural equity and the laws of god as well as baneful to mankind in general which effect is unhappily demonstrated by the numberless instances of unnatural oppression now prevailing to the destruction of mankind in almost every part of the world i have already shown in my answer this answer to mr thompson is confined to one kind of slavery only viz the oppression of private tyrants or petty slaveholders and has already been printed in america and therefore i need not now repeat the arguments which it contains especially as i propose soon to reprint it in england with some other tracts expressly against domestic slavery such as is unlawfully tolerated in the british colonies   to the reverend mr thompson an advocate for the african slave trade that the jewish constitutions were not strictly consistent with the law of nature in all points and consequently that they are not to be considered as the rule by which lawyers and casuists may safely determine what is or what is not according to nature  the law of nature has been variously represented but all the best writers both ancient and modern agree in adopting that maxim of the civil institutes servitus autem est constitutio juris gentium qua quis dominio alieno contra naturam subjicitur justin institutes book   tit    from whence the other authorities in the common law of england seem to be derived    est quidem servitus constitutio juris gentium qua quis dominio alieno contra naturam subjicitur etc bracton lib   cap    est quidem servitus libertati contrarium item constitutio quaedam de jure gentium qua quis dominio alieno contra naturam subjicitur etc fleta lib   cap     servitude is a constitution of the law of nations by which contrary to nature one is subjected to anothers power cowells institutes tit      which declares involuntary servitude or slavery to be contrary to the law of nature this rule is commonly understood as applicable only to domestic slavery but it is equally true when applied to political oppression or the exercise of an unlimited dominion over a whole nation some few authors indeed have been so unreasonable as to assert that there is no such thing as natural law but they are properly censured by the learned baron puffendorf in his law of nature and nations book   chap    he particularly mentions the argument of carniades as contracted by lactantius to the following effect  that men first instituted laws to secure and promote their own advantage etc but that there was no such thing as natural law in the world etc p  0   such doctrine is certainly very convenient for tyrants and slaveholders of every degree who must otherwise remain without excuse whenever the law of nature and the common rights of humanity are urged against them it is therefore necessary for them either to misrepresent the law of nature as the reverend mr thompson has done or else like carniades utterly to deny its existence this latter method has been also adopted by some modern advocates for slavery who in private discourse on this subject have declared that they esteem the law of nature to be no other than their natural propensity to pursue their own hearts desire of profit or pleasure and this they call natural liberty though it certainly is the most unnatural tyranny for when the immutable necessity of reciprocal consideration is forgot or set aside there can be no safety among men and consequently no natural liberty we must therefore submit ourselves to be the servants of law in order to be truly free according to the excellent observation of cicero legum denique idcirco omnes servi sumus ut liberi esse possumus tom   p  0  hamburgh edition       we may learn from the histories of all nations that lust avarice pride revenge love of power jealousy etc are principles of action which unavoidably produce oppression and wrongs to the destruction of the human species in all places where will and pleasure whether in political or private dominion are supreme or whenever selflove and private interest become entirely predominant among men that selflove is predominant with the generality of mankind is but too apparent yet we are not therefore obliged to admit that selflove is the universal principle of action though an eminent and learned lawwriter has with very good intentions as his argument proves thought proper to give it that title  honesty indeed is the best policy even for a selfish man to pursue and it is certain that the solid seize of virtue and justice afford a real and substantial satisfaction which in the end most amply fulfils the purposes of selflove  but though virtue and honesty are thus favorable to selflove in their natural effects yet this by no means proves that selflove is the motive of all virtuous and honest men or that it is the universal principle of action for if that were really the case many of the most amiable virtues must be esteemed mere empty names there could be no true generosity or benevolence no disinterested goodness of heart no sincere natural affection between parents and their children husbands and their wives brethren friends etc whereas history affords many undoubted instances of selflove being lost in the superior affections natural to generous minds in all these different degrees of connection but it is needless to recite them since even in the brute creation there are natural that excellent english lawyer the great henry de bracton informs us that natural law is that which nature or more properly god himself has taught all animals jus natural est quod natura i e ipse deus docuit omnia animalia etc and afterward he further explains himself saying jus natural quod docuit omnia animalia natura i e per instinctum naturae etc viz natural law which taught all animals by nature that is through the instinct of nature etc lib   c     affections superior to selflove  the common hen is so inflamed with natural affection and anxious care for her tender brood that she seems to have as little sense of selflove in time of danger as of her own weakness for she will boldly fly in the face of every invader except man however superior in size or strength to herself  the timorous cow it is said will attack the fiercest tiger when her calf is by her side many instances of very extraordinary affection in dogs to their masters have been well attested those faithful animals have sometimes been known to lose all sense of danger to themselves in the necessary defense of their owners and the very swine discover such a natural affection and real sympathy for their brethren of the sty whenever they hear their cries of distress that their example ought to shame the depraved part of mankind imperial tyrants and royal robbers who extend their dominion by breach of faith unlawful invasion murder and rapine as also those petty tyrants and destroyers of mankind the african traders and american slaveholders lest the affectionate brute notwithstanding his sensuality should seem on comparison a more generous and therefore a more noble animal than that man who stifles all natural affection fellowfeeling and charity to his kind merely for the sake of acquiring power or worldly profit to himself and surely a time will come when all such offenders against the law of nature who prefer the wages of unrighteousness to the natural dictates of humanity and conscience will have reason to esteem the lot of the most contemptible brute infinitely more eligible than their own  now as it appears that selflove is not the universal principle of action even in brutes much less ought it to be esteemed so in mankind because the human soul besides the natural affection which men ought to have in common with other creatures is endowed with a much more noble principle or motive to good actions i mean reason or that knowledge of good and evil which we inherit from our first parents and which they unlawfully took upon themselves at the instigation of their spiritual enemy that they might thereby be rendered accountable for all their actions and through knowledge but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die genesis ii       become guilty before god  the history of that fatal transaction demands our most careful consideration since all mankind are particularly affected by it and surely the principles of our own nature are subjects of enquiry infinitely more important to us than all the other branches of natural philosophy and yet perhaps they are less examined by men of science and consequently are less understood than any other but in vain is the most accurate knowledge of plants drugs fossils and minerals or of the exact revolutions of the heavenly bodies and of the nature and properties of all the elements etc if the philosopher is unacquainted with himself  multi enim multa sciunt et scipsos nesciunt sed qui seipsum nescit nihil bne novit quam alia scire et se nescire quid aliud est quam seipsum gravius condempnare etc doct and stud c       and the properties and state of his own soul which is too often the case knowledge in all the former particulars is indeed honorable and praiseworthy but in the latter it is indispensable for when men through ignorance of the compouna nature of man slight the common means which god has revealed to guard their minds against intellectual deceptions they are sure to be perverted in their principles to the imminent danger both of body and soul such an one probably thinks himself too judicious a critic to admit the mosaic account of the subject now before us viz the fall of man at least in the literal sense of the text so that the doctrines which i propose to collect from it will have very little weight i fear with men of that stamp nevertheless as there are many doctrines in other parts of scripture which corroborate the literal meaning of that relation and as there are also several circumstances discoverable in the nature of man which cannot otherwise be reasonably accounted for i must beg my readers to excuse me even if they think me too prolix in my examination of that part of the sacred history which i conceive to be absolutely necessary for the obtaining a true practical idea of the law of nature and the principles of action in man  god delivered a clear and express law to man before the fall  but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it and then follows the denunciation of punishment  for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die genesis ii     this was the first and only penal law a forfeiture of life and though we find afterward that the declared punishment was not immediately executed according to the letter that is the penalty of death was not inflicted on the day of the transgression as it seemed to be at first ordained yet this affords no just exception against the truth and propriety of the relation  the same almighty being who had a right as all things are his own to prohibit the action abovementioned and to assign a punishment for disobedience had certainly a right also to respite or postpone or even to remit if he had been pleased to do so the execution of the law which he himself had ordained but for the present it is sufficient to remark that the nature of the penalty had been clearly revealed to our first parents and was as clearly understood by them so that they were sufficiently sensible of their obligation to observe the said law previous to their breach of it which plainly appears by the speech of the woman to the tempter viz but of the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden god has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die  after so clear an acknowledgment of the divine precept the act of taking the fruit which otherwise in itself would probably have been no crime was certainly a wilful sin of a very heinous nature being a gross contempt of gods word for which our first parents very justly incurred the penalty of death which they were previously told must be the consequence of disobedience  they had received this caution even from god himself whom they knew to be their maker and supreme lord and yet the unwary woman unhappily listened to an assertion that was absolutely contradictory to her creators word and thereby drew upon herself and all her descendants the irrevocable doom to labor  pain  and mortality  perhaps the haughty philosopher will now be ready to arraign the justice of the divine decree which involved the innocent progeny that is innocent with respect to this particular crime in the punishment of their guilty parents but if he will patiently follow me through this examination of human nature he will perhaps be able to form a better idea of the nature of original sin and of the cause of its being intailed or rather the effects of its being intailed on all the descendants of adam for the immediate effect of that original sin of our first parents was the acquisition of an additional faculty even of a divine attribute to the nature of man which of course descends from these original stocks by natural inheritance to all their progeny and thereby inevitably involves them all in the same condemnation the manner of which shall be more particularly explained hereafter this very ancient example of punishment for a contempt of gods word the direful effects of which labor pain and mortality are ever before us should teach mankind the extreme danger of paying attention to any doctrines and interpretations of law or religion that have the least tendency to oppose or contradict the literal or most obvious meaning of gods word for the efforts of our spiritual enemy are never more baneful than when he is pleased to assume the office of a commentator on the laws of god in which character he is frequently discoverable for though he does not now present himself outwardly or apparently as at first in the assumed shape of a serpent yet the venom of his doctrines is too often sufficiently distinguishable both in the writings and discourses of men and it is remarkable that his first attempt against mankind should be in the capacity of a critic on the divine law the influence of spiritual enemies is indeed a distinct principle of action in man which shall be more particularly mentioned in the course of this tract  but to return to the first fatal instance beforementioned of satans success in misleading mankind which occasioned another distinct principle of action in man  it appears that the tempter was well well acquainted with the true nature and effects of the forbidden fruit which he declared indeed but not without uttering at the same time a notorious falsehood ye shall not surely die said he for god does know that in the day ye eat thereof viz of the fruit taken from the tree of knowledge then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil genesis iii      now this acquisition of knowledge which the tempter promised was really such as he represented it viz a divine attribute ye shall become as gods knowing good and evil so that in this one respect indeed his intelligence was true for the inspired historian has recorded also the words of god himself to the same effect  and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil chap iii    but truth is much more deceitful and dangerous even than falsehood itself when for the purpose of misleading it is maliciously blended with the latter for notwithstanding the deceivers flattering assurance to our first parents that they should not die yet in the very day as it seems of their transgression they heard the tremendous sentence of misery and death pronounced against them and though it was not then finally executed as they had reason to expect it would according to the tenor of the law before declared on which the judgment was founded for god never judges men without law like the arbitrary princes of this world yet the said law by which their lives were expressly forfeited was sufficiently fulfilled by the condemnation of the transgressors on the very day of their offense to mortality whereby their once immortal bodies were rendered continually liable to diseases injuries misery and death as the bodies of all their descendants have ever since been and they were no longer entitled even to the food necessary for the support of their poor mortal bodies without severe labor care and assiduity  cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow in sorrow or rather in labor for  is the expression in the original which in the targum is explained by another hebrew word  signifying rather fatigue or labor than sorrow and as the necessity of mans labor was the more immediate consequence of the earths new propensity through the curse to bring forth thorns thistles and useless weeds it seems the most expressive rendering in this place and most suitable to the context in the following verse in the sweat of thy face shall thou eat bread in the vulgate also it is rendered in laboribus and by pagninus in labor the same word is also necescessarily rendered labors in isaiah lviii    and exact all your labors and in proverbs v  0  lest strangers be filled with thy wealth and thy labors be in the house of a stranger   shall thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shall eat the herb of the field  in the sweat of thy face said god to his guilty creature man shall thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust thou shall return genesis iii    to     these have ever since been the conditions of human life and though some men who have store of worldly goods endeavor to cast away care and seem to live in a state of opposition to this general rule yet they only deceive themselves for no descendant of adam be he ever so rich has any right to eat the bread of idleness nor can he do so without offense against his own soul as well as against this universal ordinance of god  if providence has afforded him wealth and leisure he is accountable for both being only a steward for life after which the performance of his duty to god to his country to his neighbors nay to mankind in general his brethren of the universe will be strictly scrutinized and punished in proportion to the degree of his wilful neglect and disobedience since nothing is more clearly revealed than that all mankind lie under an indispensable obligation to improve their talents for all these duties as well as to use them whenever there is an opportunity so that the man who neglects to employ in these services a due portion of that leisure which his rank or situation in life affords him may justly be said to mispend his masters time for it is not his own and such an one must inevitably suffer with the unprofitable servant described in the gospel who neglected to improve his talent  cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness  there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth matt xxv  0 see the whole parable from the   th verse whereby it plainly appears that mankind are laid under an indispensable necessity to improve their respective natural talents to the best of their power for their lords service  the affluence and unemployed leisure therefore of many persons whom we daily see amongst us afford no just exception to gods general ordinance concerning the hard conditions of human life it is almost too obvious to be mentioned that riches and hereditary honors procure no exemption from the most material part of that sentence viz to dust thou shall return and that the time and manner of that returning to the dust or to the ground is equally unknown to the rich and to the poor though to both equally certain so that no man not the greatest or most independent can claim even a single day beforehand as his own i will say to my soul says the rich man in the parable soul thou have much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry but god said unto him thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou have provided luke xii     0 wherefore with respect also to the other part of the punishment for the original sin viz the doom to labor let those men who think themselves exempted by their rank and fortunes from the necessity of employment who think they have a right to spend their time as well as their money just as they please for their own amusement and mere selfsatisfaction and seem to enjoy leisure and ease as if gods general ordinance to all mankind had been partial or of none effect let such men i say be reminded of the alarming dreadful sentence pronounced by the lord of the vineyard in the parable behold these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbereth it the ground luke xiii    how absurd therefore is the pride of those men who value themselves on account of territorial authority whether public or private and yet live as if the importance which they assume in right of landed possessions or hereditary rank in life might of itself be esteemed a sufficient merit without the cultivation of any other but let them remember that there is a lord of the vineyard the lord most high is terrible he is a great king over all the earth psalm xlvii        to whom all things belong for though god has given the earth to the children of men psalm cxv    yet the earth is the lords and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein psalm xxiv      and to whom a strict account must be rendered of every trust for the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods and unto one he gave five talents to another two etc after a long time the lord of those servants comes and reckons with them etc matthew xxv    to  0 give an account of thy stewardship for thou may be no longer steward luke xvi      and of every possession whether of lands or of governments so that the dominions and estates of all temporal lords and landowners be their right of tenure ever so unexceptionable among men are yet so far from being their own that even they themselves whenever they acquire a habit of mispending their time and wealth are justly esteemed as encumbrances upon that very ground in which all their imaginary consequence is planted now shall we envy the rich mans enjoyment of unemployed leisure if this be the consequence far better had it been for such a person to have endured with the meanest labourer the common lot of man and in the sweat of his face to have eat his bread genesis iii     than thus to have lived an unworthy exception to the general decree thereby rendering himself in the sight of god as one that cumbereth the ground it would be well for mankind if the consideration of this sentence might be esteemed also a general principle of action but alas we are all too apt to mispend our time in some degree yet it is a failing to which the rich are more particularly liable they are not compelled by necessity like other men to think for themselves and from thence a fatal inconsiderate notion is too apt to prevail among them viz that their time is their own and therefore as they presume upon a supposed right to spend their leisure according to their own will and pleasure they necessarily mispend their substance also for which they are equally accountable and as riches are also the ordinary means of procuring the sweets and enjoyments of life they are consequently a continual source of temptation as well to acquire them unjustly as to expend them improperly from hence probably arises the extreme danger of riches to the spiritual welfare of mankind verily i say unto you said our lord that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle then for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god matthew xix       go to now ye rich men  weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you james v    son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things and likewise lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented luke xvi    it is nevertheless through the additional faculty beforementioned which human nature acquired by the transgression of our first parents viz the knowledge of good and evil that sin is imputed to us whether we be rich or poor  our spiritual enemy envied the happiness of mankind in their original state and therefore artfully led them to the criminal usurpation of forbidden knowledge that they might thereby be rendered accountable to the eternal judge for all their thoughts words and actions and through knowledge become guilty before god and continually subject to sin and death for this divine knowledge obliges us howsoever we act to approve at least of virtuous actions and to condemn vice so that when men transgress it is for the most part knowingly or wilfully and as the strength of sin is the law the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god which gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ   cor xv        so the guilt of every criminal action is with justice imputed to us because we have wilfully offended against this natural light or law in our hearts by which we ought to have known how to refuse the evil and choose the good isa vii     the gentiles without the knowledge of scripture nevertheless acknowledged this principle law according to cicero is a supreme reason planted in nature which commands what ought to be done and prohibits the contrary and he affirms that the same reason when it is established and perfected in the mind of man is law  lex says he in his first book de legibus est ratio summa insita in natura quae jubet ea quae facienda sunt prohibetque contraria eadem ratio cum est in hominis mente confirmata et confecta lex est see tom   of his works p     hamburgh edition        here the enlightened heathen writer plainly acknowledges the principle as natural to mankind   ratio summa insita in natura and yet esteemed it at the same time a divine attribute by some means imparted from god   recta et a numine deorum tracta ratio though he might probably be unacquainted with the occasion of its being engraffed in human nature he mentions this attribute again in his second book de natura deorum where he speaks of prudence or the choice of good and rejection of evil as a universal law common to god and man  sequitur ut eadem sit in his quae in genere humano ratio eadem veritas utrobique sit eademque lex quae est recti praeceptio pravique depulsio ex quo intelligitur prudentiam quoque et mentem a diis ad homines pervenisse etc tom   p     and in his first book de officiis he more particularly defines the law of nature in man by describing the double bias of soul viz appetite and reason and instead of laying down appetite or the pursuit of happiness as the rule of obedience which some very eminent and learned lawyers have done he wisely reverses that rule and thence forms an unexceptionable rule of action viz that reason must rule but appetite obey see his own words duplex est enim vis animorum atque naturae una pars in appetitu posita est quae est  graece quae hominem huc et illuc rapit altera in ratione quae docet et explanat quid faciendum fugiendumque sit ita fit ut ratio praesit appetitus vero obtemperet tom   p      he also clearly describes this natural instinct the knowledge of good and evil under the title of common sense communis intelligentia and lays it down as the law or rule of nature naturae norma for distinguishing good laws what a profitable and convenient reduction might be made in the bulk and number of our statute books especially of the later volumes upon a revisal conducted strictly according to this excellent rule from bad right from wrong and honorable from base which certainly is a much safer principle to rely on than selflove  atqui nos legem bonam a mala nulla alia nisi naturae norma dividere possumus nec solum jus et injuria a natura dijudicatur sed omnino omnia honesta ac turpia nam et communis intelligentia nobis notas res efficit easque in animis nostris inchoavit ut honesta in virtute ponantur in vitiis turpia haec autem in opinione existimare non in natura posita dementis est de legibus lib   tom   p     hamburgh edition       and the apostle paul has also given a strong testimony concerning the power and influence of this instinct or first principle planted in human nature  he informs us that some men who had not the written law of god were nevertheless capable of doing by nature or instinct the things contained in the law  for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves we find a remarkable instance of the natural dictates of conscience in the behavior of tubourai tamaide a poor uninstructed inhabitant of the remote island of otaheite when he was unjustly charged with stealing a knife the story is related in the account of capt cooks voyage vol   p  0  and the singularity of the circumstances leads the writer to the following remark upon this occasion it may be observed says he that these people have a knowledge of right and wrong from the mere dictates of natural conscience and voluntarily condemn themselves when they do that to others which they would condemn others for doing to them that tubourai tamaide felt the force of moral obligation is certain for the imputation of an action which he considered as indifferent would not when it appeared to be groundless have moved him with such excess of passion  but to what shall we impute the lamentable change of principle in the same person who was afterward on another occasion absolutely convicted of theft may not the licentious example of the english whose criminal indulgences among the poor indian women proved that they had no fixed regard for that pure religion which they professed have occasioned the corruption of the poor heathens morals and natural principles of virtue he was certainly become a worse man by his acquaintance with them    which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness or the conscience witnessing with them and their thoughts the mean while or between themselves accusing or else excusing one another etc romans ii        this necessarily implies a natural knowledge of good and evil so that this divine faculty or instinct in the nature of man seems plainly to be the grand principle whereby men who have not the law are a law unto themselves romans ii    and this i apprehend to be properly the law of nature in man the law written on our hearts or the conscience which bears witness with us as the apostle declares in the following verse  our thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing us  for there are few men so bad as not to have been at some time or other sensible of remorse through the accusation abovementioned of their their thoughts or conscience for what are these thoughts which accuse and excuse but conscience itself that is the very same principle only differently expressed by the apostle for the sake of explanation and again this conscience which bears witness is not a different or distinct principle from the knowledge of good and evil but only another name or mode of expressing the same principle or if it be so defined by some writers as to appear in any degree different or distinct from the latter it cannot at most be otherwise esteemed than as a different effect of that same divine knowledge and the like may be said of sinderesis  as well as of the law of reason both of which some authors have treated as distinct principles from conscience notwithstanding that all these separate heads sinderesis reason and conscience are necessarily resolved into one single principle or foundation viz the knowledge of good and evil to which the enquirer is naturally led in attempting to define them for indeed this same identical principle or power is equally attributed to them all sinderesis says the author of doct et student is a natural power of the soul set in the highest part thereof moving and stirring it to good and abhorring evil see doct et stud english version      and      dialogue   cap    but in the latin copy of   0  it is in the   th chapter sinderesis est vis motiva seu potentia naturalis animae rationalis quae semper est nata figi in superioribus partibus animae movens et stimulans ad bonum et abhorrens malum etc doct et stud cap    and again sinderesis etiam est principium quo ad speculativa et quo ad operativa and therefore a principle of action exemplum de speculativis ut omne totum est majus sua part quodlibet est vel non est exemplum de operativis ut nullum malum est faciendum bonum est prosequendum et similia et ideo sinderesis dicitur a quibusdam lex rationis quia principia legis rationis ministrat quae ei insunt a natura etc ibid cap       what is sinderesis therefore when thus explained but the natural knowledge in man to reject the evil and choose the good reason is also explained by this celebrated author to the same effect  after or according to the doctors  reason says he is the power of the soul that discerns between good and evil and between good and better comparing the one with the other the which also shows virtues loves good and flies vices see chap    in the english versions of      and      but the   th chapter in the latin original according to the edition of   0  ratio secundum doctores est ipsa vis animae rationalis quae consulit et discernit inter bonum et malum et melius comparando unum ad alterum quae etiam virtutes eligit et deum diligit et dicitur non solum cognitiva sed etiam motiva and therefore a principle of action cum autem judicat aliquid esse bonum vel malum et ibi sistit sic dicitur cognitiva si vero ulterius procedat indicando aliquid esse bonum ut fiat vel malum ut evitetur sic dicitur motiva si vero adhuc amplius procedat et non solum indicat aliquid esse bonum ut fiat sed etiam id fieri appetit sic dicitur liberum arbitrium nam liberum arbitrium apprehendit rationem et voluntatem etc cap        in the beginning of the chapter he expresses himself as if he supposed that man was endued with this divine faculty of reason before the fall even at the time when he was created cap    de ratione quando primus homo creatus est percepit duplicem a deo oculum exteriorem scilicet et interiorem exteriorem carnis quo visibilia cerneret et interiorem rationis quo invisibilia agnosceret atque divina per illum carnis ut visibiles posset hosts aspicere cognoscere et vitare per illum rationis ut spirituales hosts contra animam decertantes superare valeret etc thus englished in the editions of      and      chap    of reason when the first man adam was created he received of god a double eye that is to say an outward eye whereby he might see visible things and know his bodily enemies and eschew them and an inward eye that is the eye of reason whereby he might see his spiritual enemies that fight against his soul and beware of them etc    a doctrine which certainly is erroneous that our first parents received from god when they were first created a due proportion of reason suited to their original condition is not to be doubted but there is no authority whatever to warrant the supposition of their being at first endued with that perfection of reason that attribute of a divine and spiritual nature which afterward became natural to man though the worthy author apparently means this supreme degree of reason when he tells us that man by the gift of reason is made like to the dignity of angels  per quam etiam angelicam imitatur dignitatem a falso discernendo verum et a bono malum quamobrem valde a sua degenerat origin quoties veritatem discernere negligit atque malum bono preponit ibid c       discerning truth from falsehood and evil from good whereas it appears very plainly from the scriptures that this perfection of reason was afterward acquired by unlawfully eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge for it is plain that the desire of acquiring knowledge was part of the temptation to trangress a tree to be desired to make one wise said the deluded woman and it was not until they had both of them eaten the forbidden fruit that god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil genesis iii    thereby plainly alluding to the knowledge then newly acquired by the forbidden fruit and they were driven out of the garden we are expressly told to prevent a further acquisition to the nature of man viz lest he put forth his hand and take  also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever and therefore it is certain that man was not enlightened by the divine law of reason within himself when he was first created or at least not with so great a share of it as has since been justly attributed to human nature  the third article which i have before mentioned as a principle necessarily included in that divine knowledge of good and evil which our first parents unlawfully took upon themselves is conscience and the ingenious author of doctor and student before quoted in describing the meaning of the word conscience has accordingly explained it exactly as if he had been defining the true purpose of the former principle the divine knowledge of good and evil so god says he has placed conscience in the midst of the rational soul as a light by which it should discern what it ought to do or ought not to do sic deus posuit conscientiam in medio animae rationalis tanquam lumen quo discernet quid facere vel non facere debeat doct et stud c       this is exactly the purpose of the knowledge of good and evil viz that we should use it as a light to discern what we ought to do or ought not to do or in scripture words that we may know to refuse the evil and choose the good isa vii    and again in the   th verse  from what has been said it must appear that conscience reason and sinderesis though sometimes treated as distinct principles are nevertheless essentially founded on one great principle viz the divine knowledge of good and evil and when our first parents contrary to the commands of god took that knowledge upon themselves the immediate effects of it were the most pungent workings of conscience they were conscious of their disobedience to god conscious of their shame and nakedness conscious that the divine justice must pursue them so that they would have even hid themselves had it been possible from the presence of their almighty creator but how vain was the attempt to fly from gods universal presence the universal presence of god is most elegantly described by the psalmist oh whither shall i go from thy spirit or whither shall i flee from thy presence if i ascend up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if i say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me that is with respect to gods knowledge of my thoughts and actions yea the darkness hides not from thee etc see the whole    th psalm o lord thou have searched me and known me etc    when they could not even separate themselves from the anxious warnings and forebodings even of their own consciences for conscience maintained its new habitation in their throbbing breasts attending them in their most secret retirement with a stinging remembrance of their disobedience and ingratitude and as the wilful taking of conscience upon themselves was the cause of all their misery so the effect of that one fault was the entailing sin and death on all their descendants who by the laws of nature must necessarily partake of that nature which their parents so unhappily assumed for thus  by one man sin entered into the world as we are informed by the great apostle of the gentiles and death by sin and so death passed upon all men  in or through whom all have sinned for until the law that is even before the written law of moses sin was in the world also also or moreover  the original word is  which in this place on account of the context seems more intelligible if rendered also than but which latter is the common version   sin is not imputed when there is no law but but seems better to express the meaning of  in this place than the common rendering nevertheless which gives a different turn to the sense   death reigned from adam to moses even over them who had not sinned after the similitude of adams transgression etc romans v    to    apparently meaning that as death which was the effect and punishment of imputed sin reigned from adam to moses that is until the law  so we ought to conclude that some sort of law previous to that of moses preceded sin as sin preceded death viz  as sin has reigned unto death see ver    for otherwise death could not have reigned before the written law and consequently the law to be understood by which sin entered into the world and by which death passed upon all and reigned from adam to moses was the law of internal knowledge or conscience by which all men from the time of our first parents christ alone excepted are convicted sinners for as the ways of man are not equal to his assumed knowledge he is thereby rendered guilty and obnoxious to the eternal justice of god in whose sight shall no man living be justified psalm cxliii    hence a temporal death or departure from this world is not the only fruit of sin but there is also a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation etc hebrews x    the sense of which is so deeply imprinted on the human conscience that even the most hardened offender is at some time or other affected with it otherwise sin could not be esteemed the sting of death  for if the natural light of human reason would permit men to indulge themselves with a positive assurance that death is really the last period or final dissolution of their existence the consciousness of sin would not increase the fear of death and could not therefore with propriety be esteemed the sting of death death is indeed the king of terrors and nature shrinks at its approach but the anguish of the guilty and unbelieving soul springs from a deeper source than death viz the dread of what must follow it this is a further effect of reason and human knowledge for though a man refuses to be bound by the eternal laws of reason yet reason will inform him of his guilt and its deserts and vindicate her injured laws by dreadful expectation for the very devils believe and tremble james ii     horrible gloom when reason sees no ground for hope  thus conscience though not obeyed is conscience still and a time we know will surely come when men shall begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us see also revelation vi       and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondsman and every freeman for all will be equal in that tremendous day hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand    luke xxiii  0  death therefore it is manifest is not the only object of the sinners fear or men would never seek a hiding place in what must be their graves by wishing to be buried under the very mountains and hills with the vain hope of secreting themselves from the wrath to come  and who is free from sin  in the sight of god shall no man living be justified psa cxliii   and without shedding of blood is no remission heb ix    wherefore it is manifest that the blood of every man is forfeited before god  but the almighty was graciously pleased to accept the blood of animals probably as an acknowledgment of that forfeiture and as a type of a future and more effectual redemption to atone for human guilt  for the life of the flesh said god to moses is in the blood and i have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul lev xvii     but as the necessity of redemption is thus obvious so the means of obtaining it has been as clearly revealed and therefore the same innate knowledge of good and evil which has rendered us obnoxious to gods eternal justice through disobedience will lead us if we use it as we ought to repentance and amendment and consequently to reconciliation and eternal happiness through that more effectual propitiation and redemption to which all mankind are invited by the redeemer himself who is the way and the truth and the life as no man comes unto the father but by him john xiv   for if through the offense of one our first parent adam many be dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace which is by one man jesus christ has abounded unto many and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses unto justification etc see the contrast as carried on by the apostle paul in the  th chapter of his epistle to the romans  men seldom fall indeed into any very gross offense against the eternal law till they are initiated as it were by lesser crimes and have gradually stifled the natural restraint of the innate knowledge or conscience before described and then they are no longer worthy to be called men being more properly brutes because conscience or the knowledge of good and evil which should distinguish the nature of men from brutes does no longer influence their actions  the state indeed of such unhappy men is worse than that of brutes because there is still another capital distinction in their nature which wicked men cannot cast off as they do conscience they have a living soul which must inevitably be accountable for all their actions as i have before remarked and therefore when they prefer the temporal gratification of their passions whether of pride love of unlimited power avarice lust hatred or selfishness to the eternal welfare of their souls they may be said to sell themselves for naught because all unlawful passions are increased instead of being satisfied by indulgence so that there is no bondage so wretched as that of sin  they allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those that were clean or for a little escaped from them who live in error while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants or slaves of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage   pet ii     0 see also the remainder of the same chapter for the lamentable consequences of that wretched bondage the service of sin    no slave so truly miserable as the man who is a slave to his passions whosoever commits sin is the servant or slave of sin john viii     for the truth of this conclusion no further or better proof can be expected than our saviors authority dr jackson book  0 chapter       and therefore when we are endeavoring to trace out the law of nature and principles of action in men it would be unreasonable to search for it among slaves i mean those that are slaves to their passions because such men are not their own masters and consequently are not worthy the name of men it would be neither just nor charitable to draw our conclusions concerning the nature of man from that depraved state of human nature wherein the proper and natural distinction of manhood the knowledge of good and evil which we naturally inherit from our first parents has lost its influence  no man indeed is perfect neither are all men depraved and though the depraved state of man may perhaps be most general it certainly is not universal and therefore the universal principle of action in man is not to be drawn from thence but it will be still much more profitable for us to remember when any rule of obedience is proposed as an universal principle of action that it is not so much our business or interest to trace out what really is the universal principle of action as what it ought to be i have already produced the testimony of the most learned and able lawyer among the heathens that the knowledge of good and evil is an universal principle natural to mankind and he so far esteems it as a rule of obedience that he lays it down as the foundation of law for law says he again in another place is nothing else but right and divinely inspired reason commanding what is honest and forbidding the contrary est enim lex nihil aliud nisi recta et a numine deorum tracta ratio imperans honesta prohibens contraria oration philippica    vol   p        but a modern though very learned and respectable law commentator has referred us to a different principle as a rule of obedience which is very liable to be misunderstood he informs us in page    vol   that the creator has graciously reduced the rule of obedience to this one paternal precept  that man should pursue his own happiness this says he is the foundation of what we call ethics or natural law yet in justice to the worthy author it must be allowed that the happiness which he speaks of is not selfish partial or sensual happiness for that would be a very improper subject for a paternal precept but real happiness and substantial happiness as he further expresses himself in the same page and no happiness can be real or substantial which is not lasting so that it is plain this eminent writer means that lasting and substantial happiness alone which arises from obedience to the will of god for the knowledge of which he refers us at the same time to the holy scriptures see the following page     yet even such substantial happiness can only be called an effect of which a conscientious obedience to the will of god is one of the causes but the primary cause or motive to that obedience in good men is still different from both and yet none of them can be the proper foundation of ethics or natural law  the learned author has himself assigned a more probable foundation in the preceding page to which perhaps he might mean to refer by the pronominal adjective this in the sentence which immediately follows his one paternal precept viz this is the foundation of what we call ethics or natural law for he observes in p  0 that considering the creator only as a being of infinite power he was able unquestionably to have prescribed whatever laws he pleased to his creature man however unjust or severe but as he is also a being of infinite wisdom he has laid down only such laws as were founded in those relations of justice that existed in the nature of things antecedent to any positive precept  those relations of justice then on which the other laws are founded are properly the foundation and these the learned writer himself tells us in the following sentence are the eternal immutable laws of good and evil to which the creator himself in all his dispensations conforms and which he has enabled human reason to discover so far as they are necessary for the conduct of human actions thus the foundation is clearly laid down and there is no occasion to assign any other motive of obedience to the several laws on this foundation than what is mentioned in the same sentence viz human reason by which men are enabled to discover these eternal and immutable laws of good and evil for the knowledge of what is good or what is evil is surely a sufficient motive for choosing the one and rejecting the other because good when known is as truly amiable in itself as evil is detestable and frightful so that the former most naturally engages our preference without any other motive than this natural knowledge of their respective qualities  sinister motives do nevertheless too frequently prevail through the extreme frailty of human nature which engages the greater part of mankind in the pursuit of temporal interest or partial and sensual happiness  so that if the learned commentator had mentioned selflove as the general instead of the universal principle of action i should not have thought myself obliged to have taken particular notice of that part of his work  several reasons may be assigned why it cannot be admitted as the universal principle of action  and first because the most worthy actions as i have already observed are frequently occasioned by a more generous motive than selflove  secondly because bad men are sometimes prompted to good actions through the influence of their own natural knowledge of good and evil when the occasion happens not to interfere with their particular views of private interest or their predominant passions a more remarkable instance of this perhaps was never known than what my own grandfather experienced in his acquaintance with the lord chancellor jefferies who was perhaps the most abandoned timeserver of those days if we except his companion in iniquity general kirk it would not have been possible says rapin speaking of chancellor jefferies and general kirk for him king james the iid to have found in the kingdom two men more void of all religion of all honor aad all humanity they were two tigers chafed with blood who had no pleasure but in carnage tom  0 p  0    dr sharp was as totally different and opposite to the chancellor in every part of his character as it was possible for any man to be yet the chancellor entertained a very particular regard and esteem for him he treated the doctor very roughly indeed when he had received his royal masters orders to prosecute him for preaching against popery but in every other point which did not interfere with his timeserving principles and politics he was always ready to show favor and kindness to dr sharp whenever he had an opportunity and happy it was for him that he did so for afterward in the time of his distress when a just retribution of worldly trouble overtook him insomuch that he was not only a prisoner expecting in his turn a severe execution of the laws for his injustice and cruelty but also grievously afflicted with the stone and other diseases in consequence of his former intemperance dr sharp was the only person who afforded him any comfort in his misery for he regularly visited the unhappy man in his confinement and used his best endeavors to alleviate his distress and prepare him for another world by advice and exhortation    for if this was not the case it is obvious considering the great multitude of selfish men in comparison of the just that society could not exist  and thirdly because bad actions which most abound manifestly tend even in the opinion of the offenders themselves to defeat the most essential purposes of selflove for the most hardened sinners are conscious through their innate knowledge of good and evil that their unlawful temporary gratifications tend to deprive them of their real and substantial happiness viz eternal salvation for if they had not this consciousness of evil there could be no such thing as presumptuous sin  selflove however under proper restrictions is certainly a main branch of the law of nature and though it cannot be admitted as the universal principle of action is nevertheless an universal principle but it cannot be admitted as a rule of obedience because there are many occasions when it ought to be superseded by more noble motives to action  the knowledge of good and evil is also an universal principle in man though it is still much farther from being the universal principle of action than selflove and indeed my present attempt is not to prove what is the universal principle of action but only what it ought to be as i before remarked being convinced that the one paternal precept laid down by the learned law commentator though certainly with good intentions and probably with good authority from other law writers as the rule of obedience viz that we should pursue our own happiness is very defective because the very rule itself requires a multitude of other rules to restrain it within due bounds and curb the selflove of individuals for the benefit of society  nothing is so liable to be misunderstood as our own happiness for when self alone is the object selflove can imply nothing but partiality and selfpreference so that such a rule of obedience is liable to afford a handle of excuse for actions of mere selfgratification to which the learned and worthy author or perhaps rather the adopter of the hypothesis would be entirely averse a slaveholder for instance might allege that he pursues his own happiness by extorting the unwilling service of other men because he is thereby enabled to maintain himself and family not only comfortably but elegantly and that the maintenance and support of the sugar islands and consequently the happiness of his wealthy neighbors depends upon the employing of slaves so that social benefits do also arise from it and he will likewise allege that he is obliged by selflove to persist in the measure because he cannot maintain the same happiness and comfort by any other means so that he does not act contrary to the law of nature or the rule of obedience as laid down by the most eminent writers on the subject  thus the paternal precept as it is called of pursuing our own happiness may lead men to form a false estimate of necessity or what they may think themselves obliged to undertake from their particular situation in life and will afford them the like excuse for any other vice on which a mans temporal subsistence depends  it is therefore an oblique rule which insensibly declines into mere selfgratification or private interest which is the bane of equity and justice so that selflove can no otherwise be admitted as a rule than for the purpose of measuring the due proportion of that love which we owe to the rest of mankind agreeable to a real paternal precept that will never deceive us thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself lev xix     this excellent maxim of the old law is strongly enforced and recommended in the new testament which shall hereafter be shown nay the very heathens it seems were not entirely ignorant of this divine precept for the favorite maxim of the emperor alexander severus was much to the same effect according to the report of lampridius quoted by the learned joseph mede book   p   0 viz quod tibi fieri nonvis alteri ne feceris do not to another what you would not have done to yourself neither has the doctrine been overlooked by the writers on the law of nature hobbes very judiciously refers us to this rule of obedience for the easy knowledge of what the law of nature dictates when a man doubts says he whether what he is going to do to another be agreeable to the law of nature let him suppose himself in the others room for by this means continues he when selflove and the other passions which weighed down one scale are taken thence and put into the contrary scale it is easy to guess which way the balance will turn and baron puffendorf law of nature and nations as translated by basil kennet oxford    0 p  0    remarks thereupon that  this is no other than the great rule prescribed by our savior himself of doing to men as we would be done by  the learned baron nevertheless remarks in the following paragraph  that this precept cannot be esteemed a fundamental axiom of the law of nature since it is only a corollary of that law which obliges us to hold all men equal with ourselves and therefore may be demonstrated a priori but howsoever it may be capable of being demonstrated yet this is no just objection to hobbess excellent rule for knowing  what the law of nature dictates especially as the learned objector seems afterward to have sought in vain for a more fundamental axiom of the law of nature for i cannot find that any thing he has afterward proposed is at all worthy to be compared with it either as a foundation or a rule of obedience  nevertheless in justice to the learned baron i must observe that he has well defended this general rule against the objection of dr sharrock  dr sharrock is of opinion says he that this rule is not universal because if so a judge must needs absolve the criminals left to his sentence inasmuch as he would certainly spare his own life were he in their place i must needs give a poor petitioner what sum soever he desires because i should wish to be thus dealt with if i was in his condition or i must clean my servants shoes because i require him to clean mine  but the rule says the learned baron will still remain unshaken if we observe that not one scale only but both are to be considered or that i am not only to weigh and examine what is agreeable to me but likewise what obligation or necessity lies on the other person and what i can demand of him without injuring either of our duties book   chap   p  0   neither does the barons own objection which immediately follows in the least affect the propriety of hobbess rule for the easy knowledge of what the law of nature dictates for though the nature of a rule or principle of doctrine differing from active principles be such as to induce the necessity of supposing a prior principle or instinct in man whereby he may be enabled to suggest adopt approve or obey this or any other rule which seems to be the reason of the barons refusing to acknowledge this excellent rule as a fundamental axiom of the law of nature yet the learned baron himself has multiplied the difficulty by assigning still another rule or mere principle of doctrine viz the holding all men equal with ourselves as the foundation of this rule instead of a real first cause such as the immediate inspiration of god the revelation of his will in the scriptures or the natural and divine instinct of knowing good and evil for whether the precept is inculcated and made known to man by divine revelation immediate or scriptural or merely by the natural instinct in man of knowing good and evil it may nevertheless be justly esteemed a fundamental axiom of the law of nature  the jews and christians indeed are taught the value and importance of this precept by the holy scriptures yet this is not the only means of its being known and received among men as a rule of obedience  for besides the example which i have already given concerning the emperor alexander severus it appears that the gentiles in every part of the world have demonstrated a sense of this precept without the assistance of scripture not only the ancient greeks and romans but the remote inhabitants of china and america of which a few examples are here subjoined from the additional notes of the translator of puffendorf p  0  viz aristotle in diogenes laertius lib   segm    being asked how we ought to behave ourselves toward our friends answered as we wish they would behave themselves toward us lib   tom   quod quis juris in alterum etc seneca de ira lib   c    let us suppose ourselves in the same circumstances as the person with whom we are angry that which now puts us in a passion is only the wrong opinion and estimate of ourselves we are unwilling to suffer what we are willing to do it is a saying of confucius in marcinuss hist sin lib   c    never do to another what you are unwilling to suffer from him the same precept was made use of by ynca manco capac the founder of the peruvian empire in order to the reducing his subjects to a life of civility de la vega l   c     thus it appears that not only the heathen nations of europe but also the distant uninformed inhabitants of china and america were endued by their innate knowledge of good and evil with general ideas of that most excellent precept which christ himself has declared to be the true christian rule of action and which therefore may justly be esteemed a fundamental axiom of the law of nature viz  all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets matt vii    see also luke vi    the meaning and apparent intention of this golden rule is exactly the same in effect as the other great commandment of the law thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself so that all persons who carefully examine these and other parallel texts must necessarily be convinced that the command to love our neighbor as ourselves is the one paternal precept or rather i should say the only paternal precept to which the creator has graciously reduced the rule of obedience since by the highest authority we are assured that the equitable rule of doing to others as we would that men should do unto us or in short to love our neighbor as ourselves is the law and the prophets which implies as much as if our lord had said this is the spirit or first principle of law and contains the sum and essence of all other laws the testimony of the apostle paul is nearly to the same effect  for all the law says he is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself gal v    which might well be paraphrased as follows all the law is fulfilled in one word  for the creator  has graciously reduced the rule of obedience to this one paternal precept not  that man should pursue his own happiness  but  even in this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself so that no other paternal precept can possibly be received as a general rule of obedience for all occasions except this alone which must therefore be acknowledged as the fundamental rule both of natural and revealed law concerning this golden rule of action i have wrote a separate tract under the title of the law of liberty or royal law to which i must beg leave to refer my readers for further remarks on that head  having now proved i hope that this fundamental axiom of the law of nature ought to be the universal principle of action in man i can more safely resume my discourse concerning principles of action in general it has already been shown that the knowledge of good and evil is an universal principle in man as well as selflove but i must now remark that the former has the following essential difference from selflove as an universal principle viz that it is never superseded like the latter by any just motive of duty though it is often violated in breach of duty through human frailty for all just motives of duty are perfectly consistent with it and influence the heart under its direction and guidance and even the most noble motive to action independent of inspiration or immediate revelation is so far from superseding the natural knowledge of good and evil that it may more properly be esteemed an exertion of it for instance by a due exertion of the knowledge of good and evil we promote the very first principle of all duty as it is the first great commandment viz the love of god for if we have knowledge to choose the good and reject the evil the same knowledge must incline us to prefer the author of all good when revealed to us and his commandments before every other consideration for so abrahams obedience in attempting to sacrifice his son was rendered acceptable to god he knew his maker and supreme lord by unquestionable revelation and therefore justly concluded through his natural knowledge of good and evil that the command of god ought to supersede all natural affection and selflove so that this was an effect of reason which seemed to counteract even the principles of reason itself by dissolving all the ties of nature but the patriarch thereby gave an ample proof of a sincere faith and of an unfeigned love to his creator  by what principle of action also was moses induced though the meekest of men to remonstrate to his creator when the divine indignation was declared against the ingratitude and wickedness of the children of israel in worshipping the molten calf during the time that moses continued in the mount to receive the law god said to moses  i have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people now therefore let me alone  let me rest that is from your intercessions that my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume them and i will make of thee a great nation exodus xxxii    0 now if selflove had been the universal principle of action moses would not have declined the acceptance of such a distinguished honor when tendered to him even by the almighty lord of the universe whose right of disposal could not justly be called in question but the faithful minister of the israelitish commonwealth did not seem to entertain the least sense of that imaginary paternal precept mentioned above that man should pursue his own happiness for his answer on that occasion proves that he was actuated by a principle infinitely superior to selflove i mean a true and unfeigned zeal for the glory of god arising from a right use of his natural discretion or knowledge of good and evil which directed his choice and enabled him to set aside all consideration of self or private worldly interest when he thought the circumstances of the proposition seemed likely to affect the honor of god in the misinformed opinion of the egyptians and other heathen for he besought the lord his god though god had previously forbid him saying let me alone and said lord why does thy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou have brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand wherefore should the egyptians speak and say for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth turn from thy fierce wrath said moses to the almighty and repent of this evil against thy people and he also claimed the promise by which god had absolutely bound himself to the patriarchs  to whom said moses thou swarest by thine own self and said unto them i will multiply your seed etc and the text immediately informs us that the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people exodus xxxii   to    thus god was pleased to manifest his regard and consideration even for human judgment  even for the opinion of a mere man when founded on reason and other just principles such as mankind are capable of exerting and shall earthly monarchs then presume to despise any reasonable remonstrance of their fellow men  of their equals in every other respect except that of a delegated office when it is apparent that even the supreme lord and maker of all things has condescended to hear and graciously receive a remonstrance from his creature man nay and that repeatedly on various occasions the like remonstrance was also made by moses when god declared his anger against israel for murmuring at the report given of the promised land and for proposing to return into egypt and also for attempting to stone joshua and caleb who had endeavored to appease and convince them of their error see the   th chapter of numb ver   and the lord said unto moses how long will this people provoke me and how long will it be ere they believe me for all the signs which i have showed among them i will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them and will make of thee  said god to moses a greater nation and mightier than they  but the noble principles far superior to selflove by which that great minister of state generally regulated his conduct once more prevented his acceptance of the glorious promise even though tendered by his maker his sincere regard for the glory of god agreeable to the first great commandment made him jealous that the heathen nations should falsely conceive that the lord jehovah was not able to bring his people the israelites into the land which he swear unto them so that his zeal for the glory of god was manifestly the principal motive of his answer on that occasion and moses said unto the lord then the egyptians shall hear it for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for they have heard that thou lord art among this people that thou lord art seen face to face and that thy cloud stands over them and that thou go before them by day time in a pillar of a cloud and in a pillar of fire by night now if thou shall kill all this people as one man then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak saying because the lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he swear unto them therefore he has slain them in the wilderness and now i beseech thee let the power of my lord be great according as thou have spoken saying the lord is long suffering and of great mercy forgiving iniquity and transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation pardon i beseech thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou have forgiven this people from egypt even until now and the lord said i have pardoned according to thy word numb xiv    to  0    and though a natural affection or brotherly love for his countrymen might probably be also included as an additional motive to his intercession worthy our imitation yet his own selflove was manifestly quite out of the question since he might have attained for himself the highest pitch of worldly glory without forfeiting his real or eternal happiness by such an acquisition for as the offer was made by the god of the spirits of all flesh the acceptance of it could not have been imputed to him as sinful though the contrary behavior was apparently more agreeable to the will of the almighty who was pleased to signify his approbation of mosess remonstrance and intercession by declaring to him  i have pardoned according to thy word numb xiv    to  0  also upon the rebellion of korah related in the   th chapter of numbers when god spoke to moses and aaron saying  separate yourselves from among this congregation that i may consume them in a moment yet these two great leaders of israel were so little actuated by that imaginary universal principle of action selflove that they were entirely regardless of their own danger notwithstanding the divine warning and seemed to have no other care but that of endeavoring to save their brethren from gods wrath for it does not appear that they retreated or separated themselves from among the congregation as they were expressly directed but only fell upon their faces and exerted the powers of human reason in the following short remonstrance to their maker  o god the god of the spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and will thou be wroth with all the congregation numb xvi  0      the like remonstrance founded in sound reason and natural equity had once before been made even to the almighty himself by his faithful servant abraham when god condescended to reveal to him the awful decree of divine vengeance against the populous cities of the plains of sodom   will thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked  said abraham and abraham drew near and said will thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city will thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right genesis xviii           shall not the lord of all the earth do right  thus a due exertion of right reason demonstrated the dignity of human nature and the examples just mentioned sufficiently prove that the almighty requires his creature man to judge of right and wrong and to form and declare a sound judgment upon the eternal principles of justice and righteousness agreeable to that divine knowledge with which the human mind is most certainly endowed  though abraham and his descendants moses and aaron knew that they could not exist even a single moment without the immediate protection of divine providence yet they thought it their duty to remonstrate even to their creator on the eternal principles of justice and judgment  the almighty searcher of hearts knew beforehand what they would say and the propriety of their future answers and therefore undoubtedly afforded them these extraordinary opportunities of proving to all mankind their knowledge of good and evil as well as their faith and entire dependence on the eternal justice and judgment of the divine being that these clear examples of the knowledge and dignity of human nature as also of the regard and consideration which even the great author of that nature was graciously pleased to manifest on those occasions toward the mental faculties of his creature man might be recorded to the end of time  concerning the spirit of justice and judgment with which abraham was endowed god previously declared  i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment etc genesis xviii    so that abrahams remonstrance wherein he appealed to  the justice and judgment of god was apparently agreeable to the foreknowledge and expectation of the almighty as well as the other remonstrance of abrahams descendants moses and aaron for these extraordinary exertions of human reason in appealing to the divine justice were so far from being offensive even to the supreme and eternal sovereign of the universe that on the contrary he clearly manifested his approbation by the gracious manner in which he accepted and answered these human petitions he condescended to satisfy the righteous and just spirit of abraham by an assurance that even if ten righteous persons only could be found amongst the wicked nations in the plains of sodom  i will not destroy it said he for the tens sake genesis xviii    but alas by the fatal catastrophe of all the nations in the plains of sodom soon afterward and by the very small number of individuals that were found worthy of the divine warning to escape the national punishment it is apparent that there were not even five righteous persons to be found in five royal cities genesis xiv   horrible depravity    and to the remonstrance of moses and aaron the descendants of the just abraham the like favorable attention was paid by the god of the spirits of all flesh  for as their petition was offered up in behalf of the whole congregation viz that they might not suffer for the fault of one or a few persons god condescended to spare the congregation though they had justly incurred the forfeiture of life by joining the text informs us that korah gathered all the congregation against them moses and aaron unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation whereby the guilt of the congregation is manifest numb xvi      the haughty and factious princes of israel in open rebellion to the divine ordinances contrary to the clearest evidence of all their senses for moses on offering up this short petition was immediately directed to separate the congregation from the more notorious offenders  speak unto the congregation saying  get ye up from about the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram  and moses rose up and went unto dathan and abiram and the elders of israel followed him and he spoke unto the congregation saying depart i pray you from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest ye be consumed in all their sins  and accordingly all persons that had grace sufficient to repent of their connections with these wicked men  gat up from the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram on every side and immediately afterward god was pleased to justify moses and to demonstrate the truth of his divine mission by a tremendous and unusual example of vengeance  the ground clave asunder that was under them and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their houses etc   upon the hardened offenders and their families numb xvi   to  0 and this being done in the presence of the whole congregation then a populous nation the evidence of it which is handed down to us by their descendants the jews and has also been confirmed from time to time by other instances of divine vengeance upon the same nation was thereby rendered incontestable  nevertheless the very next day all the congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron saying ye have killed the people of the lord  this further rebellion having once more provoked the divine justice the cloud covered the tabernacle and the glory of the lord appeared and moses and aaron were once more commanded to separate themselves from the congregation that a national vengeance might take place  get you up from this congregation said the almighty that i may consume them as in a moment nevertheless these two worthy ministers of god discovered no sense of fear for themselves whilst the national danger demanded their endeavors in behalf of their brethren and therefore instead of separating themselves as they had been once more commanded they once more fell upon their faces to implore the divine mercy and forgiveness of the national iniquity so that selflove was manifestly superseded by patriotism and brotherly affection and as the plague was already begun among the people the mediation of these two men was so far favored by the god of israel that moses was inspired with wisdom and presence of mind to instruct his brother aaron how to make an atonement for the people by the burning of incense  and accordingly aaron stood between the dead and the living and the plague was staid numb xvi         these are unquestionable examples to demonstrate that selflove is not the universal principle of action  upon a former intercession also of moses in behalf of his ungrateful countrymen he permitted his natural affection for them to carry him seemingly far beyond the bounds of reason and moderation in his expressions to the almighty and moses returned unto the lord and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold yet now if thou will forgive their sin and if not blot me i pray thee out of thy book which thou have written and the lord said unto moses whosoever has sinned against me him will i blot out of my book exodus xxxii           even so far as to wish that he himself might be blotted out of gods book meaning probably an exclusion from the temporal blessings promised in gods covenant or perhaps the loss of life both of which came upon him afterward for his unguarded expressions on another occasion compare numb xx    with numb xxvii        deuteronomy iv    and psalm cvi       if the sin of the people was not forgiven so that selflove is by no means the universal principle of action  the affectionate apostle paul seemed also equally anxious for the eternal welfare and prosperity of the same great nation and he expressed the like unbounded love toward them by one of the strongest hyperbolical expressions as mr burkitt calls it that he could possibly have chosen for that purpose  i could wish says he that myself were accursed from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh romans ix   and though the apostle by the words   might perhaps mean to refer only to that anathema of temporal misery and destruction denounced by christ himself against jerusalem and the unbelieving jewish nation for their open rejection of the gospel behold your house said christ is left unto you desolate matt xxiii    luke xiii    and again  when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whosoever reads let him understand said our lord then let them which be in judea flee unto the mountains etc and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days etc for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be matt xxiv        under this severe anathema of national misery the unconverted part of the jewish people might with propriety be accounted  accursed from the messiah being then separated or excommunicated as it were from the immediate protection of the eternal king of israel and by him publicly given up to temporal vengeance the sufferings and misery of which and not the reprobation which occasioned them the patriotic apostle would willingly have endured if it were possible in his own person for no otherwise could he wish to be separated from christ but in sufferings for the love of christ was unalienable  see preceding chapter ver    to    if he could thereby have removed from his nation this dreadful anathema of christs temporal vengeance which at the time the apostle wrote was dreadfully impending but whether this conjecture of mine be right or not and whether the anathema mentioned by the apostle is to be understood as temporal as eternal or both yet the same limitation with respect to the love of christ must necessarily be understood viz that the apostle wished he might perish whether in this world or the next not as an enemy of christ but as a savior of his brethren agreeable to the remark of the learned chrysostom and as christ himself also was made a curse for us gal iii    see this point clearly stated by the rev dr john sharp in his symphonia prophetarum et apostolorum printed at geneva in         yet it is manifest that the affectionate and truly patriotic apostle would have been ready to suffer every kind of temporal misery and even to lay down his life for the refractory nation if he could thereby have averted the approaching vengeance from his countrymen and restored them to grace and the promised privileges of the gospel to which they had been the first invited of all other nations and therefore we cannot surely conceive that the principle of action or motive to such a declaration was selflove  the disinterested principles of this apostle are evident also from some other expressions and especially from that in his epistle to the romans v   viz  peradventure for a good man says he some would even dare to die which idea totally excludes the principle of selflove but though the apostles expressions sufficiently prove that selflove was not his principle of action yet the same was more effectually demonstrated by his life and practice  and again when we read of jonathans inviolable friendship toward david can we conceive that he was actuated by selflove we cannot mention that principle without injustice to the generous character of that truly noble prince unless we speak of it comparatively to show that his friendship and brotherly love was equal to it for the scripture repeatedly informs us that he loved david as his own soul  it was not an unreasonable friendship he was well convinced of the merit and virtue of david for on these he founded his love and he had too much virtue himself to violate a reasonable friendship even though his own private interest and very inheritance was at stake  these points were most earnestly pressed upon him with all the authority that an anxious worldlyminded father could possibly assume and yet without effect  as long as the son of jesse lives upon the ground said saul to jonathan thou shall not be established nor thy kingdom wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely die now if selflove had been the principle of action with jonathan he could not have greater temptation but he knew how to refuse the evil and choose the good and would not therefore submit like modern statesmen to the wretched policy of doing evil that good might come  honor and justice were his principles of action and he was willing to risque not only his worldly dignity and state but his life also rather than injure and forsake an innocent man wherefore shall he be slain said he what harm has he done  and when he found that his father persisted in his base resolution he was filled with honest indignation and as the text informs rose from the table in fierce anger  not on account of his fathers injurious behavior to himself in attempting to kill him with a javelin but because he was grieved for david says the text and that his father had done him shame see   samuel xx    to     and again  was david king of israel actuated by selflove when he tendered his own life to save the lives of his subjects praying god to let his hand be against him and against his fathers house instead of the nation in general  surely his principles of action were very different from selflove or from that imaginary paternal precept of seeking his own happiness  his conscience probably informed him that he was guilty before god in having numbered the israelites to satisfy some vain or presumptuous curiosity concerning the strength of the nation at a time when his whole confidence and hope of success against his enemies ought to have been placed in god alone and he would perhaps then recollect that the same sinful presumption within himself which had occasioned the undertaking had also occasioned this example proves that kings and princes are indispensably bound to exercise themselves daily and constantly in the study of the holy scriptures agreeable to the command in deuteronomy xvii      0 and it shall be when he sits upon the throne of his kingdom that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the levites and it shall be with him and he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to fear the lord his god to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to do them that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren and that he turn not aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom he and his children in the midst of israel lest they should inadvertently occasion any breach of gods laws and thereby draw down the divine vengeance upon themselves as well as their unwary subjects who are equally guilty whenever they comply with an unlawful command   the neglect of that tribute or offering to god which in the law is expressly enjoined to be given as a ransom for the soul of every individual of that nation whenever they should be numbered viz half a shekel for every one when thou take the sum of the children of israel after their number said god to moses then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the lord when thou numberest them that there be no plague among them when thou numberest them etc see exodus xxx    to     reason and conscience therefore taught him that he himself was the principal aggressor and these just principles joined to a patriotic regard for the preservation of his countrymen certainly induced him to present himself to god as the proper victim of divine vengeance  for david spoke unto the lord when he saw the angel that smote the people and said  lo i have sinned and i have done wickedly but these sheep what have they done let thine hand i pray thee be against me and against my fathers house etc   samuel xxiv     it would surely be highly absurd to attribute so pathetic and penitent a declaration to the principle of selflove some excellent arguments and very striking examples have been produced by the truly benevolent mr brook of dublin in his fool of quality to prove that selflove is by no means the universal principle of action  to quote the authority of a romance in a tract on the first principles of law will perhaps at first sight give offense to many of my readers but for my excuse i rely on the propriety of the arguments themselves and the just application of the several real examples by which they are illustrated i should never of my own accord i confess have consulted any work under the form of a novel for information of this kind but the sentiments of this sensible author being pointed out to me by a worthy friend i thought it would be injustice to my argument if i neglected to refer my readers to the clear light which the worthy author of the fool of quality has thrown upon the subject when he makes his earl of moreland enquire whence how by what means may a man arrive at happiness  by getting out of himself my lord  answered his worthy character mr meekly out of himself mr meekly you astonish me greatly a contradiction in terms unnatural impossible  god himself my lord cannot make a man happy in any other way either here or hereafter it is said the earl an established maxim among all thinking men whether divines or philosophers that selflove is the motive to all human actions  virtue forbid exclaimed mr meekly all actions are justly held good or evil base or honorable detestable or amiable merely according to their motives but if the motive is the same in all there is an end at once to the possibility of virtue the cruel and the kind the faithful and the perfidious the prostitute and the patriot are confounded together etc  he afterward relates in very striking terms the wellknown example of damon and pythias whose inviolable friendship triumphed over selflove as well as over the cruel intentions of the tyrant dionysius  then follows the authors excellent definition of the term self wherein he demonstrates the necessity of overcoming selfishness by superior principles originally communicated to our nature by the divine intelligence and he proves that such principles have prevailed in the world by reminding us of the ancient states of sparta and rome which derived their luster and power their whole preeminence and praise says he from this principle of communication which in them was called love of country but this beatifying principle continues he was still more eminently instanced in the society of the church of jerusalem who had all things in common who imparted their possessions to all men as every man had need and thence did eat their common bread with gladness and singleness of heart praising god and having favor with all people etc  he afterward mentions the instances of the roman regulus and the decii as also that of leonidas and his three hundred spartans who devoted their lives for the liberties of greece etc and lastly exemplifies this disregard of self the vital source and principle of every virtue in six mechanics or craftsmen of the city of calais when it was besieged by king edward the  d  the whole argument with the examples are too long to be inserted here but are highly worthy the readers perusal  see the fool of quality vol   p        0    the monarch of israel was actuated by a much less reasonable principle of action and still very opposite to selflove when he uttered that bitter lamentation for the death of his wicked rebellious and incestuous son absalom  would to god said he i had died for thee my son  natural paternal affection was more powerful in this case than reason and every other principle of action even selflove which is also a natural affection and generally very potent was entirely superseded by it for the king most earnestly wished that he himself had died instead of that unnatural wretch who he was well aware ceased not whilst he lived to plot his fathers ruin being an enemy he well knew that was implacable that was restless and impatient to deprive him not only of his kingdom but of his life and had already violated his bed in the most public and shameless manner with the detestable crime of incest  there was no room to hope for the reformation of a wretch that had so entirely lost all distinction between good and evil  no gleam of happiness for his injured father but in his death  and yet paternal affection compelled the latter to esteem even his own death preferable if he could thereby have prolonged the wretchs life  o my son absalom my son my son absalom  would to god said he i had died for thee o absalom my son my son   samuel xviii     thus it appears that selflove is by no means the universal principle of action since there are other affections which sometimes supersede it and become the leading principles of action  a certain noble author of the last century in a work entitled a view of the soul has several chapters concerning the power and influence of the affections over all the other natural faculties reason itself not being excepted and in one chapter he attempts to prove that some affection is the substantial part of the soul i have thought says this author and do think and believe which is somewhat more than a thought it is a thought with the concurrence approbation and allowance of ones reason that the soul of man is immortal and that the very essence or substantial part of a human soul disrobed of a body or subsisting of itself is some restless working however at some times invisible affection and that if those more noble faculties of our soul next and immediately under that bright heavenly star are the pilots to conduct us unto rest some affection as it seems to me is the chief passenger in this frail and weak vessel of the flesh st paul in that admirable encomium of his of charity tells us that it abides when many other gifts fail and if we shall know as we are known as he tells us in another place there will be then little use of the invention memory reason or the like which are but the handmaids to knowledge neither can i rationally imagine after return of the soul to its place of rest or for default thereof in its banishment to everlasting wandering any use of other faculties than the affections unless toward the exalting or heightening them in their several degrees whether love and joy on the one side or sorrow fear etc on the other  the soul of man being an emanation from that divine love must necessarily partake of it love and not able at present by any natural light it has to reach unto itself its proper object lays hold on any thing rather than seem to vanish or be extinct and withal that it happens to have such several inclinations in man while it is here is surely by reason of some false imaginary light or the want of a true one and that we want both power and skill in the setting or tuning some strings of the affections as i may call them and it is want of a clear inspect into our nature and frame that we become as david speaks a stubborn generation a generation that set not their hearts aright and whose spirit cleaves not steadfastly to god and i do further believe that all the faculties strength and power of the soul which we have are given us toward the performance of that first and great commandment thou shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with a thy mind the whole soul beside seems naturally subservient if not subsequent to the affections motion and the motion of the soul would be strange without them and not imaginable they being as necessary as they are useful and therefore i think we may as well cease to be by our own power as cease to affect and they who have gone furthest or most covertly herein have in going about to hide some particular affections showed others more visibly and for the covering of their joy or sorrow fear or anger or the like have set up for predominant in their soul a seeming contempt of all things which is an affection itself and for ought i know as subject to be faulty as any for surely the soul may seem no less glorious in its march with all its parts and retinue than some of them provided it marches the right way and each faculty help and assist and not go about to destroy each other a view of the soul sect   pages  0    0    but though the affections are certainly to be esteemed principles of action yet they cannot at any rate be admitted as rules of obedience as i have before observed concerning the affection of selflove because the generality of mankind are more liable to be influenced by evil misplaced affections than by those which might tend to their real happiness  the affections of the avaricious man for instance are all subordinate to his affection for amassing temporal wealth  he may love his wife and children perhaps when the natural affections of the husband and parent do not interfere with his predominant passion for riches but whenever they do the wretch loses all feeling for his own flesh and blood and will eagerly sacrifice to mammon the peace of his family and the happiness of his beloved children even in the most material circumstance of their lives and though such a wretch is sometimes influenced indeed by the more general principle of selflove that is whenever the consideration of self happens to fall in competition with his duty to other men yet even selflove itself must yield to the love of hoarding since it is the wellknown characteristic of the miser to withhold all the comforts of life even from himself in order that he may indulge his unreasonable affection for amassing wealth which depravity if not assiduously and carefully checked in time will most surely increase with age till it becomes inveterate and irresistible and entirely enslave its wretched votary  it would be well for such men if they deprived themselves only of temporal comforts but alas avarice defeats selflove even in its most important concern eternal welfare go to now ye rich men weep and howl of your miseries that shall come upon you james v   compare this with what has already been mentioned in pages      0  the depraved appetites and affections of drunkards and gluttons are also principles of action which are frequently too powerful both for reason and conscience and even for selflove for they too often lead men with their eyes open to certain destruction even though they are warned by the clearest conviction and foreknowledge concerning the inevitable consequences of their respective vices diseases misery and death may stare them in the face and mark them by their gradual approaches as the unfortunate victims of these criminal indulgencies  but how seldom do they deter nay the certain expectation even of eternal damnation is not sufficient to reform them and the learned dr hales has produced an example  so bewitching is this infatuation that though they cannot most of them but be sensible says dr hales that they are manifestly shortening their days and just plunging themselves into their graves yet will they not refrain this an eminent physician was so sensible of from his own unhappy experience that he said when men had got a habit of it they would go on though they saw hellfire burning before them a friendly admonition to drinkers of gin brandy etc by stephen hales dd p      concerning drunkards to prove that they would go on even though they should see hellfire before their eyes  the depraved affections for every other vice as lust gaming etc are equally capable of supplanting the universal principles of selflove and common sense and do frequently carry men headlong to destruction when it is impossible but that they must have foreseen the necessary consequences of their inordinate pursuits  how carefully therefore ought mankind to guard themselves against every unlawful affection and strenuously to resist them whenever they occur lest any undue affection should become the reigning principle of action and lead the poor enslaved mortal to eternal destruction from whence come wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members ye lust and have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight and war yet ye have not because ye ask not ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god james iv       but many actions which may seem apparently to have been occasioned merely by corrupt affections are nevertheless promoted by a more latent cause i mean the inspiration or influence of the spiritual enemies the devil is not merely a name which those who would sap the foundations of religion pretend religion has contrived to frighten timorous minds nor is danger then only to be apprehended from him when he is supposed to assume a bodily form it is superstitious weakness to be afraid of him only when imbodied and to neglect the secret and unseen influence which his continual converse with us as an unimbodied spirit may have upon us he and his angels are not yet cast into outer darkness though it be prepared for them the mouth of the bottomless pit is not yet closed over them they fell from god not so much by a local descent as by mental apostasy and dissimilitude and they have still this visible world once the seat of their happiness and glory to range in they are therefore styled by the apostle spiritual wickednesses in high places and their leader is called the god of this world the prince of darkness the prince of the power of the air uncloathed and unimbodied spirits may converse with us by secret illapses without our perception of the medium through which they act even the wind blows where it lists and we hear the sound thereof but cannot tell whence it comes nor whither it goes as there are divine illuminations communicated to the soul by the good spirit of truth so there are impure suggestions to the fancy made by the evil spirit of darkness and a watchful observer of his own heart must have heard the frequent whispers both of the voice of wisdom and the voice of folly he from whose eyes a heavenborn faith in christ has removed the scales of corruption may easily discern the calm irradiations of divine light leading him to holiness and peace and the foul and disturbed fires of satan betraying him into sin and misery  but though our enemy be invisible and on that account more able to execute his malignant designs against us yet let us not so dread his power as to decline the contest while our minds are constantly turned to that light which lights every man that comes into the world while we desire it and depend upon it as the light of life we shall always be able to know and to guard against the stratagems of the apostate spirit whether he appears in his own naked deformity or clothes himself like an angel of light a forced imitation will always fall short of the archetype and though sin and falsehood may put on the mantle of holiness and truth yet he that is inwardly acquainted with the truth as it is in jesus and ingenuously loves and pursues it will be able to detect the imposture and through the veil behold the blackness and malignity of the enemies to his peace evangelical discourses by the worthy and ingenious mr john pain discourse v p            and deceivers of mankind which must also be reckoned amongst the various principles or motives to action because nothing can be more certain than that these incorporeal malignant beings take a most dangerous advantage though unperceived of all immoral carnal affections in unguarded worldly men and do thereby lead the unwary and careless liver into the most detestable slavery the original or fundamental temptation by which satan draws men into the snare of servitude or bondage spiritual is by enlarging or improving their desires not of things simply evil but of things either natural or indifferent that is for their kind or quality not unlawful these desires being improved unto the full or unto some excessive measure do by long custom or continuance require satisfaction by as strong a law of necessity at least as importunately as our natural desires of food or raiment do the more excessive or exorbitant any desire is the more impatient it is of repulse it is as impossible for a greedy or ravenous appetite to be satisfied with a spare or moderate diet as for a moderate appetite to be satisfied without any food at all a vain fantastic that takes proud clothes to be part of himself is as desirous of change of suits or costly apparel as a poor man is of apparel itself or of such stuff as is sufficient to keep out cold and wet an ambitious spirit is not so well content with an ordinary place or rank amongst freemen as an ingenuous mind will be with the estate or condition of an hired servant if no better by means fair and honest be likely to befall him a man apt to overprize himself and jealous withal of contempt of wrong or of gross abuse is not so easily appeased with streams of blood as a calm and gentle spirit is with an ingenuous acknowledgment of wrongs done or with a courteous answer for wrongs suspected the desire of wealth or worldly goods after it has once exceeded its lawful bounds becomes as unsatisfiable as hell it enlarges itself by often satisfaction and of all earthly and mortal things it knows no stint or period of growth but grows strong and lusty by waxing old  none of these desires of meat of drink of apparel of satisfaction for wrongs done or suspected of honor riches or preferment are in themselves or for their quality unlawful their unlawfulness consists only in their excess but even the best of these or like desires being improved beyond its measure will for its private satisfaction betray the soul which gives it harbor into satans hands he does not he need not tempt any man to be a thief a robber or a murderer for as st james tells us chap     every man is tempted to these and the like crimes by his own concupiscence and our concupiscences and sensual desires are always increased by custom he that has long inured himself to exceed either in quality of meat or drink or to fare deliciously desires only to satisfy his appetite or to observe his delightful custom so these may be satisfied he has no desire to be a thief to be a cheater or couzener but rather than his intemperate appetite should be unsatisfied he will take himself to some other part of satans service and adventure on theft or murder or any other breach of gods commandments dr jacksons works vol   p       that they may dishonor the work of god and prepare the deluded mortal for eternal shame and punishment  the amazing power and force of the unlawful affections which i have already described cannot reasonably be accounted for on any other principles we have no right however to murmur at gods permission of spiritual temptations whereby the divine knowledge of good and evil presumptuously assumed by man is proved and tried especially as the almighty has mercifully been pleased to give us the most ample warning throughout the scriptures of our continual danger insomuch that the christian church has generally made the necessary resistance to evil spirits an express article of the baptismal vow viz to renounce the devil and all his works nevertheless the unreasonable heresy of the sadduces who were the deists of ancient times not only subsists to this day but seems even to prevail in a most dangerous degree for there are many people amongst us who profess to believe the scriptures and yet affect to disbelieve the existence of those malignant spiritual beings commonly mentioned and signified under the name of the devil though the scriptures afford the clearest testimony concerning them but our modern sadduces endeavor to explain all texts wherein devils or evil spirits are mentioned as mere customary figures of speech expressive of some evil affections and sometimes of mere bodily disorders according to them said archbp sharp the devil that is so often spoken of in the scriptures is nothing else but either a disease of the body or a phantasm in the brain or the wicked principles and inclinations of a mans heart this is the doctrine of mr hobbs and his followers  but there cannot a vainer conceit enter into a mans head than this is by the very same logic that they can prove this they may likewise prove that all those men that are spoken of in the old and new testament were not real persons but qualities for it is certain that the devil is in the scripture as much represented as a person a real subsisting being distinct from god and from good angels and from mankind i say he is as plainly thus represented as any man or woman that is there mentioned is and he for instance that will say that when our savior was tempted by the devil in the wilderness all this was but a transaction of his imagination and that it was only his own fancy that presented to his eyes all the kingdoms of the world and that it was only his own fancy that set him upon a pinnacle of the temple and would have had him fallen down and worshipped it i say he that would give such an account as this of that matter may with the same reason say that jesus himself was but a phantasm an imagination and that there was never such a real person in the world  the devil then has a real being of his own independent of us or any other creature and that being is of the spiritual or angelic nature as there are good spirits and good angels so there are evil spirits and evil angels and of this latter sort is the the devil  but then secondly when we are speaking of the devil we are not to understand any one particular being or any one particular evil spirit but the whole aggregate or company of evil spirits which inhabit round about us in the lower regions of the air all these are in the scripture language and in common speech called by the name of the devil and sometimes in the plural number by the name of devils  for the understanding this we are to know that among that infinite and innumerable company of angels which god created in a happy and glorious condition all of them did not continue in that primitive happiness but several of them by their wilful apostasy from god forfeited that dignity and glory they were possessed of and so depraved their natures that they were incapable of dwelling any longer where they did before but were by the just vengeance of god cast down into these lower regions of the air where they are reserved by providence to the judgment and punishment of the great day  this is the plain account that the scriptures give us as to this matter thus st jude in the  th verse of his epistle the angels says he that kept not their first estate but left their own habitations them has god reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day and just to the same purpose and almost in the same words does st peter speak in the second chapter of his second epistle verse the fourth  these fallen angels now thus thrust down from heaven though they do yet in a great measure retain all the intellectual accomplishments of the angelical nature such as reason and memory and knowledge yet are they in their moral qualities quite contrary to all the good angels and particularly as to this that as the good angels are infinitely kind and benign great lovers of god and of mankind and most entirely disposed to do all good offices to them whatsoever so the nature of those fallen angels is cruel and revengeful full of hatred and spite and malice to god and to his whole creation and upon account of this the scripture has given to them the name of satan or devil which two words as all that understand the learned languages know signify neither more nor less than an adversary or an accuser or calumniator the one being the hebrew word for it and the other the greek word and indeed it is with reference to this enmity to mankind that most of these names and characters that they bear in scripture are bestowed upon them upon this account it is that the devil is called a murderer a deceiver a liar and the father of lies the destroyer the old serpent the great dragon with sundry other such appellations but then though these names being put in the singular number seem to denote some single evil spirit that bears ill will to mankind yet we are always to remember that they are to be expounded collectively that is to say to signify the whole body of these apostate spirits of which there are a vast number i say the whole body of them for that these lapsed angels are formed into a body politic or government or kingdom is plainly enough intimated in the new testament for there we meet with the kingdom of darkness in opposition to the kingdom of light and there we meet with the prince of the devils as the chief of them who is likewise by st paul called the god of this world and the prince of the power of the air under whom also as in other societies there are many subordinate officers as st paul seems to intimate in the  th of the ephesians where among the wicked spirits in heavenly places that is in the air as grotius with the ancients rightly expounds it that he says we wrestle against he makes mention in the plural number of principalities and powers and other rulers of the darkness of this world  this is the scripture account of these matters i must confess it may seem a very odd thing to some that there should be in the world a society of such spirits as are confessedly endowed with all the knowledge and subtilty of the angelical nature and yet are so horribly degenerated in their morals as to take pleasure in every thing that is naught and even in ruining mankind if they could but that it is really possible that there should be such beings does in some measure appear from the prodigious instances of the depravation of reasonable natures that we sometimes see among ourselves there being men of excellent parts and endowments to be found that do sometimes so far degenerate from human kind that for all manner of wickedness and malice they may be rather called devils than men but that it is more than possible that there are a race of such spirits as do malign the welfare of mankind and take pleasure in making fools and wretches and slaves of them is too evident both from all the histories of past ages and from the sad experience of some nations at this day who if we may credit the histories that are writ of them do miserably groan under the violences and tyranny of the devil but however no one that acknowledges the truth of the scripture can possibly doubt of this for what i have now delivered is so plainly affirmed in the old and new testament that there is no evading of it and indeed this hypothesis of the being of evil spirits and their ill will to mankind and their concerning themselves continually to do us mischief is so interwoven with and makes so considerable a part of the scheme of our religion as it is delivered by christ and his apostles that we cannot deny the one without much weakening if not altogether overthrowing the other archbishop sharps sermons vol   p  0        howsoever plausible this kind of sophistry may appear where applied to some few particular passages yet there are others so clear in the literal expression and so well guarded by the scope or intention of the subject delivered in the context that it is impossible to wrest them from the obvious literal meaning without perverting all the rules of grammar and common sense  we are most carefully warned by the great apostle to the gentiles to be upon our guard against these powers of darkness  put on the whole armor of god says he that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not with flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places ephesians vi        in the same epistle iv    the apostle still further warns the ephesians against the spiritual enemy neither says he give place to the devil and in his  d epistle to the corinthians ii  0    he signifies his forgiveness to some offending person probably meaning that fornicator whom he ordered in the  st epistle chap   to be excommunicated he says for your sakes forgave i it in the person or in the sight or presence of christ lest satan should get an advantage over us for we are not ignorant of his devices the apostle james also warns us upon the same points resist the devil says he and he will flee from you iv   and the apostle peter is still more particular in his advice on this head  be sober be vigilant says he because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faithetc   pet v    the same apostle also tells us that god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment   pet ii   the word which is here translated  down to hell viz   down to tartarus or in tartarus is derived from the greek verb  terreo to dread or be in terror so that even if tartarus or hell does not signify a real place but the place of torment or hell after the day of judgment must necessarily signify a real place of material fire because all men are to rise again with their bodies and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god job xix     and consequently will be capable of bodily punishment for it is not the soul alone but the whole body of the unrepenting sinner that will be cast into hell if thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell matt v  0 0  and as human bodies after the resurrection will be incorruptible for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality   cor xv    or everlasting so of course they will be capable of everlasting bodily punishment in the fire that never shall be quenched where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched mark ix       and this fire which must be a material fire as bodies are to be punished in it is the very same fire that is prepared for the devil and his angels depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels matt xxv     and consequently we may be assured that the latter though spirits will also be rendered as capable as the human bodies of feeling the perpetual torment of that fire and lastly it is not improbable that even this terrestial globe on which the worldlyminded seem to place their whole desire and happiness may hereafter become that very hell or place of future punishment both for wicked men and devils since it has so long been the seat both of human and diabolical wickedness for moses seems to intimate in his prophetical song that there is a worldly hell  a fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell  and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountains deuteronomy xxxii    commentators generally remark indeed that hell is mentioned here only as a type or metaphor of the most extreme temporal misery or sufferings in this life agreeable to the tenor of the subject carried on in the following verses yet the having recourse to such a metaphor certainty implies a real idea of hell and of the future destruction of the world by fire for otherwise the recital of these circumstances even as metaphors or types would be useless and unintelligible it may be objected indeed that the present world will be consumed or agreeable to the literal expression of the hebrew in this text eat by the fire which is also foretold by the apostle peter  that the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up   pet iii  0 so that the earthly fire must at length cease for want of materials if all earthly things are to be burned up and to pass away heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away matt xxiv    see also chap v    and luke xvi    in fire and smoke whereas the fire prepared for the devil and his angels is expressly declared to be an everlasting fire matthew xxv    yet these last considerations will afford no just objection to what i have before suggested because the almighty can surely render the fire perpetual by a continual accession of new materials as the old are consumed or by a variety of other means which like most other operations of providence are infinitely above human comprehension agreeable to the intimation of the prophet isaiah though the same is also given as a metaphor of extreme temporal sufferings  viz and the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch and the dust thereof into brimstone and the land thereof shall become burning pitch it shall not be quenched night nor day the smoke thereof shall go up for ever etc isaiah xxxiv    0    it signifies at least an actual state or condition of extreme terror and horrible darkness in which even spirits may be involved or as it were bound for the apostle by the idea of darkness here expressed may perhaps allude to a total exclusion from the light comfort and influence of the divine grace or an entire withdrawing of the glorious creators light and spirit by which exclusion or withdrawing the wilful reprobacy of these rebellious angels might probably have been fixed upon them as an indelible stain of infamy to mark them for future punishment and to exclude them from all hope of escaping the divine justice so that those spiritual beings which once were glorious in their nature being created angels of light have rendered themselves most inglorious and detestable by misusing that liberty in which the benevolent creator had placed them for they kept not their first estate and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the great day jude    but wickedly withdrew themselves from their own habitation and have thereby been the wilful authors of their own disgraceful and depraved nature the diabolical disposition which is founded only in their own voluntary wickedness for god is not the author of confusion god has declared indeed by his prophet isaiah c xlv   i form the light and create darkness i make peace and create evil i the lord do all these things but the latter part of this sentence says the learned dr louth prebend of winchester in      explains the former light being often put for happiness and darkness for adversity the sense is continues the doctor that all the vicissitudes of good or ill success are to be ascribed to providence god sets up one kingdom that of cyrus and pulls down another the babylonian monarchy commentary on isaiah p     to the same effect is the paraphrase of the learned deodati viz i am the cause of all goodness and prosperity through my benignity as likewise by my justice i am author of afflictions punishments and calamities and indeed commentators in general agree that the evil here to be understood is not the evil of sins and vices  modo hic excludas peccata et vitia quae sunt ex homine says the learned vitringa but the evil of afflictions sicknesses subjection to foreign enemies and all other external or bodily sufferings whereby mankind are either proved and tried that they may thereby set forth due examples of faith and patience to others or else are punished and chastised according to the just dispensation of gods providence in the government of the world nevertheless god both proves and punishes mankind even by internal evil for as the supreme direction and control of all things whatsoever belong absolutely to god alone he is said in scripture to do what he only permits upon just occasions as when men wilfully forsake gods laws and religion preferring temporal gratifications to justice righteousness and truth such a gross abuse of the natural knowledge of good and evil is presumptuous sin and  he that commits sin is of the devil   john iii   but if god permits men to be ensnared by the delusions of the devil after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish  a plain reason is assigned for such permission  because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned or judged who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness   thessalonians ii          by withdrawing his restraining grace from man and giving him up entirely to the bent of his own inclination god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts etc and again  god gave them up unto vile affections and again god gave them over to a reprobate mind etc for all which plain reasons are given showing that the wilful wickedness of man is the one foundation or first cause of gods deserting or thus giving them up so that they are without excuse says the apostle paul because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools etc wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts etc see romans i  0     and even gods own servants may sometimes be deserted or left to themselves for a time as king hezekiah was upon a particular occasion when the ambassadors came to him from babylon to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land for then god left him to try him that he might know all  that was in his heart   chronicles xxiii    that is according to the dutch annotation that god might make known to hiskia and to all the church what was in his heart for god made trial of him for a while by the forementioned desertion that he might know himself and out of the sense and feeling of his own weakness and impotency might have cause to humble himself and that all believers beholding their own weakness and infirmity in him might work out their own salvation with fear and trembling and accordingly we road that hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart both he and the inhabitants of jerusalem so that the wrath of the lord came not upon them in the days of hezekiah   chronicles xxxii    this example affords a clear illustration of the true sense in which god may be said to tempt or to lead into temptation viz god left him to try him etc    or by ceasing to restrain the power of spiritual deceivers when the divine vengeance and retribution was to be poured upon the wicked king ahab he was given up to the delusion of wicked spirits  and the lord said who shall persuade ahab that he may go up and fall at ramoth gilead etc and there came forth a spirit and stood before the lord and said i will persuade him and the lord said unto him wherewith and he said i will go forth and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and he said thou shall persuade and prevail also go forth and do so wherefore the true prophet micaiah told ahab  behold the lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets etc   kings xxii  0     here the effects of gods permission is plainly considered as the act of god for the spirit being rendered free to act agreeable to its own wicked principles upon the persons mentioned effected the purpose of the divine justice and retribution upon ahab thus the very devils are used as instruments to fulfill the eternal justice and judgment of the almighty upon the unrighteous and in such cases may properly be said to become the principles of action in man    hence arises the necessity of our daily prayer  lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil notwithstanding that we are assured by the apostle james that god tempts none  but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then says he when lust has conceived it brings forth sin and sin when it is finished brings forth death jam i        this latter text teaches us how we are to comprehend and limit such expressions as that above quoted from the lords prayer    but of peace   cor xiv    god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempts he any man or rather he tempts none  no beings whatsoever james i    and  out of the mouth of the most high proceeds not evil and good lam iii    so that as iniquity can have no fellowship god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin   john i      with god these apostate spirits have of course been totally excluded from every ray of the divine light whereby instead of continuing angels of light as at first created they are become totally dark and opposite in every principle to the light goodness and mercy of the almighty so that they may now be called with propriety angels of darkness for though they sometimes deceitfully assume the opposite character for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light   cor xi     in order to deceive the unwary yet their power is only of darkness the apostle paul apparently means these wicked angels or spirits when he warns us against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world ephesians vi    and elsewhere they are spoken of collectively as the power of darkness giving thanks unto the father says the same apostle which has made us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son col i        this is your hour said our lord to the chief priests and elders of the jews who came to apprehend him and the power of darkness luke xxii    the power of death has also been attributed to the same malignant spirits for christ took upon himself our nature flesh and blood  that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage heb ii          being bound as it were in the dark chains   pet ii   of their own iniquity or reprobacy  in the everlasting chains of horrible darkness jude    whereby they are effectually reserved for judgment without being deprived of that activity in exercising the malignity of their fixed reprobate principles and proneness to do evil which the scriptures in many other passages attribute to them for without some such supposition how shall we reconcile the abovementioned text of the apostle peter as also that which is parallel to it in the epistle of jude wherein the fallen angels are represented as bound in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day jude   with those other texts before quoted from the apostles paul james and peter concerning the activity and vigilance of diabolical spirits  the apostle paul as i before remarked warns us of the wiles of the devil by which word in the singular number is commonly understood the prince the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience ephesians ii   now shall the prince of this world be cast out john xii     beelzebub the prince of the devils matt xii         or chief of the fallen angels and tells that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world etc ephesians vi       being a clear declaration of the agency and activity of these invisible spiritual beings  again the apostle james tells us to resist the devil and he will flee from us which excludes every idea of his being actually bound in chains of confinement and the apostle peter represents him as a roaring lion that walks about seeking whom he may devour which absolutely forbids the belief of a local confinement in any one place so that the chains of darkness in tartarus may very well express such a total darkness of apostasy and absolute reprobation as i have supposed wherein the disobedient angels are bound and reserved for the day of vengeance for the everlasting fire having in a former note at p     made some remarks concerning the probability that the present terrestrial globe on which the greater part of mankind seem to place their whole interest and desire will hereafter become the region of everlasting fire or hell i have since had the satisfaction to find on a further examination of that point that the same opinion has been long ago decisively asserted by my own grandfather in a sermon concerning the manner of the day of judgment and though i could wish my readers to peruse the whole sermon yet i must beg leave to lay before them a short extract from it which is much to my present purpose  the second particular says he which the scriptures acquaint us with concerning the general judgment is this that the earth shall then be set on fire and that in the most terrible manner imaginable whether this general conflagration will happen upon christs coming to judgment or rather will be the last transaction of the judgment the scripture does not declare but that there shall be such a conflagration and that this fire shall be for the everlasting punishment both of the devil and wicked men who will all be tumbled down into these lower regions which will then be a perfect lake or sea of fire as the scripture expresses it rev xix  0 is beyond all doubt to this purpose let us observe what the apostle says the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire to take vengeance of them that know not god and obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ   thessalonians i    but more expressly this conflagration of the world is taught us in the second epistle of st peter chap iii     where the apostle tells us that as the world which was of old perished by an universal deluge of water so the heavens and the earth which are now are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men from whence it is plain that at the day of judgment this world shall be set on fire and that fire shall be for the punishment of ungodly men furthermore in the verses following he adds to the same purpose the day of the lord shall come as a thief in the night in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up ver  0  if any one be at a loss to conceive how the heavens should be set on fire as well as the earth as st peter three times in this chapter affirms they shall be the difficulty will be removed by considering that the heavens here spoken of are not those heavens in which stars are in which signification we commonly use that word but the sublunary heavens viz those lower regions of the air wherein are the clouds and vapors and other meteors which are here called the elements and in which sense the heavens are frequently taken in holy scripture now these heavens together with all that is in them shall at that day pass away with a crackling noise of fire and the earth and all the things in it shall be put in flames david tells us that upon the wicked god shall rain fire and brimstone and an horrible tempest this shall be the portion of their cup psalm xi   and our savior intimates the same when he tells us as in the day when lot went out of sodom it it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all so shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed luke xvii     0  and now who can express the horror and confusion that shall be at that day who can fancy so sad and dismal a face of things as shall then be all the world over could we imagine ourselves to be present when the whole frame of nature is upon the point of dissolution and the whole world in flames about our ears with what terror and amazement should we be filled how would our hearts fail us and our joints be loosed and our knees smite against each other dan v   unless we were sure we were in the number of those who should be wafted up to meet the bridegroom with comfort oh what will then become of all impenitent sinners what will become of all worldly sensual ambitious voluptuous men who set up their rest in this world and mind nothing but their ease and the gratification of their appetites or the pursuit of their secular interests when they shall see all that they loved all that they admired all that they delighted in gone irrecoverably gone in a moment lastly what will become of all those bold profane persons who entertained all discourses of a future judgment only with scoffs and derision oh how will they find themselves abused and see to their great amazement what they would never before believe that there is a reward for the righteous that there is indeed a god that judges the earth ps lviii    archbishop sharps sermons vol   p           d edit   prepared for the devil and his angels matt xxv    being marked and distinguished from other spirits by their confirmed propensity to evil and their continual opposition to every good principle which renders their final condemnation to that everlasting fire inevitable for the devils also believe and tremble james ii    by which it seems they foreknow their own certain condemnation like those abandoned human sinners who sin wilfully after they have received the knowledge of the truth to whom there remains no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries heb x        this clear description of human reprobacy opens to us a very probable idea of the angelic reprobacy or the mode whereby the nature of devils was first occasioned and at the same time proves that men are equally liable to fall into the same lamentable degeneracy and horrible apostasy from god and thereby may become a sort of devils thus the reprobate judas was mentioned even by our lord himself who knew the wilful wickedness of his avaricious heart john vi    for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him john vi    and that he was a thief john xii   was mentioned i say in express terms as being a devil   have not i chosen you twelve said our lord to his disciples  and one of you is a devil john vi  0 the man indeed was the work of the benevolent creator but he became a devil by the operation of his own mind assisted by the spiritual influence of satan whom he neglected to resist thus wilfully abusing the divine hereditary knowledge of good and evil within himself and of course partook of the diabolical nature which will most certainly be the unhappy case of every other man who in like manner neglects that necessary resistance to satan and his own predominant passions whereby he is rendered a slave to habitual sin    but indeed of a very base and inferior order for though they may be equal perhaps in wickedness when the restraining power of conscience or the divine knowledge of good and evil is entirely effaced or withdrawn from them yet they must remain as much inferior in power and abilities as human nature is inferior to the created part of devils i mean the angelic nature for the scriptures inform us that angels are greater in power and might   pet ii    and consequently must retain a greater proportion of both i e power and might even in their fallen state than reprobate men  the devils or satanical spirits are constantly represented in the scriptures to be as diametrically opposite in their nature to the infinite goodness of god as darkness is to light god is light and in him is no darkness at all   john i    as falsehood ye are of your father the devil etc when he speaks a lie he speaks of his own for he is a liar and the father of it john viii    is to truth i am the way and the truth and the life john xiv    as implacable and unprovoked malice he the devil was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him john viii    is to everlasting mercy and love god is love   john iv   for the lord jehovah is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth endures to all generations psa c    and therefore as they were really angels in their first estate so entire a change in their very nature may fairly be accounted as  chains of darkness  of horrible darkness wherewith they are bound as it were and reserved for eternal judgment without hindrance or impediment to their natural activity in promoting evil as far as god is pleased to permit in order to prove the faith of mankind as in the severe trials of jobs patience and also in the temptation even of our lord himself which cannot be otherwise understood than in a literal sense for christ in his human nature not only overcame those extraordinary exertions of the devils power related by the apostle matthew chap   and the evangelists mark chap   and luke chap   but was also in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin heb iv     and our lord also declared the earnest wish and activity of the spiritual enemy to overcome the faith of the apostle peter  simon simon said our lord behold satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren luke xxii       this is a clear revelation that human nature is really liable to the impulse and temptations of wicked spirits the above remarks are principally intended for the use of those persons who disbelieve the reality of spiritual influence but there are some people and worthy people too who are apt to fall into a contrary extreme concerning spiritual adversaries i mean those persons who through bodily disorders are subject to low spirits and religious melancholy whereby they are led to conceive either that god has forsaken them and left them to themselves or that it is the devil that is always busy about them and raises those tumults and disturbances in their minds and as this unhappy case of religious melancholy may be esteemed an affection of the mind as well as of the body it certainly relates to my present subject and seems worthy of as much notice in this tract as most other affections of the human mind which i have mentioned but i am precluded from offering any remarks of my own upon it by the writings of my grandfather who has already treated this case so fully so judiciously and so satisfactorily for the comfort of such persons as may happen to want advice thereupon that it would be superfluous to add any thing more than a reference to those parts of his works where the subject is examined and discussed see archbishop sharps sermons vol   sermon   p    and indeed all the sermons collected in that volume are on such points as are most liable to perplex and disturb the minds of persons subject to low spirits and religious melancholy and the several difficulties are explained in such easy and natural arguments as cannot fail to instruct and remove the doubts of every attentive reader    which will certainly prevail over us and become the principles of action if we are not careful and vigilant to resist them as we ought for christ did not forbid the tempter from using his endeavors against peter but only prayed that the faith of the apostle should not fail whereby he has taught us that a sound and steadfast faith for which we also are bound to pray will sufficiently enable us to resist the powers of darkness  but when men disbelieve the very existence of those active spiritual adversaries how should they be upon their guard to resist their influence for unbelief in the existence of spiritual beings will certainly be promoted even by the devils themselves in all places wherever they can gain advantage by it and especially wherever skepticism deism and the groundless notions of the sadducees are openly set up in opposition to the clear testimonies of revealed religion and the true faith for in all such places it is obvious that the interest of satans empire will be promoted by a disbelief of his existence and consequently that the angels of darkness will in such places most carefully abstain from every outward and visible demonstration of their agency and power among men whereas at other times and in other places where ignorance of a contrary nature has prevailed and men have been subjected to superstitious terrors by neglecting the only proper object of their confidence in such places i say the agency and interference of demons with mankind have ever been notorious and manifest of which the histories of all heathen nations bear ample testimony  the uniformity of demon worship in all parts of the world before the preaching of the gospel affords also a clear proof of the worldly empire of satan for though devils were worshipped under various names and various figures yet there was a constant uniformity in all such particular points as tended most to the destruction of mankind or to lead men to the most direct opposition to the revealed laws of god whereby the universal author or promoter of such baneful devices was clearly discoverable the same being for the most part contrary to the nature of man and such therefore as could not naturally proceed from man alone  hence we may plainly account for the universal adoption of human sacrifices amongst all heathen nations some of these deluded people withheld not even their own offspring from their spiritual deceiver the spilling of human blood being most grateful to that being who  was a murderer from the beginning  ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaks a lie he speaks of his own for he is a liar and the father of it john viii     hence we may also account for the cuttings in the flesh for the dead and the marking or tattooing of the skin which still prevails amongst the african and american nations and the present uninformed islanders of the south seas as much as it formerly did amongst the picts and other more ancient heathens for their marks in the flesh were certainly intended by the spiritual deceiver as a sort of dedication to himself i have been informed by an englishman who lived many years amongst the indians in the internal parts of north america very far to the westward and who is himself tatooed with all the marks of distinction common to the nations with whom he has had any connections that he once saw a party of indians who had taken some prisoners in war tatoo a couple of their unfortunate captives with the most curious marks they could devise and afterward hang them up upon a tree as a sacrifice to that infernal being which they worshipped saying at the same time in their language that they hoped those two fine men viz finely tatooed whom they presented would be acceptable to him for though the indians in general acknowledge that there is a god whom they call the great and good spirit yet through the delusions of the devil they think it more profitable to worship evil spirits by way of propitiation lest they should hurt them  outre lidee du premier estre quont les sauvages says father lafitau speaking of the american savages et quils confondent avec le soleil ils reconnoissent

 and as an affront to the divine creator who formed man without any such unnatural distinctions and expressly commanded in his revealed law  ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead or rather for the soul nor print any marks upon you i am the lord that is jehovah the only eternal being levit xix     and as the forbidding to marry is declared in scripture to be a doctrine of devils now the spirit speaks expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which god has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth   timothy iv       so we accordingly find that amongst the ancient heathens there was an order of nuns or priestesses called vestal virgins that were bound contrary to nature in vows of celibacy and amongst the heathen tartars chinese and other idolaters even to this day the celebrated venetian father mark paul in the account of his travels through the east speaking of the territories of the great cham of tartary informs us that there are many monks appointed to the worship of idols who have a great monastery inveniuntur in regione illa plurimi monachi idolorum cultui deputati habent hi monasterium quoddam magnum etc novus orbis regionum ac insularum etc p   0 see also p     of the pagan monks and monastery at the city caigui  mr isbrants ides who was envoy extraordinary from their czarian majestys john and peter alexowitz in      to the court of china speaking of the town of jekutskoi on the river angara which rises from the lake of bakal says on one side of this town likewise there stands a fine monastery or convent on that particular spot where the river jakut from whence it derives its name empties its waters into the angara extract from mr isbrants ides travels inserted in the english edition of mons le bruns travels p      in the following page mention is made of the mongulian devotees and he describes a mongulian nun as well as a lama or priest whilst the envoy resided in this place he met with a taischa that is to say a mongulian or mogulian lord who had thown himself under the shelter and protection of the czar of moscovy and had been for some time a proselyte to the christian faith and received a member of the greek church  this young nobleman had a sister who was a mongulian nun and was greatly inclined to become a christian cnvert a well as her brother in conversation upon that serious and important topic she would ingenuously acknowledge that the god in whom the christians put their trust and confidence must of necessity in her opinion be an omnipotent god indeed since he had expelled their mongulian deity out of paradise but she was firmly persuaded that a time would come when he should be restored  a proof this that the mongulian nuns are pagans and never be subject to the like disgrace again  when any of these nuns or mongulian devotees enter into a room they never salute any person present whomsoever though it is a customary thing with their ladies who live under no restraint since their order is too strict to approve of such formal ats of complaisance in her hand she held a string of beads which she couned over and over with her fingers and was attended by a mongulian priest whom they caled a lama who held in his hand likewise a string of beads which he kept constantly counting with her and at the same time visibly

monastery or convent beforementioned belonged to one or the other of these orders they both kept their account of their vain repetitions and numerous prayers by strings of beads like our popish

beds and are also in many other respects like the romish priests as that they fill their chapels with statues they abstain from flesh but not all however such crimes says the author meaning such crims as the eating of flesh are easily pardoned for money and like them they boast that the souls of the damed are redeemed from hell by their prayers some live by begging others live in caves and mountains but the greatest part in monasteries some of them have a long black robe and square cap and walk with a paternefter or rosary that is a string of beads in their hands the women or nuns have separate monasteries shave their hair and reject marriage and the priests of the sect of lauzu profess celibacy and live in monasteries caeremonias fere instar romanensium habent horas suas plane more

idolatrous chinese priests or bonzes at the city of camsan and in his account of the japanese idols p     he informs us that the japanese believe that their idol amida requires nothing of them to incline him to save them except a frequent repetition of the word namu amida buth that is happy amida save us compare this with the vain repetitions of the popish rosary and when they repeat these words they also use their rosaries or strings of prayer beads which the japanese says he have in common with the christians and which are commonly painted in the hands of their idols as you see says he in the annexed picture which shows the representation of amida and every way corresponds with the figure of pussa the goddess of the chinese  illos huic idolo tantum tribuere ut ad salvandum se nihil aliud requiri credant nisi frequentem horum verborum repetitionem namu amida buth hoc est felix amida salva nos quae verba identidem repetunt rosaria sua seu coronas e globuiis precatoriis

string of beads in his right hand p    and the priest which attends the idol menipe is represented in the plate at p     and     with a string of prayer beads hanging from his girdle after the popish fashion    and though we have no account that the ancient heathen used beads yet they were certainly equally distinguished by their numerous prayers and repetitions for which alone the beads are used as our lord himself testified  but when ye pray said he use not vain repetitions as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking be not ye therefore like unto them etc matt vi        there are distinct orders of men it seems as well as women laid under the same unnatural restraint through the instigation of their spiritual adversary adversary  the name for an adversary hater or enemy is satan  which name was generally applied by the jews to the spiritual enemy in particular and it is remarkable that many of the heathen tartars worship the devil under that very name to this day  the author last quoted respecting the tartar devotees tells us in page     concerning the idols of the ostiachs that these idols are called saitans a name which seems to derive its origin from satan the arch fiend of hell and in page     speaking of the people of barabinsy who are a kind of calmucs he says  when they traverse the woods in order to hunt down their game they take their saitan as they call it along with them which is an image made of wood inelegantly carved with a knife only and covered with a particolored stuff not unlike that which is frequently worn by the female russians this idol or saitan of theirs is enclosed in a box which is carried upon a particular sledge and to this their god they offer up the first fruits of their chase be it what it will without any exception  when they prove more successful than they could reasonably expect and when safely arrived at their respective cabbins this saitan or idol is deposited in the most conspicuous part of their tent or hut in its proper box and covered over with the finest furs they are masters of by way of grateful acknowledgment of the great success they have met with through their means and there they are left untouched till they are grown rotten and worthless in process of time for they are firmly convinced that they should be guilty of the most heinous sin of sacrilege should they strip them of those robes or apply them to any other purpose whatsoever    and yet the same deceiver promoted almost universally amongst the heathen as a sacred rite the promiscuous use of woman in order to draw men by their natural lusts to join the superstitious congregations of his worshippers  of this kind were the rites of venus among the greeks romans and more particularly among the inhabitants of cyprus the young women here used to prostitute themselves to such strangers as came ashore in order to raise money for their portions univ hist vol   p      the shameful rites of astarte whom the heathens called queen of heaven in her temple at byblus  for there she had a temple as the venus of adonis and there such women as would not conform to the custom of shaving their heads at the annual time of lamenting adonis were bound to prostitute their bodies one entire day for hire and the money thus earned was presented to the goddess univ hist vol   p      those of thammuz  there sat women weeping for tammuz ezekiel viii    whoever he was i e thammuz the superstition of mourning over him was universally practiced by the women in those parts speaking of the country of the phoenicians or land of canaan they began their lamentations at a stated time they set up their outcries as soon as they perceived the river adonis to appear of a bloody hue as at certain times it did the cause of this red face of the river was anciently known and by those who were not so superstitious as the rest of their cotemporaries and countrymen ascribed to a kind of minium or red earth which this river brought away when it swelled to an unusual height it is still subject to the same appearance in the time of floods for which he quotes mr maundrels travels univ hist vol   p        the lamentations of a mother for the loss of her only son could not be more loud or tender they then proceeded to the sacrifices of the dead having first disciplined themselves with whipping which practices hay since been revived by the church of rome at the instigation without doubt of the same spiritual author and the next day pretending him to be revived and ascended through the air to the upper regions they shaved their heads as the egyptians did for the loss of apis and at byblus at least those who would not comply were bound to prostitute themselves in the manner and for the purposes above specified univ hist vol   p       or adonis among the phoenicians syrians and apostate jews those of tanais or anaitis among the armenians in honor of this goddess tanais and in her temple the armenians used to prostitute their daughters it being a custom among the young women to consecrate their virginity to tanais that is to her priests univ hist vol   p        and those of mylitta the aphrodite or venus of the ancient babylonians and more eastern nations at whose shrines women of all ranks even of the first quality were required once in their lives to prostitute themselves  who is called also  in the same page  etc herod lib   p    frankfort edit   0   herodotus also tells us that there was a similar law at cyprus      the impious rites of baalpeor whereby many of the israelites were ensnared by the council of balaam  behold these said moses speaking of the midianitish women that were taken prisoners by the israelites caused the children of israel through the council of balaam to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor and there was a plague among the congregation of the lord numb xxxi      seem to have been of the same kind for worshipping baalpeor says bishop patrick into which they the israelites were inveigled by the women who invited them to a feast and there by their charms excited another fleshly appetite in them which they would not let them satisfy unless they would both eat of their sacrifices and worship their idol etc on numb xxv       and to increase the temptation to demon worship it appears that the women of the first quality among the daughters of moab and midian were not exempted from that most disgraceful and pernicious pollution baneful both to body and soul for the midianitish woman that prostituted herself to zimri the simeonite and was killed together with her captivated israelitish paramour by phineas is expressly declared to have been the daughter of zur by whose consent no doubt says bishop patrick she went upon this wicked design that by her noble garb and attendance she might the more powerfully entice the great men of israel to idolatry    who was head over a people and of a chief house in midian numb xxv    and he is mentioned afterward as one of the kings of midian numb xxxi    thus the council of balaam promoted the service and worship of devils and this should warn us of the extreme danger of yielding to the crime of fornication which in all ages and nations has been used as a snare to vilify mankind and enslave them to spiritual adversaries for as the forbidding to marry is unquestionably the doctrine of devils see p     preceding whereby those who devote themselves to such unnatural commands fall under more severe temptation to fornication when pope gregory vii hildebrand removed the married priests in the year  0   from officiating in the church service and forbid the laity to hear them say mass the numbers of monkish or unmarried clergy were of course increased and the scandal of incontinence the necessary effect of forbidding to marry became notorious of which even the monk matthew paris bears ample testimony  porro paucis continentiam observantibus aliquibus came causa lucri ac jacantantiae simulantibus multis incontinentiam perjurio multipliciori adulterio cumulantibus m paris hist angl p   and afterward in the reign of henry i anno   0  when archbishop anselm excommunicated the married priests whom he maliciously called sacerdotes concubinarios as if their lawful wives were no better than concubines there were not wanting some prudent persons even in those dark days to declare the immoral tendency of the measure as m paris testifies this says he speaking of the said excommunication of married priests seemed good to some and to others dangerous lest while they aim at purity greater than their strength they should fall into worse uncleanness hoc autem bonum quibusdam visum est et quibusdam periculosum ne dum mundicias viribus majores expeterent in immunditias laberenter deteriores m paris hist angl p       a remarkable example of which he gives us in the person of cardinal john de creme anno domini mcxxv johannes cremensis apostolicae sedis cardinalis de licentia regis anglorum veniens in angliam perendinavit per episcopatus et abbatias et non sine magnis donariis ad nativitatem beatae marioe apud londonias solemn consilium celebravit ubi igitur de concubinis sacerdotum severissime tractasset dicens summum esse scelus de latere surgere meretricis ad corpus christi conficiendum ipse cum die illa corpus christi consacrasset post vesperam fuit in meretricio interceptus res notissima negari non potuit dum magnum decus in summum dedecus commutavit m paris hist angl p  0    joannes cremensis who after holding a council of the clergy in london in the reign of henry ii against married priests and therein bitterly exclaiming against the monstrous wickedness of rising from the side of a whore for so he affected to call the virtuous wife of a priest to perform mass was himself detected that very evening in a real brothel  the affair was so very notorious says m paris that it could not be denied whilst the cardinal exchanged great honor into profound disgrace    so on the other hand fornication is reciprocal in its effects by being one of the most baneful obstacles to lawful and virtuous marriage and consequently to the increase and multiplication of mankind but this bad as it is is not the worst consequence of habitual fornication for men being thereby drawn away from the service and worship of their creator are gradually led to greater crimes whereby their minds are more and more darkened like those of the fallen angels until they are totally deprived of the light and image of their creator and lose both temporal and eternal happiness  when men are in bondage to their own lusts there is no doubt but that satan has already got an advantage over them and by their lusts and unrestrained affections does hold them in bondage also to himself so that a man cannot free himself from spiritual bondage without forsaking and repenting of his favorite sins for we can have no direct idea of resisting the devil as the scriptures command us but that of resisting evil wherever we perceive it whether in thoughts words or actions but when men entirely neglect this necessary resistance to evil they are sure to be led on from one vice to another till the two beforementioned natural and universal principles in mankind intended for their preservation viz common sense or reason and selflove have lost their influence for the actions of of a great part of mankind cannot be accounted for upon any other principle than that of a lamentable bondage to the spiritual adversary who leads them to actions that are clearly contrary to selflove and common sense and contrary even to any probable gratification that might afford a temptation to human beings  to actions that apparently tend to their own everlasting destruction  how common is it for men to lift their hands against their own life and deliberately to exclude themselves from all possibility of repentance it must be allowed indeed that real madness or lunacy and other natural distempers and frenzies are frequently the principles of action which occasion suicide but we have too many instances of deliberate selfmurder wherein no such natural causes can with justice be alleged though generally assigned by the coroners juries through a false notion of mercy which inclines them to adopt the erroneous maxim that all men are mad who kill themselves but nothing is more false  if the brute creation were equally liable to voluntary deaths suicide might with more probability be attributed to natural causes only as they are almost equally liable to distempers but herein appears a capital distinction between human nature and that of brutes none of the brute creation ever violate the universal principle of selflove which the divine author of nature has given them for their preservation and though man is also endowed with the same principle as i have already shown yet the very brutes make so much better use of it than man that in them we distinguish the same principle even by another name and call it instinct  an instinct of selfpreservation  an instinct because it is never violated how are we to account for this seeming superiority in the brutes why should human nature be more subject to depravity than they are man who in addition to that natural light with which he was endowed at the time of his creation has since acquired an additional power of discernment and prudence for his preservation even a divine knowledge of good and evil that he may know how to refuse the evil and choose the good and yet is in general infinitely more depraved than the very brutes let any reasonable man consider how impossible it is by natural causes to account for so extraordinary a circumstance that man endowed with such a superiority of knowledge for selfpreservation and also endowed with selflove in common with the rest of the creation should yet be subject to such monstrous depravity as to lose all sense of both while the brutes are never known to violate that universal principle selflove except it be for a reasonable cause that they risk their own lives in defense of their young to preserve their species or through gratitude as dogs will defend their masters which surely is no depravity to what extraordinary cause then shall we attribute this very singular superiority of brutes in a circumstance so necessary to happiness the cause is obvious brutes have never been subject to spiritual delusions or to be actuated by infernal spirits since the time that the serpent deceived our first parents  there is no instance i believe since that time of brutes being really actuated by evil spirits except one and that was be pleased to observe by express permission of our lord himself viz when the devils entered into the swine by the lake of gennesareth for it appears that the demons had no power to enter into the animals till our lord had expressly granted it for  the devils besought him saying if thou cast us out suffer us to go away into the herd of swine and he said unto them go the permission being thus gained the animals immediately acquired a new principle of action too similar to that which actuates poor abandoned sinners among men as when the devil entered judas and led him not only to betray his lord but to punish the horrid treason with his own hands contrary to every conceivable natural principle of action so the unhappy brutes by gennesareth were no sooner subjected like mankind to the bondage of infernal spirits than they immediately lost that principle of selflove which in them because never violated but at this particular time is called instinct and by the immediate consequence of that loss they have afforded us a notable example of the baneful effects of diabolical inspiration this particular case of the gadarene demoniacks has been violently attacked by the opposers of the common received doctrine concerning the reality of demoniacal possessions three very eminent and learned men among them for instance have endeavored to accommodate to their own notions the evangelical history of this matter and by the failure of their several attempts have proved that the literal meaning of the terms in which the evangelists have related the several circumstances of that case and no less than three evangelists out of the four have mentioned it cannot possibly be set aside without raising up in its stead the most glaring absurdities one of these gentlemen notwithstanding his own errors has very fully and justly censured the miserable shift to which the other two learned men were reduced in attempting to defend their own groundless hypothesis  a farther argument says he in favor of real possessions is taken from the destruction of the herd of swine which the demons are said to have entered and stimulated to instantaneous madness this case is considered by some continues he as a decisive proof of the power of demons both over the human and brutal race this conclusion is expressed in too general terms the example is indeed  a decisive proof of the power of demons over the brutal race whenever demons can obtain the divine permission to enter brutes but without such express permission the case itself sufficiently demonstrates as i have remarked above for otherwise the asking and granting permission to enter the swine would be but vain circumstances that they have no power over the brutal race the case is very different with human bodies which i have already shown    and is thought even to have been purposely designed by providence to refute the opposite opinion to enervate this argument dr sykes suggested and dr lardner strenuously contended that the swine were frighted by the two madmen and so driven down the precipice into the sea on the other hand says he the advocates for the common hypothesis insist upon it to my apprehension continues he with great reason that it was impossible for two men however fierce to put so vast a herd of swine as two thousand into motion in an instant and to cause them all to rush with violence down a precipice into the sea swine contrary to the nature of most other animals running different ways when they are driven but this part of the controversy might well be spared it not appearing from the history that the men ever fell upon the herd or made any attempt to drive them into the sea nay the history expressly refers their destruction to a different cause from the behavior of the madmen an essay on the demoniacks of the new testament p   0     many other insurmountable objections are alleged by the same ingenious writer and may be seen at large in pages     to   0 if what i have already quoted should not be thought amply sufficient to confute the groundless supposition of the other two learned men and he very justly concludes thereupon  for these reasons says he i cannot accede to the opinion of those learned writers who ascribe the destruction of the swine to the madmen but then unfortunately for himself he immediately adds  neither says he can i see any just ground for ascribing it to the agency of demons p      he tells us elsewhere that what is called the ejection of demons is the case of a natural disorder p     and      that there never was nor can be a real demoniack p   0  that the demoniacks spoken of in the new testament were all either madmen or epilepticks prop vi p     and with respect to the particular case before us he asserts that all that can he inferred from their the evangelists saying that the demons came out of the men and entered into the herd of swine is that the madness of the former was transferred to the latter in the same sense as the leprosy of naaman was to cleave to gehazi and to his seed for ever p     he allows however what a learned writer says he contends for that in the case before us the power of imagination could have no place dr warburton p          it was never said that the swine fancied themselves possessed their disorder i admit says this author was real but not therefore demoniacal so great a miracle as that wrought upon them continues he can be ascribed to no other agency than that of god p      certain it is that no created being whatsoever whether good or evil visible or invisible can have any power to act without the knowledge and permission of the almighty but at the same time we must remember that there is a very material difference between the agency of god and the permission of god  god is indeed said to do what he only permits as i have elsewhere remarked see notes in pages     to     and he sometimes grants his permission to very unworthy agents both spiritual and temporal which act with views and intentions very opposite to the actual purposes of god that are really effected by their actions for the histories of all nations sufficiently testify that even the vices and malicious dispositions of the enemies both to god and man are frequently permitted to act as instruments of divine vengeance see my tract on the law of retribution pages         and elsewhere to promote the eternal justice and glory of the almighty as he alone can bring good out of evil  but in all such cases wherein there is manifest evidence of evil in the production of events though the same are certainly by the sufferance or permission of god yet it would be highly injurious to truth to ascribe the agency to god  in the case before us concerning the gadarene demoniacks the permission and the agency are clearly distinguished by the evangelists in the most express terms so the demons besought him saying if thou cast us out suffer us to go away into the herd of swine and he said unto them go matthew viii        and all the demons besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them and forthwith jesus gave them leave mark v     and they the demons besought him jesus that he would suffer them to enter into then the herd of swine and he suffered them luke viii     thus the divine permission is clearly and distinctly declared and the same faithful historians leave us as little room for doubt concerning the agents in this matter for when they the demons were come out they entered into the swine and behold the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters matthew viii     and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place etc mark v     then went the demons out of the man and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down etc luke viii     here is the most express evidence of three evangelists that demons or unclean spirits entered into the swine and the consequences of that entering are as clearly noted  the animals rushed headlong to their own apparent destruction a circumstance which was never known to happen either before or since that time to any brute animals whatsoever so that it is unreasonable to attribute that singular deprivation of natural instinct in brutes to a natural disorder because the circumstances of it must necessarily be allowed to have been totally unnatural to brutes though with mankind alas it is far otherwise for we have almost daily examples of men that are absolutely actuated with the same violent desire to rush headlong out of the world but the reason of of this remarkable difference between men and brutes i have already i hope sufficiently explained  now if it is unreasonable to attribute this singular destruction of brute animals to a natural disorder it is much more unreasonable nay it will appear profane and blasphemous to say that it can be ascribed to no other agency than that of god when we consider that the demons which are said to have entered the swine were not mere nullities as this author supposes not a mere name for deceased souls or the souls of dead men but are expressly declared by the evangelist mark to be unclean spirits  mark v    for if the sin against the holy ghost the most unpardonable of all blasphemies consisted as many learned commentators have supposed in attributing the the works of god to  beelzebub the prince of demons surely it must be almost equally dangerous to ascribe to the agency of god the furious and profane agitations occasioned by the inspiration of unclean spirits  but i impeach not the intention of the learned author but only the tendency of his doctrines his excuse however is already prepared he doubts in page    whether these epithets evil and unclean given by the evangelists to the spirits ejected by christ express their personal dispositions or only those effects they were supposed to produce nay even  cacodemon with him is not a wicked demon see note in p    and he tells us in another part of his work p     that infirmities plagues and evil spirits seem to be mentioned only as so many distinct species of diseases these suppositions for they are merely such may seem at first sight to afford some excuse for his ascribing to the agency of god the declared effects of unclean spirits but his error has still a deeper root he has in another tract an inquiry into the nature and design of christs temptation in the wilderness  d edit enlarged   ascribed to the agency of god that which no less than three evangelists have expressly registered amongst the transactions of the devil himself i mean the temptation of christ by the devil in the wilderness and he roundly exculpates satan from the charge there was no real presence or agency of satan says he on this occasion p    and that the devil was not really and personally present with christ but only in mental representation and consequently could act no part in this whole transaction p     and yet all this is carried on in such smooth language and with such seeming plausibility that the author himself is apparently deluded by his own sophistry and mistaken conclusions after a great deal of sophistry in p  0 to    in comparing the evangelists account of the temptation with several expressions in ezekiel and st john relating to the revelations of the spirit viz as that  the spirit took me up  lifted me up and took me away  i was in the spirit  he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness etc he boldly concludes thereupon in p     thus says he from the express testimony of the three several evangelists it appears that christ was conveyed into the wilderness in a prophetic vision trance or extacy under the afflatus or inspiration of the spirit of god  but where has he shown the express testimony of the three several evangelists that christ was conveyed in a vision he cannot show that even one of the three has once used any such expression or even the least insinuation about a vision on that occasion though the expressions of ezekiel and st john relate to revelations received in the way of visions yet that does not prove that all similar expressions wherein the spirit is said to lift up or take away must necessarily be understood as visions if his argument proved any thing at all it would prove too much let us suppose it for once to be perfectly conclusive and apply it to that text in the acts of the apostles where we read that  the spirit of the lord caught away philip and afterward that he was found at azotus shall we say then to argue like our critic that   this passage of scripture is to be understood as a history not of a fact but of a vision p    and that it appears  from the express testimony of the text though the text contains not a single word about a vision trance or extacy any more than the texts of the three evangelists do about the supposed vision of christ that philip was conveyed in a vision that is his removal was not real and corporeal but spiritual and mental only p  0 notwithstanding that the text afterward asserts it as a fact that he was found at azotus the circumstances of this transaction necessarily oblige us to understand that the operation of the spirit upon philip when he was caught away was not visionary but real and it will appear upon further examination that a similar necessity of literal interpretation is equally included in the circumstances of the other case also now if the spirit of the lord really caught away philip from the sight of the eunuch in the desert and left him at azotus there is no absurdity in supposing that our lord himself might also really be led by or in the spirit into the wilderness and that the history must necessarily be so understood will i trust be hereafter shown that it was no unusual thing for the prophets of god to be actually led  carried  or  caught away by  or in  the spirit is manifest from the apprehension of such a carrying by the spirit expressed by the generous and faithful obadiah governor of king ahabs house when elijah required him to acquaint his master where he might find him   kings xviii    and the opinion of obadiah with respect to the true meaning of such expressions is certainly to be preferred before the sentiments of the author of the inquiry etc or perhaps than the opinion of any other man whatever because obadiah was not only personally acquainted with elijah but also with a great many other prophets of the lord having himself preserved the lives of more than one hundred of them by hiding and maintaining them in caves so that he could not be unacquainted with the occasional effects of the holy spirit upon prophets and therefore we may fairly conclude that his apprehension of the spirits removing or carrying the prophet to a different place was not without just foundation or example or at least not without probability especially as we read that elijah was at last actually taken away in a miraculous manner which was equally attributed to the spirit of the lord by the sons of the prophets at jericho  lest peradventure said they the spirit of the lord has taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley   kings ii    and they cannot surely be be supposed to mean that the spirit of the lord had taken him up in a mere trance or vision    for notwithstanding the plain testimony of the evangelists abovementioned concerning the agency of the devil and satan in that temptation as that he was  led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil in which the agency of the spirit and the agency of the devil are clearly distinguished that jesus said unto him the devil  get thee hence satan  and that  then the devil n b the appellations satan and the devil are manifestly applied to the same wicked being  leaves him etc matthew iv       and immediately the spirit drives him jesus into the wilderness and he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted of satan and was with the wild beasts etc mark i       whereby the reality of our lords being driven by the spirit into the wilderness is manifest for though the author of the enquiry asserts in pages    and    that it appears by comparing the several evangelists together that christ had but just left the banks of jordan and therefore was still in the wilderness at the very time he is said to have been led into it etc yet that part of the wilderness where john baptized ceased in effect though not in name to be a wilderness whilst it was the place of public resort for all jerusalem and all judea and all the region round about jordan mat iii   mark i   and therefore even supposing it true that christ was still in the wilderness at the very time he is said to have been led into it we must necessarily understand that he was led to some more solitary part of the wilderness than that which had been for some time before the place of public resort for the whole nation for otherwise he could not well be said to be  there in the wilderness  with the wild beasts but when our author wrote the above assertion that christ was still in the wilderness etc notwithstanding that the evangelist luke assures us that he returned from jordan  he seems to have forgot that the word return or  implies a going back to some other place from whence he had lately come and is used in that sense about thirtyfour times in the new testament without a single exception so that it is much more prudent to believe the plain testimony of the evangelist that christ returned from jordan that is from the place where he was baptized to some other place or at least was on his way to some other place than to believe the contradictory assertion of this critic that he was still in the wilderness at the very time he is said to have been led into it    yet our author is pleased to assert that it is to be understood as a history not of a fact but of a vision as such says he the writers of the gospel expressly represent it by which it seems this learned author is so far blinded by hypothesis as to forget the true meaning of the word expressly for not one of the writers of the gospel have expressed the least idea about a vision in that particular case and yet he asserts that they expressly represent it without leaving us says he as the sacred penmen have been thought to do in other instances to collect it from the nature and circumstances of the relation they likewise continues he represent this vision he must mean this vision of his own imagination  this vision of a vision for the evangelists cannot justly be charged with any such representation not as diabolical but divine ascribing it says he to the spirit of god an inquiry etc p       now what shall we say to the assertions of this critic when we turn to the authority of the evangelists themselves and find that they are so far from ascribing any such supposed vision of a temptation to the spirit of god that they expressly mention the devil or satan as the tempter and do not express or represent a single word about a vision in that particular case nevertheless our commentator boldly adds to this monstrous perversion of evidence the following mockery of truth viz  so that to all the other arguments urged above says he we may add what we before promised to produce the authority of the evangelists whom he most notoriously contradicts and the express letter of the text which as notoriously contradicts him in confutation says he of those who misconstrue christs temptation either as an outward transaction or as an illusion of satan inquiry etc p    see also his proposition p     that all the evangelists who have mentioned this affair do in express terms affirm that it passed spiritually and in vision that it was an ideal or mental representation and consequently could not be an outward transaction now if such a method of explaining scripture as he himself censures others in p     of his essay on the demoniacks etc be allowed language can be of no use  he may think it a generous action perhaps to excuse or endeavor to exculpate an adversary and more especially such an inveterate adversary as satan himself the author of the inquiry etc in p   objects that if the evangelical history of our lords temptation is to be understood as a narrative of real facts etc it is unsuitable to the sagacity and policy of the evil spirit etc  now this would certainly be a good argument if we could suppose that the evil spirit is prompted by no other principles of action than sagacity and policy but alas he yielded himself a slave as frail men do to principles very opposite to sagacity and policy or he would surely have kept his first estate and have still remained as originally created an angel of light and therefore with respect to the particular circumstances of christs temptation expressly ascribed to the devil or satan by three evangelists we may reasonably conclude that our spiritual adversary was prompted to that unequal contest with christ by the same predominant principles of evil viz pride envy and falsehood that originally occasioned his fall from god but now occasioned a much more mortifying abasement to satanical pride and envy  a defeat by man  even by the seed of the deluded and much injured woman    from the most baneful and malicious attempt that was ever made against the happiness of mankind but this generosity or whatever else it may be called to the enemy is productive of consequences which the learned author had he been aware of them would not perhaps be willing to adopt for his doctrine of satans innocence in this matter viz that  there was no real presence or agency of satan on this occasion p     that the devil was not really and personally present with christ but only in mental representation and consequently could act no part in this whole transaction p    and that the evangelists represent this vision  we have as little reason to affirm from the style of the gospel writers and the manner of their expressions that christs temptations are only the history of a vision as we have to affirm that our lords restoring the lame to their feet the blind to their sight the lepers to their cleanness the diseased to health and the dead to life was likewise all the history of what was transacted in a vision or that the whole gospel account of what our lord did upon earth is no more than the history of so many visions an account of what he saw in spiritual raptures by a prophetic afflatus and inspiration  hui quantam fenestram ad nequitiam patefeceris see p    of a little tract printed in      entitled christs temptations real facts or a defense of the evangelical history showing that our lords temptations may be fairly and reasonably understood as a narrative of what was really transacted etc wherein the reader will find many sensible and learned remarks in confutation of the novel doctrine propagated by the author of the inquiry   as he is pleased to call it not as diabolical but divine ascribing it to the spirit of god p    this doctrine i say of satans innocence not only deprives christ  the son of man of that actual triumph and victory which he gained in his human nature for the restoration of mankind over the temptations of the prince of this world but it also necessarily implies that god himself was the tempter which if not downright blasphemy is at least a doctrine which is expressly contradicted in scripture  for there we read that god cannot be tempted of evil neither tempts he any man james i    and though there are several passages of scripture wherein god is said to tempt as for instance we read in genesis xxii    that god did tenet abraham etc when he ordered him to offer up his only son for a burntoffering yet this was not a temptation to sin for men if the command had been actually executed the patriarch would not have sinned but on the contrary would have been justified by his faith in him that commanded whom he knew to be the creator and lord of life and therefore the only rightful disposer of life in all creatures but as the command was revoked just in so critical a time as to demonstrate the patriarchs readiness to obey and yet to save the life of his son the command was so far from being a temptation to sin that it was not on the part of the righteous lord who commanded even a temptation to kill because the event showed that the command was not given with any such intention but merely to prove the patriarchs faith and obedience the same hebrew root  here rendered did tempt is frequently used in other passages of scripture where it necessarily signifies to prove or try as in exodus xvi    that i may prove them  whether they will walk in my law or no and in deuteronomy viii     that he might prove thee  to do thee good etc see also judges vi    psa xxvi  etc    yet they are all clearly to be understood in a different sense from the tempting mentioned by the apostle james which was a tempting or being tempted of evil apparently meaning a temptation to sin there is an expression however in   samuel xxiv   which without a further explanation would be very difficult to be reconciled with the text above cited from the apostle james that god cannot be tempted of evil neither tempts be any man for the text in samuel seems at first sight to imply a temptation to sin by the almighty  and again the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and he moved david against them to say go number israel and judah as if god himself had moved david to sin against israel which might seem to give countenance to the doctrine of the author of the inquiry into the nature and design of christs temptation viz that it is represented not as diabolical but divine ascribing it to the spirit of god  and that there was no real presence or agency of satan on this occasion p       but we are happily relieved from the difficulty by further information in another text concerning the real agent in that temptation or moving of david for we read in   chronicles xxi   that  satan stood up against israel and provoked david or moved david for the same hebrew word  is used in both texts to number israel and therefore when this text is compared with the former wherein it is said that god moved david we must necessarily understand that the moving of david was indeed supernatural and spiritual but that the real agent as the action was evil was the spiritual enemy satan acting by gods permission as a just judgment against israel and also against david himself who at that time was probably so much elated by his temporal prosperity and successes as to forget that his absolute dependence ought to be upon god and not upon the number of his subjects and certain it is that he was off his guard and neglected that necessary vigilance over his thoughts and actions which god requires of all men for otherwise he would have resisted the evil suggestion of satan whereas his yielding to it occasioned the imputation of sin    and in other passages where the latter or indeed any spiritual influence of evil whatever is to be understood the evil spirit or real agent in the evil is generally mentioned and in that case the agency cannot be ascribed to the spirit of god without gross absurdity at least if not blasphemy even though the spirit be expressly declared to be from the lord as in the case of saul related in   samuel xvi    where we read that an evil spirit from the lord troubled him  now this expression if we regard the literal meaning of it clearly implies not only that the evil spirit came by the permission of god as it was an evil spirit from the lord but also that the said evil spirit was really the agent which troubled saul  the same ingenious writer has attempted to set aside the literal meaning of this text also by attributing readiness disorder to a deep melancholy meaning thereby a mere natural disorder without any supernatural spiritual influence for if he admitted the latter as the cause of readiness melancholy he must necessarily give up his whole hypothesis but the futility of such a supposition shall be clearly shown hereafter in a separate tract on the case of saul as i have already extended this note to a most unprecedented length but as the law of nature and the principles of action in man cannot be understood without a competent knowledge of those spiritual beings with which the minds of men are liable to be influenced i was obliged to take some notice of such contradictions to my general doctrine as had been previously published by the ingenious author of the essay on demoniacks for i must acknowledge that i was not aware of them until my tract was not only finished as i thought and sent to the press but was also more than half printed and therefore i hope my readers will excuse the irregularity of tacking so long a note to so small a tract    to which at all other times mankind alone are subjected  for behold says the text the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters matthew viii         thus the influence of evil spirits became manifestly a principle of action in the poor brutes which overpowered their natural instinct of selfpreservation and hurried them headlong to destruction and the cause being known it is very natural to conclude when we see similar effects in human beings that the same principle of action may perhaps have produced them especially if there be no previous circumstances of distemper or distraction which may leave room to hope that another cause might reasonably be assigned and as the example also shows us that devils have no power to enter brutes without express permission of the creator let us by a comparative consideration of our own bodies learn to be continually upon our guard against the devices and instigations of our spiritual enemies always remembering that they need no such express permission from god to enter the human body or rather that god has already lodged the power of permitting or resisting them entirely in the human breast since we are by nature continually liable to receive the inspiration of the devil and his angels as a principle of action if we neglect the necessary resistance commanded in the scriptures and consequently that they already have permission from god to enter all human beings i mean all those as are capable of discerning between good and evil and do not reject the evil as they ought according to that divine knowledge which we inherit from our first parents  this peculiarity in our nature is therefore apparently the reason why spiritual adversaries are permitted by the almighty to approach mankind though they have no such general permission with respect to the rest of the animal creation but man took the knowledge of good and evil upon himself contrary to the express commands of god as i have before remarked and therefore we have no right to murmur at the permission which god has granted to the devil and his angels to take possession of all unguarded souls which unhappily yield to their suggestions and temptations without resistance or repentance and more especially we have no right to murmur i say at this permission if we consider that god has given us fair warning of our continual danger and warfare with the principalities and powers of darkness as the holy scriptures plainly inform us that we are continually liable to satanical influence and that the devil will get an advantage over us if we do not resist him as we ought  in this necessary resistance and the objects of it consist the principal exercise of that assumed knowledge of good and evil for which we are accountable viz we know evil from good and consequently know when we ought to resist but if we do not resist then we have chosen the evil and in whatsoever mode the evil is manifest have given advantage to the devil and submit ourselves to his bondage the choice therefore which is set before us amounts to this  whether we will choose the kingdom of god and his righteousness mat vi    and cheerfully assent as the dignity of human nature requires to that perfect law of liberty which christ has tendered to us for the regulation of our conduct toward all mankind as well as for selfpreservation or  whether we rather prefer the empire of satan the spiritual enemy for the sake of those temporal gratifications and vile indulgences by which he holds men in bondage through their carnal affections till they become personal enemies even to themselves  the assumed principle of knowing good and evil will undoubtedly induce all mankind most readily to choose the kingdom of god and his righteousness mat vi    but this is not a choice to be made merely once in our lives but to be continually maintained or the prudent choice will avail nothing are not men in general bound by a solemn oath in the outward rite of water baptism thus to maintain that prudent choice which they publicly profess and yet how little do their practices in general correspond with such a resolution surely the mammon of unrighteousness luke xvi   the prince of this world that had been cast out john xii    the principalities powers and rulers of the darkness of this world not flesh and blood with whom we have to wrestle do apparently prevail over a great multitude in every rank of life for this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light a lamentable choice a shameful prostitution of the knowledge of good and evil but the apostle assigns the reason because says he their deeds were evil for every one that does evil hates the light neither comes to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that does the truth comes to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god john iii    to    let us therefore be upon our guard and put on the whole armor of god that we may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil ephesians vi     but though human nature is thus liable to the influence of the devil and his angels let us remember at the same time for our comfort that it is equally capable of being actuated by divine inspiration and that mankind in the glorious freedom of the gospel are equally left to their choice for the admission of that supreme good the gift of the holy ghost to regulate their principles of action in all cases as they are for the admission of the contrary spirit the prince of darkness for the promises of christ relating to that heavenly gift are clear and absolute and are tendered to all mankind without exception that they may exercise their natural knowledge of good and evil in choosing accepting and continually claiming them if they really prefer the kingdom of god to the kingdom of this world here is true freedom a charter of inestimable privileges ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you etc mat vii   and again all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive mat xxi    and mark xi    and after these general promises our lord appealed to the common sense of his hearers concerning the efficacy of a sons request to a natural father to obtain things that are necessary for him and concludes thereupon  if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him luke xi   to    so that every man who devoutly and with due faith claims that glorious gift according to the promise and with such a disposition of mind as the scriptures require will undoubtedly receive it for he is faithful that promised heb x     i am well aware how uncommon it is to introduce these religious topics into tracts of law but as the divine influence of the holy spirit upon mankind may certainly be esteemed the supreme principle of action in man i am obliged by the nature of my subject to cite some testimonies concerning the general effect of that heavenly gift to which all mankind are entitled for such is the compound nature of man that enquiries concerning human nature and the principles of human actions cannot be fairly and carefully defined without a careful examination of this human claim to divine inspiration nor indeed without a careful warning also against that very opposite and foreign spiritual influence which is equally liable to alter human nature and become the principle of action which i hope i have already sufficiently proved from scripture and therefore with respect to the former viz the inestimable claim to divine inspiration which we hold in christ it is proper to be remarked that the peculiar and necessary effect of that glorious and heavenly gift is a total change in the nature of man from his fallen state before described to a new creature by a regeneration or new birth through the spirit to which god has also been pleased to annex as necessary on our first public admission to the claims and privileges of the gospel an outward visible sign also or typical washing with water verily  verily i say unto thee said our lord to the jewish ruler nicodemus except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god john iii   here are two distinct articles expressly mentioned by our lord as necessary to salvation viz  st water by which we outwardly profess our faith in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost upon our first admission into christs church for that is the form of baptism afterward expressly ordained by christ himself matt xxviii    and  dly the holy spirit which we claim of the father in the name and through the merits of the son so that faith in all the three divine persons is undoubtedly necessary to constitute that spiritual regeneration without which no man can enter into the kingdom of god and as faith therefore must precede we may clearly perceive the reason why water the outward sign of initiation to the public profession of that necessary faith is first mentioned    by which we bear a public or outward testimony of that true faith which alone can qualify our claim to the promise  thus man through the privileges of the gospel becomes a new creature   cor v    and partakes even of the divine nature if his own earnest and sincere endeavors are not wanting for the apostle peter has expressly declared that this is one of the effects of our lords most gracious promises grace and peace be multiplied unto you said the apostle through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature kononoi having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust   pet i   to    hence the dignity and superiority of man over the rest of the visible creation is manifest we not only possess by natural inheritance from our first parents a divine attribute as i have already shown in the former part of this tract viz the knowledge of good and evil but also by a right use of that knowledge in choosing and preferring the good and in rejecting and resisting the evil we are capable also  through christ of partaking  even of the divine nature so that if we consider this most extraordinary privilege which is tendered to us on the one hand and that deplorable condition on the other hand which we shall probably fall into if we neglect it viz the partaking of the diabolical nature by the inspiration of the devil and his angels to which as i have already shown we are continually liable if we do not watch and resist it must be be evident that man is either the most glorious or the most miserable and base of all other creatures  surely the consideration of these things ought to humble the pride of those inconsiderate persons who on account of mere temporal honors and worldly possessions are so lifted up above their brethren as to forget that they have no natural precedence but expect that the multitude of inferiors in fortune should implicitly submit to the will of the worldly superior in all things and who also seem to lose all sympathetick concern all sense of fellowfeeling for the wants and sufferings of their poor dependants as if they sprung from a different stock and were not of equal dignity in the sight of god  but alas pride is a principle of action which occasioned the fall even of satan himself   timothy iii   lest being proud he fall into the condemnation or judgment of the devil that is says an old commentator by means of pride and highmindedness be cast into hellfire in manner as the devil is by which to my seeming says he it is plain what the sin of the devils was namely an ambitious affecting aspiring unto and arrogating divinity to themselves not content with their own condition unto which very sin the devil afterward by the serpent tempted eve ministers being young men and young scholars continues this writer by presumption and pride are in no small danger of eternal destruction complete christian dictionary      p        and of his angels and is equally pernicious to human nature for it renders mankind more liable to forfeit that glorious liberty those inestimable privileges which i have before described than any other vice and the reason is plain for the proud man of all others is most liable to neglect that royal law which i have already mentioned  that golden rule by which their notions of political government and their behavior to all mankind ought to be regulated for if he was not guilty of this neglect he would necessarily cease to be proud he would cease to be uncharitable he would cease to be an advocate for arbitrary power either in political despotism or in domestic slavery both of which now unhappily prevail almost throughout the whole world for even the enlightened english nation is no longer qualified to censure the unnatural oppression of the peasantry and lower orders of people in russia poland france some part of germany and in many other states which are commonly called christian since the english government have publicly favored and do continue to encourage the most abominable oppressions that ever disgraced mankind i mean the african slave trade carried on from england and the toleration of slavery in the british colonies let the advocates for these oppressions seriously and carefully consider the dignity and equality of human nature which i have described as well as their own state of probation in this life and the forfeiture of inestimable privileges to which they are continually liable and i trust they will become sensible of their danger  but alas there are many other causes of failure which tend to deprive mankind of that glorious and eternal dignity for which all men should be candidates for besides the ordinary temptations of worldly pleasures this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil john iii     which draw the bulk of mankind from considering the true means of obtaining the glorious promises of the gospel how often are the minds of men puffed up with selfsufficiency and the pride of human learning and too often even with spiritual pride whereby they suffer themselves to be perverted through the deceitfulness even of their own sophistry  how can such men avail themselves of the glorious promise of divine inspiration as a principle of action if they form to themselves a mode of believing which is totally different from the faith once delivered to the saints  perhaps they will say  we do ask the assistance of gods holy spirit and have as good a right as others to suppose that gods promise is fulfilled in us nevertheless they must allow that faith is necessary for those who ask and how can men be said to have the necessary faith who form to themselves notions of gods holy spirit which are totally inconsistent with the divine nature  how can we conceive that the spirit of glory and of god   pet iv    rests upon those who wickedly esteem that glorious and eternal spirit heb ix    no otherwise than as a created being and a mere ministering spirit and who refuse to join in that excellent form of prayer the litany of the church of england merely because the holy ghost is therein addressed as god is not this to do  despite unto the spirit of grace heb x     these men may pray for the holy spirit indeed but with such erroneous conceptions of that glorious gift it is impossible that they should receive that eternal spirit of truth till they have sincerely repented of their horrid blasphemies and humbled their own haughty spirits to receive the plain information of the scriptures for if our belief in the holy trinity were set aside the greatest part of those sacred writings would become utterly unintelligible to us because they must in that case seem to contain the grossest contradictions as there are passages which without that necessary doctrine would surely appear inconsistent with grammar and common sense the doctrine of the holy trinity is expressed in the articles and liturgy of the church of england in such guarded terms as cannot easily be misconstrued and perverted and though a certain set of men may pretend to found their objections to the church of england on some other articles of less moment yet i am thoroughly persuaded that the said guarded terms concerning that one necessary doctrine are the principal causes of offense to many of those mistaken clergymen who lately petitioned parliament that they might be exempted from subscription it is reasonable and just indeed that all men should be at liberty to teach and profess whatever religious opinions they think most consistent with the holy scriptures if we except any public promulgation of that religion which offends against the laws of this nation as a civil society by asserting a foreign jurisdiction and which has also unhappily adopted some antichristian rites of idolatry sorcery and enchantments  but the petitioners cannot allege that they are not already at liberty to bear a public testimony of their opinions and it would be dangerous even to the true religion were not such liberty of conscience allowed for supposing any material alteration should be permitted to be made in the articles and liturgy of the church of england a great majority perhaps of the present churchmen might think themselves obliged to dissent and separate from what would then be called the established church and would certainly think themselves entitled to a free toleration and a public use of the present liturgy in their several separate congregations  i am therefore a sincere advocate for liberty of conscience but when a majority of the clergy and people have agreed upon the articles of their faith and established the same as the national profession of religion which it surely is while the majority continue of that opinion it is certainly no unjust restraint nor derogation from that necessary liberty abovementioned that those who are to be admitted public teachers of the national profession should be required to subscribe a declaration that they approve and will maintain the same for otherwise the uniformity of doctrine would be banished from the pulpits and the peace of congregations would be continually disturbed by the broaching of undigested notions diametrically opposite to the general and established opinions of the people and even the public form of prayer would be reduced and molded according to the caprice of every officiating minister for there can be no church government without a written test of doctrine couched in such terms as are least liable to misconstruction and equivocation the catholic or universal church in every age and in every place has ever had its tests of doctrine or particular creeds to which the assent of all persons but more particularly the assent of the clergy was always required so that the church of england is not singular in requiring the assent or subscription of those persons who desire to be admitted and authorized by the national church as public teachers and expounders of the christian faith   to the articles of the church of england but as a right faith must seal and authenticate our claims to the inestimable privileges and immunities of the gospel and as the true dignity of human nature cannot be attained without the divine assistance and the inspiration of gods holy spirit whereby men are made partakers as i have already shown of the divine nature some knowledge of the latter so far as the almighty has been pleased to reveal himself to us is absolutely necessary for those persons who desire to be acquainted with the law of nature and the principles of action in man and therefore some observations relating to the doctrine of the holy trinity are by no means foreign to the subject and intention of this tract but it is an awful mystery that must be received more by faith in what god has been pleased to reveal to us than by human comprehension the finite understanding of the natural man  the natural man receives not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned   cor ii    cannot in this life conceive an adequate idea of that glorious and eternal being which in every attribute is infinite perfection nay even if we had a perfect knowledge of that which is now so far above us yet no language could supply words no rhetorical figures of comparison could be found to express that knowledge and it would therefore remain unuttered in these lower regions like those unspeakable words which were heard by the apostle paul when he was caught up into paradise   cor xii   for  to whom will ye liken god said isai xl    or what likeness will ye compare unto him  but a time will come when we shall know even as we are known for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part said the apostle to the corinthians but then shall i know even as also i am known   cor xiii     this expression to know even as we are known implies a perfect knowledge of that eternal being which is infinite in knowledge in power in majesty in glory etc  and therefore a more exalted state of happiness cannot be conceived than that which a perfect knowledge of god must afford  a happiness to be expected only in heaven when human nature shall have put on incorruption and immortality for this corruptible body must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written see isaiah xxv   death is swallowed up in victory   cor xv        but though we can neither attain in this life a perfect knowledge of god nor that perfect happiness which results from it yet it is our duty to improve and cultivate our limited knowledge concerning the divine nature as far as god has been pleased to reveal himself to us in the scriptures for so far the knowledge is undoubtedly necessary to man even in this life or otherwise we may be assured the revelation would not have been made in the scriptures by inspiration of god all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfect etc   timothy iii        who cannot act in vain let us therefore earnestly desire to partake of that necessary knowledge and let us look into the evidences of it with the most awful reverence and the most humble submission of our faith to the word of god lest through any improper conception of the divine nature we should unhappily fall under a similar condemnation to that of eliphaz and his two friends who visited job  my wrath said jehovah is kindled against thee and against thy two friends for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right etc job xlii    when moses desired to see the glory of jehovah saying i beseech thee show me thy glory he was answered by the almighty thou can not see my face for there shall no man see me and live exodus xxxiii    0 we must therefore limit our ideas of those appearances under which god revealed himself to the patriarchs and to moses  for the gospel expressly informs us that no man has seen god at any time but the evangelist immediately adds with respect to the messiah the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he has declared  that is has clearly declared or shown the father or as mr leigh has remarked upon the word in his critica sacra  id est says he nobis ad ejus veram cognitionem eruendam dux et auctor fuit etc  this is further explained by the declaration of our lord himself  he that has seen me said our lord has seen the father etc   john xiv   believe me that i am in the father and the father in me and yet they are distinct persons for the lord said unto my lord  sit thou on my right hand etc mat xxii    psa cx      ib ver    not that any man has seen the eternal being or jehovah i mean the divine nature nam deum ut est nemo mortalium quamlibet magnus vidit unquam nisi per aenigmata et quanquam mosi patriarchis et prophetis aliquam suorum arcanorum portionem quadantenus patefecit tamen hanc gratiae et veritatis plenitudinem solus unigenitus filius accepit qui sic ad nos descendit factus homo ut per divinam naturam semper sit in sinu dei patris erasmi paraphrasis in evang joannis p     in which the son of man even while on earth was and is in the bosom of the father and in which now that he is ascended into heaven he is always with his church on earth though he sat down  which plainly implies a personal residence on the right hand of the majesty on high heb i    for god is a spirit and cannot be seen by human eyes for he is  the king eternal immortal invisible etc   timothy i     whom no man has seen nor can see   timothy vi     there shall no man see me and live exodus xxxiii     0    though he be not far from every one of us for in him we live and move and have our being acts xvii       but christ being the image of the invisible god in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in the earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all or among all he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell col i      but the word father expressed in this version is not found in the original greek though it is here supplied as the principal substantive which is an unjustifiable violence to the text especially as the proper governing substantive of the sentence is plainly expressed in the original i mean the words  the fullness for it apparently means that divine fullness which the same apostle in the very next chapter  th verse expressly calls  all the fullness of the godhead  that dwells  bodily or personally in christ so that both verses have the same application of the word  and surely the fullness of the godhead may with propriety be said to will or please to dwell in christ according to the literal sense of the text and therefore there can be no necessity to supply another substantive to govern the verb  the literal construction of the text is sufficiently intelligible   which is literally rendered by the learned hugh broughton as follows for that in him all fullness pleased to dwell this is copied from an old printed bible in my possession with ms corrections copied from mr broughtons own handwriting at the bottom of the page the same verse is transcribed with a little variation in the order but equally literal  viz for all fullness pleased to dwell in him    the same literal interpretation exactly has been made by the author of the syriac version which mons de dieu translates as follows quia in ipso voluit omnis plenitudo habitare the arabic version also has the same rendering except in one word  being construed perfection instead of fullness  quia perfectio omnis in eo voluit habitare    in whom all fullness dwells coloss i        for in him dwells all the fullness of the godhead bodily  or personally coloss ii   who being the brightness of his glory and express image of his  that is gods see the first verse of the chapter which contains the governing substantive to which this relative pronoun his plainly refers  god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spoke in time past unto the fathers by the prophets has in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he has appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high heb i        person  and upholding all things by the word of his power hebr i   in him alone therefore who is the image of god   cor iv   can god be seen and in him alone could be fulfilled that ancient promise to the jewish nation that they should see their god  o zion that bring good tidings get thee up into the high mountain o jerusalem that bring good tidings lift up thy voice with strength lift it up be not afraid say unto the cities of judah behold your god isaiah xl   compare this with the context in the same chapter the divine person whom the cities of judah are here called upon to behold was afterward agreeable to this prophecy particularly pointed out by john the baptist to  the cities of judah for there went out to him john the baptist jerusalem and all judea and all the region round about jordan matt iii    whom john had previously forewarned saying  after me comes a man which is preferred before me a man whom he himself knew not only that  he should be made manifest  to israel john i  0    but as soon as this faithful messenger was divinely instructed concerning the identity of the person that was to be made manifest to israel for god was manifest or appeared  in the flesh   timothy iii    see note in p     concerning the true reading in this text he proclaimed him to the cities of judah the people that flocked to him from jerusalem and all judea saying behold the lamb lamb of god i e the lamb foretold by isaiah liii   he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter etc of god which takes away or bears the sins of the world john i       and the office of that faithful harbinger or forerunner in proclaiming the advent as well as the dignity of the divine person that was to be seen or made manifest to israel is as distinctly foretold in the  d and  th verses of the same chapter the voice of him that cries in the wilderness for the wilderness was the appointed place of johns ministry prepare ye the way of the lord  the way of jehovah make straight in the desert once more alluding to the place wherein the messiah was first proclaimed by his inspired harbinger a highway for our god and again the glory of the lord  i e the glory of jehovah  shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together etc this latter sentence was fulfilled only in part when the voice in the wilderness proclaimed the messiah saying behold the lamb of god etc  for though jerusalem and the cities of judah then beheld their god in the person of the son of god  he that sees me said our lord himself sees him that sent me john xii    compare this with   john iv    because that god sent his only begotten son into the world etc    and saw the glory  the word was godetc  all things were made by himetc  and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth john i       agreeable to this the apostle paul informs us that god was manifest or appeared  in the flesh   timothy iii    the cavils of the learned wetstein upon this text are clearly confuted by the very accurate observations of the rev dr j c velthusen printed at london in      who proves that  c the proper abbreviation for  and not o c or o is the true reading in this text   of jehovah that was promised to be revealed without perceiving it agreeable to another prophecy of isaiah  in seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive  in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which says by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive matt xiii    isai vi    0 ezekiel xii    chap vi   yet all flesh did not then see him together succeeding generations indeed may be said to see and also to perceive the glory of jehovah that is with the eye of faith in the scriptures but the prophecy will most certainly be literally and universally fulfilled at the day of judgment when all the tribes of the earth shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory matt xxiv  0 for then the glory of jehovah will be so revealed that all flesh shall see it together even those men shall see that now presume to deny the divine nature of our redeemer and refuse to worship him for behold he comes with the clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him rev i   this is he said the learned bishop chandler speaking of the divine word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shines in darkness and the darkness comprehends it not john i      etc  and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth john i       which was in the beginning with god and was god and made all things who in time says he was made flesh and is called jesus jesus or iesous from  jeshouo in the vulgar tongue of the jews while our lord was on earth signifying a savior  from  salvation see psalm xx   where the word is used as a noun in that sense  by the strength or in the mightinesses of the salvation of his right hand see also psalm l       from whence is formed the verb in hiphal  he saved agreeable to the purport of the name jesus declared by an angel before the birth of christ she shall bring forth a son and thou shall call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins matt i     the apostle peter also bore the like testimony concerning the true meaning of christs name when he was filled with the holy ghost in the presence of the high priest and elders of the jews saying  ye rulers of the people and elders of israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him does this man stand here before you whole this is the stone which was set at naught of you builders see psalm cxviii    isai xxviii    which is become the head of the corner neither is there salvation says he still alluding to the name jesus in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved acts iv       this name of salvation therefore exactly corresponds with the title by which the prophet isaiah proclaimed to the jews the advent of that divine person who was to redeem zion  etc say ye unto the daughter of zion behold thy salvation  jesho comes behold his reward is with him and his work before him and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of jehovah etc isai lxii          and christ as he is indeed the fountain of life and light to every being that partakes of either etc sermon before the king in      p    sometimes he is indeed treated says the same learned writer p    as an angel or messenger but even then is so distinguished from all other angels in respect of majesty authority and power or dignified with the incommunicable title of jehova that they had not the least thought of his being a mere angel etc  the eternal word though he was in the beginning with god and was god yet under the dispensation of the gospel that he might restore the lost dignity of fallen man became the angel or messenger of god that is of jehovah tsabaouth the lord of hosts for he was  the messenger of the covenant foretold by the prophet malachi and being also lord of hosts himself he sent another messenger before his face to prepare his way  behold i that is i jehovah tsabaouth or lord of hosts see the end of the verse  will send my messenger that is john the baptist our lord himself applied this prophecy to john the baptist  for this is he of whom it is written said our lord behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee matt xi  0 mark i   luke vii       and he shall prepare the way before me that is before the divine word which being included in the unity of jehovah then spoke to the jews under the title of lord of hosts  and the lord  the adoun adoun  is a title for a great lord and from thence one of the false deities of the phoenicians is named adonis but when the  is prefixed to this title in the singular number it marks that the person spoken of is not only a hard but the lord by way of eminence as being the only supreme lord and governor of all things for it is then applicable to none but jehovah the lord of hosts and is so applied in no less than seven other instances of scripture without one instance of a different application see exodus xxiii    and xxxiv    isai i    iii   x    x    xix      or supreme lord whom ye seek whom the jews were taught by their prophets to expect shall suddenly come to his if the adoun or lord who was the messenger of the covenant was not also jehova he could not be said to come to his temple   temple even the messenger or angel  malach from whence the prophet malachi himself was also named of the covenant whom ye delight in behold he shall come says the lord of hosts malachi iii    thus it appears that the messenger whom our lord himself declared to be john the baptist was to be sent to prepare the way before jehovah of hosts the same divine being who spoke by the prophet behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me but our lord himself in referring to this passage varies a little from the original by making a distinction of persons between the lord or jehovah of hosts who spoke and the divine person before whom the messenger was to prepare the way  behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee matt xi  0 this variation from the first to the second person from my to thy and from me to thee proves that christ for it cannot be applied to any other but christ and jehovah was indeed the person before whom the messenger john was to prepare the way and the original text which undoubtedly is also a true reading in this place as it perfectly corresponds with all the ancient versions proves at the same time that the way was to be prepared for jehovah who said behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and consequently it appears by comparing both texts that christ is included in the eternal being jehovah the socinians endeavor to evade this testimony of the scripture concerning the divine nature of the messiah by supposing that he is called jehovah only in a relative sense as being the prophet or ambassador of jehovah the representative being named for the principal in like manner for instance say they as he that despises christs messengers is said to despise christ himself and he that despises him despises also him that sent him luke x    and he that lied to the apostles lied to god acts v    in these and such like passages indeed the relative sense is manifest and it may also in a certain degree be admitted in the construction of the text in question but yet not so as to favor the socinian argument in the least respect whatsoever  the prophecy for instance concerning the messenger therein mentioned of whom jehovah said   he shall prepare the way before me was fulfilled in the person of john the baptist as our lord himself declared see note in p     and therefore according to the socinian method of argument it might indeed be said of those worldly men who despised that extraordinary messenger of jehovah and neglected the doctrine of repentance which he enforced that they in so doing despised the lord jehovah by whom this messenger was sent and on the other hand those jews who readily received johns doctrine of repentance and attended diligently to his instructions may in the like relative sense be said to honor jehovah by paying due respect to his messenger but a mere relative honor such as might lawfully be given to the messenger of jehovah will bear no comparison with the honor that is due to jehovah himself  the latter must be supreme honor and worship whereas the former amounts only to respect attention and good offices for whatever is more than these must lead to idolatry so that the comparison can be carried no farther  a messenger of jehovah cannot therefore merely as such be allowed the name of jehovah because this would entitle him also to the honor that is due to jehovah alone so that when jehovah said my messenger  he shall prepare the way before me he must mean if language has any use that the messenger was to prepare the way for the advent of jehovah himself who could not be said to come in the person of any messenger or ambassador whatsoever except in one of the divine persons that are manifestly included in the same eternal being and consequently are entitled to the honor and worship as well as to the name of jehovah this glorious title jehovah is no where in scripture attributed to any person whatever that is not thus included in the unity of the godhead neither can it be without blasphemy so that the socinian argument must fall to the ground because it is the distinguishing title of the supreme divine nature  thou whose name alone is jehova art the most high over all the earth psalm lxxxiii    or it should rather be rendered as we find it in the old english versions  thou whose name is jehovah art only or alone the most high etc  this division of the sentence is agreeable to all the ancient versions except the syriac but in either way of translating the name of jehovah is manifestly given as the distinguishing title of the supreme god and cannot therefore be attributed to any person whatever that is not truly god because the said distinction would be destroyed if the name was ever used merely in that relative sense for which the socinians contend proper names indeed were frequently formed or compounded with that holy name by having it prefixed or postfixed to some other word apparently with an intention to distinguish the servants of jehovah see my remarks concerning the names jehoiakim jehoiachin and zedekiah in my tract on the law of retribution p    note  0   0    0 and      but the peculiar and incommunicable name itself has never been mentioned by any of the sacred writers in such a manner as to refer us either in direct terms or by necessary implication to any other persons whatsoever besides those of the holy trinity and on the other hand with respect to christ it is not only the name of jehovah that is referred to him by the necessary interpretation of several incontestable passages of scripture but also the power and jesus came and spoke unto them his disciples saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth  go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost matt xxviii       for as the father raises up the dead and quickens them even so the son quickens whom he will john v       the honor for the father judges no man but has committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father he that honors not the son honors not the father which has sent him john v        and the glory of jehovah and now o father said our lord jesus glorify thou me with thine ownself and surely to be glorified with the father himself is the same thing as to partake of the glory of jehovah with the glory which i had with thee before the world was john xvii      so that the socinian evasion beforementioned is as vain as it is wicked whenever it is applied to those passages of scripture wherein the name of jehovah is attributed to that divine person in whom dwells all the fullness of the godhead bodily coloss ii     jehovah is the proper and essential name of almighty god because it in some degree expresses his eternal being or existence being a compound word including different tenses or times of the hebrew verb  to be or rather as it is the preterperfect tense signifying he was from whence is formed  the participle as well as present tense signifying according to buxtorfs concordance though in his lexicon he renders it also fuit ens es est being thou art he is to which the prefixed  the true characteristic letter of the future tense  shall or will be is also added to form the word  jehovah so that this mysterious and awful name seems to express all time or eternity as if for instance a word was to be compounded of three different tenses of the latin word esse to be viz est fuit erit he is  he was  he shall be yet so as to include the sense of all three and consequently to denominate in one single word an eternal being that ever did and ever will exist  and such seems to be the interpretation of the glorious name jehovah according to the opinion of the most learned in the hebrew tongue viz ens existens ab eterno et in eternum a being existing from all eternity and for ever this is the sense which the learned buxtorf has quoted in his hebrew lexicon from the famous jewish rabbin aben ezra and he cites also the authority of several others of the most eminent jews much to the same purpose amongst the rest he cites a commentary on some of the psalms viz x    and cxlvi   etc from a jewish book wherein this sense is plainly laid down  textus his docet de deo creatore quod est primus sine principio et ultimus sine fine sic nomen ejus testatur de tribus existensis seu existendi differentiis ejus  praesenti praeterito et futuro quae sunt literae ipseu smet nominis appropriati  et profort trs  existentias ejus voce regui et dominii ad indicandum quod ipse regnat et gubernat in mundo fuo secut rex regit servs fuos the text here teaches concerning god the creator that he is first without beginning and last without end so his name bears witness of his three existences or differences of existing  in the present the preter or past and the future tenses which are the letters of his own appropriated or peculiar name  and proclaims his three existences  with the voice of rule and dominion to denote that he reigns and governs in his world as a king governs his subjects    but as the words of holy scripture are best interpreted by holy scripture he refers us at the same time to a text in the revelations wherein the apostle john addresses the seven churches of asia in the name of god which is there clearly expressed in the same sense that the jews as i have before remarked have attributed to the hebrew name jehovah and seems therefore to be the true interpretation of it   grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come  rev i   in like manner the four beasts or rather living animals  which in the revelations represent the hosts or armies of israel by the figures of those animals which were borne on the standards of the four principal tribes in their encampments round the tabernacle rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come  rev iv   so also the four and twenty elders which sat before god on their seats fell upon their faces and worshipped god saying we give thanks to thee o lord god almighty which art and wast and wilt be or art to come etc  rev xi        this eternal being which has been pleased to reveal himself to us in such clear and comprehensive terms is the same almighty jehovah that is mentioned in genesis xiv    in the highest terms of power and glory  the lord in the original jehovah the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth the same eternal being or jehovah is also called jehovah god of israel  in exodus xxxii    joshua vii    xiii    xxii    judges xi    etc he is also called jehovah the god of gods  in joshua xxii    where we find this glorious title twice expressed in the same sentence the lord or jehovah god of gods the lord god of gods he knows etc and therefore as the lord or jehovah mentioned in these several texts is undoubtedly the supreme god we are naturally led to attribute the same divine excellence and supreme dignity to the glorious name jehovah wherever it occurs in other parts of scripture because there is but one jehovah  hear o israel    the lord or jehovah  our god is one lord viz one jehovah   and thou shall love jehovah with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might etc deuteronomy vi     thus the unity of god is proved to be an indispensable article of our faith and yet we are equally bound to acknowledge that three divine persons are comprehended in that one almighty and eternal being or jehovah  because this glorious name is clearly applied in the holy scriptures even in those of the old testament to as many distinct persons who are therefore to be esteemed equal or one with the supreme god as jehovah our god is one jehovah deuteronomy vi    for though we are bound to acknowledge a manifest subordination with respect to the merciful and gracious offices of redemption and sanctification whereby two of the divine persons are particularly distinguished in scripture yet we are obliged at the same time to believe that the several divine persons are of one and the same eternal and almighty existence with respect to that incomprehensible being or divine nature wherein their unity consists because the contrary doctrines of those men who deny that our lord jesus christ and the holy ghost partake of the same divine nature with the father do manifestly and necessarily include the supposition of a superior and inferior order of divine existence for that all the three persons have divine existence and divine attributes cannot be denied without setting aside the whole tenor of the holy scriptures which existence could not without absurdity be called one and the same but must necessarily be esteemed several or separate and different if the least degree of inequality with respect to the divine nature be admitted and therefore such doctrines are totally inconsistent with our indispensable belief in the unity of god whatsoever those mistaken people who call themselves unitarians may think  but a due regard to these two necessary distinctions viz the equality and unity as there is but one god of the three persons with respect to their divine nature and the revealed subordination of two of them with respect to the merciful and gracious offices of redemption and sanctification whereby they are personally distinguished and made known to us in scripture  a due regard to these two necessary distinctions i say and to the proper application of the several texts by which both are respectively proved will clearly demonstrate at least to all men who sincerely ask and seek the knowledge of truth as christ has commanded that the doctrine of the trinity as received by the church of england is strictly consistent with the indispensable doctrine of scripture beforementioned concerning the unity of god  that there are three distinct persons in that one eternal being or jehovah is clearly revealed in scripture for each person is occasionally mentioned under that distinguishing and peculiar name of the supreme god  and first with respect to the first divine person in the holy trinity  in the   d chapter of isaiah the divine person whom the prophet represents in the  th verse as speaking in the name of jehovah is clearly distinguished from the messiah and holy spirit and though it may seem a needless work to produce any proofs that the almighty father the god and father of our lord jesus christ ephesians i   see also the   th verse  the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory our lord himself likewise said unto mary magdalene after he arose from the dead  go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god john xx       is truly jehovah which no man will deny yet i propose to recite some parts of this chapter in order to prove the clear distinction of persons and their offices as revealed even in the old testament  thus says god jehovah he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the earth and that which comes out of it he that gives breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein i jehovah have called thee apparently meaning the messiah in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people and for a light of the gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prisonhouse i am jehovah that is my name and my glory will i not give to another etc isai xlii      these words of jehovah are manifestly addressed to the messiah as a distinct person in his mediatorial office of redeemer and the divine person who thus addresses the messiah is manifestly the same that speaks in the first verse of the same chapter and mentions both the messiah and the holy spirit in that one sentence as distinct persons from himself and under different and distinct characters or offices of the christian dispensation suitable to the nature of that extraordinary prophecy concerning the future redemption of mankind behold my servant apparently meaning the messiah in his state of humiliation as son of man whom i uphold mine elect in whom my soul delights i have put my spirit upon him here the three persons are distinctly expressed he shall bring forth judgment to the gentiles he shall not cry not lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street a bruised reed shall he not break etc isai xlii      thus we find the office of the messiah particularly described in this chapter as well as the descent of the holy spirit upon him and this is expressly foretold by the lord jehovah who speaks of himself distinctly from the other two so that the distinction of persons is hereby clearly manifested  secondly the glorious name of the supreme god jehovah is plainly attributed in the  0th chapter of isaiah to the second person the divine messiah in his pastoral office as shepherd of israel  the peculiar harbinger or forerunner of the messiah is described and foretold in the third verse as the forerunner also of jehovah  the voice of him that cries in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord  the way of jehovah make straight in the desert a highway for our god  d verse  and john the baptist in whom alone that prophecy could be fulfilled as i have shown more particularly in my tract on prophecy remarks on several very important prophecies  d edit p           declared the identity of the divine person whom he preceded in the world and whose way he was sent to prepare saying  he that comes after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire matt iii     and afterward when the priests and levites those that were sent from jerusalem to ask him who art thou questioned him saying why baptizest thou then if thou be not that christ nor elias neither that prophet john answered them saying i baptize with water but there stands one among you whom ye know not he it is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes latchet i am not worthy to unloose etc john i        and the next day he bore full and express testimony to the identity of the divine person that came after him whose way he prepared  john sees jesus coming unto him and says  behold the lamb of god which takes away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me comes a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore i am come baptizing with water and john bare record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me now mark again the clear declaration of two divine persons separate and distinct from the divine being now represented as speaking upon whom thou john shall see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost and i saw said john and bare record that this is the son of god again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples and bore the like testimony to the divine person whose way he was sent to prepare for looking upon jesus as he walked he says  behold the lamb of god john i        thus john declared himself to be the peculiar harbinger as i have said of the son of god so that the name of jehovah whose way in the prophecy he is expressly said to prepare must necessarily be attributed to the messiah to whom afterward this long expected preceding messenger did personally apply the prophecy  the voice of him that cries in the wilderness prepare ye the way of jehovah make straight in the desert a highway for our god isai xl   and the divine person for whom the way was to be thus prepared is so distinctly described by his advent and pastoral office in the  th  0th and   th verses of this chapter that the proper application of the glorious titles therein mentioned cannot be mistaken at least by those who sincerely seek after truth o zion that bring good tidings get thee up into the high mountain o jerusalem that bring good tidings lift up thy voice with strength lift it up be not afraid say unto the cities of judah  behold your god to the fulfilling of which in christ the apostle paul as i have already shown bears ample testimony saying god is as manifest in the flesh etc   timothy iii     i have just now seen a new edition of the greek testament by the rev b harwood d d published at london in the present year      wherein contrary to the general evidence of the best greek mss the editor has boldly ventured to alter the common reading of this text and to insert the masculine article  this instead of the substantive  god had he added an accent to the article in order to render it neuter viz  instead of   which instead of this his new text would have seemed rather more probable because the article which at present is without a substantive would in that case have agreed with the preceding noun substantive of the neuter gender  and would also have been countenanced by the neuter relative quod in the latin vulgate this remark proves also that accents in some particular cases are essential to the meaning and proper construction of the text and should not therefore be indiscriminately omitted together with such as are useless as they are in this edition but indeed in either way with or without the accent the expression which he has introduced into the text is entirely unscriptural even if to make the best of it we should suppose that the accent is to be understood and the article to be construed as if written   what sense can be made of it a mystery  which was manifest in the flesh  received up into glory  a parallel reading cannot be found in scripture  as the editor in his preface appeals to god concerning his sincerity and integrity it would be uncharitable to call either of these in question but we are not bound to think so favorably of his discretion  the zeal which he has expressed at the end of his book for the opinions of the polish brethren who were most notorious socinians gives us too much cause to suspect not only his want of discretion but also such a want of moderation and impartiality as must render him totally unfit to decide for us in the choice of controverted readings of the holy scriptures and consequently the preference which he has paid to his own opinion by arbitrarily taking upon himself to alter records the particular alteration of which i complain at present has but one single greek manuscript to support it and what is worse even this single ms is not a credible evidence for it has been condemned in the strongest terms by the most eminent critics and judges of ancient mss in europe so that dr harwood has been particularly unfortunate to adopt this very exceptionable evidence i mean the claromontan ms of st pauls epistles together with the old cambridge ms of the gospels and acts as the principal authorities to justify his presumption in altering the sacred records he tells us in p vii of his preface  that they approach the nearest of any manuscripts now known in the world to the original text of the sacred records  that is he must mean in his own opinion and accordingly in this edition says he these have been most commonly followed but the famous father simon speaking of the claromontan or clerment ms together with that at st germains which seems to have been only a continuation or part of the two former in a third volume says  magnum illum erratorum quae inveniuntur in duobus illis exemplaribus in textu graeco esse indicium a latinis esse scripta qui graecae linguae cognitionem nullam habuere with respect to the cambridge ms the learned dr mill calls it  codicem pessimi commatis and asserts that it contains many things that are not greek and that the writer has presumed to add substract and change this includes all the various modes of corrupting evidence and altering records an infinite number of places pro arbitrio says he according to his own caprice the very learned ger van mastricht syndic of bremen asserts the same thing only in different words  prolixior fui de hoc codice says he speaking of the cambridge ms quia omnes paginas implet addit detrabit mutat pro lubitu omniumque codicum varias lectiones superat ideoque non multum ei tribuendum quod ex examine hoc critico affatim patet etc the same learned writer informs us that m le clerc esteemed it a mere paraphrase joh clericus in art critico hunc habet pro paraphrasi etc and that father simons and the learned fr gomarus held it cheap  non magnam auctoritatem tribuunt and in the preface to wetstens  d edition of the greek testament in   mo the character of the cambridge clermont and st germain mss is summed up in such terms at must oblige us to think very indifferently of dr harwoods choice of mss and much worse of his presumption in daring to alter the sacred records upon such miserable evidence  a librario latino scripti says the author of the abovementioned preface et ad versionem italicam corruptam tam inepte atque imperite deformati atque depravati sunt ut risum moveant qui illis locum dignitatemque genuinorum codicum graecorum conciliare voluerunt  now what must we think of dr harwoods assertion that these mss approach the nearest of any mss now in the known world to the original text of the sacred records if my readers have not leisure to consult the works of the several authors which i have quoted on this occasion they may see the evidence collected in the prolegomena to the last mentioned edition of the greek testament and i hope these few hints will induce the learned among the clergy who ought to be the guardians of the sacred text to examine dr harwoods new text with care and accuracy to point out its errors to the public and to consider of the best means to prevent any ill effects from so dangerout an attack upon the sacred records   of so much importance must at best be esteemed a dangerous presumption his indiscriminate and unjust censure of the doctrine of athanasius which he has been pleased to entitle  the athanasian impiety of three coequal gods vol ii p     is a sufficient proof of the intemperance of his zeal and the hastiness of his conclusions so that the adventurous variations which he has made from the common greek text will gain but little credit by his authority athanasius was a steady assertor of the unity of god and could not therefore be guilty of so shocking an impiety as to assert the existence of three coequal gods and if the doctor meant only to reflect on the confession of faith which is commonly called the athanasian greed his censure is equally unjust for the unity of god is clearly and expressly taught and declared therein neither does it contain any assertions whatever concerning the divine nature of the son and the holy ghost which are not strictly warrantable according to the clearest evidence of holy scripture  by the evidence even of incontrovertible texts so that the charge about three coequal gods seems to be founded only in the indiscriminate zeal of him who published that unjust assertion against athanasian it distresses me much to speak so freely of this gentlemans performance but the cause of truth compels me insomuch that if he had even been one of my own brothers whom i dearly love i must have done just the same the opposers of the common reading  etc in the abovementioned text are so clearly confuted by the rev dr veithusen as i have before remarked in p     that i must request my readers if they have any doubts concerning the true reading of this passage to consult his judicious and accurate remarks upon it they are published at the end of a very thin octavo pamphlet entitled  observations on varius subjects  printed for c heydinger in the strand         and again for in him dwells all the fullness of the godhead bodily coloss ii   so the apostle john  the word was god etc all things were made by him etc and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth john i       see notes in p          but to return to the prophet  behold said he the lord god that is adoni jehovah or the lord jehovah will come with strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before him he shall feed his flock like a shepherd the peculiar office of the messiah who himself declared i am the good shepherd the good shepherd gives his life for his sheep etc john x    he said the prophet shall gather the lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are with young isai xl       it is surely the reward and work of the messiah in his pastoral office that are here so distinctly foretold and therefore the adjective his and the personal pronoun him both expressed by  in the original and so often repeated in these verses as also the personal pronouns him and he must necessarily be referred by the plainest rules of grammar to the personal nouns the lord god or adoni jehovah which immediately precede them and by which the holy spirit has marked the supreme or equal divinity of the messiah with the father and that he is really jehovah and god beyond all possibility of contradiction  before the incarnation of the divine logos or word of god that is before he was made flesh and dwelt among us john i    god revealed himself to the children of israel not only by the name of  jehovah signifying eternal existence by including the characteristical letters of the present preterite and future tenses as i have already shown but also by the name of  ahiah which is the same verb of being or existence with the sign only of the future tense signifying i will be in the common english version this name is rendered i am  god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shall thou say unto the children of israel i am has sent me unto you exodus iii    the literal meaning however of the word  as it is in the future tense is i will be and so indeed it was rendered in the older english versions  i have a copy printed in      wherein the word is rendered i will be and the translator has added the following remark upon it this traunslation says he follows the hebrew which has i will for that which is in all latten traunslations sum i am but which way soever it be taken it signifies that god only has been is and shall be and has his being of himself and that all other things have their being of him stryve not therefore for the matter but let it be was am or will be al is one matter    and when the son of god was personally present on earth in our human nature as a descendant of abraham he asserted his preexistent state by giving himself a similar title of eternal existence though in a different tense for he used the present tense alone without any characteristical letter of the future  i am instead of i will be as the promises respecting his own person were accomplished by his presence which as he himself also promised will continue to the end of the world lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world matthew xxviii  0 for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them matthew xviii  0 how the son of god who was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god mark xvi    and will continue to sit there till all enemies are subdued or put under his feet as the holy ghost declared by david saying the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool psa cx   how the son of god i say whose personal residence in heaven is so expressly declared may yet be said to be always present on earth with his church will be more easily explained when i come to speak of the divine nature and existence of the holy spirit in the eternal being jehovah   before abraham was said our lord i am  john viii    this expression if the occasion of its being made be duly conconsidered cannot be made to accord properly with its context in any other sense than as a reference to christs eternal existence and as such it manifestly corresponds with the meaning of the glorious name jehovah  the purpose of our lords argument was certainly to declare his preexistent state of glory in answer to the jews who said  art thou greater than our father abraham which is dead etc john viii     thou art not yet fifty years old and have thou seen abraham so that his immediate answer  before abraham was i am must necessarily be understood in the sense which i have mentioned  he had a little time before told the jews who disputed with him i proceeded forth said he and came from god v    the expression in the original greek has a much deeper meaning it is not merely from god as in the common english translation but out of god ek   out of god i proceeded forth etc which is much more expressive of that procession which is commonly called the eternal generation of the son  of that divine person who is in the bosom of the father john i    and whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting micah v   had not these jewish unbelievers been blinded by their own wickedness and worldly desires they would have understood by the prophets that their messiah though he was to be a descendant of abraham according to the promises was yet to be one who had eternal existence and consequently must be entitled to the incommunicable name of eternal existence jehovah for he whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting was the same of whom the prophet micah says that he should come out of bethlehem ephratah to be ruler in israel viz that ruler of whom the same prophet foretold that they should smite the judge of israel with a rod upon the cheek compare the first and second verses of this chapter and in the fourth verse the name of jehovah is manifestly attributed to the same divine person  and he shall stand and feed that is as a shepherd compare with isaiah xl ii in the strength of jehovah in the majesty of the nameof jehovah his god compare this also with the prophecy of jeremiah concerning the branch from the stock of jesse  and this is his name whereby he shall be called jehovah our righteousness jer xxiii    his eternal existence and almighty power as god were plainly declared by the psalmist  thy throne o god is for ever and ever psa xlv   this as the apostle paul testifies was said of the son  but unto the son he says thy throne o god is for ever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom thou have loved righteousness which accords with the name of the divine branch jehovah our righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god even thy god has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows heb i      in the latter part of this sentence indeed the prophet manifestly alludes to the inferior nature the nature of man which this divine person was to assume for the angels were not his fellows but men  it was human nature alone that was to be exalted and restored by that peculiar union with the divine nature in christ whereby all mankind are rendered fellows and brethren to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead   petiv   and may thereby become if their own negligence and wilful abuse of gods gifts do not prevent them even fellow heirs ephesians iii   heirs of god and joint heirs with christ romans viii    who is the heir of all things heb i    for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him of the seed of abraham heb ii    and accordingly the same apostle calls him the firstborn among many brethren romans viii    and informs us also that it behoved him to be made like unto his brethen that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people heb ii    but the apostle nevertheless amply proclaims the eternal existence and divine nature of that person mentioned in his quotation from the   th psalm who was to be anointed above his fellows for he immediately afterward quotes another psalm viz cii        to assert the eternal dignity and power of the same person  and thou lord lord   the apostle manifestly applies to christ the title of  lord which is the usual greek rendering of the hebrew title jehovah the essential name of that eternal being to whom the prophet in the ciid psalm here quoted really addressed himself as appears by the first verse  jehovah hear my prayer etc and in the   th verse which immediately precedes the apostles quotation the person addressed by the psalmist is expressly called upon as god  my god  i said o my god take me not away in the midst of my days thy years are throughout all generations and then immediately follows the apostles quotation of old thou laid the foundation of the earth etc to which he has added the word  though not expressed in the original so that he must mean thereby to express the person to whom the psalm in general was addressed viz the lord  or jehovah there is something peculiarly deep and mysterious in this psalm  the prophet in his own person as a man of afflictions seems to express and prefigure the temporal sufferings humiliation and death see particularly the   d and   th verses  he weakened my strength in the way probably alluding to the failure of our lords bodily strength in the way to mount calvary when he was led away bearing bis cross before the soldiers compelled simon of cyrene to carry the cross compare john xix       with matt xxvii    he shortened my days i said o my god take me not away in the midst of my days thy years are throughout all generations  the hebrew word here rendered to take away is formed from the root  to ascend and from the ascending of smoke toward heaven the same word signifies also to offer a burntoffering and as a substantive it signifies a burntoffering or sacrifice for it is thus used both as a substantive and as a verb in that remarkable command of god to abraham by which the sacrifice of the son of god was manifestly prefigured  take now thy son said god to abraham thine only son isaac whom thou love and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burntoffering  upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of genesis xxii   it was also upon one of the mountains in the land of moriah that the beloved son of god who is also eminently called son of man by having voluntary taken upon himself the seed of abraham in which according to the promise in genesis xxii    all the nations of the earth were to be blessed was really sacrificed and became the propitiation for our sins   john ii   as even caiaphas the wicked high priest himself had foretold saying it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not john xi  0 he was accordingly brought as a lamb to the slaughter which isaiah had long before declared isai liii   nay abraham himself seemed to have foretold this long before the giving of the law from mount sinai at a time indeed when he thought of another sacrifice even when he led his own beloved son as the victim bearing the wood for the sacrifice just as the beloved son of god was afterward led away to death bearing his cross john xix    for isaac said to abraham behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burntoffering and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burntoffering genesis xxii      and accordingly we find the harbinger of the messiah proclaiming the manifestation of that promised lamb  behold the lamb of god which takes away the sin of the world john i    for isaiah had also foretold this propitiation saying he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities isai liii   in like manner the inspired psalmist in the particular psalm already mentioned seems to allude also to the same great sacrifice of the son of god if the interpretation of the word  which it necessarily bears in the above cited command of god to abraham and many other places be admitted  he weakened my strength in the way he shortened my days i said o my god   sacrifice me not in the midst of my days psa cii       so christ afterward in reality prayed to god that the bitter cup of his sufferings might pass from him  o my father said he if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as that wilt matt xxvi    for being in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin heb iv    he was affected through the weakness of that human nature which he had taken upon him with all the horrors of an approaching agonizing death but as he knew that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning himself luke xxiv    he soon afterward declared his steady resolution to suffer for us saying the cup which my father has given me shall i not drink it john xviii    and accordingly he was taken away or rather sacrificed in the midst of his days agreeable to the expression above cited from the psalmist being in the thirtyfifth year of his age as scaliger and several other learned men have supposed see the rev mr burtons essay toward reconciling the numbers of daniel and john p     which is exactly half the age of man i mean half the term which moses in the  0th psalm has declared to be the usual period of human life but even if our lord was only in the thirtythird year of his age when he suffered according to the common chronology he might still with sufficient propriety be said agreeable to the psalmists expression to be sacrificed in the midst of his days   of the messiah as a man upon earth at the same time that he prays to him as god and jehovah that looked down from the height of his sanctuary from heaven etc see verse       in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands they shall perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as does a garment and as a vesture shall thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail heb i  0        so that our lord was really in his being or existence what the same apostle seems to apply to his doctrine jesus christ the same yesterday and today and for ever heb xiii   for it was he who said fear not i am the first and the last i am he that lives and was dead and behold i am alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and death rev i        thus it appears that our redeemer was not only jehovah in name but in effect or reality also if the true meaning of that title be considered as his being the first and the last demonstrates his eternal existence and power as much as the name of jehovah  compare the lastmentioned text with the exhortation of god by isaiah xli  0 to his people israel  fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness and again in the   th and   th verses for i the lord or jehovah thy god will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not i will help thee fear not thou worm jacob and ye men of israel i will help thee says the lord i e jehovah and thy redeemer the holy one of israel and this lord or jehovah who here declares himself to be the god of israel proclaims his own eternal existence near the beginning of the same chapter viz  th verse in the very same terms that were used in the revelations by him that lives and was dead  who has wrought and done it said jehovah by isaiah calling the generations from the beginning i the lord jehovah the first and with the last i am he and also in the   th chapter ver   thus says the lord jehovah the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts jehovah tsabaouth i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god see also isai xlviii    wherein we find that the god of israel the lord of hosts mentioned in the  d verse declares his eternal existence in the very same terms used by christ in the revelation viz i am the first i also am the last  and as it has already been shown that the true meaning of the title jehovah is nearly to the same purpose it is manifest that christ is jehovah in effect as well as in name  he is jehovah also in power and glory  who have declared this from the ancient time said isaiah who has told it from that time have not i jehovah and there is no god else beside me a just god and a savior there is none beside me look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for i am god  and there is none else i have sworn by myself the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness and shall not return that unto me every knee shall bow every tongue shall swear isai xlv         now let us see to whom this is applied by the apostle paul  for none of us that is no true christian lives to himself says the apostle and no man dies to himself for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the lords for to this end christ both died and rose and revived that he might be lord both of the dead and living but why do thou judge thy brother or why do thou set at naught thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ for it is written here the apostle applies to christ the very text which i last cited from isaiah  as i live says the lord it was jehovah who spoke by isaiah in the text cited by the apostle  unto me every knee shall bow etc for jehovah proclaimed his title in the preceding context which i quoted above  i jehovah and there is no god else beside me etc and therefore it is certain that the apostle here uses the word  or lord as the usual greek rendering for jehovah for so it is generally translated in the greek versions of the old testament as well as in the gospels so that by applying the title  or lord in this place to christ he manifestly applies to him the title of jehovah to which it refers in the hebrew    every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god let us not therefore judge one another any more etc romans xiv       the reason here assigned by the apostle for the illegality of judging our brother is that we shall all stand at the judgment seat of christ to whom he attributes the dignity of jehovah by maintaining in the preceding context that he is the lord to whom we live and die etc and by applying to him isaiahs prediction of universal homage to jehovah as if christ himself in his preexistent state had said  i jehovah etc  unto me every knee shall bow etc  and from this application of the prophecy to the person of christ the apostle immediately draws a conclusion with a manifest reference to what he had before said of our standing at the judgment seat of christ  so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god let us not therefore judge one another any more etc  from this whole quotation it appears that when the apostle asserts the dignity of christ as being the lord of us all   that we live and die unto the lord  etc he in effect applies to him the dignity of jehovah as that title is usually expressed in greek by  the lord in the septuagint tranflation we read  hear o israel the lord our god is one lord for  that is hear o israel jehovah our god is one jehovah deuteronomy vi    and the same text is expressed exactly in the same words by the evangelist mark xii    where he recites our lords answer to the question of the scribe about the first or chief commandment for the evangelist unquestionably substitutes the word  lord in his greek text for  jehovah in the original hebrew of which there are many more instances in the new testament so that from thence we are taught the true import and meaning of the title  the lord as applied to christ in the new testament  lords there are indeed many and the word  is of as general use and application in the greek tongue perhaps as sir in the english tongue but yet whenever it is preceded by the article  as  and has no express reference to any particular place title office or temporal dignity it must necessarily in that case be understood as a title of supreme dignity because it is then applicable to no other being but that alone which is most eminently the lord  as being  lord of all this title of supreme dignity is due not only to the heavenly father but is also expressly applied to his messiah  the word which god sent unto the children of israel preaching peace by jesus christ he is lord of all acts x       so that the title  the lord and many times  even without the article is with propriety substituted in the greek scriptures when the apostle matthew cites isaiahs prophecy that a virgin shall be with child and applies it to the birth of jesus by the virgin mary a descendant of the house of david he says now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord  by the prophet etc matt i       whereas in the book of the prophet himself we find that the prediction was the word of jehovah see isai vii  0     moreover the lord ie jehovah spoke again unto ahaz saying ask thee a signof jehovah thy god etc  again when isaiahs prophecy concerning the harbinger of christ   prepare ye the way of jehovah etc isai xl   is cited in the new testament we find the greek word  lord substituted for the hebrew name jehovah by all the four evangelists matt iii   mark i   luke iii   and john i    this prophecy by the unanimous testimony of all these evangelists is applied to the preaching of john the baptist who himself pointed to jesus as the person whom he was sent to precede in the world and for whom he prepared the way behold the lamb of god says the baptist which takes away or bears the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me comes a man which is preferred before me etc john i        jesus therefore is undoubtedly that  that lord or jehovah before whom john prepared the way agreeable to the prediction of the prophet as i have elsewhere remarked    ye shall not tempt jehovah your god etc in deuteronomy vi    is rendered by matthew iv   and also by luke iv    thou shall not tempt the lord thy god  and the like rendering of the title jehovah may be found in the  0th verse of the same chapter of matthew and in the  th verse of the same chapter of luke  also  thou shall keep and perform a free will offering according as thou have vowed unto jehovah thy god etc in deuteronomy xxiii    is rendered by the apostle matthew v    thou  shall perform unto the lord  thine oaths  deuteronomy vi    thou shall love jehovah thy god with all thine heart is rendered by matthew xxii    by mark xii  0 and by luke x    thou shall love the lord thy god    also   jehovah said unto my lord in the   0th psalm ver   is rendered by the apostle matthew xxii      the lord said unto my lord etc and in the same manner exactly by mark xii    and by luke xx    and also in the acts ii     in the remarkable prophecy of isaiah lxi   quoted by st luke iv       concerning the preaching of the messiah or anointed   the spirit of adoni jehovah or the lord jehovah is upon me because jehovah has anointed me to preach to the poor etc the evangelist has substituted the greek title  for the hebrew titles adoni jehovah  the prophecy in the    th psalm ver    which was cited by our lord himself   blessed is he that comes in the name of jehovah is rendered by the evangelist luke xiii    blessed is he that comes in the name of the lord  and he expresses the name jehovah by the same greek title  when he afterward records the circumstance whereby that prophecy was in part fulfilled viz the public entry of christ into jerusalem when the whole multitude of disciples proclaimed before him saying  blessed is the king that comes in the name of the lord  luke xix       see also john xii    where we find the same rendering of the words  in the name of jehovah by in the name of the lord   the prophecy of isai liii   who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of jehovah revealed is rendered by the evangelist john  lord who has believed our report and to whom has the arm of the lord  been revealed john xii     these examples from the evangelists i hope are amply sufficient to prove the true meaning and importance of the greek title  lord when it is applied to god or to christ in which case it implies nothing less than the dignity of jehovah   for the title jehovah in translations and quotations from the hebrew original wherein that holy name occurs  it would take up too much of my readers time as well as of my own were i to cite all the examples that may be found in the greek scriptures of quotations from the hebrew text wherein the word  or lord is substituted for the hebrew title  jehovah however i have inserted in the preceding note a sufficient number i hope of examples from the evangelists to demonstrate beyond contradiction the true meaning and importance of the greek title  lord when it is applied to god or to christ for in that case if there is any truth in the evangelists as faithful translators it implies and expresses nothing less than the dignity of jehovah exactly in this sense therefore we must necessarily understand the apostle paul when he tells us in his first epistle to the corinthians xv    that the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is   the lord or jehovah from heaven  the effect of this translation of mine will appear sufficiently justifiable if it is compared with a parallel expression of john the baptist recorded by john the evangelist iii     he that comes from above is above all  he that is of the earth is earthly and speaks of the earth he that comes from heaven the apostle repeats his assertion is above all this is clearly a part of the testimony of john the baptist concerning the supreme dignity of that divine person whose way he was sent to prepare john the baptist as i have already remarked was sent to prepare the way of jehovah  his voice  was the long expected voice foretold by isaiah  the voice of him that cries in the wilderness prepare ye the way of jehovah xl   he was that extraordinary messenger of jehovah foretold by malachi iii   behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me etc  that is i jehovah will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me viz before jehovah for the divine person whom the prophet represents as speaking these words is expressly mentioned in the  th verse of the same chapter  for i am jehovah i change not etc it therefore evidently appears that the way was to be prepared for jehovah and indeed the prediction was fulfilled in the most exact literal sense for when this extraordinary messenger was questioned by his own disciples and the jews concerning jesus saying  he that was with thee beyond jordan to whom thou bear witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him john showed them that their report of the increasing power and fame of christ contained nothing contradictory to the testimony which he had always borne concerning his own office and calling  ye yourselves said he bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him that is before the christ or messiah and after assuring them that christ must increase saying he must increase but i must decrease he added the highest testimony that could be given of christs heavenly power and divine existence such a testimony as became that extraordinary messenger who was sent to prepare the way of jehovah saying  he that comes from above is above all which expression cannot with propriety be applied to any person that is not really and truly jehovah john iii           for the sentence immediately follows what the baptist said of christ  he must increase but i must decrease john iii  0   etc  now it must be allowed that none except the god of israel whose name alone is jehovah psa lxxxiii    can justly be said to be above all  so that if the messiah was not truly god and included with the almighty father and the holy ghost in the eternal being jehovah this expression that he is above all could not with the least propriety be so peremptorily and repeatedly applied to him but as john the baptist who was sent to prepare the way of jehovah as i have already remarked has positively asserted concerning him that comes from heaven that he is above all we must necessarily conclude that the lord from heaven the title applied to christ by the apostle paul in the parallel text recited above is a title of supreme dignity and implies as much as if the apostle had expressly entitled the messiah  jehovah from heaven for had this latter been literally expressed by some prophet in the hebrew tongue the apostles words  would have been the regular greek version of such an expression which i have already proved by a variety of examples see pages           but christ is not only  the lord or jehovah from heaven but he is also the lord of glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified   the lord of glory   cor ii      one of the highest titles that can be conceived so that if he were not really of one and the same divine nature with the almighty father this title of supreme excellence the lord of glory could not be used with the least degree of propriety especially as god i e the lord jehovah has declared to the jews that he will not give his glory to another  viz i am the lord i e jehovah that is my name and my glory will i not give to another etc isai xlii    if christ therefore is the lord of glory he must necessarily be esteemed one with the father in the eternal being jehovah  our lord himself also declared i and the father are one   john x  0 and yet this very sentence which asserts the unity of the father and the son expresses at the same time a manifest distinction of persons which is also clearly demonstrable in almost every other page of scripture though the doctrine of the unity of god is not less clearly laid down and inculcated throughout the scriptures  our lord has delivered this doctrine of his unity with the father in various modes of expression as  he that has seen me said he has seen the father etc and i am in the father and the father in me etc john xiv    0 and yet the true nature and manner of that unity must still remain a mystery because a perfect knowledge of that eternal being which in every way is infinite cannot possibly fall within the comprehension of our finite understandings see page       this doctrine is nevertheless a necessary part of our faith because the scriptures contain such a proportion of evidence really within the measure of human judgment as is sufficient to authenticate the whole and demonstrate the divine mission of those holy persons by whom they were from time to time delivered for our instruction and therefore as we are answerable to god for the use or abuse of that knowledge of good and evil which we inherit from our first parents as i have already shown in the beginning of this tract we cannot reject any part of the scripture evidence without being guilty of such a manifest perversion and abuse of that hereditary knowledge as must render us highly culpable before god and endanger our eternal welfare we are bound therefore to receive even some things that we do not understand for the sake of those things which we do understand just as our lord himself instructed philip to believe this very doctrine of his unity with the father for the sake of the mighty works  or else believe me said our lord for the very works sake john xiv    our lord had been instructing his disciples concerning his own dignity and office  i am the way said he and the truth and the life no man comes unto the father but by me if ye had known me ye should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him philip says unto him lord show us the father and it suffices us jesus says unto him have i been so long time with you and yet have thou not known me philip he that has seen me has seen the father and how say thou then show us the father believe thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwells in me he does the works believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake john xiv         which he had shown him for these indeed were evident to his senses and could not be denied and therefore as the divine mission was so strongly authenticated philip was bound to receive the whole doctrine of the gospel as delivered by divine authority even though he did not comprehend it and in like manner is every man indeed obliged to submit his judgment in receiving and acknowledging these revealed mysteries of our religion for the sake of that substantial evidence which the scriptures afford us of other truth and facts which fall more immediately within the measure of human comprehension  believe me that i am in the father said our lord and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake  but our lord nevertheless condescended to illustrate this doctrine in some degree by a most interesting comparison which relates very materially to the principal subject of this tract the nature of man because it informs us at the same time concerning that intimate connection with the divine nature which human nature is rendered capable of acquiring through the divine mediator between god and man  sanctify them said that divine mediator when he prayed to his holy father for his disciples through thy truth thy word is truth  and who is this logos this word this truth of the holy father both under the old and new covenant but our divine mediator himself who immediately added as thou have sent me said he into the world even so have i also sent them viz the disciples as he had formerly sent the prophets into the world and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one which is the interesting comparison beforementioned as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou have sent me and the glory which thou gave me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou have sent me and have loved them as thou have loved me father i will  that they also whom thou has given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou have given me for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world o righteous father the world has not known thee but i have known thee and these have known that thou have sent me and i have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou have loved me may be in them and i in them john xvii        here is a glorious declaration of the dignity to which god has been pleased to call mankind and as the unity of the disciples or true believers is thus clearly compared to the unity of the father and the son it is manifest that the doctrine of the lastmentioned unity as far as the scriptures have revealed it to us is a topic necessarily included in the subject of this tract  the nature of man but this unity of the father and the son is not in all respects the same unity as that wherein the church or congregation of disciples and true believers is included with the father and the son that they also said christ to his heavenly father may be one in us  though the faithful undoubtedly partake of the divine nature by the holy spirit agreeable to the promises see p  00   0  and both christ and the father are in them as our lord said  i in them and thou in me agreeable to what our lord had once before declared  if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him john xiv    thus human nature is capable of being exalted and dignified even in this life notwithstanding the uncertainties and sufferings attending our worldly condition  the faithful indeed are one in the father and the son as our lord prayed for them to his heavenly father that they all may be one  as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us etc and again that they may be one  even as we are one i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one etc but we must be careful to maintain the due distinction between the unity of the father and the son and the unity of the faithful in the father and the son the latter is indeed in some respect or other like the former alike probably in that very circumstance alone of being in unity  in unity of will of love and universal benevolence etc for god is love and he that dwells in love dwells in god and god in him etc   john iv    but it is not altogether the same unity wherein the scriptures declare the almighty father and his son to be one as some socinians have conceived or it could not with propriety be compared with it like is compared with like but like is not the same even to a proverb in what respect the latter unity may be like the former i have already shown by authority of scripture but the heavenly father and his son are one in many other respects which cannot with the least degree of propriety be attributed to the unity of the church in christ the son of god is one with his almighty father in eternal existence in that being of eternity jehovah see p          etc they are one also in power and divine attributes the son being expressly entitled lord of all see page     the lord from heaven page     the lord of glory p     and is also declared to be above all p     and over all god  says st paul speaking of the people of israel  whose or of whom are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christ came who is over all god blessed for ever amen romans ix     blessed for ever and our lord manifested himself to be truly god when he asserted his power on earth to forgive sins without contradicting the inward sentiment of the scribes reasoning in their hearts  who can forgive sins but god only see mark ii          these are undoubtedly attributes of the heavenly father and many more shall hereafter be mentioned in the course of the argument so that the father and the son are manifestly one in these several respects and in many more as there is but one god or one jehovah but the unity of the congregation of true believers that they are one in christ etc must be considered in a more confined sense the true believers are one glorious universal church one building of which our lord jesus christ is the foundation   cor iii    the chief corner stone ephesians ii  0 they are a spiritual house   pet ii   a bride for thy maker is thine husband the lord jehovah of hosts is his name and thy redeemer the holy one of israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called isai live    john iii    a being of many in one so we being many are one body in christ and every one members one of another romans xii    as the symbol of the cherubim four living creatures in one which moved with one spirit and represented the hosts of israel see p  and of course all those that are engrafted on that stock the olive tree of israel through christ for  if ye be christs then are ye abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise gal iii     thus all true believers in christ by being accounted abrahams seed are included in the spiritual israel and are esteemed one in christ that is one catholic church but not one jehovah for in the peculiar unity of the latter none can be included except the three divine persons to whom alone the supreme title jehovah is distinctly attributed in the scriptures  my reason for making this remark is that some learned men in their comments on jeremiah xxxiii    viz grotius vitringa and several others have applied to jerusalem that glorious title which the scriptures have given to christ alone viz jehovah our righteousness the learned and rev mr william lowth formerly prebendary of winchester in his commentary on jeremiah p     also applies it to jerusalem that is says he to the church etc the learned authors of our last excellent english version have likewise unhappily fallen into the same error though the older english versions were clear from it and have rendered the passage as follows  and this is the name wherewith she shall be called the lord our righteousness so vitringa  hoc est nomen quo ipsa denominabitur jehova justitia nostra anacrisis apocalypsios p      but the hebrew text will bear no such construction insomuch that the abovementioned translators have been obliged to interpolate their respective versions of this passage with words that have nothing to answer them in the original in order to make up that imaginary sense of it which they have erroneously adopted for they supply the words is the name and nomen for which there is not the least authority in the original text supplementary words are never allowable in translations from the hebrew scriptures unless they are absolutely necessary to render the sense complete by filling up such a vacuum in the english expression as sometimes arises from the difference of idiom in the two languages but they are very far from being necessary in the text before us which will appear by two plain circumstances viz   st that a literal rendering of the hebrew in this text into english affords an intelligible and just construction without that interpolation so that here can be no reason or authority whatever for making it  and  dly that the words supplied by the translators have led them for they could not have so rendered the hebrew text without them to attribute to jerusalem that glorious title which in the parallel passage of jeremiah chapter xxiii     as well as in the text before us apparently belongs to the righteous branch of david the king that should reign and execute judgment and righteousness  in the earth so that the passage instead of being as in the hebrew bible parallel to the former in the former passage jer xxiii     the righteous branch of the house of david the king that was to reign and do judgment and righteousness in the land is manifestly called jehovah our righteousness  in his days  here is a masculine relative plainly refering back to the substantive   king in the preceding sentence judah shall be saved   feminine  i e judah she shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely these are mentioned as contingents of that kings reign so that the principal substantive must be known by the reference of the relative which plainly points to  the king mentioned in the preceding sentence and this is his name whereby he shall be called  here the masculine relative is again inserted and connected by the copulative  and to the relative in the beginning of the same sentence so that both relatives manifestly refer back to the same principal substantive  the king mentioned in the preceding sentence and not to the nearest substantives judah and israel as some have erroneously conceived in order to make the text correspond with the mistaken construction of the parallel text which cannot be done without violence to both texts and therefore we must abide by the letter and construe this part of the sentence as follows  and this is his name which they shall call or proclaim rather than  whereby he shall be called for the verb is in the  d person plural the lord our righteousness  the expression in the other parallel text varies in several circumstances from this so that critics cannot be justified in attempting to warp the sense of this passage to that nor the sense of that to this but on the contrary are bound to give to each of them their true literal sense and we shall find that the parallel will be so far from being weakened thereby that it will on the contrary appear much more clear and consistent    is rendered by their translation absolutely dissonant irreconcilable and unparallel not only to that particular text but to every other part of scripture  jerusalem or the church might be allowed by way of title to bear a motto or memorial respecting the righteousness of jehovah or that jehovah is righteous as king zedekiah and others certainly did hear such a memorial of jehovah in their names see my tract on the law of retribution p   0     but neither zedekiah nor even the redeemed church or spiritual jerusalem could with the least degree of propriety be called what christ alone really was and is  jehovah our righteousness  but the impropriety of thus applying that glorious title need not be argued it is amply sufficient to show that the hebrew text cannot admit of such a construction without doing violence to it as vitringa and the learned english translators have done by supplying the word  nomen or name which is not found in the text see the words at length  that is  in those days referring back to the former sentence wherein the righteous branch of david is foretold and that he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land shall judah be saved  feminine she shall be saved and jerusalem shall dwell  also feminine she shall dwell safely and he  iste or this person who shall call her or rather  he who shall call to her  is the lord our righteousness here is a translation strictly literal the only word supplied being the common auxiliary verb is which very frequently is found necessary to be added to the english expression in translations from the hebrew and though we find the manner of expression very different from the text in the   d chapter there being here a feminine relative instead of a masculine relative the verb being also varied from plural to singular and the noun  name entirely omitted yet the sense according to this most literal rendering is not only consonant and parallel to the former passage but also strictly scriptural for jehovah certainly called to jerusalem and her inhabitants both before and after that prophecy of jeremiah  i have called unto them said jehovah speaking to the inhabitants of jerusalem by jeremiah chap xxxv    but they have not answered here is the very same verb  to call and the preposition  prefixed in like manner to the pronoun following the verb so that the expression is the same and again we read in the prophet micah vi    the voice of jehovah shall call to the city  here the very same verb  is used in the same sense  shall call and in the two preceding chapters sion is called upon under the figure of a woman  be in pain and labor to bring forth o daughter of zion like a woman in travail etc thou shall go even to babylon etc chap iv  0 and again in the  th chapter  st verse gather thyself in troops  o daughter of troops manifestly refering to the daughter of zion mentioned in the preceding verse he has laid siege against us they shall smite the judge of israel with a rod upon the cheek etc and who is this judge of israel surely it is the divine word who not only by his prophets in ancient times  are not these the words which jehovah has called   called or proclaimed i e to the inhabitants of jerusalem by the former prophets when jerusalem was inhabited  etc  zech vii   here the verb  to call is used in the very same sense that i have given to it in the text of jeremiah now under consideration   but also in his own person as son of god and son of man called to the city and its unwary inhabitants  who said by isaiah  i have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people etc chapter lxv    but they refused to hearken and pulled away the shoulder and stopped their ears that they should not hear yea they made their hearts as an adamant stone lest they should hear the law and the words which the lord of hosts has sent in his spirit by the hand of the former prophets therefore came a great wrath from the lord of hosts therefore it came to pass that as he called  the same verb still used in the same sense and they would not hear so they shall call  in the future tense and i will not hear  says jehovah of hosts and i will scatter them  still in the future tense and be pleased to remark that the prophecy of this scattering or dispersion was delivered by zechariah after the return of israel and judah from their former dispersion in the provinces of babylon but this future dispersion was to be much more notorious and general  i will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not etc zech vii        from this last dreadful and general dispersion the jews have never yet returned to their own proper country but the land is still desolate after them see the   th verse having been ever since possessed and plundered by standing armies the bane of mankind consisting alternately of various foreign nations and the frightful desolation of that devoted land has been continued and prolonged by the detestable arbitrary governments of arabians turks and such other foreign despots the scourges of mankind  for they laid the pleasant land desolate this determined vengeance against the jews viz they shall call and i will not hear etc was lamented in the most affecting terms by the judge of israel abovementioned whom they smote and despised for he called and they would not hear  o jerusalem jerusalem that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings and ye would not behold your house is left unto you desolate for i say unto you ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say blessed is he that comes in the name of the lord matt xxiii        may god of his infinite mercy hasten that time and give grace to the descendants of his once peculiar people that they may acknowledge the true shepherd and king of israel and be collected from this fatal dispersion which has already endured more than   00 years then will they know and declare that the branch of righteousness that grew up unto david and executed judgment and righteousness in the land is he that called to her  that is to jerusalem jer xxxiii    and that this is his name  which they shall call jehovah our righteousness jer xxiii   nay some of the most learned rabbis have declared long ago that this is the title of the messiah and even grotius himself who applies this title to the city  hic de civitate agitur see on jer xxxiii    yet acknowledges that not only christians but also the learned rabbi kimchi refers it in a more sublime sense to the messiah sensu sublimiore non christiani tantum sed et kimchi hoc ad messiam refert  and therefore if all the texts above cited be duly compared and considered it must appear that the title jehovah our righteousness is not applied by jeremiah xxxiii    to jerusalem but to him who as the prophet said shall call her this it seems has been the opinion of several interpreters particularly huetius demonstr evang prop vii cap    and our learned bishop pearson in the notes upon his exposition of the creed p     who as the abovementioned mr lowth acknowledges render the words thus he that shall call her i e to be his peculiar people is the lord our righteousness see also the old english translation by tindal printed in       and he that shall call her is even god our ryghteous maker  in the old version called the bishops bible we read  and he that shall call her is even god our righteousness and in the common english version printed by the kings printer in      we find nearly the same rendering  and he that shall call her is the lord our righteousness  these are sufficient authorities i trust for what i have asserted in this note and for the translation which i have ventured to make of the text in question and therefore if all the texts also above cited be duly compared and considered it must appear that the title jehovah our righteousness was not applied by jeremiah to jerusalem but only to the righteous branch which as he foretold grew up to david and called to her    are in like manner esteemed one because all distinctions of nation rank and dignity and even of sex are set aside in the true church  there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ jesus and if ye be christs then are ye abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise gal iii       thus the faithful are one in christ but surely not with christ  i mean not with him in the unity of power glory and eternal existence wherein he and the holy ghost are and ever were included with the almighty father the unity of the church is indeed in some respects as i have shown like the unity of the father and the son but it is not the same unity as the socinians would insinuate this attempt of the socinians to exclude the doctrine of christs divine dignity which necessarily arises from the repeated declarations in scripture that the father and the son are one is vain and futile because the many circumstances of divine omnipotence and eternal existence already recited in which they are one cannot without blasphemy be attributed to the church or to that other unity wherein the church is included in the father and the son    in the communion service of the church of england indeed mention is made of our unity with christ  we are one with christ and christ with us see exhortation at the time of the celebration etc but this has not the least reference to the unity of christ with the father but only to the declared unity of the faithful who form that one building whereof christ is the chief corner stone in whom all the building fitly framed together grows unto an holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit ephesians ii  0     so that all faithful disciples are undoubtedly one in christ that is one  holy temple with respect to the one holy temple we may say that the faithful are one either in or with christ because christ is called the chief corner and the head and gave him to be head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that fills all in all ephesians i       of the church and consequently in this figure is esteemed a part of the church    or one catholic church even as the father and the son are one but it must appear from the several texts already quoted if they are duly compared and weighed together that the unity of the church in christ is not mentioned as the same unity wherein the father and the son are one viz one in power glory and eternal existence or one god but only as a resemblance or illustration in some respects of that divine unity  in some respects i say as being united in will or in divine love as i have already shown or by the inspiration of the holy spirit in each individual through which the whole congregation of the faithful that are builded together in christ become  an habitation of god see the text last quoted from ephesians ii  0     but not in all respects because there are many circumstances some of which i have already mentioned wherein the unity or fellowship of christ with the heavenly father is infinitely transcendent and such as cannot without blasphemy be attributed to the redeemed brethren or those that are merely members of the church so that the socinian objection to the doctrine which necessarily arises from the several texts wherein the father and the son are declared to be one is apparently unjust and false may any other man but the man christ jesus   timothy ii   say as he did  all things that the father has are mine john xvi    and again  as the father knows me even so know i the father john x    or as christ expressed himself to his heavenly father in prayer  and now o father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was john xvii   thus christ declares his right to be glorified with the heavenly father himself which must mean to be glorified with supreme glory as it is the glory of the almighty father the glory which the son had with his almighty father before the world was this glorious person assumed the nature of man and for a time dwelt among men that he might fulfill all righteousness mat iii    even in his human nature and thereby restore the lost dignity and privileges of that nature  the first man being of the earth earthy but the second man the lord from heaven   cor xv    human nature therefore is indeed exalted to eternal glory but that is only in by and through him who alone is truly and essentially the son of god as well as the son of man for he is the way and the truth and the life no man comes unto the father said our lord but by me john xiv    the miserable state of fallen man is already described in the former part of this tract the means of retrieving our lost dignity remains still to be shown god has mercifully revealed to us these necessary means and tendered them in the scriptures to our choice that by a prudent use of the knowledge of good and evil we may constantly prefer and choose the good earnestly claiming the promises of divine assistance whereby we shall also be enabled to reject the evil on all occasions and effectually to resist the spiritual enemy and maintain our integrity in the severest trials of our faith for in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us romans viii     thus the device of satan in promoting mans assumption of forbidden knowledge is completely turned against himself for that very knowledge which through his deceit and temptation subjected all mankind to sin and death is now through the mercy of god become a proper principle of action if we use it as we ought to incline us to righteousness and lead us to  the tree of life the hereditary knowledge of good and evil which our first parents unlawfully took upon themselves by eating of the tree of knowledge is shown in the beginning of this tract to be a divine knowledge such as must have originally proceeded from god and as the divine word which  was with god and  was god john i   is declared also to be the true light which lights every man that comes into the world john i   we may perhaps without impropriety conceive that the said divine knowledge of which man unlawfully partook was in some way or other originally communicated to the tree of knowledge in paradise by the eternal word because light and knowledge when mentioned as mental properties are certainly synonymous terms so that to impart knowledge to every man is the same thing as to light or enlighten every man that comes into the world but whether this conjecture be true or not yet we are certain that we can have no hopes of regaining the privileges which were lost by the former fatal disobedience except through christ alone for to him are attributed all the properties of the tree of life from which our beguiled ancestor was unhappily excluded being driven from paradise  lest he should put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever genesis iii       so that in him we may truly partake of such benefits as are amply sufficient to restore the original dignity of man and this is the record that god has given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that has the son has life and he that has not the son of god has not life these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god   john v        he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches to him that overcomes will i give the spirit here speaks in his own name and thereby declares his own omnipotence and divine nature   to him will i give says the spirit to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god rev ii    therefore to  eat of the tree of life is manifestly a spiritual repast though real in its eternal effects which are undoubtedly the same as those we expect in christ as the living father has sent me said our lord and i live by the father so he that eats me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eats of this bread shall live for ever john vi       christ is therefore in a most effectual manner to us the tree of life and accordingly he himself has assured us in the strongest terms  verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you whose eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and i will raise him at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed  truly so and my blood is drink indeed etc john vi        now as the eating the flesh of the son of man and drinking his blood  except ye eat etc  ye have no life in you etc is thus declared to be absolutely necessary for us of course the means given us of doing so demand our most serious consideration especially as they were expressly and clearly revealed to the apostles in the solemn hour of christs latest instructions the apostle paul relates the last commands of christ on this subject as they were revealed to him by our lord himself even after his ascension whereby the necessity and importance of them are still further confirmed viz that the lord jesus the night he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do  manifestly directing his disciples to use the solemn ceremony of breaking bread as he had done in remembrance said he of me after the same manner also the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the new testament or new covenant in my blood this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me thus far the apostle relates the commands of christ which clearly relate to what our lord himself had before declared concerning the necessity of eating his flesh and drinking his blood so that this solemn ceremony of bread and wine is manifestly the means he had given us of doing so because our lord declared of the bread  this is my body etc adn of the cup this is the new covenant in my blood etc and therefore we may be assured that all persons who sincerely and with due faith and disposition partake of these two outward symbols of his body and blood in remembrance of him according to the form which he himself so expressly instituted do most certainly in a spiritual manner partake also of the tree of life agreeable to the promise of the spirit to him that overcomes the bread is no otherwise the body of christ than as it is used in this institution  viz received and eaten in remembrance of christ by which we have communion of his body   cor x    for we have no authority whatever to esteem it the body of christ in any other respect so that for all other purposes and uses whatsoever it cannot be allowed so much as the name of any thing else but what it really is  mere bread  even when it is held up to be worshipped and therefore that church which uses it in suth an unjustifiable manner is certainly guilty of the grossest idolatry    which confirms the doctrine of their necessity and importance  as our lord had before declared  my flesh is meat  food from thence the german broat and english word bread indeed and my blood is drink indeed he now substituted the real viands of bread  or food indeed and wine drink indeed as the outward symbols of that flesh and blood that spiritual meat and drink for the soul of which all persons must of necessity partake who hope for eternal life blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life etc rev xxii       but we must remember at the same time that this knowledge in man is far from being of itself sufficient for these purposes the dignity and privileges of human nature cannot be known nor the manner of communicating them properly understood without a right faith in the dignity and divine nature of christ because in his promises alone our title to those extraordinary privileges is founded whatsoever ye shall ask in my name said our lord jesus that will i do a clear proof of his divine nature that the father said he may be glorified in the son if ye shall ask any thing in my name said our lord again i will do it etc john xiv        a right faith therefore concerning the true dignity of that divine person in whose name we hope to obtain the heavenly gift of the holy ghost is undoubtedly necessary and we must give him the honor due unto his name or the very mention of that name instead of intitling us to favor would be an offense to god who has highly exalted his only begotten son and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father philip ii        neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved acts iv    for as the father raised up the dead and quickens them even so the son quickens whom he will john v     in a preceding verse viz   th our lord in like manner compared with a seeming insinuation of equality his own works with the works of his father  my father works hitherto said he and i work  the father which works hitherto was clearly understood by the jews to signify the almighty father the worker or maker of all things and therefore they could neither brook the mention he made in the same sentence of his own working nor the particular claim which our lord expressed in that sentence to the almighty father as his peculiar father calling him my father instead of our father as the common parent or creator of mankind  all this is plainly implied in the following verse and therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath viz by his miraculous works in healing the sick and doing good but said also that god was his father  said that god was his proper or peculiar father making himself equal with god for to call god his peculiar father was justly esteemed by the jews the same thing as making himself equal with god though they were unjustly incensed at it through a want of due attention to the mighty works similar to those of the almighty father to which christ appealed as a proof that he was really the son of god  that supreme honor is therefore due unto the name and person of the son our blessed redeemer who for our sake took the nature of man upon himself is manifest because we are expressly commanded to honor the son even as we honor the father so that we cannot exceed  for the father judges no man but has committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father  and again he that honors not the son honors not the father which has sent him john v        to honor the son  from  and  according as or even as they honor the father would be idolatry if the son was not a divine person really and truly god from all eternity because the god of israel the eternal and everlasting  jehovah and creator of all things thus says god the lord or jehovah he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the earth and that which comes out of it he that gives breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein i the lord have called thee that is christ in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and will give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles etc isai xlii       at the very time that he promised this glorious redeemer for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison that is from the bondage and slavery of satan and them that sit in darkness out of the prisonhouse he immediately added in the very next sentence i am the lord or jehovah that is my name and my glory will i not give to another etc isai xlii       it is impossible therefore that the supreme god jehovah should give his glory or require men to honor the son even as they honor the father if the son was another or not in unity or one with the father in the eternal being of the one god i mean if he was not included in the one eternal divine being  which is but one  one jehovah that is unity itself and therefore incapable of different degrees or inequality hear o israel said moses the lord or jehovah our god is one lord or one jehovah  deuteronomy vi   and yet we find that this glorious name of the one eternal god of israel viz jehovah  is manifestly attributed both in the old and new testaments as i have already shown to the messiah as a distinct person from the father and therefore when we read our lords expression in john xiv    my father is greater than i we must necessarily understand that no comparative reference can possibly have been intended thereby nor is to be made concerning the divine nature or godhead which certainly is but one viz one jehovah as the text expressly declares and consequently we must acknowledge with the author of the creed commonly attributed to athanasius that the son is equal to the father as touching his godhead viz the one eternal being or jehovah though inferior to the father as touching his manhood or his mediatorial office for in some such qualified sense we must of course understand our lords expression in john  the father is greater than i beforementioned for those men who venture to assert that the inferiority of the son consists in his divine nature must evidently suppose a superior and inferior divine nature and consequently that there are two divine natures which idea the scriptures expressly forbid  jehovah our god is one jehovah deuteronomy vi    and therefore as the son is also jehovah we are bound by the scriptures to believe that he is of the same divine nature with the father in that one eternal being agreeable to what he himself has declared  i and the father are one  john x  0 and as the plurality of persons is clearly expressed in the latter text by the plural verb  we are so the word  one evidently demonstrates the unity and equality of their divine nature for it is no less evident from the context that the said word  one refers to the being of god or jehovah and was intended to express the unity of their divine nature  the divine nature or godhead acts xvii    which can be but one  one godhead as there is but one god    timothy ii    james ii       the jews it is plain understood the expression in that sense and immediately charged our lord with blasphemy  saying  because that thou being a man make thyself god and though our lord condescended to cite a passage from the psalms wherein the title of gods is applied to mere men viz i said ye are gods in order to show that the scriptures would not be broken by the consequence which they had drawn from his expression yet he immediately after maintains the evident meaning of his first expression as it was at first understood by the jews and by a fair comparison showed his infinite superiority over them that were called gods in the law if he said our lord meaning the prophet david called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father has sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemest because i said i am the son of god and our lord immediately added an incontestable proof of his being god not merely in a confined qualified sense like those men called gods in scripture i have said ye are gods and all of you are children or sons of the most high psa lxxxii   the whole psalm is plainly intended as a reproof and warning to wicked rulers or wicked judges whom the inspired psalmist calls gods probably because they ought to act as gods vicegerents on earth in judging righteously according to gods law as moses charged them  ye shall not respect persons in judgment but ye shall hear the small as well as the great ye shall not be afraid of the face of man for the judgment is gods etc deuteronomy i       or as king jehoshaphat afterward warned his judges in a most excellent charge which ought to be wrote in letters of gold on the most conspicuous part of every court of judicature  viz  take heed what ye do for ye judge not for man but for the lord who is with you in the judgment wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you  take heed and do it for there is no iniquity with the lord our god nor respect of persons nor taking of gifts   chronicles xix     it is obvious therefore when these texts are duly considered that judges and magistrates are called gods by the psalmist only in a confined and qualified sense because they judge not for man but for the lord and because the judgment is gods and though in the same sentence they are called sons of the most high yet this is no disparagement or lessening to the title and dignity of the real son of god because the former which are mere men by nature are no otherwise sons of the most high than by adoption for the sake of the real son who was not ashamed to call them brethren i will declare thy name unto my brethren psa xxii    and again  who are my brethren and he stretched out his hands toward his disciples and said behold my mother and my brethren for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven the same is my brother etc mat xii      0    heb ii    and even vouchsafed to take human nature upon himself and to become also the son of man that he might be our brother indeed and the restorer of human dignity in his own person  the quotation made by our lord john x    from the   d psalm viz i said ye are gods manifestly refers us back to a preceding expression in the  st verse of the same psalm wherein the inspired psalmist had said that god  judges among the gods  meaning the congregation of god mentioned in the beginning of the same verse  god stands in the congregation of god he judges among the gods how long will ye judge unjustly etc the whole psalm as i have before remarked is a reproof or warning to unjust judges who are here called gods apparently in no other sense than what i have already described the congregation of god  and  signifies for the most part the main body of the people or the congregation of the israelites in general as in numbers xxvii    and xxxi    and also in joshua xxii       but in the text before us when the subject of the context is duly considered the expression seems to mean the congregation or assembly of the judges or senators of the people and not the whole congregation of god though indeed the said assembly was the proper representative of the whole congregation of god because the judges magistrates and other officers were originally elected by the people as all magistrates and public officers in strict justice ought to be we read indeed that moses chose able men out of all israel and made them heads over the people exodus xviii    but in fact the able men were chosen by the people and not by moses though it is here said that he chose them as it was indeed by his advice that they were chosen agreeable to the council and proposal of jethro related in the preceding context for in the first chapter of deuteronomy wherein moses begins to repeat the history of former transactions he relates this amongst the rest in terms which clearly show that the election of the able men was by the people i spoke unto you says he at that time saying i am not able to bear you myself alone the lord your god has multiplied you etc how can i myself alone bear your cumbrance and your burden and your strife take ye  choose ye to yourselves in the hebrew says the learned bp patrick it is give ye i e present unto me says he such persons as you think fit according to the following characters wise men and understanding and known among your tribes etc thus the learned bishops paraphrase amounts to the full meaning of my interpretation above choose ye to yourselves  but there is no need of a paraphrase to justify this rendering the word  indeed literally signifies give ye as the bishop remarks but neither his lordship nor the english version have taken any notice of the word which immediately follows it viz   to yourselves for when these two words come together  they form a phrase which construed literally indeed it give ye to yourselves  as the dxx have literally rendered it but as such a sentence necessarily implies a choice the phrase is much better expressed when rendered choose ye to yourselves as above above which is the version of the syriac  choose ye to yourselves both in this text and in joshua xviii   where the same hebrew phrase occurs   choose ye to yourselves three men for each tribe and i will send them and they shall rise and go through the land and describe it according to the inheritance of them and they shall come again to me etc thus joshua also as a faithful minister of state under god was careful to maintain the popular rights of election and to promote them by his advice even a survey of the country in his opinion it seems was not to be trusted to any public officers or commissioners whatever but such as were duly chosen by the people and those in equal proportions for each tribe  choose ye to yourselves said he three men for each tribe etc  wise men and understanding and known among your tribes which necessarily implies that the tribes were to nominate and i said moses will make them rulers over you i e the returns of the elections were to be made to moses and he was to invest the elected with public authority and ye said moses answered me and said  the thing which thou have spoken is good for us to do thus moses like a good politician and faithful public minister under under god declared the free assent of the people whereby the important measure he had proposed by the advice of jethro was enacted and became a public law or statute so i took said moses the chief of your tribes wise men and known that is known among the tribes as expressed in the   th verse which necessary qualification could not fairly be ascertained unless the known men were really returned or named to moses as such by the tribes themselves and made them heads over you captains over thousands and captains over hundreds and captains over fifties and captains over tens and officers among your tribes thus it appears that the officers in general from the colonel or captain of a thousand whether of individuals or families down to the sergeant or tythingman were recommended or nominated by the people before they were invested with authority by moses and i charged your judges at that time whereby it must of course be understood that the judges also had been previously nominated by the people as wise men and understanding and known among the tribes agreeable to the preceding enacted proposal saying hear the causes between your brethren and judge righteously between every man and his brother and the stranger that is with him ye shall not respect persons in judgment etc deuteronomy i       the remainder of the excellent charge i have quoted above  i have thus far digressed from my subject not only for the sake of explaining several texts of scripture which occurred to me in the course of my argument but also for the honor of human nature to show the glorious state of political liberty with which god was pleased to bless his people israel and in which he would most certainly have maintained them if they had persevered in the right faith and in due obedience to his laws but when men forsake god they unavoidably lose their liberty    but god also in effect and power  if i do not the works of my father continued our lord believe me not but if i do though you believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him john x         this reference to the works of the father was a manifest appeal of christ to the understanding of his hearers concerning the peculiar manner in which he was really god and of the same divine nature with the father agreeable to the obvious sense of his first proposition  i and the father are one ver  0  and the unbelieving jews notwithstanding their mental blindness and hardness of heart foretold by their own prophets as plainly understood that the necessary effect of this argument was exactly the same upon the whole that they at first apprehended viz that he made himself i e declared himself to be really god and therefore they immediately renewed their wicked persecution as at first for they sought again to take him says the text but he escaped out of their hand ver     my readers may perhaps think that i prolong my work too much and render it tedious by inserting so many proofs concerning the divine nature of the son of god but alas i find that my labor on this point is become necessary many learned men and some even of my own particular friends have unhappily overlooked that indispensable doctrine and do not perceive that the glorious name jehovah the peculiar name of the one supreme god is clearly in the scriptures attributed also to the son of god and we cannot rightly understand the nature and dignity of man which is my leading subject in this tract nor the true value of the price which was given for mans redemption as we are bought with a price   cor vi  0 unless we are truly sensible of the nature and dignity as far as god has revealed it to us in the scriptures of that divine person who took human nature upon himself in order to restore the lost dignity and privileges of fallen man  one of my learned friends though a sensible and worthy man amongst other arguments and quotations against my doctrine remarks as follows  the apostle paul says he says in ephesians i      0 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory  set him at his own right hand hence says my learned friend it necessarily follows that christ is not jehovah but the son of jehovah  god who made the worlds by his son is the father of christ heb i   see likewise says he isaiah xi    the spirit of jehovah shall rest upon him  also isai lxi     the spirit of the lord god is upon me because jehovah has anointed me to preach etc compared with luke iv     now that christ is the son of god or as my friend styles him the son of jehovah i will declare the decree the lord in the hebrew jehovah has said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee psalm ii      every true christian must readily allow to be a true and indispensable doctrine but it by no means follows from thence though my friend says it necessarily follows that christ is not jehovah to the direct contrary of my friends assertion i am obliged to remark that as christ is the son of jehovah and the son of god in a peculiar and essential manner christ is in a peculiar and essential manner the son of god because he proceeded forth and came out of god see p         and is expressly called the only begotten of the almighty father  and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth john i    and again god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believes on him is not condemned but he that believes not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god john iii           it necessarily follows from thence that he is also really and truly god and jehovah in an essential manner for as a son must necessarily partake of the nature or essence of his natural father so the son of jehovah must necessarily be of the same nature being or essence with his almighty father jehovah and as there is but one jehovah must necessarily in some way or other though incomprehensible to us at present be included in that one eternal being the very circumstance which my friend assigns as a proof that  the son is not jehovah was esteemed by the unbelieving jews when our lord was on earth as a proof that he made himself equal with god therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath that is as they falsely alleged because he had healed the sick and done good on the sabbath day which was certainly lawful but said also that god was his father  his own proper or peculiar father that is his father in a real or essential manner and this it seems is the very reason which my friend has assigned as a proof that christ is not jehovah but which on the contrary the jews rightly esteemed to be the same thing as making himself equal with god  john v     our lord was so far from denying the truth of the consequential doctrine which the jews had drawn from his having said that god was his father   his own proper father that he immediately in the very next verse appealed to his works for the truth of it then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do showing thereby that the father is indeed the fountain of power but immediately afterward he shows likewise that he himself as being son of the almighty father was therefore equal in power with the father for what things soever he that is the father does said our lord these also does the son likewise or in like manner  which is surely such an ample declaration of his own almighty power as could not be true were he not really jehovah for the father continued our lord loves the son and shows him all things that himself does and he will show him greater works than these alluding to the mighty works by which he proved himself to be the son of jehovah that ye may marvel said he for as the father raises up the dead and quickens them even so the son quickens whom he will another incontestable declaration of almighty power such as cannot be attributed to any that is not truly god though it is certainly an especial attribute of him that is called   the prince or author of life but ye denied the holy one and the just said the apostle peter to the jews and desired a murderer to be granted unto you and killed the prince of life whom god has raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses and his name i e the name of jesus as a proof that he has life in himself john v    and quickens whom he will through faith in his name has made this man strong whom ye see and know etc acts iii        for as the prophets of old wrought miracles in the name of jehovah so the apostles and primitive christians wrought miracles in the name of jesus to prove that he was the son of jehovah and consequently is truly god and lord    for the father continues our lord judges no man but has committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honor which honor as i have before remarked implies supreme honor and worship such as would be gross idolatry if the son was not truly jehovah because the law which christ came to fulfill think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled matthew v        declares expressly  thou shall fear jehovah thy god him shall thou serve and to him shall thou cleave etc deuteronomy x  0 and this law christ himself in his quotation of it has taught us to understand as an injunction to serve and fear jehovah only or exclusively of every other being  for it it written said our lord thou shall worship the lord thy god  for jehovah thy god and him only shall thou serve or worship  matthew iv  0 whereas if the son was not truly jehovah this also would be an irreconcilable contradiction to the command abovementioned that all men should honor the son even as  they honor the father   the son even as they honor the father and as supreme honor is certainly due to the father we must of course honor the son with supreme honor even as  we honor the father this is so necessary a part of the christian duty that men cannot pay the proper honor to the heavenly father unless they thus honor the son also with supreme honor for he that honors not the son that is he that honors not the son even as he honors the father  for this is necessarily implied from the preceding context honors not the father  how dangerous therefore is the doctrine of some modern clergymen who have seceded from the church of england merely because the litany and other parts of our excellent liturgy express divine honor to the son of god what mental blindness not to perceive that we are bound to honor the son not merely for his own sake but also for the sake of our heavenly father which has sent him that the father in return may have mercy on us for the sake of his only son for the scriptures assure us that we cannot honor the father if we do not honor the son  and the jews of old were warned by the psalmist concerning the necessity of honoring the son lest they should perish from the right way  kiss the son lest he be angry and ye perish from the way psalm ii    the literal sense of this passage is fixed by the preceding context  i will declare the decree  jehovah has said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee v      which has sent him john v         the scriptures attribute eternal honor and glory to the son and that jointly with the heavenly father  blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sits upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever and the four beasts or animals the redeemed out of the twelve tribes of israel which are represented by the figures that anciently distinguished the standards of the four principal tribes in their encampments round the tabernacle this opinion has been adopted by the great sir isaac newton  the people of israel says he in the wilderness encamped round about the tabernacle and on the east side were three tribes under the standard of judah on the west were three tribes under the standard of ephraim on the south were three tribes under the standard of reuben and on the north were three tribes under the standard of dan numb ii and the standard of judah was a lion that of ephraim an ox that of reuben a man and that of dan an eagle as the jews affirm compare this with revel iv   and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast or animal was like a flying eagle rev iv    whence were framed says sir isaac newton the hieroglyphics of cherubims and seraphims to reprepresent the people of israel a cherubim had one body with four faces the faces of a lion an ox a man and an eagle looking to the four winds of heaven without turning about as in ezekiels vision chap i and four seraphims had the same four faces with four bodies one face to every body the four beasts are therefore four seraphims standing in the four sides of the peoples court the first in the eastern side with the head of a lion the second in the western side etc and all four signify together the twelve tribes of israel out of whom the hundred and forty four thousand were sealed apoc vii   observe on the prophecies of daniel and the apoc p       representing the redeemed hosts of israel said amen rev v       see also the   th verse  thus we find that honor and glory and power belong unto the lamb for ever he had indeed for a time laid aside this supreme glory this glory which is attributed to him jointly with him that sits upon the heavenly throne that he might become the son of man and by obedience for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous romans v    in fulfilling the law think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfill matthew v     and all righteousness and jesus answering said unto him john the baptist suffer it to be so now for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him matthew iii     even as a man might retrieve the dignity and lost privileges of human nature but the divine glory was again to be restored to him though he now partook of the nature of his creature man nay the son himself even when a man claims the glory of his heavenly father  and now o father said he glorify thou me with thine ownself with the glory which i had with thee before the world was john xvii   see also p  0   it was not only in his divine nature that the son was to be thus glorified but expressly as man so that the nature of man is indeed exalted in christ to the highest pitch of glory  behold the man whose name is the branch says the prophet zechariah he shall grow up out of his place and he shall build the temple of the lord that is  the holy temple in the lord i e in christ in whom the faithful are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit ephesians ii       see also p  0    0     even he shall build the temple of the lord and he shall bear the glory that is even he  the man that is called the branch shall bear the glory and shall sit and rule upon his throne and he shall be a priest upon his throne that is a royal priest after the order of that righteous king the lord jehovah has sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek or the righteous king psa cx   compare with heb v     0 and also with heb vii          who was king of salem or king of peace for this melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace etc heb vii      and the counsel of peace shall be between them both zechariah vi       the throne or kingdom here promised was also to be an everlasting kingdom though given to christ expressly as son of man for it is certainly the same kingdom foretold by the prophet daniel  i saw in the night visions says daniel and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed dan vii       compare this with chap ii    wherein the same prophet informs us that  in the days of these kings meaning the kings or rather kingdoms which succeeded the fourth great kingdom or roman empire shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand for ever the psalmist had also previously declared  thy throne o god is for ever and ever psalm xlv   which the apostle paul has applied expressly to the son heb i   these prophecies of an eternal kingdom proclaimed by the prophets under the old testament were confirmed by the angel gabriel when he declared the eternity of christs government  and behold said he to the blessed virgin thou shall conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus which signifies a savior see note in p     he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever    and of his kingdom there shall be no end  luke i        the apostle paul nevertheless informs us of a time when he christ shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power meaning all power that in any degree is opposite or inimical in its nature to his kingdom of righteousness for he must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet   cor xv       and again in the   th verse  and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all the two last mentioned texts when collated with the preceding declarations concerning the eternity of christs kingdom would contain an irreconcilable difficulty were it not clearly demonstrable that the son of god is really included with the almighty father in the eternal being jehovah and consequently is truly god for the fact is that he is called jehovah and god in many unquestionable passages of scripture in some expressly in others by necessary implication several examples of which are already cited in this tract and no inference to the contrary can be justly drawn from any of the texts which my learned friend before mentioned has laid before me as proofs of an opposite sentiment  most of these indeed are such as relate to the son merely in his mediatorial office as messiah or the anointed of jehovah  as psalm ii   the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the lord and against his anointed psalm ii   and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said lord thou art god which have made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant david have said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the lord and against his christ acts iv          but unto the son he says thy throne o god is for ever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom thou have loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god even thy god has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows heb i     the lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool psalm cx   for he must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet   cor xv    that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him etc which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places ephesians i    0 has in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he has appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds heb i     compared with acts iv          also heb i      psalm cx     cor xv    which is the particular text now under consideration ephesians i    0 and heb i   and others relate particularly to christs ministry whilst he dwelt personally as a man upon earth  as isai xi   and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord isai xi   the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord has anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the broken hearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn lxi     the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the broken hearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised luke iv    lxi     compared with luke iv     these prove indeed that he is inferior to the father as touching his manhood and all of them demonstrate his subordination to the almighty father in the ministry and gracious offices which he had undertaken for the restoration of mankind but none of them afford the least shadow of contradiction to the texts wherein his divine nature is declared one particular text however remains to be mentioned which at first sight seems to militate against my general argument  viz psalm lxxxiii     that men may know that thou i e god mentioned in the  st and   th verses whose name alone is jehovah art the most high over all the earth  now it is strictly true indeed though i do not think it the proper translation of this text see pages          that god alone is jehovah because jehovah alone is god for who is god but jehovah psa xviii     and the scriptures assure us that there is but one jehovah deuteronomy vi   or one only wise god romans xvi      timothy i    and therefore when the son of god is called jehovah or god he is not so named as being distinct or separate with respect to that one eternal being jehovah or god but as being included in that divine nature or god whose name alone is jehovah and as being one with the almighty father which was declared by the son himself  i and the father  we are one john x  0 i am in the father and the father in me john xiv    xvii    and x    and therefore though the son shall deliver up the kingdom to god even the father  and shall also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all as declared in the texts cited above from   cor xv        yet as the son is in the father and the father in him and as all things that the father has are the sons john xvi    and as he must of course be glorified with the glory which he had with the father himself before the world was john xvii   it is manifest that he will still reign in and with the almighty father in that eternal being of god which will then be all in all  in the above mentioned text of st paul it is said that he christ must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet and that the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death   cor xv       this opens to us the time that christ will deliver up the kingdom death that last enemy will be effectually destroyed when all men that are redeemed by christ are risen from death the world itself where alone death reigned and all that is desirable in it will then not only be burned up   pet iii  0 but will be made the seat of eternal horror and everlasting fire see notes in pages   0 and     and the irrevocable decrees of the son of man in his final judgment upon men and angels will by that time have taken place here then is an end of the whole christian dispensation what need can there be of a redeemer a mediator or of a judge after the fate of all mankind is determined  it is no lessening therefore of the sons dignity that he then delivers up the several charges which he had undertaken in obedience to his fathers will when the same shall have been completely executed and fulfilled  the generality of commentators agree that it is christs mediatorial kingdom which will then be delivered up but they should also have mentioned that sovereignty which is still of higher degree that glorious sovereign authority which is of unspeakable dignity i mean that of sitting as supreme judge of the universe an authority of which even the almighty father has divested himself  for the father judges no man but has committed all judgment unto the son and the supreme dignity of the trust is fully declared by the reason of its being given that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father john v       nay not only men but angels must honor him for the word all  includes angels as well as men and we read expressly that angels are required to worship him and again when he brings in the first begotten into the world he says says the apostle to the hebrews and let all the angels of god worship him heb i   compare with the greek version of psalm xcvii      which would be gross idolatry if christ was not truly god and one with the father in the eternal being jehovah and when the important trust shall have been fulfilled and completely executed that divine authority and jurisdiction as supreme judge which had been committed only to one of the divine persons shall be delivered up together with all other offices of distinct or separate authority that god may be all in all and in god undoubtedly the son of god shall reign over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom there shall be no end  agreeable to the angels prophecy luke i     the scriptures indeed are every where filled with clear testimonies concerning the divinity of our blessed redeemer so that the command to honor him even as we honor the father is perfectly consistent with all the rest and therefore unless we honor the son with supreme honor even as we honor the father we fall short of the command and for want of due faith cannot expect to obtain of the father that glorious and heavenly gift for the necessary improvement of human nature which our redeemer has promised to them that ask in his name even the spirit of truth john xv    which will guide us into all truth john xvi     the supreme or equal divine nature of the holy spirit is not less clearly declared in several parts of scripture than the divine nature of the son of god notwithstanding that some other parts of scripture express a manifest subordination of office as that he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he  shall hear that shall he speak john xvi    upon this augustine has remarked that audire illi scire est scire vero esse ab illo a quo precedit illi est essentia scientia et audientia semper audit spiritus sanctus quia semper scit tract    but the true sense of this hearing and speaking of the holy ghost will be best understood by comparing the text with another passage of scripture wherein gods revelation by his spirit is further explained st paul speaking of the things which god has prepared for them that love him intimates that  god has revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit says he searches all things yea the deep things of god for what man continues the apostle knows the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so  so also the things of god knows no man but the spirit of god   cor ii  0    thus by comparing spiritual things with spiritual agreeable to the apostles advice in the next verse but one ver    we learn how to understand what is said of the holy ghosts hearing what he shall speak for the manner of his knowing or being acquainted with the things of god we find is plainly compared to the knowledge of the soul in a man respecting the things of a man and surely a stronger declaration of supreme and infinite knowledge could not have been made he therefore that searches the deep things of god speaks not of himself because he speaks the things of god and of course the things of christ because all things that the father has said christ are mine therefore said i continues our lord that he i e the spirit shall take of mine and shall show it unto you john xvi       and that he is sent or given by the father our lord said to his disciples  i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever even the spirit of truth etc john xiv        but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things etc chapter xiv       and also by the son  it is expedient for you said our lord to his disciples that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you john xvi   compare this with chapter xv     when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceeds  proceeds out from the father he shall testify of me this text affords an ample proof of the divine nature of the holy spirit and shows that he is not like other spirits a created spirit but on the contrary proceeded out from the father as grotius remarks  non creatus aliquis spiritus sed qui de patris ipsius substantia procedit et ab ipso emanat  ut athenagoras loquitur the divine word in like manner proceeded out from the father as i have already remarked see p        and again that he is declared to be the spirit of christ of which salvation  meaning the salvation of souls mentioned in the preceding verse the prophets have enquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glory that should follow   pet i  0    from hence it is manifest that this spirit of christ is the same identical spirit of god  the spirit of jehovah which spoke beforehand the sufferings of christ by the prophets in old time so that the spirit of god is unquestionably the spirit also of christ agreeably to what our lord himself declared all things that the father has are mine see page  0  and therefore the almighty operations of the holy spirit manifested the glory of the son as well as the glory of the father  he said our lord speaking of the spirit of truth shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father has are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and show it unto you john xvi       compare this with john xvii  0  and all mine are thine said christ to his heavenly father and thine are mine and i am glorified in them    as well as the spirit of god  yet i say notwithstanding these expressions of subordination the supreme or equal divine nature of the holy spirit is clearly revealed in several parts of scripture the prophet isaiah for instance has declared the divine omnipotence of the spirit in the strongest terms  in terms which prove that the spirit of god is a free and independent spirit and is truly god of the same supreme divine nature or eternal being with the other two divine persons for this prophet expressly applies to the spirit of god the same supreme attributes of creation and almighty power which in other parts of scripture are occasionally attributed to the other two divine persons  but hear the words of the prophet himself dictated by that same spirit  who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and meted out heaven with the span and comprehended the dust in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance who has directed the spirit of the lord or rather the spirit of jehovah  for thus exactly is the spirit of the lord commonly expressed in the old testament when mention is made of his inspiration or coming down upon the prophets or who being his counselor has taught him with whom took he counsel and who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and showed to him the way of understanding thus the prophet clearly insists on the independency of the free where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty   cor iii     take not thy holy spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit psa li         spirit of the lord  behold the nations are as as a drop of a bucket and are counted as the small dust of the balance behold he takes up the isles as a very little thing and libanon is not sufficient to burn nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burntoffering all nations before him are as nothing and they are counted to him less than nothing and vanity isaiah xl        the prophet afterward proceeds to speak of god  without further distinction of persons having already in the preceding part of the chapter clearly distinguished the person of the son of god under the title of jehovah and our god whose advent was to be proclaimed by the voice in the wilderness and of whom sion and jerusalem were directed to say unto the cities of judah behold your god see p          and having also expressly distinguished the spirit of jehovah and proclaimed his divine attributes and supreme dignity see ver        last cited he now proceeds to speak of god in the   th verse without further distinction of persons to whom then continues he will ye liken god or what likeness will ye compare unto him ver    etc  the spiritual nature of god is surely so far above our finite comprehension that it cannot be explained or expressed by any likeness or comparison whatsoever  but yet as we may clearly perceive and understand by what is revealed to us that the supreme attributes of creation and almighty power are applied expressly to the holy spirit as in the above cited text of isaiah which in other parts of scripture are equally attributed to the father and the son we may reasonably conclude that the supreme dignity of the holy spirit must necessarily consist in his entire union and equality with the father and with the son in the divine nature or godhead see note in p     and note     in p      that one eternal and glorious being jehovah which is and which was and which is to come the almighty rev i   see also p      this entire union of the holy spirit with the almighty father and the son in the one eternal being of god is a necessary doctrine without which the almighty power attributed in the scriptures to the holy spirit cannot be reconciled to that other indispensable article of our faith the unity of god  in the book of job chapter xxxiii   the spirit is declared to be the creator the spirit of god the words here rendered the spirit of god are  which are both noun substantives and therefore ought not to be construed  the divine spirit as in the greek version  etc but the spirit of god as it is rendered in the chaldee paraphrase or targum  and also in the syriac version  for in both these the article of the genitive case is added to the second substantive to mark the sense of the hebrew in such cases though that most ancient language has no article to express the genitive case   has made me and the breath a term synonymous to spirit of the almighty has given me life in the account also which moses has given us of the creation we read that the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters genesis i   and the psalmist attributes the creation to the spirit jointly with the divine word  by the word of jehovah were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath or spirit or spirit  for the word here rendered breath is  i e the very same hebrew noun by which the spirit is most commonly expressed in holy scripture   of his mouth psalm xxxiii   and afterward when the divine word was made flesh and dwelt among us he himself expressly attributed to the spirit of god attributed to the spirit of god  our lord said to the jews  if i cast out devils by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god is come unto you matthew xii      those mighty works to which he appealed for the truth of his doctrine concerning his unity with the almighty father see p     and which at another time he expressly calls the works of his father if i do not the works of my father believe me not john x    so that without the doctrine of the unity of the divine nature this application of the same attributes to different persons could not be understood  st paul also attributed to the power of the spirit of god i have therefore whereof i may glory through jesus christ in those things which pertain unto god for i will not dare to speak of any of those things which christ has not wrought by me to make the gentiles obedient by word and deed through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of god so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum i have fully preached the gospel of christ romans xv        the miracles which he wrought through jesus christ in preaching his gospel to the gentiles nay even the miraculous conception of the blessed virgin from whence the holy child jesus was called the son of god is expressly attributed to the holy ghost by st matthew  she was found with child of the holy ghost i    for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost i  0 compare this with luke i     the holy ghost shall come upon thee etc  the glorious title   the power of the highest which immediately follows these words concerning the holy ghost in the last mentioned text is by several learned commentators attributed also to him viz the holy spirit  et virtus altissimi i e spiritus dei qui virtus dei luc xxiv    efficacissimus lucas brugensis as quoted in poles synopsis and grotius on the   th verse of this chapter says  quoties  nominatur spiritu nominato vis quaedam spiritus solita major indicatur ut infra    meaning the   th verse the text in question actor x      cor ii     thessalonians i      and a title nearly similar is certainly attributed to the same spirit even by our lord himself when he foretold the fulfilling of gods promise in the gift of the holy ghost  and behold said he i send the promise of my father compare with john xiv        upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high luke xxiv     similar titles are also given to the son of god for even in his ministerial character as messiah or christ after he had taken human nature upon him he is called the power of god and the wisdom of god   cor i    surely these are attributes of the divine nature and titles of supreme dignity  the power of justification must certainly be also accounted a divine attribute and as such can belong to none but god for it is god that justifies romans viii    but yet both justification and sanctification also another divine attribute are expressly attributed to the holy spirit jointly with christ  but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by  or in the spirit of our god   cor vi     to give life also is not less apparently an attribute of the divine nature than creation whether we speak of mere animal life or the spiritual or eternal life but more especially the latter and yet this almighty power is attributed both to the son and to the holy spirit for though it is god who quickens the dead romans iv    and who quickens all things   timothy vi    yet the son also is called a quickening spirit   cor xv    and quickens whom he will  john v    and by the same authority we know likewise that it is the spirit that quickens john vi    in consequence of this almighty power the son is called the prince or author of life and killed the prince or author of life  whom god has raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses acts iii    see also a note in p        and the spirit is expressly entitled  the spirit of life there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death romans viii       and after three days and an half the spirit of life from god entered into them and they stood upon their feet etc rev xi        add to this that the spirit is expressly entitled the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might and the spirit of jehovah shall rest upon him viz upon the branch from the stem of jesse the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the lord etc isai xi    the spirit of holiliness and declared to be the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead romans i    and the spirit of glory  for the spirit of glory and of god rests upon you   pet iv     these expressions of dignity and power are unlimited and do certainly include the highest or supreme degree of the several recited attributes even the infinite wisdom understanding counsel etc of god because they are attributed to that glorious spirit which searches all things yea the deep things of god   cor ii  0 and they are attributed to him also as essential properties which are so eminently his that he is even named from them  the spirit of wisdom  the spirit of might  the spirit of glory as christ is also entitled  the power of god and the wisdom of god see p     and the lord of glory see pages          these titles and attributes cannot in that eminent and essential degree in which they are attributed both to the son and holy spirit belong to any being that is not truly god and jehovah and it is clearly revealed to us that there is but one jehovah hear o israel the lord or jehovah our god is one jehovah deuteronomy vi   as i have before remarked in pages          who is the only true god the god of israel when god delivered the law to his people israel he said  i am jehovah thy god which have brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage thou shall have no other gods before me exodus xx      and yet we learn by the scriptures not only that christ is truly god and jehovah of which i have already produced many authentic proofs from scripture in pages          but that the holy ghost is also jehovah and consequently is included likewise in the unity   of the deity or godhead this is a scriptural expression for the nature of god for we read in col ii   that in him i e in christ dwells all the fullness of the godhead  of the deity or divine nature bodily nearly the same word but in the nominative case viz  is also used in romans i  0 another expression for the divine nature or deity we read in acts xvii    viz  that there is but one divine nature is a necessary doctrine because there is but one god and though it is difficult for our finite understandings to comprehend how three divine persons are included in that one god yet these scriptural expressions for the divine nature  and  afford great relief to our conceptions of that necessary doctrine for there is no difficulty in comprehending that three divine persons may be united in one divine nature  or  and hence also it is a necessary doctrine that the son and not less the spirit likewise is equal to the father as touching the godhead though inferior and subordinate in some other respects because it would be absurd to contend for the unity of the divine nature if the least degree of inequality respecting that nature or existence be admitted see pages            of the deity or godhead  the holy ghost is jehovah because it is he who limiteth a certain day saying in david today after so long a time see st pauls commentary on the   th psalm as it is said today if ye will hear his voice the holy ghost refers them to the voice of another person who appears by the apostles argument to be the messiah harden not your hearts heb iv   in the preceding chapter the apostle tells us expressly that it was the holy ghost who said these words  wherefore says he as the holy ghost says  today if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me says the holy ghost proved me and saw my works forty years but in the several accounts which moses has given us of these glorious works and transactions we find them mentioned as the works of jehovah and by st paul they seem to be attributed to christ for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ   cor x   and again in the  th verse  neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents    and therefore if the holy ghost was a mere ministering spirit employed only as an agent in jehovahs works with jehovahs power and was not also truly jehovah himself he the spirit of truth could not have called them his works wherefore i was grieved continues the holy ghost still speaking in david with that generation and said they do always err in their heart and they have not known my ways so i swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest heb iii       surely these are expressions of supreme authority which could not be used by any spirit that was not truly jehovah  again in the  0th chapter of the same epistle   th verse we read   etc  the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the covenant that i will make with them etc the text to which the apostle apparently refers us is in jeremiah xxxi    where we find that it was jehovah who said these words by the prophet  see also the two verses preceding  behold the days come says jehovah that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel etc jer xxxi    and afterward in the   d verse the text quoted by st paul as words said by the holy ghost the prophet adds in the name of jehovah  but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days says jehovah i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their god and they shall be my people this text is expressly attributed to the holy ghost by the apostle and the next verse is joined by the copulative  and as the words of the same divine speaker  and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know jehovah for they shall all know me saith the holy ghost this being a regular continuance as i before remarked of the words attributed to him by the apostle from the least of them unto the greatest of them says jehovah for i will forgive their iniquity and none but god can forgive sins see a note in p     marked  and i will remember their sin no more jer xxxi        this promise is apparently to the same effect as that which jehovah had before proclaimed by his prophet isaiah viz  and all thy children shall be taught of jehovah isai live    to these texts therefore our lord probably referred when he said to the jews  it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that has heard and has learned of the father comes unto me john vi    thus the being taught of god is manifestly esteemed by our lord to be the same thing as hearing and learning of the father for he mentions these circumstances apparently to illustrate what he had before said in the preceding verse concerning the fathers drawing the true believers  no man said our lord can come unto me unless the father which has sent me draw him john vi    so that christs reference to what was written in the prophets on this subject especially as he applies these prophecies to the drawing and teaching of the father seems at first sight to make against my argument which was to show that the prophecies here cited were the words of the holy ghost speaking in the prophets under the title of jehovah but this is so far from being a real objection that it is truly a confirmation of the former argument concerning the speaking of the holy ghost when we consider that the drawing of the father and the teaching of god is effected only by the spirit of god for the same apostle john who recorded our lords reference to the prophets last cited tells us in his first general epistle ii  0 how this teaching of god is communicated   and ye have an unction from the holy one from the holy one  that is  says dr whitby from jesus christ emphatically so called acts iii    apoc iii   but then that unction says he is the holy spirit which he has given to them that believe for he being anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows psa xlv   anointed by god with the holy ghost acts x    this grace says the dr is given to christians according to the measure of the gift of christ ephesians iv   and we all beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same likeness as by the spirit of the lord   cor iii    vol   p        and ye know all things   john ii  0 this unction or anointing is generally understood by commentators to signify the influence of the holy spirit by the unction here and the anointing ver    is meant the holy spirit whose gifts and graces are diffused throughout the whole church and to every living member thereof rev francis fox m a see his new test with references printed in      p      thereby are signified the gifts of the holy ghost bestowed on believers whereby they are consecrated to god psa xlv   heb i   assemblys annotations in novo testamento ubi omnes sunt reges et sacerdotes per unguentum intelligitur que vis dei gratia ut diximus hebr i   et iac v    eximie vero illa per quam spiritus nobis in singulis circumstantiis suggerit et christi praecepta et monita quae cuique tempori sunt idonea joh xiv    grotius see also the opinion of dr whitby in the preceding note but the scriptures themselves teach us plainly that the inspiration of the holy spirit is to be understood by the unction or anointing  the spirit of the lord jehovah is upon me because jehovah has anointed me etc isaiah lxi   compare with acts x     how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy spirit and with power see also note in p        and the effect of that influence is further explained in the   th verse of the same chapter  but the anointing which ye have received of him abides in you and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it has taught you ye shall abide in him   john ii    and it is manifest that this anointing which teaches all things is to be understood of the holy spirit for the apostle paul informs us that the communication of this knowledge or teaching from god is by the holy spirit  eye says he has not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for them that love him but god has revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of god for what man knows the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knows no man but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god or rather the spirit out of god  that is which proceeds forth  see john xv    out of god see note     in p     that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god whereby it is manifest that we obtain this knowledge of the things of god by the holy spirit which things also we speak not in the words which mans wisdom teaches but which the holy ghost teaches this teaching of the holy ghost is also fully declared by our lords promise of that heavenly gift to his disciples  but the comforter which is the holy ghost says our lord whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things etc john xiv    and again when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth etc john xvi       comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural  or animal man receives not the things of the spirit of god how urgent and importunate ought we therefore to be in claiming on all occasions the gracious promises of spiritual assistance see p  00   0  as the nature of man is declared to be thus miserably deficient without that heavenly gift the neglect of which is the first foundation of infidelity and scepticism for they are foolishness unto him even the things of infinite wisdom for such must be the things of the spirit of god are foolishness to the mere natural man neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judges all things etc   cor ii        the glorious effect of christs promises upon those who duly claim them is principally as i have before remarked see p       0  that we shall partake of the divine nature but how can that effect take place if the spirit of god and of christ but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ be in you i e in you by his spirit mentioned in the preceding sentence the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal mortal bodies by his spirit that dwells in you romans viii       here we find the spirit of god and the spirit of christ distinctly mentioned in the same context though the spiritual effects of both are undoubtedly the same because both these titles belong to one and the same holy spirit as st paul elsewhere declares  for through him says the apostle speaking of the reconciliation or uniting of the gentiles and the commonwealth of israel through christ we both i e jews and gentiles have access by one spirit unto the father ephesians ii    this one spirit therefore must necessarily be understood not only when the spirit of god is mentioned but also whenever we read of  the spirit of the son because ye are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts gal iv     the spirit of jesus i know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of jesus christ phil i     or the spirit of christ see note in p     for as christians are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit ephesians ii    so likewise it must be through the same spirit that they become an habitation of christ  if christ be in you etc because the same text informs us that  if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his    see page     the spirit of the father and of the son by which alone we can have communication with either compare the preceding note in page     with the note in p      see also page      is not really divine we are taught by a multitude of texts throughout the new testament that man by nature is capable of receiving the holy spirit within him so that the human body is expressly called in scripture the temple of the holy ghost what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own   cor vi     and therefore if the holy ghost were not really and truly god of the same divine nature with the father for there can be but one divine nature as there is but one god which i hope is already clearly demonstrated see pages          how improper would be the idea of comparing man to a temple for christians are not only called the temple of god   cor vi     and what agreement says the apostle paul has the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them and will be their god and they shall be my people and this indwelling or inhabitation of god in the faithful is declared in scripture to be through the spirit which affords an ample proof that the spirit is truly god in whom says st paul to the ephesians ii    speaking of jesus christ ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit thus the true christian does really become a temple of god for where god dwells is a temple as grotius remarks templum est ubi deus habitat in piis habitat deus per spiritum sanctum sunt igitur templum dei grot annot tom iv p      and god dwells is good men by his holy spirit  therefore says he are they the temple of god this inhabitation or indwelling of the holy spirit in the temple of god is plainly declared by the apostle paul in another text  know ye not says he that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwells in you if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy is holy   being sanctified by the holy ghost romans xv     which temple ye are   cor iii          but expressly as i have already remarked the temple of the holy ghost as if the terms were synonymous  too many temples indeed through the depravity of mankind and the influence of devils have been dedicated to those  which by nature are no gods but that was only amongst men  who knew not god gal iv   but shall we conceive of the inspired writers of the new testament that they would also dedicate temples to a being which by nature is no god for if we could suppose it true that the holy spirit by nature is no god the temple of the holy ghost would be no better in that one respect than heathen temples and therefore if we really believe the holy scriptures to be the word of god we must necessarily believe that the holy ghost is really and truly god for otherwise we should not have been required by the holy scriptures to esteem our bodies as the temple of the holy ghost and as it thus appears to be a necessary conclusion that the holy ghost is truly god it is equally a necessary doctrine that he is also jehovah   for who is god i e truly god  except jehovah compare this with ps lxxxvi  0  thou art god alone that is thou jehovah art god alone for the whole psalm is a prayer addressed to jehovah   bow down thine ear o jehovah etc  see also isaiah xxxvii    and compare thse texts with the note in p     concerning those persons whose title of gods was merely nominal   psa xviii    and therefore though the holy ghost is clearly revealed to us in scripture as a distinct person from the father and the son he must nevertheless be included in that one divine and eternal being jehovah and accordingly in that supreme character he revealed the divine will to the prophets of this i have already produced some remarkable and i trust incontrovertible proofs and therefore shall only request my readers attention to one more example of it well spoke the holy ghost said the apostle paul to the unbelieving jews at rome by isaias the prophet unto our fathers saying go unto this people and say hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and not perceive for the heart of this people is waxed gross etc acts xxviii    but when we turn to that part of isaiahs prophecy to which the apostle refers us as the saying of the holy ghost we find it was jehovah which spoke to the prophet  i heard says the prophet the voice of the lord adonai saying whom shall i send and who will go for us speaking expressly in a plurality of persons then said i here am i send me and he said go and tell this people hear ye indeed or in hearing but understand not and see ye indeed or in seeing but perceive not make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed see some observations on this passage in my tract on several important prophecies  d edit pages         and             then said i lord or adoni how long and he answered until the cities be wasted without inhabitant and the houses without man and the land be utterly desolate etc isai vi        now the lord or adoni who then spoke to isaiah was represented to the prophet see the beginning of the chapter as sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple etc and one cried unto another that is the seraphims mentioned in the preceding verse holy holy holy is jehovah of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory etc ibid       now notwithstanding that the lord jehovah is represented in this divine revelation as speaking in the plural number who will go for us and that the threefold repetition of the epithet holy in the proclamation of gods glorious title jehovah of hosts seems to correspond with the abovementioned idea of a plurality of persons being comprehended in that one eternal being jehovah which then revealed himself to isaiah yet the apostle paul expressly attributed the revelation to the holy ghost as being the divine person which then spoke well spoke the holy ghost says he by isaias the prophet saying go unto this people and say hearing ye shall hear etc who then shall presume to say that the holy ghost is not really and truly god when it is apparent by the citations already made that the glorious name jehovah which includes the divine nature of the father and of the son is expressly attributed also to the holy ghost  without a due sense of this supreme dignity of the holy spirit we should form but a very unworthy idea of the real dignity of human nature which as i have already shown is not only capable of receiving the gift or internal communication of that glorious and eternal free spirit see note in p   0 of god as a principle of action but is absolutely entitled even to claim that wonderful participation of the divine nature to claim it i say by a written charter of privileges which can never be taken from us as gods word cannot fail he having bound himself to us on certain reciprocal conditions by an irrevocable covenant as sure as his word that man might be free indeed we are free i say having now a free choice through christ to partake if we will if we will for notwithstanding all that has been said and wrote concerning predestination and reprobation yet it must surely be our own fault a depravity in our own choice or will if we partake not of the tree of life  no man indeed can come to me said that divine person who alone is the way and the truth and the life john xiv   except the father which has sent me draw him and i said he will raise him up at the last day john vi    but though this drawing depends on the will of the father yet no just argument arises from thence against the free will of man because we have ample assurance on the part of the almighty that his good will to draw us will not be wanting if we seek him as we ought and do not resist his divine grace in our hearts of this good will his affectionate remonstrances from time to time by his prophets bear unquestionable testimony  why will ye die o house of israel for i have no pleasure in the death of him that dies says the lord jehovah wherefore turn yourselves  in hiphil cause ye to turn i e the repentance must be by your own will and deed and live ye ezekiel xviii       and again god swears by himself that we may have full assurance of his will in our favor if our own will is not wanting  say unto them as i live says the lord jehovah i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will ye die o house of israel ezekiel xxxiii     these texts indeed are assurances of gods love to the house of israel but in christ even the gentiles are entitled to claim them being now engrafted on the stock of israel see p     and are thereby rendered abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise gal iii    and under the new covenant also god has confirmed these assurances of favor on his part if we are not wanting to ourselves promising us that we shall receive if we will but ask see note in p      for the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance   pet iii   from hence it follows that if any perish it is not by gods will though he certainly foreknows their destruction but by their own wilful abuse of the knowledge of good and evil for we are assured also by another apostle that god will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth   timothy ii   the word all says the learned mr francis fox on this text here stands for every man for so it is used ver   where we are commanded to pray for all men hence says he we may argue that if god wills the salvation of all men and would have all come to the acknowledgment of the truth then he affords all sufficient means and grace in order to their obtaining salvation because without this they cannot be saved see john vi    quoted in the beginning of this note if any therefore perish it is not because god denies them grace and help but because they are wanting to themselves and will not be prevailed with to use the assistance he affords their destruction therefore is not from any peremptory decree of gods but from themselves new testament with references p     note    of the tree of life see note in p   0 from which our first parents were unhappily excluded in this world  but these glorious privileges being granted to human nature only through the merits of that son of man who voluntarily took our nature upon him we must always remember that our title to the benefits of the free covenant beforementioned is valid only when claimed in his name and for his sake as we ourselves are otherwise totally unworthy of them for he alone is the way and the truth and the life and no man comes unto the father but by him john xiv    he has therefore particularly instructed us how to claim the privileges of human nature assuring us by reiterated and i say unto you said our lord jesus ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for our lord had just before given a parable of a mans going to his friends house even at midnight and knocking at the door to borrow bread for every one that asks receives and he that seeks finds and to him that knocks it shall be opened if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him luke xi        and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name said our lord jesus  that will i do an ample proof as i before remarked of his being truly god in effect and power as well as in name and that he and the father are one as he himself not only said but proved by his works so that we must necessarily understand as there is but one god jehovah that he is included with the father in the one eternal being jehovah that the father may be glorifed in the son if ye shall ask any thing in my name our lord jesus again repeated and enforced his gracious promise i will do it if ye love me said he keep my commandments and who has a right to command but god  our lord nevertheless immediately afterward declares the ministerial office which he had condescended to undertake for our sake as mediator between god and man himself being both and i said he will pray the father and he sll give you another comforter or advocate see abp sharps sermons   vol disc  d that he may abide with you for ever even the spirit of truth here the three divine persons are distinctly mentioned together in their separate personal functions under the christian dispensation whom i e the spirit of truth the world cannot receive because it sees him not neither knows him but ye know him and of course all other true disciples of christ know him as the promises are to all and cannot fail for he dwells with you and shall be in you john xiv        again i say unto you said our lord jesus that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name i e in the name of jesus there am i in the midst of them matt xviii     0  these and many more such declarations of christ are the reiterated promises mentioned above on which the restored dignity and privileges of human nature are firmly founded and may be effectually secured if the future building be raised thereupon with the plumb line of integrity and be afterward maintained with perseverance to the end of life he is faithful that promised heb x    wherefore be strong and of a good courage fear not nor be afraid for the lord jehovah thy god he it is that does go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee deuteronomy xxxi     promises tendered in the most urgent and affectionate manner that prayers in his name shall certainly be effectual that is provided there be no wilful defect on our part which conditional clause is always to be understood wherever promises of blessings are delivered in holy scripture  let us therefore be mindful that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us romans viii     that is toward us or respecting ourselves referring probably to that eternal weight of glory with which human nature is capable of being invested after the sufferings of this present time as signified by the same apostle in a parallel passage of another epistle  for our light affliction said the apostle which is but for a moment i e comparatively speaking works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory   cor iv    this further revelation of gods will variously expressed in the new testament when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory mortify therefore your members etc col iii   for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the savior the lord jesus christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself ph iii  0    beloved now are we the sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that has this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure   john iii     but some man will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain but god gives it a body as it has pleased him and to every seed his own body all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of birds etc  so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural  or  animal body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural or animal body and there is a spiritual body and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit etc  and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly  i e of the lord jehovah from heaven mentioned in the   th verse see also pages                0  now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither does corruption inherit incorruption by this latter part of the sentence i e neither does corruption haberit incorruption the apostle explains what he meant by the flesh and blood which cannot inherit etc ita explicat as grotius justly remarks quid intelligi voluerit per  et  it is manifest from the whole context that the apostle by flesh and blood in this text meant only corruptible and perishable flesh and blood for it is not the substance or solidity of flesh and blood which cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven but only the corruptibility or dissoluble and corrupt quality of it as another learned commentator slater has remarked  non intelligit corporis substantiam sic enim resurget job xix       sed qualitatem corruptam pol synop vol v page      we have incontestable evidence by the resurrection and ascension of our lord that the real human substances of flesh and bones of which his revived body consisted can and does inherit the kingdom of heaven  our lord was particularly careful to convince his disciples of this truth after his resurrection saying  behold my hands and my feet that it is i myself  thus insisting upon the identity of his own person handle me and see thus urging his disciples to receive undeniable conviction by all their senses for a spirit says he has not flesh and bones as ye see we have and when he had thus spoken he showed them his hands and his feet luke xxiv     0 now this was not to convince them merely that the hands and feet which he then showed were flesh and bones but that they were also to undeniable demonstration the same identical flesh and bones that had been publicly nailed to the cross for our lord showed them likewise his side john xx  0 undoubtedly that same wounded side which had been pierced with a lance for it was manifestly on account of the wounds which he had received in his flesh that he now pointed out as unquestionable evidences of his identical body those particular parts thereof his hands feet and side in which the principal wounds had been made agreeable to the predictions of the prophets ps xxii    zech xii  0 and xiii     and at the same time he submitted himself to the most critical examination of those select persons whom he had chosen for witnesses  it is i myself says he handle me and see etc that our lord appealed to the evidence of real wounds in his flesh is further demonstrated by the declaration of the apostle thomas when he had heard the account of our lords appearance from the other disciples for thomas answered them saying  except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe and accordingly this palpable and unquestionable demonstration was graciously allowed him even in the presence of the former witnesses for  after eight days again the disciples were within and thomas with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you then says he to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing john xx        and after our lord had at several other times   cor xv      visited instructed and confirmed his disciples concerning the truth and reality of his resurrection and other necessary doctrines he at length ascended from among them toward heaven even while their whole attention was fixed upon him  while they beheld says the text he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly  toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven acts i       thus we have incontestible evidence concerning the identical substance of our lords revived body flesh and bones and therefore with certainty we know that the human body consisting of solid and palpable substances of flesh and bones is capable of inheriting the kingdom of heaven and consequently we must understand that the flesh and blood mentioned by the apostle which cannot inherit etc must necessarily mean corrupt and mortal flesh and blood before it has undergone the promised change to incorruption and immortality as explained above for our lords body it is manifest if all these circumstances are considered could not possibly have undergone any other change than that of being raised incorruptible whereas before it was corruptible or liable to injuries and mortal or it could not have suffered and died and in like manner all the rest of the  dead shall be raised incorruptible as the resurrection of christ is the pledge of our hope he being declared the first fruits of them that slept   cor xv  0 i shall not apologize to my readers for the length of this note because the subject of it very materially concerns the nature of man and all mankind are personally interested in the assurances we have that even the body as well as the soul shall one day be raised to immortality and eternal duration nevertheless i confess that i should have neglected to treat upon this very material part of my subject as i conceived that the doctrine was sufficiently understood and generally received among christians had not a new pamphlet on very different principles been put into my hands at the very time when i had proceeded in transcribing the above note for the press even to the very sentence where i have placed the mark of reference so that i thought myself obliged to add these remarks upon the text in order to guard against the plausible insinuations in the said tract    behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound for the trumpets shall sound  says the apostle but the author of the new pamphlet mentioned in the preceding note boldly insinuates that it shall not sound and as this author has thought proper to conceal his name i hope i may censure his opinions with less reserve because he cannot suspect me of any personal dislike to an unknown author and must therefore consider my severity as levelled merely against his erroneous doctrines and not against himself  do you take the last trumpet says he in page    to be some instrumental sound etc  the word last says he again evidently implies a first now who is he that heard the instrumental sound of the first trumpet thus on the strength of a mere sophistical quibble he ventures to found his opposition to the clearest evidence of scripture that the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised  as if these great articles of the christian faith the resurrection of the dead and the awful summons to the judgment seat of christ could possibly be set aside by such superficial reasoning for though we may not be able to answer his question viz who is he that heard the instrumental sound of the first trumpet yet any plain honest christian who reads his bible with a proper humble disposition can easily inform him who they were even a whole nation at once that really and truly heard the actual sound of a former heavenly trumpet see the   th chapter of exodus wherein the instrumental sound is clearly expressed by two different technical hebrew names of an instrument well known among the israelites which seems to have been a kind of horn or cornet the use of such instruments is particularly recorded in joshua vi   for seven of them were sounded by the priests at the taking of jericho the sound only of one instrument bearing two different names was heard at mount sinai though it is described as being loud to a most tremendous degree being a heavenly trumpet and answerable to this the future heavenly trumpet foretold by st paul is mentioned in the singular number viz the trump of god   thessalonians iv     now as the sounding of the former trumpet was previously appointed and foretold as the awful signal to apprize the israelites of the coming of jehovah upon mount sinai and to summon them up to the mount see exodus xix    and    so the actual tremendous sounding of that former trumpet see verses    and    is an incontestible earnest or pledge to us even upon the principles of this authors own argument that we ought to expect an actual sounding also of the last trumpet because it is as clearly appointed to be the awful signal of the future coming and appearance of the messiah to judge the world as the former trumpet was of the descent of jehovah upon mount sinai so that the ingenious hypothesis of this author about the soundless summons of the last trumpet falls at once to the ground  there is such ample evidence god be thanked of outward transactions throughout the whole account which moses has given of gods coming down upon mount sinai or horeb which is only a different part of the same mountain that the literal sense of his relation cannot without the most glaring perversion be enveloped and darkened by the delusive mist of figurative sophistry and the same indeed may be said of what is revealed to us in the scriptures concerning the future coming and appearance of the messiah to judge the world but this author nevertheless presuming upon the supposed force of his insidious quibble about the last trumpet ventures openly to profess his disbelief of the actual future judgment of the world by christ and boldly asserts that there will be no such process hereafter the judgment seat says he is in every mans heart and it is there and there only that man can or ever will feel acquittance or condemnation etc note in p    and this unscriptural doctrine he has attempted in a preceding part of his book to illustrate by an example drawn even from scripture itself when paul stood before felix says he in p  0 felix stood before the judgment seat of christ else what made him tremble what but the secret condemnation he felt in his breast but give me leave for a moment to treat this author in his own evasive style by answering question with questions though i by no means wish to avoid giving him a direct answer to his trembling system  would not felix have had much less cause to tremble if with the spirit of our modern author he had conceived that there would never be any other condemnation than that which he felt within himself and again  did not felix tremble whilst or as the apostle reasoned  a genitive case taken absolutely as the grammarians say i e to mark the precise interval of any action or corresponding circumstance as that it happened during the very time that the apostle reasoned of righteousness temperance and the judgment to come expressly  or the future judgment so that the apostle could not possibly mean the present internal condemnation which at that very interval of time caused felix to tremble acts xxiv    but this author not only denies the future judgment of christ but also it seems the future resurrection of the dead he feels speaking in p    of a man that has the witness within himself  that he is risen with christ and so experiences with st paul the power of his resurrection and being made a partaker of the first resurrection flesh and blood then convinces him what it is etc now as he thus asserts that he is made a partaker of the first resurrection and that there will be no process hereafter nor judgment of christ besides that which as he conceives is in every mans heart it necessarily follows that with respect to himself and such other truly awakened such this author must suppose the resurrection to be already past this is a leading principle which being once admitted all the other doctrines which this author has labored to inculcate must necessarily follow as concomitant circumstances the perusal of his book therefore enables us to form a very probable idea of the particular doctrines held by those very ancient heretics hymeneus and philetus for though this author himself a similar spirit conceives that his doctrines are not only uncommon but nw etc and accordingly in his preface apologizes for the untrodden path yet his path is very old and so strongly marked in antiquity that the leading principle abovementioned on which almost all the rest depends was described more than   00 years ago even by st paul himself who mentioned the promoters of it expressly by name and warned us against the pernicious effects of their errors in the strongest terms  their word says the apostle will eat as does a canker of whom is hymeneus and philetus who concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection is past already and overthrow the faith of some   timothy ii          and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed that is we living men whoever we are that shall be found alive and remaining in the body at that awful period shall be changed for the apostle had before declared that we shall not all sleep that is in death but we  shall all be changed viz both dead and living shall be changed from corruptible to incorruptible beings though the manner of the change will be different in these two different states of mankind the dead will be raised incorruptible but the living shall be instantaneously rendered so in the twinkling of an eye thus the change will be made in the property or quality of our living bodies and not in the identity of them it will be an annihilation or dissolution of corruptibility and not of substance for the substance on the contrary will be rendered indissoluble and eternal even that substance which now is subject to so many fatal accidents diseases and death for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so that it is manifestly this same mortal body this earthly tabernacle in which we now live that shall hereafter put on immortality and incorruption  we that are in this tabernacle do groan says the same apostle in another place being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life   cor v   and this is further explained in the former text viz so when this corruptible says the apostle shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory o death where is thy sting etc   cor xv          concerning the sure and most certain expectation that we may entertain of being invested with eternal glory in the world to come if we persevere in the true faith and practice of christianity in this world completes our charter of privileges and immunities or the perfect law of liberty which the almighty has been pleased to tender to his creature man   who then shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded said the apostle to the romans that neither death nor life nor angels that is the angels of satan nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord romans viii         here is a noble declaration of that perfect liberty to which christ has restored mankind that glorious dignity of human nature which even the poorest and meanest persons amongst us the distressed the hungry and the naked are capable of attaining by perseverance in faith and resolution in observing and keeping on their part the conditions the conditions of our reciprocal covenant with god let us but satisfy ourselves that we perform the conditions which christ has required of mankind in order to salvation which conditions are all summed up in these two words faith and repentance and we may be as certainly assured that we belong to god and are entitled to his favor as if we saw our particular names recorded in a book among them that are appointed to salvation away therefore with all fears and doubts concerning our eternal predestination let us never be solicitous in enquiring whether god has decreed such a particular number of persons in exclusion to the rest of mankind to eternal life or if he has done so whether we be in the number of them but let us take care to secure our own duty secret things belong to the lord our god but the things that are revealed to us and to our children that we may do all the works of his law as we have it in deuteronomy let us take care to obey gods commandments let us live as well as we can and if we do so it is certain we cannot miscarry and if god has made any such eternal decrees concerning the lot of particular persons it is certain likewise that we are in the number of those that are predestined to eternal salvation provided we continue in our faith and obedience abp sharps sermon  of the fewness of those who shall be saved vol iii p       of our reciprocal covenant with god  let us therefore like the apostle approach unto the throne of grace in full assurance of faith always remembering that a sound faith must be the principal foundation of our pretensions to the promised dignity and privileges of human nature and that by perseverance in the true faith and a continual renewal of those inestimable claims from time to time while we remain in this world we may be as confident as the apostle that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord because through him god has put it absolutely in our own power whatever our temporary afflictions and sufferings may be in this life to attain an eternal weight of glory   cor iv     for which cause we faint not  though our outward man perish being fully persuaded that he who promised is able also to perform  the defects of this tract wherever the reader discovers any are certainly to be attributed to the fallible author whose name is prefixed but
