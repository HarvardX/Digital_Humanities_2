prince hoare  loves victims the hermits story part the first canto i leave hermit leave these wilds forlorn cast off this garb of woe with earliest gleam of opening morn thy guests prepare to go with earliest gleam of opening morn well spread the parting sail far hence over rolling surges born our native land to hail for though in sore distress we came to beg relief from thee yet not unknown to goodly fame we plough the dangerous sea beneath yon cliffs impending side within a secret bay our vessel proudly stems the tide our streamers lightly play then hermit kind with us return for this thy sheltering care thy former dwelling let us learn well place thee safely there this lonely strand i will never forsake never cast these weeds away my thanks for offered service take but leave me here to stay here till in death my limbs are cold a sacred vow i will keep full often over yonder swelling mould to pray to fast and weep but though my vow forbid return my native land to hail would you my former dwelling learn i will not refuse the tale a tale of grief and blushing shame my lips must then disclose yet so shall memory keep my name and pity mourn my woes a sire of noble birth i own on rosays fertile plain no care his tranquil life had known unvexd by grief or pain till heaven alas my sins ordained to wake his virtuous rage and shame unfelt before distained the silvered cheek of age with him in social union bound earl hubert long had been their youth the palm of friendship crowned and age beheld it green now straight prepare your horsemen all said the earl to go with me i have a feast in bower and hall where you must shortly be set forth set forth my sire replied set forth without delay however fleetly you shall ride well pass you on the way with me i will bring my son along to grace your bower and hall and if he fail in dance or song on me the blame shall fall the minstrels played the hall was bright the bower was fair to see and there came many a noble knight and maid of high degree but midst those maidens all so fair more fair than all was one in peerless boast of beauty rare the gentle emma shone of humble birth she early mourned a parents shortened date but heaven to joy her grief had turned and given a kinder fate the partner of earl huberts breast the helpless babe surveyed and pity soft in tears confessed bestowed its bounteous aid in ripening charms the nursling grew and youth its luster shed less fair the roses blushing hue when first its leaves are spread her eyes were as the diamond bright but shone with tempered ray like northern meteors that by night over heavens pale azure play forgive these tears that still must flow ancor men duol purchio mean rimembri dante inf  whenever the tale is told for learn the beauteous maid lies low beneath yon swelling mould canto ii when youth beats high in every vein and passion fires the mind what can the wandering thought restrain the lawless spirit bind too strong by reason to be swayed desire my torment grew for fair as dian was the maid but chaste as dian too how shall your virtuous ears endure my guilty tongue repeat what arts i used her love to lure and watchful honor cheat too well i strove the maiden loved her devious steps i led to duty lost we secret roved and banished virtue fled illomend deed the hope how vain each social tie foregone that constancy should yet remain and faith intent on one who first pollutes the tender mind and leads from truth astray never let him hope again to find the gem he casts away the fatal change thus subtly wrought i justly learnt to rue pleased with the freedom i had taught to other loves she flew five lonely months my anxious fears her flight in vain explored and often my fondlyfalling tears her fancied death deplored oh vanity that man beguiles who boasts the stronger mind in womans charms and native wiles defeat still doomed to find if happily here some listening guest have known like pains to prove let his consenting heart attest how stoops our sex to love before my gate in winters cold a trembling mourner stood a tale of piteous want she told and plaintive begged for food beneath that garb of friendless woe my emma stood confessed i clasped ere words had power to flow the wanderer to my breast i strove to chide but faintly blamed then met her ardent kiss desire again my soul inflamed and hope renewed my bliss fond pleasing dream too quickly over the false one fled again amazed i grieved but vowed no more to prize a heart so vain our angry vows love turns to jest while yet her loss i mourned again repentance touched her breast again the fair returned and while i viewed those fatal charms upon my neck she hung to earth i shook her from my arms around my knees she clung forgive the wretch she suppliant cried the wretch thy flattries made verbis capta puella tuis ovep  by pleasures voice ah faithless guide too easily betrayed with thee who taughtst me first to sin mentis prima ruina meae ovep  let me my sins atone this let repentant anguish win to live with thee alone thus over a bosom fondly soft she triumphed unrestrained often from my arms she fled and often those sheltering arms regained so flitting on the summers breeze delighted far to roam the swallow born over smiling seas awhile forgets her home but scared at sight of wintry gloom when chilling blasts arise with trembling wing and ruffled plume returns to friendlier skies at length the destined hour was near that rose to fix our fate for still on follys wild career chastising sorrows wait once when by lengthened absence tried love poured the weary tear and hope her wonted aid denied my fruitless search to cheer it chanced at morn i bent my way from harfleurs lonely towers to where its tides in havres bay the western ocean pours there as i wandered lost in thought faint notes of female cry hom od  my ear with frequent wonder caught and drew my curious eye far off advancing where i stood a convict group i spied behind the fiends of power pursued each lingering step to chide by force compelled the guilty band reluctant sought the shore whence doomed to leave a forfeit land and to return no more pitying i marked their hopeless lot and heard their clanking chains their errors in their griefs forgot their vices in their pains nor thought while flowed the ready tear for sorrows not my own my doom to share those griefs how near and mingle groan with groan as when dire phantoms of the night sleeps soft infoldment break up leaps the wretch in wild affright and doubts if yet he wake so roused at once with startling dread amid the guilty train i saw my emma captive led and partner of their pain the distant sight perhaps deceived with eager step i flew  too soon i came  nor yet believed the horrid vision true nec tantum scelus esse putabam ov ep  to heaven her eyes intent were cast and poured a crystal flood the flinty pavement as she passed was marked with streaks of blood i stood distracted and appalled then faintly breathed her name each wandering sense my voice recalled and shook her feeble frame her feeble frame no more sustains her eyes flash wildly round she shrieks  and sinking on her chains falls senseless to the ground canto iii need i relate what cares i used till sluggard life returned or number all my prayers refused or tell her ransom spurned whether by daring guilt betrayed or fate severe oppressed i shunned to ask of truth afraid  her anguish filled my breast doomed to her cheerful native land to bid a long adieu and on a rude unpitying strand declining life pursue unhappy fair whose fatal power enslaves my constant thought behold in this disastrous hour the ruin thou have wrought these tears this anguish is thine own that rends thy alberts breast but tears with thee are pleasing grown and anguish lulls to rest together on the appointed plain well count the painful years together drag the galling chain and mingle bitter tears forbear forbear the suffrer cried and raised her languid head thy hate thy vengeance i will abide  thy constancy i dread let mercy grieved at length forsake a wretch to sorrow born leave that obdurate heart to break which could deserve thy scorn the tender prayer i heard unmoved or heard with softened heart from her whom still alone i loved resolved no more to part the swelling sails forbad delay we left our native shore over the blue waves the streamers play and land is seen no more ah shade beloved what wondrous grief did then thy bosom know while the fraught heart denied relief and tears forbore to flow pale drooping over the billows foam i see thy form recline thine eyes over ocean wildly roam or deeply fix in mine that speechless woe can language paint or tell the thrilling look when sighs at length and accents faint the fearful silence broke for thee  for thee  much injured youth midst all my sins abhorred so witness for me heavenly truth my bosoms only lord for thee alone these pangs these sights  my chains no longer wound   she said when sobs convulsive rise and choke the imperfect sound well pleased in death these eyes should close so thou might feel i cried no greater pain than albert knows with emma by his side secure we brave the changing sky by hope forbid to weep love bears his lighted torch on high and guides us over the deep and see the destined land appear that land our faith shall prove alike shall either hemisphere propitious smile on love part the second canto i past was each gay each joyous hour no more we festive played in pleasures brightlysparkling bower or wealths luxurious shade but who on truths unerring beam shall earthyy blessings weigh will learn how often the worlds esteem on wealth is thrown away the source of human bliss or woe where shall enquiry find alas the wretched only know  it is lodged within the mind midst toils severe and labor rude far from our native shore in long and hopeless servitude the pains of life we bore yet emma here by sorrow taught preserved loves constant flame and emmas love was all i sought it was ease twas wealth twas fame happily one masters stern command our equal lot received and fond to aid my stronger hand her fainting toil relieved custom unchanged contentment gave we viewed our dangers past and scapd from fortunes troubled wave here found repose at last our chastend thoughts the wish inspire religions bonds to prove and turn the wandrings of desire to pure connubial love what though no whiterobd priest was near our hands no altar joined yet angels stooped our vows to hear and heaven the record signed fain would i pause and over the rest of my distressful tale could memory die within my breast for ever cast a veil but conscious duty prompts me here my sorrows to renew my trembling lips with words of fear their painful task pursue to him whose power our toils confessed on gallias fairer shore one only son in hour unblest a longlost consort bore the father watched the pleasing care through childhoods tender stage of all his treasured wealth the heir and comfort of his age now bold in manhood fierce and strong in wealth and power elate proudly he viewed the subject throng and held tyrannic state by love subdued his ardent eye he fixed on emmas charms and doomed in heedless luxury the victim to his arms his subtle arts assailed her truth those arts my emma spurned stung by her scorn the haughty youth in wild resentment burned the guilt his lawless soul desired insulting force essayed i saw with rage indignant fired and rushed to emmas aid perish presumptuous slave he cried and aimed a deadly wound my bosom owned its injured pride  i felled him to the ground the hunter meets no swifter blow who venurous points the chase where lurks the tiger lowering low and guards his infant race awhile the spirits quivering flame upon lifes confines played the fled and veiled the wretchs shame in deaths eternal shade horrid the deed but greater dread our future hours display stern vengeance hovering over my head must mark its helpless prey alternate ill alone remained to stay  twas death to fly  from every good that life contained twas with more pain to die what voice my lingering doubts reproved and bade for flight prepare thy emma ah too dearly loved thy dangerous flight shall share with thee i will range the desert wide while life shall strength supply content to suffer at thy side blessed in thy arms to die cease emma cease too fondly true thou temptst a certain doom despair must still our flight pursue and horrors endless gloom where should alas our footsteps stray we wander hence in vain famine or ruthless beasts of prey await us on the plain the ardor of that dauntless breast nor words nor prayers allay with eager look my hand she pressed and daring led the way canto ii over wilds unmarked by human tread  do nunca pie humano estampo su pisada garcilaso  we took our venurous flight yet was not hopes last ember dead though pald its fainting light if aught amid those desert plains by natures hand bestowed might temper thirsts unceasing pains or yield sustaining food perchance the safe and friendly coast our toiling steps might gain where britains sons with envied boast in british freedom reign far swelled the gale with murmuring sound and filled our hearts with dread we cast a fearful look around and trembling swifter fled now over the earth the closing night her sable veil had thrown nor yet had our disastrous flight or rest or solace known sudden my emmas bursting tears in copious torrents fell sweet love i cried these gloomy fears let brighter hope dispel no fears her faltring voice replied my constant soul invade wherever we wander by thy side i wander undismayed yet midst the shades of night secure escaped from every eye no more these feeble limbs endure  ah cease awhile to fly fainting she spoke with eager haste my hands her couch prepare but what amid that dreary waste availed a lovers care yet on the ground my garments laid her tender form enclose and mine the welcome task i said to watch over thy repose parent of mercy from thy hand the streams of comfort pour let balmy sleep at thy command her wasted strength restore great god who hearst the suppliants cry and calmst the wretchs pain why in that hour of agony were breathed my prayers in vain canto iii soft as the sleep which tired at eve the harmless infant knows so soft ah soft but to deceive appeared my loves repose with silent joy each breath i heard that gently heaved her breast and many a prayer anew preferred to bless the wholesome rest hope charmed awhile my troubled thought when starting from the ground my neck the trembling emma caught and wildly clasped me round hold hold they drag him hence away but well together die ah say my only safety say my albert art thou nigh behold thy albert ever near whence spring thy fears anew no dangerous rival threatens here no vengeful foes pursue to balmy slumber yield again thy limbs that fevrous burn tomorrows dawn shall banish pain and peace with light return now with tumultuous haste the blood coursd ardent through her veins and scarce the fiercelyfrantic mood her alberts voice restrains oh scorching fires that inward rage and ravage lifes retreat oh parching thirst thy force assuage allay thy deadly heat farewell my albert yet in death let not remembrance die thine is this last this fleeting breath and thine this parting sigh with accents such as love inspires i strove to calm her woe if aught to cool those raging fires within the desert flow my search the precious draught shall find and bring thee quick relief suspend this anguish of the mind endure awhile thy grief then forth my doubtful course i took attentive bent to hear if mid the gloom or murmuring brook or bubbling spring were near while swift i trod the yielding soil my passing feet bedewed oerjoyd i blessed the prosperous toil that every hope renewed eager i stooped with anxious care each scanty drop to drain then flew the gathered prize to bear and sooth my emmas pain perplexed i trace with fearful choice the scarcerememberd ground aloud i call  my emmas voice returns a grateful sound as joys the mother over her child if found where chance he strays while yet her bosom heaving wild the past alarm betrays so gladdend i that sound pursue again i call more nigh  her languid accents scarce renew the feebly formed reply with panting speed more swift i fly and trembling over her bend my emma taste thou shall not die heaven deigns this aid to send her lifted arms my bosom pressed and folding strove to close but sunk unconscious from my breast and deaths chill damps arose emma i cried most loved most dear thou all that i adore  no sound responsive met my ear  the conflict was no more canto iv silent in horror and dismay through the drear hours of night i watched afar the doubtful ray of slowreturning light with pangs more keen my soul to fill arose that cheerless ray appalled i viewed the mighty ill and cursed the coming day what more ensued  how robbed of sense how prostrate on the plain or how awaked  remembrance thence attempts to trace in vain high heaven to mercy still inclined beheld my abject plight and deigned upon my darkened mind to shed redeeming light as breathe the plains and smile anew amid serener day where late the furious whirlwind flew and scattered wild dismay such calm my soul perceived when first renewed by faiths pure beam while every passion fled dispersed before the brightning gleam at once each impious thought repressed that maddend in despair devotion taught my altered breast the will supreme to bear with firm resolve but fainting strength the lifeless corse i bore nor void of hope to reach at length the distant friendly shore not long my toil this close retreat with grateful wonder viewed for holy purpose refuge meet heavens pitying guidance showed midst parching plains of barren sand severely spread around this vale by natures bounteous hand with springs and woods is crowned beneath yon planetrees branchy shade the lightest turf i chose and there her grave with anguish made my hands were doomed to close there while my tears fasttrickling fell to heaven i raised my prayer and slowly bade a last farewell to all my earthly care now daily over that precious mound his goodness i implore who knows my suffrings latest bound and will my peace restore mine was the guilt by passion led the virtuous heart to stain for which heaven loads this weary head with years of lingering pain but may my penitence atone for innocence betrayed just vengeance punish me alone and spare her injured shade nine times the suns revolving ray amid these wilds i have viewed illume with vainlylavishd day the dreary solitude meanwhile of man the cheerful face or voice till you appeared my longing eye has ceased to trace mine ear has never heard and till in death these limbs are cold my sacred vow i will keep full often over yonder swelling mould to pray to fast and weep finis the subject of this poem is in part taken from a favorite french novel of which the principal circumstances are believed
